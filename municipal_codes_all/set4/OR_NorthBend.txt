The enforcement officer shall attempt to secure voluntary correction of the violation by contacting the property owner or other person responsible for the violation, in person, by telephone, or in writing, and, where possible, explaining the violation and requesting correction within a reasonable time on the basis of a mutual agreement.

If the person responsible for the violation cannot be personally served within King County and if an address for mailed service cannot be ascertained, notice shall be served by posting a copy of the notice of violation conspicuously on the affected property or structure. Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the person effecting the service, declaring the time and date of service, the manner by which the service was made and, if by posting, the facts showing the attempts to serve the person personally or by mail.

B. Extension and Modification. When unforeseen circumstances delay correction under the conditions of the voluntary correction agreement, the enforcement officer may grant an extension of the time limit for correction or a modification of the required corrective action if the person responsible for the violation has shown due diligence and/or substantial progress in correcting the violation and requests such extension or modification in a writing clearly establishing the need for such an extension. Any modification to a voluntary correction agreement shall be made in a writing signed by both parties.

C. Failure to Comply. If the terms of the voluntary correction are not met:

1. The city may abate the violation and assess costs and expenses of abatement in accordance with NBMC 1.20.110; and

2. Notwithstanding the requirements of NBMC 1.20.050 and 1.20.060, the enforcement officer may issue a notice of civil infraction to the responsible person without having attempted to secure voluntary correction or issuing a notice of violation under the following circumstances:

a. When an emergency exists; or

b. When a repeat violation occurs; or

c. When the violation creates a situation or condition which cannot be corrected; or

d. The responsible person cannot be contacted or refuses to communicate or cooperate with the city in correcting the violation. (Ord. 1585 § 4 (part), 2016).

A. Penalty Amount. The monetary penalty for each violation shall not exceed $1,000 per day; provided, that the enforcement officer may double the monetary penalty schedule if the violation is a repeat violation as defined in NBMC 1.20.020(Q).

Any monetary penalty assessed must be paid to the city within 10 calendar days from the date of a notice from the city that penalties are due.

2. The city attorney and city staff are authorized to take all actions available at law to collect the monetary penalty. (Ord. 1585 § 4 (part), 2016).

A. The city may abate a condition which was caused by or continues to be a violation when:

1. The terms of a voluntary correction agreement entered into pursuant to NBMC 1.20.070 have not been met; or

2. A notice of violation has been issued pursuant to NBMC 1.20.060 and the required correction has not been completed by the correction date; or

3. A citation has been issued pursuant to NBMC 1.20.080, and deemed committed by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

4. The condition is subject to summary abatement as provided for in subsection B of this section.

B. Summary Abatement. Whenever any nuisance causes a condition, the continued existence of which constitutes an immediate threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, or to the environment, the city may summarily and without prior notice abate the condition. Notice of such abatement, including the reason for it, shall be given to the person responsible for the violation as soon as reasonably possible after the abatement. No right of action shall lie against the city or its agents, officers, or employees for actions reasonably taken to prevent or cure any such immediate threats. The city shall be entitled to recover any costs incurred for summary abatement after actual notice of same is provided to the person responsible for the violation.

C. Authorized Action by the City. Using any lawful means, the city may enter upon the subject property and may remove or correct the condition which is subject to abatement. The city may seek judicial process as it deems necessary to effect the removal or correction of such condition, and in the event the city must seek relief through the superior court for enforcement of a violation, the city shall be entitled to recovery of its costs and expenses of suit, including attorneys’ fees and expert witness fees.

D. Recovery of Costs. The costs, as defined in NBMC 1.20.020(H), of correcting the violation shall be billed to the person responsible for the violation and/or the owner, lessor, tenant, or other person entitled to control, use, and/or control of the property, and shall become due and payable to the city within 10 calendar days of the billing date. All such costs shall constitute a lien against the premises, as set forth in subsection E of this section.

E. Lien – Authorized. The city of North Bend shall have a lien for any monetary penalty imposed and the costs of any abatement proceedings under this chapter against the real premises. The lien shall be subordinate to all previously existing special assessment liens imposed on the same property, and shall be superior to all other liens, except for state and county taxes, with which it shall be on a parity.

1. The code enforcement officer shall cause a claim for lien to be filed for recording within 90 days from the later of:

a. The date that the monetary penalty is due; or

b. The date the work is completed; or

c. The date the nuisance is abated.

2. The claim of lien shall contain sufficient information regarding the notice of violation, as determined by the enforcement officer, a description of the property to be charged with the lien and the owner of record, and the total amount of the lien.

3. Any such claim of lien shall be verified by the enforcement officer, and may be amended from time to time to reflect changed conditions. (Ord. 1585 § 4 (part), 2016).


1.20.120 Interference unlawful – Misdemeanor.

Any person who knowingly obstructs, impedes, or interferes with the city or its agents, or with the person responsible for the violation, in the performance of duties imposed by this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 90 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment. (Ord. 1585 § 4 (part), 2016).


1.20.130 Stop work orders – Emergency orders.

A. Stop Work Orders.

(Ord. 653 § 2, 1985).


3.32.030 Warrant issuance.

Warrants drawing interest at a rate established by the city administrator but not exceeding 12 percent shall be issued against the local improvement guaranty fund to meet any liability accruing against it. The warrants so issued shall at no time exceed five percent of the outstanding obligations guaranteed by the fund. At the time of making its annual budget and tax levy the city shall provide for the levying of a sum sufficient, with other resources of the fund, to pay warrants so issued during the preceding fiscal year. (Ord. 653 § 3, 1985).


3.32.040 Purchase of defaulted bonds.

Defaulted bonds and interest thereon and warrants or other short term obligations against local improvement district funds of the city shall be purchased out of the guaranty fund, and as between the several issues of bonds, interest payments, bond short term obligations no preference shall exist, but they shall be purchased in the order of their presentation. (Ord. 653 § 4, 1985).


3.32.050 Foreclosure of lien – Sale of property.

A. For the purpose of protecting the guaranty fund, so much of the guaranty fund as is necessary may be used to purchase certificates of delinquency for general taxes on property subject to local improvement assessments which underlie the bonds, interest payments or short term obligations guaranteed by the fund or to purchase such property at county tax foreclosures or from the county after foreclosure.

B. The city, as trustee of the fund, may foreclose the lien of general tax certificates of delinquency and purchase the property at foreclosure sale. When doing so, the court costs, costs of publication, expense for clerical work and other expenses incidental thereto shall be charged to and paid from the local improvement guaranty fund.

C. After acquiring title to property by purchase at general tax foreclosure sale or from the county after foreclosure, the city may lease it or sell it at public or private sale at such price and on such terms as may be determined by resolution of the city council. All proceeds shall belong to and be paid into the local improvement guaranty fund. (Ord. 653 § 5, 1985).

(Ord. 653 § 6, 1985).


3.32.070 Deferred assessment payment.

Whenever any payment of a local improvement district assessment is deferred pursuant to RCW 35.43.250, the deferred assessment shall be paid out of the local improvement guaranty fund, which fund shall have a lien on the property benefitted in an amount equal to the deferral together with interest thereon as provided by the establishing ordinance and pursuant to RCW 35.54.100 and 35.43.250. (Ord. 653 § 7, 1985).


3.32.080 Transfer of funds to general fund.

Upon certification by the city finance director that the local improvement guaranty fund has sufficient funds currently on hand to meet all valid outstanding obligations of the fund and all other obligations of the fund reasonably expected to be incurred in the near future, the council may by ordinance transfer assets in the local improvement guaranty fund to its general fund. The net cash of the local improvement guaranty fund may be reduced by such transfer to an amount not less than 10 percent of the net outstanding local improvement district obligations guaranteed by such fund. If within five years of any such transfer from the local improvement guaranty fund to the general fund, the net cash within the local improvement guaranty fund is reduced below the minimum amount of 10 percent of the outstanding obligations, the city shall pay valid claims against the local improvement guaranty fund to the extent of the amount transferred, as a general obligation of the city, and shall pay all reasonable costs of collection necessarily incurred by the holders of valid claims against the local improvement guaranty fund.

(Ord. 1114 § 2, 2001; Ord. 1042 § 5, 1998: Ord. 1003 § 5, 1996).

3.64.010 Definitions.

The following words shall have the following meanings when used in this chapter:

A. “Bond” or “bonds” shall have the meaning defined in RCW 39.46.020(1), as the same may be amended from time to time.

B. “City” shall mean the city of North Bend, Washington.

C. “Fiscal agencies” shall mean the duly appointed fiscal agencies of the state of Washington serving as such at any given time.

E. “Registrar” shall mean the person, persons or entity designated by the city to register ownership of bonds or obligations under this chapter or under an ordinance of the city authorizing the issuance of such bonds or obligations. (Ord. 1006 § 1, 1996).


3.64.020 Findings.

The city council of the city finds that it is in the city’s best interest to establish a system of registering the ownership of the city’s bonds and obligations in the manner permitted by law. (Ord. 1006 § 2, 1996).


3.64.030 Adoption of registration system.

The city adopts the following system of registering the ownership of its bonds and obligations.

A. Registration Requirement. All bonds and obligations offered to the public, having a maturity of more than one year, on which the interest is intended to be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, shall be registered as to both principal and interest as provided in this chapter.

B. Method of Registration. The registration of all city bonds and obligations required to be registered shall be carried out either by:

1. A book entry system of recording the ownership of the bond or obligation on the books of the registrar, whether or not a physical instrument is issued; or

2. Recording the ownership of the bond or obligation and requiring as a condition of the transfer of ownership of any bond or obligation the surrender of the old bond or obligation and either the reissuance of the old bond or obligation or the issuance of a new bond or obligation to the new owner.

No transfer of any bond or obligation subject to registration requirements shall be effective until the name of the new owner and the new owner’s mailing address, together with such other information deemed appropriate by the registrar, shall be recorded on the books of the registrar.

C. Denominations. Except as may be provided otherwise by the ordinance authorizing their issuance, registered bonds or obligations may be issued and reissued in any denomination up to the outstanding principal amount of the bonds or obligations of which they are a part. Such denominations may represent all or a part of a maturity or several maturities and on reissuance may be in smaller amounts than the individual denominations for which they are reissued.

D. Appointment of Registrar. Unless otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing the issuance of registered bonds or obligations, the city finance director shall be the registrar for all registered interest-bearing warrants, installment contracts, interest-bearing leases and other registered bonds or obligations not usually subject to trading without a fixed maturity date or maturing one year or less after issuance and the fiscal agencies shall be the registrar for all other city bonds and obligations without a fixed maturity date or maturing more than one year after issuance.

E. Duties of Registrar. The registrar shall serve as the city’s authenticating trustee, transfer agent, registrar and paying agent for all registered bonds and obligations for which he, she, or it serves as registrar and shall comply fully with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations respecting the carrying out of those duties.

The rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation of the registrar shall be prescribed in each ordinance authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations, which rights, duties, responsibilities and compensation shall be embodied in a contract executed by the city and the registrar, except that (1) when the fiscal agencies serve as registrar, the city adopts by reference the contract between the State Finance Committee of the State of Washington and the fiscal agencies in lieu of executing a separate contract and prescribing by ordinance the rights, duties, obligations and compensation of the registrar, and (2) when the city finance director serves as registrar, a separate contract shall not be required.

In all cases when the registrar is not the fiscal agency and the bonds or obligations are assignable, the ordinance authorizing the issuance of the registered bonds or obligations shall specify the terms and conditions of:

1. Making payments of principal and interest;

2. Printing any physical instruments, including the use of identifying numbers or other designation;

3. Specifying record and payment dates;

4. Determining denominations;

5. Establishing the manner of communicating with the owners of the bonds or obligations;

6. Establishing the methods of receipting for the physical instruments for payment of principal, the destruction of such instruments and the certification of such destruction;

7. Registering or releasing security interests, if any; and

8. Such other matters pertaining to the registration of the bonds or obligations authorized by such ordinance as the city may deem to be necessary or appropriate. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1203 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 1006 § 3, 1996).


3.64.040 Statement of transfer restrictions.

Any physical instrument issued or executed by the city subject to registration under this chapter shall state on its face that the principal of and interest on the bonds or obligations shall be paid only to the owner thereof registered as such on the books of the registrar as of the record date defined in the instrument and to no other person, and that such instrument, either principal or interest, may not be assigned except on the books of the registrar. (Ord. 1006 § 4, 1996).

3.68.020 Source of funds.

The revenue for deposit into the crime reward fund shall be all contributions specifically transferred, donated, devised, or bequeathed to this fund. Unless otherwise indicated, these moneys shall be deposited into a specific account maintained by the city. Moneys that are donated, devised, or bequeathed to a specific reward already established from the crime reward fund by resolution of the city council, pursuant to NBMC 3.68.040, may be added to that specific reward by a subsequent resolution of the city council. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).


3.68.030 Purpose.

Moneys in the crime reward fund shall be used for the payment of rewards under this chapter. The crime reward fund shall be maintained as a general ledger account within the general fund. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).


3.68.040 Creation of specific rewards by resolution.

The city council may, whenever in its opinion the public good requires it, pass a resolution that offers and pays a specific reward out of the crime reward fund to any person or persons for information leading to:

A. The arrest of a specified person or persons convicted of or charged with any criminal offense; or

B. The arrest and conviction of a person or persons committing a specific criminal offense.

The city council shall have the ultimate authority to determine which crimes are allocated a specific reward from the general crime reward fund. The council may consider requests for specific rewards from citizens, property owners, staff members or the chief of police. The city council may establish the terms and conditions of eligibility for the reward established. The city council shall at all times retain the final and exclusive right to determine who may be eligible for any reward, whether a reward should be split among more than one person, and whether the potential claimants are otherwise qualified to receive a reward. Elected city officials and/or city staff members and their families are not eligible to receive any rewards under this chapter. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).


3.68.050 Payment of rewards.

Whenever a specific reward has been offered by the city pursuant to NBMC 3.68.040, the person or persons providing the information leading to the arrest and/or conviction shall be entitled to the reward, unless payment would be contrary to public policy. Any person or persons claiming a reward under this chapter shall file a written claim therefor with the city clerk at any time prior to the date that is 10 days after the conviction or other final disposition of the accused, unless the city council finds good cause for extending the time period to file the claim. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).


3.68.060 Conflicting claims.

When more than one claimant applies for the payment of any reward offered by the city, the city council shall determine to whom the same shall be paid, and if to more than one person, in what proportion to each. The city council’s determination shall be final and conclusive, and there shall be no appeal therefrom. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).


3.68.070 Reward offered.

A standing reward is offered by the city for information leading to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons who shall willfully and maliciously destroy or injure any real or personal property belonging to the city. Said reward shall be paid from available moneys in the crime reward fund. Recommendations for payment of such rewards, including recommendations as to the amounts to be paid and the person or persons to whom payment should be made, shall be made by the police chief to the city council, and when approved by the city council shall be paid from the crime reward fund. The city council retains the sole and exclusive authority to determine when a reward should be paid under this section and the amount of the reward. (Ord. 1274 § 1 (part), 2007).

5.04.010 Purpose – Exercise of revenue license power.

A. The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the power of the city to license for revenue. They are intended to provide a uniform methodology for levying a gross receipts tax on business entities, and nothing in this chapter should be construed as limiting a city’s ability to levy and collect a business privilege tax on any other basis; such as a tax on square footage, a tax on annualized full-time equivalents (i.e., “head tax”), a graduated annual license tax, or any other tax calculated on a basis other than a gross receipts tax (e.g., upon the gross income of the business, gross proceeds of sales, or value of products multiplied by tax rates).

B. The provisions of this chapter are subject to periodic statutory or administrative rule changes or judicial interpretations of the ordinances or rules. The responsibility rests with the licensee or taxpayer to reconfirm tax computation procedures and remain in compliance with the city code. (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1477 § 2 (part), 2012).


5.04.015 Business license required.

A. Every person engaging in business within the city during any portion of any taxable year in any business or activity for which a license fee or tax is provided by this chapter must obtain a valid and subsisting license to do so, to be known as a “business license,” issued under the provisions of this chapter and having paid the license fee and tax imposed by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. Application for the license is made through the business licensing service on forms or systems provided. The total licensing fees due, including the business license registration fee and the business licensing service handling fee established by RCW 19.02.075 must accompany the application for the license.

B. The license will expire on the date established by the business licensing service. Each license is personal and nontransferable. In case a business is transacted at two or more separate places by one taxpayer, a separate license is required for each place and a separate registration fee and handling fee must be paid for each place that a business license is issued.

C. All licenses will be issued by the business licensing service in coordination with the finance department. Each license will show the name, and place of business of the taxpayer. The license must at all times be posted in the place of business for which it is issued. When the place of business of a taxpayer is changed, the taxpayer must reapply for the license and pay the appropriate fees as provided for in this chapter, and, upon approval of the change, a new license will be issued for the new place of business. No person may engage in any business for which a license is required under this section, without being registered and licensed in compliance with the provisions of this section; nor may any person holding such business license allow any other person, for whom a separate license is required, to operate under or display his license.

D. The business license must be obtained prior to commencing business within the city and must be renewed and the annual license registration fee paid by the expiration date established by the business licensing service. The license renewal is made through the business licensing service on forms or systems provided. Failure to renew a license by the expiration date may result in the assessment of the business licensing service late renewal penalty established in RCW 19.02.085. If a license remains delinquent for at least 120 days after the expiration date it will be considered abandoned and will be cancelled. A business whose license has been cancelled must reapply for licensure in order to continue to conduct business in the city.

E. There may be an additional administrative assessment, as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance, imposed from the date the license should have been initially obtained, or renewed as the case may be, if the license is not obtained or renewed in a timely manner. The finance director may waive the penalty and interest of the administrative assessment if the license is obtained within 30 days of the date it should have been obtained or renewed, if good cause is shown. (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1670 § 1, 2018: Ord. 1665 § 1, 2018: Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1498 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 1477 § 2 (part), 2012).


5.04.020 Exercise of revenue license power.

The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed an exercise of the power of the city to license for revenue. The provisions of this chapter are subject to periodic statutory or administrative rule changes or judicial interpretations of the ordinances or rules. The responsibility rests with the licensee or taxpayer to reconfirm tax computation procedures and remain in compliance with the city code. (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


5.04.028 Administrative provisions.

The administrative provisions contained in Chapter 5.05 NBMC shall be fully applicable to the provisions of this chapter except as expressly stated to the contrary herein. (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1498 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2013: Ord. 1477 § 2 (part), 2012).


5.04.030 Definitions.

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied. Words in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural shall include the singular.

A. “Business” includes all activities engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage to the taxpayer or to another person or class, directly or indirectly.

B. “Business and occupation tax” or “gross receipts tax” means a tax imposed on or measured by the value of products, the gross income of the business, or the gross proceeds of sales, as the case may be, and that is the legal liability of the business.

C. “Commercial or industrial use” means the following uses of products, including byproducts, by the extractor or manufacturer thereof:

1. Any use as a consumer; and

2. The manufacturing of articles, substances or commodities.

D. “Delivery” means the transfer of possession of tangible personal property between the seller and the buyer or the buyer’s representative. Delivery to an employee of a buyer is considered delivery to the buyer. Transfer of possession of tangible personal property occurs when the buyer or the buyer’s representative first takes physical control of the property or exercises dominion and control over the property. “Dominion and control” means the buyer has the ability to put the property to the buyer’s own purposes. It means the buyer or the buyer’s representative has made the final decision to accept or reject the property, and the seller has no further right to possession of the property and the buyer has no right to return the property to the seller, other than under a warranty contract. A buyer does not exercise dominion and control over tangible personal property merely by arranging for shipment of the property from the seller to itself. A buyer’s representative is a person, other than an employee of the buyer, who is authorized in writing by the buyer to receive tangible personal property and take dominion and control by making the final decision to accept or reject the property. Neither a shipping company nor a seller can serve as a buyer’s representative. It is immaterial where the contract of sale is negotiated or where the buyer obtains title to the property. Delivery terms and other provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (RCW Title 62A) do not determine when or where delivery of tangible personal property occurs for purposes of taxation.

E. “Digital automated service,” “digital code,” and “digital goods” have the same meanings as in RCW 82.04.192.

F. “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(b).

G. “Director” means the city clerk/treasurer of the city or any officer, agent or employee of the city designated to act on the director’s behalf.

H. Eligible Gross Receipts Tax. The term “eligible gross receipts tax” means a tax which:

1. Is imposed on the act or privilege of engaging in business activities within NBMC 5.04.050; and

2. Is measured by the gross volume of business, in terms of gross receipts, and is not an income tax or value added tax; and

3. Is not, pursuant to law or custom, separately stated from the sales price; and

4. Is not a sales or use tax, business license fee, franchise fee, royalty or severance tax measured by volume or weight, or concession charge, or payment for the use and enjoyment of property, property right or a privilege; and

5. Is a tax imposed by a local jurisdiction, whether within or without the state of Washington, and not by a country, state, province, or any other nonlocal jurisdiction above the county level.

I. Engaging in Business.

1. The term “engaging in business” means commencing, conducting, or continuing in business, and also the exercise of corporate or franchise powers, as well as liquidating a business when the liquidators thereof hold themselves out to the public as conducting such business.

2. This section sets forth examples of activities that constitute engaging in business in the city, and establishes safe harbors for certain of those activities so that a person who meets the criteria may engage in de minimis business activities in the city without having to pay a business license fee. The activities listed in this section are illustrative only and are not intended to narrow the definition of “engaging in business” in subsection (I)(1) of this section. If an activity is not listed, whether it constitutes engaging in business in the city shall be determined by considering all the facts and circumstances and applicable law.

3. Without being all-inclusive, any one of the following activities conducted within the city by a person, or its employee, agent, representative, independent contractor, broker or another acting on its behalf, constitutes engaging in business and requires a person to register and obtain a business license:

a. Owning, renting, leasing, maintaining, or having the right to use, or using tangible personal property, intangible personal property, or real property permanently or temporarily located in the city.

b. Owning, renting, leasing, using, or maintaining an office, place of business, or other establishment in the city.

c. Soliciting sales.

d. Making repairs or providing maintenance or service to real or tangible personal property, including warranty work and property maintenance.

e. Providing technical assistance or service, including quality control, product inspections, warranty work, or similar services on or in connection with tangible personal property sold by the person or on its behalf.

f. Installing, constructing, or supervising installation or construction of real or tangible personal property.

g. Soliciting, negotiating, or approving franchise, license, or other similar agreements.

h. Collecting current or delinquent accounts.

i. Picking up and transporting tangible personal property, solid waste, construction debris, or excavated materials.

B. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if the director finds that the imposition of the city’s tax would place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or violate constitutional requirements, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit to the extent necessary to preserve the validity of the city’s tax, and still apply the city tax to as much of the taxpayer’s activities as may be subject to the city’s taxing authority.

C. To take the credit authorized by this section, a taxpayer must be able to document that the amount of tax sought to be credited was paid upon the same gross receipts used in computing the tax against which the credit is applied.

D. Credit for Persons That Sell in the City Products That They Extract or Manufacture. Persons taxable under the retailing or wholesaling classification with respect to selling products in this city shall be allowed a credit against those taxes for any eligible gross receipts taxes paid (1) with respect to the manufacturing of the products sold in the city, and (2) with respect to the extracting of the products, or the ingredients used in the products, sold in the city. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the tax liability arising under this chapter with respect to the sale of those products.

5.04.075 Deductions to prevent multiple taxation of manufacturing activities and, prior to January 1, 2008, transactions involving more than one city with an eligible gross receipts tax.

A. Amounts Subject to an Eligible Gross Receipts Tax in Another City That Also Maintains Nexus over the Same Activity. For taxes due prior to January 1, 2008, a taxpayer that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax on the same activity in more than one jurisdiction may be entitled to a deduction as follows:

1. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax, with respect to a sale of goods or services, to a jurisdiction in which the goods are delivered or the services are provided may deduct an amount equal to the gross receipts used to measure that tax from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

2. Notwithstanding the above, a person that is subject to an eligible gross receipts tax in more than one jurisdiction on the gross income derived from intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill may deduct from the measure of the tax on those amounts the gross income used in measuring the eligible gross receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction where the person’s headquarters is located.

3. A taxpayer that has paid an eligible gross receipts tax on the privilege of accepting or executing a contract with another city may deduct an amount equal to the contract price used to measure the tax due to the other city from the measure of the tax owed to the city.

B. Person Manufacturing Products within and Without. A person manufacturing products within the city using products manufactured by the same person outside the city may deduct from the measure of the manufacturing tax the value of products manufactured outside the city and included in the measure of an eligible gross receipts tax paid to the other jurisdiction with respect to manufacturing such products. (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1477 § 2 (part), 2012).


5.04.076 Assignment of gross income derived from intangibles.

Gross income derived from the sale of intangibles such as royalties, trademarks, patents, or goodwill shall be assigned to the jurisdiction where the person is domiciled (its headquarters is located). (Ord. 1704 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1477 § 2 (part), 2012).


5.04.077 Allocation and apportionment of income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Effective January 1, 2008, gross income, other than persons subject to the provisions of Chapter 82.14A RCW, shall be allocated and apportioned as follows:

A. Gross income derived from all activities other than those taxed as service or royalties under NBMC 5.04.050(A)(7) shall be allocated to the location where the activity takes place.

B. In the case of sales of tangible personal property, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs.

C. In the case of sales of digital products, the activity takes place where delivery to the buyer occurs. The delivery of digital products will be deemed to occur at:

1. The seller’s place of business if the purchaser receives the digital product at the seller’s place of business;

2. If not received at the seller’s place of business, the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee, designated as such by the purchaser, receives the digital product, including the location indicated by instructions for delivery to the purchaser or donee, known to the seller;

3. If the location where the purchaser or the purchaser’s donee receives the digital product is not known, the purchaser’s address maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business when use of this address does not constitute bad faith;

4. If no address for the purchaser is maintained in the ordinary course of the seller’s business, the purchaser’s address obtained during the consummation of the sale, including the address of a purchaser’s payment instrument, if no other address is available, when use of this address does not constitute bad faith; and

5. If no address for the purchaser is obtained during the consummation of the sale, the address where the digital good or digital code is first made available for transmission by the seller or the address from which the digital automated service or service described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) or (6)(b) was provided, disregarding for these purposes any location that merely provided the digital transfer of the product sold.

D. If none of the methods in subsection C of this section for determining where the delivery of digital products occurs are available after a good faith effort by the taxpayer to apply the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, then the city and the taxpayer may mutually agree to employ any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products. The taxpayer will be responsible for petitioning the city to use an alternative method under this subsection. The city may employ an alternative method for allocating the income from the sale of digital products if the methods provided in subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section are not available and the taxpayer and the city are unable to mutually agree on an alternative method to effectuate an equitable allocation of income from the sale of digital products.

E. For purposes of subsections (C)(1) through (5) of this section, the following definitions apply:

1. “Digital automated services,” “digital codes,” and “digital goods” have the same meaning as in RCW 82.04.192;

2. “Digital products” means digital goods, digital codes, digital automated services, and the services described in RCW 82.04.050(2)(g) and (6)(c); and

3. “Receive” has the same meaning as in RCW 82.32.730.

F. Gross income derived from activities taxed as services and other activities taxed under NBMC 5.04.050(A)(1) shall be apportioned to the city by multiplying apportionable income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor plus the service-income factor and the denominator of which is two.

1. The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in the city during the tax period by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid in the city if:

a. The individual is primarily assigned within the city;

b. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period and the employee performs 50 percent or more of his or her service for the tax period in the city; or

c. The individual is not primarily assigned to any place of business for the tax period, the individual does not perform 50 percent or more of his or her service in any city and the employee resides in the city.

2. The service income factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total service income of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period. Service income is in the city if the customer location is in the city.

3. Gross income of the business from engaging in an apportionable activity must be excluded from the denominator of the service income factor if, in respect to such activity, at least some of the activity is performed in the city, and the gross income is attributable under subsection (F)(2) of this section to a city or unincorporated area of a county within the United States or to a foreign country in which the taxpayer is not taxable. For purposes of this subsection (F)(3), “not taxable” means that the taxpayer is not subject to a business activities tax by that city or county within the United States or by that foreign country, except that a taxpayer is taxable in a city or county within the United States or in a foreign country in which it would be deemed to have a substantial nexus with the city or county within the United States or with the foreign country under the standards in RCW 35.102.050 regardless of whether that city or county within the United States or that foreign country imposes such a tax.

4. If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city, the taxpayer may petition for or the tax administrator may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer’s business activity, if reasonable:

a. Separate accounting;

b. The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;

c. The inclusion of one or more additional factors that will fairly represent the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; or

d. The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

5. The party petitioning for, or the tax administrator requiring, the use of any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income pursuant to subsection (F)(4) of this section must prove by a preponderance of the evidence:

a. That the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer’s business activity in the city; and

b. That the alternative to such provisions is reasonable.

The same burden of proof shall apply whether the taxpayer is petitioning for, or the tax administrator is requiring, the use of an alternative, reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income.

6. If the tax administrator requires any method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income, the tax administrator cannot impose any civil or criminal penalty with reference to the tax due that is attributable to the taxpayer’s reasonable reliance solely on the allocation and apportionment provisions of this subsection F.

7. A taxpayer that has received written permission from the tax administrator to use a reasonable method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer’s income shall not have that permission revoked with respect to transactions and activities that have already occurred unless there has been a material change in, or a material misrepresentation of, the facts provided by the taxpayer upon which the tax administrator reasonably relied in approving a reasonable alternative method.

G. The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section.

1. “Apportionable income” means the gross income of the business taxable under the service classifications of a city’s gross receipts tax, including income received from activities outside the city if the income would be taxable under the service classification if received from activities within the city, less any exemptions or deductions available.

2. “Business activities tax” means a tax measured by the amount of, or economic results of, business activity conducted in a city or county within the United States or within a foreign country.

3. “Compensation” means wages, salaries, commissions, and any other form of remuneration paid to individuals for personal services that are or would be included in the individual’s gross income under the Federal Internal Revenue Code.

4. “Customer” means a person or entity to whom the taxpayer makes a sale or renders services or from whom the taxpayer otherwise receives gross income of the business.

5. “Individual” means any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee of that taxpayer.

6. “Customer location” means the following:

a. For a customer not engaged in business, if the service requires the customer to be physically present, where the service is performed.

i. The customer’s residence; or

ii. If the customer’s residence is not known, the customer’s billing/mailing address.

c. For a customer engaged in business:

i. Where the services are ordered from;

8. “Service-taxable income” or “service income” means gross income of the business subject to tax under either the service or royalty classification.

9. “Tax period” means the calendar year during which tax liability is accrued. If taxes are reported by a taxpayer on a basis more frequent than once per year, taxpayers shall calculate the factors for the previous calendar year for reporting in the current calendar year and correct the reporting for the previous year when the factors are calculated for that year, but not later than the end of the first quarter of the following year.

H. Assignment or apportionment of revenue under this section shall be made in accordance with and in full compliance with the provisions of the interstate commerce clause of the United States Constitution where applicable.

5.04.078 Allocation and apportionment of printing and publishing income when activities take place in more than one jurisdiction.

Notwithstanding RCW 35.102.130, effective January 1, 2008, gross income from the activities of printing, and of publishing newspapers, periodicals, or magazines, shall be allocated to the principal place in this state from which the taxpayer’s business is directed or managed.

A. Other than any annual license fee or registration fee assessed under this chapter, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable in quarterly installments.

Until December 31, 2020, tax payments are due on or before the last day of the next month following the end of the assigned reporting period covered by the return.

Such assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owed to the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail of the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.

A. Taxes shall be paid to the director in United States currency by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, personal check, money order, cash, or by wire transfer or electronic payment if such wire transfer or electronic payment is authorized by the director. If payment so received is not paid by the bank on which it is drawn, the taxpayer, by whom such payment is tendered, shall remain liable for payment of the tax and for all legal penalties, the same as if such payment had not been tendered. Acceptance of any sum by the director shall not discharge the tax or fee due unless the amount paid is the full amount due.

B. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city by United States mail shall be deemed filed or received on the date shown by the cancellation mark stamped by the Post Office upon the envelope containing it. The director may allow electronic filing of returns or remittances from any taxpayer. A return or remittance which is transmitted to the city electronically shall be deemed filed or received according to procedures set forth by the director.

C. If a written request is received prior to the due date, the director, for good cause, may grant, in writing, additional time within which to make and file returns.

D. The director shall keep full and accurate records of all funds received or refunded. The director shall apply payments first against all penalties and interest owing, and then upon the tax, without regard to any direction of the taxpayer.

E. For any return not accompanied by a remittance of the tax shown to be due thereon, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have failed or refused to file a return and shall be subject to the penalties and interest provided in this chapter.

F. Any payment made that is returned for lack of sufficient funds or for another reason will not be considered received until payment by certified check, money order, or cash of the original amount due, plus a “nonsufficient funds (NSF)” charge of $20.00 is received by the director. Any license issued upon payment with a NSF check will be considered to be void, and shall be returned to the director. No license shall be reissued until payment (including the $20.00 NSF fee) is received.

G. The director is authorized, but not required, to mail tax return forms to taxpayers, but failure of the taxpayer to receive any such forms shall not excuse the taxpayer from filing returns and making payment of the taxes or fees, when and as due under this chapter.

All books, records, papers, invoices, vendor lists, inventories, stocks of merchandise, and other data including federal income tax and state tax returns and reports shall be open for examination at any time by the director or its duly authorized agent. Every person’s business premises shall be open for inspection or examination by the director or a duly authorized agent.

B. If a person does not keep the necessary books and records within the city, it shall be sufficient if such person (1) produces within the city such books and records as may be required by the director, or (2) bears the cost of examination by the director’s agent at the place where such books and records are kept; provided, that the person electing to bear such cost shall pay in advance to the director the estimated amount thereof including round-trip fare, lodging, meals and incidental expenses, subject to adjustment upon completion of the examination.

C. Any person who fails or refuses a department request to provide or make available records, or to allow inspection or examination of the business premises, shall be forever barred from questioning in any court action the correctness of any assessment of taxes made by the city for any period for which such records have not been provided, made available or kept and preserved, or in respect of which inspection or examination of the business premises has been denied. The director is authorized to determine the amount of the tax or fees payable by obtaining facts and information upon which to base the estimate of the tax or fees due. Such fee or tax assessment shall be deemed prima facie correct and shall be the amount of tax owing the city by the taxpayer. The director shall notify the taxpayer by mail the amount of tax so determined, together with any penalty, interest, and fees due; the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1299 § 2 (part), 2007).

The director shall notify the person by mail of the additional amount, which shall become due and shall be paid within 30 days from the date of the notice, or within such time as the director may provide in writing.

5.05.100 Overpayment of tax, penalty, or interest – Credit or refund – Interest rate – Statute of limitations.

A. If, upon receipt of an application for a refund, or during an audit or examination of the taxpayer’s records and tax returns, the director determines that the amount of tax, penalty, or interest paid is in excess of that properly due, the excess amount shall be credited to the taxpayer’s account or shall be refunded to the taxpayer. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, no refund or credit shall be made for taxes, penalties, or interest paid more than four years prior to the beginning of the calendar year in which the refund application is made or examination of records is completed.

B. The execution of a written waiver shall extend the time for applying for, or making a refund or credit of any taxes paid during, or attributable to, the years covered by the waiver if, prior to the expiration of the waiver period, an application for refund of such taxes is made by the taxpayer or the director discovers that a refund or credit is due.

C. Refunds shall be made by means of vouchers approved by the director and by the issuance of a city check or warrants drawn upon and payable from such funds as the city may provide.

D. If the director finds that a person has engaged in any business or performed any act upon which a tax is imposed under this title and that person has not obtained from the director a license as required by NBMC 5.04.015, the director shall impose a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(4), as it now exists or as it may be amended. No penalty shall be imposed under this subsection if the person who has engaged in business without a license obtains a license prior to being notified by the director of the need to be licensed.

E. If the director determines that all or any part of a deficiency resulted from the taxpayer’s failure to follow specific written tax reporting instructions, there shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(5), as it now exists or as it may be amended.

F. If the director finds that all or any part of the deficiency resulted from an intent to evade the tax payable, the director shall assess a penalty in accordance with RCW 82.32.090(6), as it now exists or as it may be amended. 

G. The penalties imposed under subsections A through E of this section can each be imposed on the same tax found to be due. This subsection does not prohibit or restrict the application of other penalties authorized by law.

I. For the purposes of this section, “return” means any document a person is required by the city of North Bend to file to satisfy or establish a tax or fee obligation that is administered or collected by the city, and that has a statutorily defined due date.

J. If incorporation into the North Bend Municipal Code of future changes to RCW 82.32.090 is deemed invalid, then the provisions of RCW 82.32.090 existing at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter is effective shall apply.

5.05.120 Cancellation of penalties.

A. The director may cancel any penalties imposed under NBMC 5.05.110(A) if the taxpayer shows that its failure to timely file or pay the tax was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Willful neglect is presumed unless the taxpayer shows that it exercised ordinary business care and prudence in making arrangements to file the return and pay the tax but was, nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond the taxpayer’s control, unable to file or pay by the due date. The director has no authority to cancel any other penalties or to cancel penalties for any other reason except as provided in subsection C of this section.

B. A request for cancellation of penalties must be received by the director within 30 days after the date the department mails the notice that the penalties are due.

5.05.130 Taxpayer quitting business – Liability of successor.

A. Whenever any taxpayer quits business, sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of his business or his stock of goods, any tax payable hereunder shall become immediately due and payable. Such taxpayer shall, within 10 days thereafter, make a return and pay the tax due.

B. Any person who becomes a successor shall become liable for the full amount of any tax owing. The successor shall withhold from the purchase price a sum sufficient to pay any tax due to the city from the taxpayer until such time as (1) the taxpayer shall produce a receipt from the city showing payment in full of any tax due or a certificate that no tax is due, or (2) more than six months has passed since the successor notified the director of the acquisition and the director has not issued and notified the successor of an assessment.

C. Payment of the tax by the successor shall, to the extent thereof, be deemed a payment upon the purchase price. If such payment is greater in amount than the purchase price, the amount of the difference shall become a debt due such successor from the taxpayer.

D. Notwithstanding the above, if a successor gives written notice to the director of the acquisition, and the department does not within six months of the date it received the notice issue an assessment against the taxpayer and mail a copy of that assessment to the successor, the successor shall not be liable for the tax.

The hearing examiner shall, as soon as practical, fix a time and place for the hearing of such appeal, and shall cause a notice of the time and place thereof to be delivered or mailed to the parties. The hearing shall be conducted in accord with the provisions of Chapter 2.20 NBMC. The decision of the hearing examiner shall indicate the correct amount of the fee or tax owing.

5.05.160 Director to make rules.

B. To allocate or apportion in a manner that fairly reflects the gross receipts earned from activities conducted within the respective cities the gross proceeds of sales, gross receipts, or gross income of the business, or taxes due from any person that is required to pay an eligible gross receipts tax to more than one Washington city;

C. To apply the city’s tax prospectively where a taxpayer has no office or place of business within the city and has paid tax on all gross income to another Washington city where the taxpayer is located; provided, that the other city maintains an eligible gross receipts tax, and the income was not derived from contracts with the city. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1299 § 2 (part), 2007).

Failure of the taxpayer or licensee to receive any such mailed notice shall not release the taxpayer or licensee from any tax, fee, interest, or any penalties thereon, nor shall such failure operate to extend any time limit set by the provisions of this chapter. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to inform the director in writing about a change in the taxpayer’s address. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1299 § 2 (part), 2007).

However, data, material, or documents that do not disclose information related to a specific or identifiable taxpayer do not constitute tax information under this section. Nothing in this chapter requires any person possessing data, material, or documents made confidential and privileged by this section to delete information from such data, material or documents so as to permit its disclosure.

3. “City agency” means every city office, department, division, bureau, board, commission, or other city agency.

However, tax information not received from the taxpayer must not be so disclosed if the director determines that such disclosure would compromise any investigation or litigation by any federal, state, or local government agency in connection with the civil or criminal liability of the taxpayer or another person, or that such disclosure would identify a confidential informant, or that such disclosure is contrary to any agreement entered into by the department that provides for the reciprocal exchange of information with other government agencies which agreement requires confidentiality with respect to such information unless such information is required to be disclosed to the taxpayer by the order of any court;

3. Publishing statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or reports or items thereof;

However, the department may not disclose general ledgers, sales or cash receipt journals, check registers, accounts receivable/payable ledgers, general journals, financial statements, expert’s workpapers, income tax returns, state tax returns, tax return workpapers, or other similar data, materials, or documents.

Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this section, a person served with a subpoena issued by the court or under Chapter 2.20 NBMC, Hearing Examiner, may disclose the existence or content of the subpoena to that person’s legal counsel.

5.14.005 Findings of fact.

A. The city of North Bend takes notice and specifically relies upon the experiences of and studies utilized by other cities and counties in combating the specific adverse impacts of sexually oriented businesses including nude and semi-nude dancing. This includes but is not limited to the studies relied upon, and findings of fact entered, by the city councils of the cities of Bellevue, Tukwila, SeaTac, and Federal Way in their respective adult cabaret ordinances.

B. Additionally, the city council enters the following findings of fact related to adult cabaret activity:

1. The documented activity in other cities with nude and semi-nude adult cabaret entertainment, demonstrates that illegal sexual activity occurs regularly and repetitively in adult cabarets.

2. Undercover police officers personally experienced, and personally observed, “table dances” involving regular exposure by the entertainer of breasts, buttocks, and pubic area. The “dances” also frequently featured masturbation by the entertainer of the customer’s groin area.

3. The entertainers typically feature two types of dances, one costing $10.00 and the other costing $20.00. A $20.00 dance takes place in a darkened area of the cabaret, where managers and others have difficulty viewing the illegal activity.

4. In other jurisdictions, entertainers have committed acts of prostitution inside the adult cabaret by agreeing to meet patrons off-site to perform sexual activity in exchange for a fee.

5. The city of North Bend currently does not have any adult cabarets located within the city limits. Therefore, the North Bend city council relies on and adopts the experiences of other cities to regulate adult cabarets. (Ord. 1076 § 1 (part), 1999).

8.40.010 Declaration of purpose. 

The city council finds that graffiti on public and private buildings, structures, and on personal property, including motor vehicles, increases additional graffiti and criminal and gang activity, and creates a condition of blight within the city that can result in the deterioration of property values, business opportunities, and enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding properties. The city council further finds that the presence of graffiti is inconsistent with the city’s goals of maintaining property, preventing crime, and preserving aesthetic standards. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this chapter to promote the health, safety and welfare of the general public by providing for a procedure for removal of graffiti from buildings, walls and other structures in order to reduce social deterioration within the city and to promote public safety and health. The city council also finds that abating graffiti from certain private property accomplishes a fundamental government purpose and will assist the poor and infirm. While voluntary graffiti removal should be encouraged, where graffiti has not been promptly removed, graffiti should be removed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. No provision of this chapter and no action taken pursuant hereto is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers or employees. Further, nothing contained herein is intended or shall be construed as forming the basis of any liability on the part of the city, its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from any action or inaction on the part of the city, its officers, employees or agents. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.020 Definitions.

A. “Abate” or “abatement” means the removal or painting over of graffiti from view.

B. “Graffiti” means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of public or private property by any graffiti implement, to the extent that the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise recognized and deemed a public nuisance pursuant to RCW 7.48.120 and 7.48.130. 

C. “Mayor” means the mayor of the city of North Bend or his or her designated representative.

D. “Owner” means any person so designated by the King County assessor as having any legal, or equitable, interest in the property.

E. “Property” means a lot, parcel, tract, premises, or piece of land, improved, or unimproved, in the city. 

F. “Responsible party” means the owner and/or person in possession of the property. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.030 Duty.

It shall be the duty of the responsible party to at all times keep property clean and free from graffiti. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.040 Declaration of public nuisance.

Graffiti is determined to be detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare and is a public nuisance. It is a visual symbol of disorder that demoralizes and erodes feelings of safety in our neighborhoods. It contributes to neighborhood decline by inviting crime and leading to a climate of intimidation in our neighborhoods. Furthermore, it lowers property value, commerce, community pride, and tax revenues. Prompt removal of graffiti from public and private property is in the public interest. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.050 Graffiti – Removal. 

A. Abatement by Responsible Party. Whenever graffiti exists the responsible party shall abate such graffiti nuisance within 48 hours of the placement of such graffiti. 

B. Abatement by City. Whenever the responsible party fails to abate and remove graffiti as set forth in subsection A of this section, and whenever the mayor determines that graffiti exists, the city, in its sole discretion, may take one of the following actions:

1. Summary Abatement – No Lien. Whenever it is determined by the mayor that the graffiti is capable of being viewed by a person utilizing any public right-of-way in the city or other facility open to the general public, the city or its agents may enter upon such property in order to remove the graffiti at the city’s expense, without reimbursement from the owner, with the following restrictions:

a. The painting and/or repair of an area shall not be more extensive than where the graffiti is located, except where the property is city-owned or where the owner agrees to pay for the costs of repainting and/or repairing a more extensive area.

b. Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than the city, the city shall first obtain the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the property.

2. Abatement with Lien. Graffiti may be removed by the city or its agents, at the owner’s expense, as a public nuisance pursuant to the following provisions:   

a. The mayor shall cause written notice to be posted on the property and shall also serve the owner with notice of abatement addressed to the owner at the address listed with the King County assessor’s office by mailing the notice in the U.S. Postal Service with first class postage or by personal service. Service shall be complete either three business days after the notice is mailed or upon personal service, whichever occurs first. The failure of any person to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding. The owner shall have five days to abate after the date of service of the notice by removing the graffiti or be subject to city removal of the graffiti and assessment of the costs of such removal as a lien on the property.    

C. No City Liability. Nothing contained in this section is intended or shall be construed as imposing any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers or employees, or forming the basis of any liability on the part of the city, its officers, employees or agents for any injury or damage resulting from any action or inaction on the part of the city, its officers, employees or agents. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.060 Appeal, abatement and cost recovery proceedings.

A. An owner who has a lien placed on his or her property by the city for abatement of graffiti may appeal the same within 10 days of the recording of the lien and posting of such notice on the property. Written notice requesting an appeal hearing before the hearing examiner shall be directed to the development services director, and shall include the name of the party requesting the appeal, the address of the graffiti nuisance property, a statement indicating standing to appeal, and a concise statement as to reasons why the graffiti on the property does not constitute a public nuisance.

B. Notice of Appeal Hearing. Upon a timely written request for an appeal, the city shall provide the appellant notice of the appeal hearing before the hearing examiner at least five business days in advance of the same. Notice shall be deemed served three business days after the same is mailed to the parties by first class U.S. mail. 

C. Determination of Hearing Examiner. The determination of the hearing examiner after the due process hearing shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative appeal. If, after the due process hearing, the hearing examiner determines that the property contains or contained graffiti, the hearing examiner shall declare the same a nuisance and order the party to whom the notice of violation is issued to pay the costs of abatement.

D. The hearing examiner shall issue a decision and order, if necessary, containing the following: findings of fact; conclusions in support of the decision and order; type and method of abatement; the date by which said abatement was completed; and the cost of the abatement. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.070 Continued presence of graffiti an infraction.

It shall be a civil infraction for a responsible party to allow graffiti to exist on their property after receiving notice of abatement consistent with NBMC 8.40.050. Each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation is committed, continued, permitted or not corrected shall be a separate violation for purposes of this chapter. A civil infraction under this chapter shall be punishable by a penalty of $75.00 for each violation. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.080 Remedies not exclusive.

The remedies for violation of this chapter that are set forth in this chapter are not exclusive. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


8.40.090 Severability.

If any provision of this chapter or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this chapter or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected. (Ord. 1463 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).

A. This chapter shall be known as, and may be cited as, the North Bend criminal code. 

B. The provisions of this code shall apply to any offense committed on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.

C. The provisions of this code do not apply to or govern the construction of and punish­ment for any offense committed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title, or to the construction and application of any defense to a prosecution for such an offense. Such an offense must be construed and punished according to the provisions of law existing in the city at the time of the com­mission thereof in the same manner as if this code had not been enacted.

D. The sections of the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the King County Code (KCC), now in effect or as subsequently amended, specifically enumerated in this title, are adopted by reference in this code.

E. Section captions are for organizational purposes only and shall not be construed as part of this code. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.020 Purposes – Principles of construction.

A. The general purposes of the provisions governing the definition of offenses are:

1. To forbid and prevent conduct that inflicts or threatens substantial harm to indi­vidual or public interests;

2. To safeguard conduct that is without culpability from condemnation as criminal;

3. To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct declared to constitute an offense; and

4. To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses, and to prescribe proportionate penalties for each.

B. The provisions of this code shall be con­strued according to the fair import of their terms, and when the language is susceptible of differing constructions, it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this code.

C. In adopting state statutes by reference, only those crimes and offenses within the jurisdiction of a municipality are intended to be adopted and, in those sections adopted which define both misdemeanors and felonies, only the language applicable to misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors is to be applied. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.030 City criminal jurisdiction.

Any person who commits any offense defined by this code, in whole or in part, within the corporate limits of the city is liable to arrest, prosecution and punishment. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.040 Classes of crimes.

An offense defined by this code, for which a sentence of imprisonment is authorized, con­stitutes a violation of city ordinance and a crime. Crimes are classified as gross misde­meanors or misdemeanors. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.050 Punishment and restitution.

A. Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a gross misde­meanor, or a crime not otherwise classified, shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a maximum term of not more than one (1) year, or by a fine in an amount of not more than $5,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

B. Unless specifically provided otherwise, every person convicted of a misdemeanor shall be punished by imprisonment in jail for a max­imum term of not more than ninety (90) days, or by a fine in an amount of not more than $1,000, or by both such imprisonment and fine.

C. A person who is convicted of a misde­meanor violation of any provision of Chapter 69.50 RCW adopted by reference shall be pun­ished by imprisonment for not less than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours, and by a fine of not less than $250.00. On a second or subsequent conviction, the fine shall not be less than $500.00. These fines shall be in addition to any other fine or penalty imposed. Unless the court finds that the imposition of the minimum imprisonment will pose a substantial risk to the defendant’s physical or mental well-being or that local jail facilities are in an overcrowded condition, the term of imprisonment shall not be suspended or deferred. If the court finds such risk or overcrowding exists, it shall sen­tence the defendant to a minimum of forty (40) hours of community service. If a minimum term of imprisonment is suspended or deferred, the court shall state in writing the reason for granting the suspension or deferral and the facts upon which the suspension or deferral is based. Unless the court finds the person to be indigent, the minimum fine shall not be sus­pended or deferred.

D. The court may impose restitution as pro­vided in RCW 9A.20.030.

E. In the event there is a conflict in the pen­alties which can be imposed upon conviction for a specific offense between the provisions of the North Bend criminal code and the Revised Code of Washington, the penalty pro­visions of the Revised Code of Washington shall apply. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.060 Limitation of action.

A. A gross misdemeanor, or a crime not otherwise classified, may not be prosecuted more than two (2) years after its commission. A misdemeanor may not be prosecuted more than one (1) year after its commission.

B. Periods of limitation toll for any period of time the person charged is not usually and publicly resident within this state.

C. If a complaint is filed before the end of a period of limitation is thereafter set aside, then the period is extended by a period equal to the length of time from the filing to the setting aside. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).


9.05.070 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

A. Every person charged with an offense is presumed innocent unless proven guilty by competent evidence establishing each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

B. When an offense has been proven against a person but a reasonable doubt exists as to the degree of the crime, a conviction shall be entered only as to the lowest degree. (Ord. 992 § 1 (part), 1996).

9.245.010 Definitions.

The definitions set forth in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

A. “Criminal conduct” means reasonable suspicion that:

1. A “more serious offense” has occurred as defined in RCW 9.94A.030;

2. Gang or gang-related activity, as those terms are defined by RCW 59.18.030, has occurred on the rental property; and

3. Drug-related activity pursuant to RCW 59.18.130 has occurred on the rental property.

B. “Landlord” means:

1. The owner, lessor or sublessor of the dwelling unit or the rental property of which it is a part and a person designated as a representative of the landlord;

2. A person or business entity such as a corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership, or agency that owns, operates or manages rental housing or rental property; and

3. A person, designated by the landlord, who has authority to sign a lease or rental agreement.

C. “Police department” means the North Bend police department or a law enforcement officer who has general authority, limited authority or specially commissioned Washington State peace officer, or any federal peace officer, as those terms are defined by Chapter 10.93 RCW.

D. “Reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the property” means that the landlord reports criminal conduct that occurs on the property whenever the commission of criminal conduct on the rental property is known or suspected, and that the landlord takes steps to prevent the recurrence of crime, which may include, but are not limited to, one of the following:

1. The landlord and on-site managers of the rental property show proof of attendance in at least a three-hour landlord training class. Training may be provided by local police departments, rental housing associations, on-line training or any other training program approved by the police department. The training must be about rental property management, crime free properties, tenant screening or landlord-tenant law; 

2. The landlord pursues eviction to judgment of the tenant who is the subject of a notice issued in accordance with NBMC 9.245.020, and begins the eviction process within 30 days after the third notice is issued; or

3. The landlord requests the city’s assistance in accordance with NBMC 9.245.030.

E. “Rental agreement” or “lease” has the same meaning as “rental agreement” defined in RCW 59.18.0301.

F. “Rental housing” or “rental property” means a rental housing facility that is rented or intends to be rented, is located on a single parcel or lot and for which a postal address exists or may exist for each individual unit, and the common areas and appurtenances to the rental housing facility. “Rental housing” or “rental property” includes any mobile home park or manufactured housing community as those terms are defined by RCW 59.20.030. “Rental housing” or “rental property” does not include the following:

1. A retail, commercial or industrial rental;

2. A registered and licensed nursing home; or

3. A properly registered and licensed assisted living facility.

G. “Tenant” had the same meaning as “tenant” in RCW 59.18.030 and 59.20.030. (Ord. 1556 § 2 (part), 2015).


9.245.020 Criminal conduct on rental property – Notice.

A. A landlord shall take reasonable steps to ensure that its rental property is not used for criminal conduct. If a landlord is notified by the police department that criminal conduct has occurred on the property, the landlord shall take reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the rental property. Repeated criminal conduct committed by tenants or guests on the rental property shall result in a civil infraction chargeable to the landlord.

B. Upon the occurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property, the police department may cause notice to be sent to the landlord setting forth the date of the occurrence, the location of the occurrence, the nature of the occurrence and the name of the person who engaged in the criminal conduct. Notice may be sent whenever the police department has probable cause to believe that criminal conduct has occurred on the rental property. Notice is deemed properly delivered when it is either served upon the landlord or a property manager of the rental property by certified mail to the last known address of the landlord. The issuance of the notice in this subsection is a prerequisite to the issuance of a notice of infraction under subsection C of this section, and the issuance of the civil infraction under subsection C of this section constitutes the notice of the fourth instance of criminal conduct.

C. If a landlord receives more than three notices under subsection B of this section regarding instances of criminal conduct committed in the same dwelling unit or anywhere on the rental property by the same tenant or any guest of the tenant within any six-month period, the landlord shall be deemed to have committed a civil infraction if they have not taken reasonable steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the rental property. If the criminal conduct is committed by guests of tenant, the city need not establish that the criminal conduct was committed by the same guest. Each instance of criminal conduct committed in the same dwelling unit or anywhere on the rental property by the same tenant or any guest of the tenant in excess of three instances of criminal conduct in a six-month period is an additional civil infraction chargeable to the landlord. (Ord. 1556 § 2 (part), 2015).


9.245.030 Landlord request for assistance.

A. A request for the assistance of the city in accordance with this section is considered a reasonable step to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur for the next single violation of the rental property, but only if the landlord cooperates with the city’s assistance and takes reasonable measures to implement the suggested methods of the city to reduce the recurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property. A request for assistance does not relieve the landlord of the duty to comply with this chapter.

B. When criminal conduct occurs on the rental property, or the occurrence of criminal conduct on the rental property is suspected by the landlord, the landlord may request the assistance of the police department in taking steps to reduce the likelihood that criminal conduct will recur on the rental property. The city shall assist landlords when such a request is made. The assistance may include, but is not limited to, the following:

1. Providing the landlord with information permitted to be disclosed by law relating to the criminal conduct that occurred on the rental property; 

2. Having a law enforcement officer communicate with the tenant suspected of engaging in the criminal conduct regarding the ramifications of continued criminal conduct; and

3. Providing the landlord with resources available to assist the landlord in pursuing eviction of the tenant.

C. The police department may work with other agencies providing advice to rental property owners or tenants in providing assistance under this chapter. (Ord. 1556 § 2 (part), 2015).


9.245.040 Violation.

A. A violation of this chapter is a class 2 civil infraction for the first offense and a class 2 civil infraction for each offense thereafter punishable under Chapter 7.80 RCW.

B. Except as set forth in this chapter and except as other rules apply, the Infraction Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction (“IRLJ”) and all local rules and policies as promulgated by the North Bend municipal court shall govern infraction proceedings including any appeals.

The fee for a permit shall be the total cost of labor and materials to the city for processing, reviewing, and issuing the permit, and field inspection of the work, as necessary. The fee shall be paid in advance of the issuance of the permit.   

A. Application Fee. A nonrefundable base application fee as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance shall be charged for each right-of-way use permit application or renewal that is accepted for processing. This fee covers the costs of initial processing, counter service and record keeping. The application fee shall be the same for all types of right-of-way use permits. Pursuant to NBMC 12.24.070(C)(6), the director may waive the fee for certain permit applications.

B. Processing of Application Fee. A fee for the processing of applications or renewals shall be charged. The amount of the fee shall be determined based upon the time and cost required to review, inspect, research and coordinate the applicants’ data for each permit application.

C. Excess Inspection Costs. The city may incur extra costs of inspection for certain permits that require more than the usual number of inspections. These costs may be incurred because of situations related to observed quality of work, traffic problems, schedule problems and cooperation of the permittee. Excess inspection fees will be charged based on the hourly rate of actual costs incurred by the city to make the excess inspections.

D. House Move Charges. When a house move permit is issued the city shall impose a charge based on the actual cost to compensate for its time and expense. These costs may include street crews, signal crews and police, if required to assist in the move. A minimum fee will be charged at the time of permit issuance based on one hour of city two-person crew time. Costs for damage to city property occurring as a result of the move, or assistance in the house move by city crews in excess of one hour, shall be billed to the house mover and permittee directly.

E. Repair and Replacement Charges. If the city should incur any costs in repairing or replacing any property as the result of the permittee’s actions, the costs of repair and replacement will be charged to the permittee. These charges will be for the actual costs to the city.

F. City Cost Reimbursement. When the city performs work in the right-of-way and finds it necessary to maintain, support, or move a telecommunications provider’s or franchisee’s equipment and/or facilities in order to protect such equipment or facilities or for any other reason, the city’s costs associated therewith will be billed to that telecommunications provider or franchisee and must be paid within 30 days from the date of billing. Each telecommunications provider and franchisee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any equipment or facilities in the right-of-way which such telecommunications provider or franchisee may damage. Each telecommunications provider and franchisee shall be responsible for the cost of repairing any damage to the equipment of another telecommunications provider or franchisee caused during the city’s response to an emergency occasioned by that telecommunications provider or franchisee’s actions.

G. Waiver of Fees. Franchised utilities, which must apply for permits because of city-initiated construction projects, may be granted a waiver by the director of normal permit fees. This provision only applies to work that would not otherwise have been done by the utility. Waiver of certain fees is also permitted under NBMC 12.24.070(C)(6).

H. Festival at Mount Si. Fees for the Festival at Mount Si committee are waived.

I. Annual Fee. Each authorization granted under this chapter is subject to the city’s right, which is expressly reserved, to annually fix a fair and reasonable compensation to be paid as reimbursement for the city’s costs in connection with reviewing, inspecting and supervising the use and occupancy of the public rights-of-way on behalf of the public and existing or future users.

13.08.010 Connection to public water required.

The owner of all new houses, buildings, or properties used for human occupancy, employment, recreation or other purposes, is required at his or her expense to install suitable plumbing facilities therein and connect such facilities directly with the city water system prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or, in the case of residential subdivisions containing five or more lots, prior to final plat approval. Provided, that the construction of accessory buildings, such as a garage or storage shed, that do not include plumbing shall be exempt from the requirements of this section. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


13.08.020 Water connection charge – Established.

Payment of a water system general facility charge (GFC) is required for connection to the city’s water system. The water system GFC shall be set forth in the city’s taxes, rates and fees schedule, and shall be deposited in the city’s water system capital improvement fund, which shall be used for the purpose of providing capital improvements to the city’s water system.

A. New Construction. Each single-family dwelling (NBMC 18.06.030) shall be one equivalent residential unit (ERU). Each multifamily dwelling (NBMC 18.06.030) shall be 0.7 ERU. For development other than single-family or multifamily, an ERU shall be 28 cubic meters per month of anticipated water usage. For development other than single-family or multifamily, the general facility charge shall be calculated by dividing the anticipated monthly cubic meter water usage by 28 then multiplying the quotient by the required general facility charge per ERU. Anticipated use shall be determined by the city engineer based upon anticipated property use, water supply line size, plumbing fixture count, and after consultation with accepted state and federal manuals.

B. Existing Structures. In the case of an existing water service where there is an intended change in use, or an increase in the intensity of use, then an additional general facility charge shall be paid equal to the number of ERUs in increased anticipated water use. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).

13.16.180 Definitions.

As used in this chapter, unless the context states otherwise, the following definitions shall apply:

A. “Air gap separation” means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supply water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle, and shall be at least double the diameter of supply pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one inch;

B. “Auxiliary supply” means any water source or system, other than the public water supply, that may be available in the building or premises;

C. “Backflow” means the flow other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign liquids, gases, or substances into the distribution system of a public water supply;

D. “Backflow prevention device” means a device to counteract back pressures or prevent back siphonage;

E. “Back pressure” means backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler, or other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the supply pressure;

F. “Back siphonage” means a form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a water system;

G. “Cross-connection” means any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of which, backflow could occur;

H. “Customer” means any person, family, business, corporation, partnership or firm connected to the city water supply;

I. “Double check valve assembly” means an assembly composed of two single, independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the watertightness of each check valve;

J. “Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device” means a device incorporating two or more check valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two checks, two shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves, less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 391 § § 2 and 5, 1974. Formerly 13.28.180).

Chapter 13.24 SEWER RATES

Sections:

13.24.010    Sewer rates.

13.24.020    Charges – When due – Delinquent charges.


13.24.010 Sewer rates.

Monthly charges, as set forth in the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance, shall apply to the following classifications of users of the city sewer system:

A. Each single-family residential unit inside the corporate limits of the city (including units in duplexes, triplexes, apartment houses, condominiums, trailer parks, and other multifamily dwellings), where each unit is supplied with a separate metered water service connection, shall pay the base sewer charge plus an additional charge per cubic meter of water consumed over an initial 10 cubic meters consumed that month as measured by the water meter.

B. Single-family residential units, duplexes, triplexes, apartment houses, condominiums, trailer courts, and other multifamily dwellings inside the corporate city limits that are serviced by only one metered water service connection shall pay the base charge for each residential unit plus an additional charge per cubic meter of water usage over the initial 10 cubic meters of water consumed that month as measured by the water meter.

C. Mixed-use buildings (those buildings consisting of any combination of residential and commercial uses) inside the city limits that are served by only one metered water service connection shall pay according to the following methodology:

1. One commercial base charge, regardless of the number of commercial businesses in the building;

2. A multifamily base charge for each residential unit in the building; and

3. An additional charge, at the commercial rate, for each cubic meter of water usage over the initial 20 cubic meters of water consumed that month for the entire building as measured by the water meter.

D. All other users inside the city limits shall pay the specified base charge plus an additional charge for each cubic meter of water consumed over the initial 10 cubic meters of water consumed that month as measured by the user’s water meter.

E. All users outside the city limits shall pay the base charge plus an additional charge for each cubic meter of water consumed over the initial 10 cubic meters of water consumed that month as measured by the user’s water meter.

F. In the event that any user of the sewage system, by reason of the user’s activities, is in two or more of the classifications set out in this section, the rate for such users shall be the highest rate established for any such classification.

G. In the event that a user of the sewage system obtains water from a metered system other than the city’s water system, the charges for sewer system usage shall be based on the meter readings from the purveyor of the water supply. As a condition of sewer service, the property owner shall sign an agreement with the city authorizing the water purveyor to provide the city water use records for the building to be served by sewer.

H. In the event the user of the sewage system obtains water from a private source that is not metered, the user shall pay the prescribed base fee for the associated uses in the building as set forth in the taxes, rates and fees schedule.

I. A user of the sewage system may apply in writing to the city administrator for a sewage charge adjustment. The burden is on the user to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence based on studies and other data that the water consumption used to calculate the sewage charge is greatly disproportionate to the user’s impact on the sewage system as compared to other users of the sewage system. Requesting such an adjustment does not extend the period for payment of the sewage charge. An adjustment on a delinquent account shall not be made until the account is paid in full. The city administrator shall establish processes and procedures for reviewing requests for adjustments and may revoke an adjustment at any time. The decision of the city administrator shall be final.

J. In addition to any applicable charges set forth in this section, all users responsible for payment of any such charges shall pay a monthly surcharge equal to six percent of the total monthly charges owed by such user to the city for sewer services. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


13.24.020 Charges – When due – Delinquent charges.

All invoices for sewer charges imposed pursuant to Chapter 13.20 NBMC and this chapter shall be due and payable upon receipt. All charges remaining unpaid shall be subject to the provisions of NBMC 13.40.070. All delinquent charges shall be a lien against the property served and shall be perfected and enforced as provided by the laws of the state governing municipal utility liens. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).

13.32.010 Purpose and policy.

A. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly owned treatment works (POTW) operated by the city of North Bend. It enables the city of North Bend to comply with state and federal laws that apply to POTWs with significant industrial users, but without a discharge permit program. All actions required, or authorities granted under this chapter are in accordance with the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), the Federal Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403), and Chapter 90.48 RCW, Water Pollution Control. The objectives of this chapter are:

1. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW;

2. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW;

3. To ensure that the quality of POTW sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations;

4. To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public;

5. To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge (biosolids) from the POTW; and

6. To promote strategies which reduce the amounts of pollution generated by users, thereby reducing the associated hazards to the POTW and receiving waters.

B. This chapter shall apply to all users of the POTW. The chapter defines certain prohibited discharges; sets forth local limits for use by state agencies in the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the recovery of liquidated damages and collection of penalties.

A. The city may enter into agreements with users to accept pollutants compatible with the treatment system at concentrations greater than those typical of domestic wastewater. Within such agreements, the city of North Bend may establish terms of the user’s discharge to the POTW including maximum flow rates and concentrations. The city of North Bend may also establish fees to recover costs associated with treating such wastes and monitoring schedules in such agreements. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a state or federal pretreatment standard or requirement including categorical standards.

B. Users discharging or intending to discharge pollutants other than BOD and TSS, and claiming compatibility, must prove to the satisfaction of the director that such pollutants are compatible with the POTW. The director may require any claim of compatibility to be endorsed by the department.

C. The city may assist, by arrangement or formal agreement, any agencies that regulate hazardous wastes and materials, and air emissions from users in order to maximize state, county, and city resources.

D. The city may specifically arrange to act as an agent of the department to determine compliance with treatment or disposal requirements and inspect on-site disposal activities and shipping documents.

E. The city may facilitate compliance by arranging or providing pollution prevention technical assistance for users, especially those in violation of pretreatment standards. The director intends to provide such assistance in coordination and cooperation with the appropriate local, county, and state authority(ies). (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.100).

No user shall ever increase the use of water, nor combine separate waste streams, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The director may request the department impose mass limitations on users which he/she believes may be using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in any other case when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.110).


13.32.120 Pretreatment facilities.

A. Users shall procure and properly install, operate, and maintain the pretreatment facilities which combined with appropriate best management practices are necessary to achieve AKART as defined herein. Such pretreatment facilities shall be designed to achieve compliance with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements within the time limitations specified by the EPA or the state, whichever is more stringent. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the department for review and approval in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 173-240 WAC, and shall be disclosed to the city of North Bend before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying its facility as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city of North Bend and/or the department and meet discharge limitations under the provisions of this chapter. Such facilities shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user’s expense.

B. Users shall comply with approved engineering reports, plans and specifications, and operations and maintenance manuals, and shall modify such documents to reflect any proposed modifications of industrial wastewater (pretreatment) facilities. Users shall submit proposals to modify pretreatment facilities to the department before implementation in accordance with Chapter 173-240 WAC. Users shall submit a copy of such revised plans and the department’s acceptance to the director before implementing changes to approved pretreatment facilities. The director may audit the compliance of any user, and require changes in operating procedures deemed necessary by the director to ensure continued compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.120).


13.32.130 Deadline for compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements.

A. Existing sources (as defined herein) to which one or more categorical pretreatment standard is applicable, shall comply with all applicable standards within three years of the date the standard is effective unless the pretreatment standard includes a more stringent compliance schedule. The department shall establish a final compliance deadline date for any existing user (as defined herein) or any categorical user when the local limits for said user are more restrictive than EPA’s categorical pretreatment standards.

B. New sources and new users as defined herein shall comply with applicable pretreatment standards within the shortest feasible time. In no case shall such time exceed 90 days from beginning a discharge. Prior to commencing discharge, such users shall have all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards installed and in proper operation. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.130).


13.32.140 Additional pretreatment measures.

A. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to comply with such conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this chapter. Such measures may include: restricting a discharge during peak flow periods; designating that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers; requiring relocation and/or consolidation of discharge points; and/or separating sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams.

B. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors or traps shall be required when, in the opinion of the director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease and oil in excess of the limits in NBMC 13.32.080, or excessive amounts of sand or other settle-able solids. Such interceptors shall not be required for domestic users. All interceptors shall be of type and capacity approved by the director and shall be located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Each user shall maintain, inspect, and clean required interceptors or traps on a schedule that ensures they capture the intended pollutants, and prevents their reintroduction into the storm or sanitary sewer systems. Users shall bear all expenses related to installation, maintenance, and repair of interceptors, and the proper disposal of removed materials.

C. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

D. The director may require a user discharging more than 10,000 gallons per day or 10 percent of the average daily flow in the POTW, whichever is less, to install and maintain, on its property and at its expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a 24-hour period. The facility shall have a capacity for at least 50 percent of the daily wastewater discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller. The director shall direct the control of discharges. The city may require the user to obtain a wastewater discharge permit solely for flow equalization, or to develop a slug discharge control plan (see NBMC 13.32.150). (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.140).


13.32.150 Accidental spill/slug discharge control plans.

A. The director may require any user to install, properly operate, and maintain, at its own expense, facilities to prevent slug loads or accidental discharges of pollutants to the POTW. The director may require users to produce and/or implement spill plans developed in compliance with applicable OSHA, health, fire, and department regulations applicable to discharges to POTWs. When such plans are required by the director they shall contain at least the following elements:

1. A description of all wastewater discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

2. A description of any and all stored chemicals;

3. Procedures for immediately notifying the director of any accidental or slug load discharges, with procedures for follow-up written notification within five days; and

4. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug load discharge, including, but not limited to, the following: inspection and maintenance of chemical storage areas, handling and transfer of materials; loading and unloading operations; control of runoff, worker training; construction of containment structures or equipment; and measures for emergency response.

B. Users shall verbally notify the director immediately upon the occurrence of a slug load or accidental discharge of substances regulated by this chapter and take immediate actions to correct the situation. Such notification shall include the following information: (1) the location of discharge, (2) the date and time thereof, (3) the type of waste, (4) the waste concentration and volume, and (5) the corrective actions taken and planned. The user shall follow-up with a written notification to the director containing the same information within seven days following the discharge.

C. Any user who discharges an accidental discharge or slug load shall be liable for: (1) recovery of any resultant expenses, losses, and damages to the POTW; (2) recovery of any fines or settlements levied upon the city by any government agency or court of competent jurisdiction attributable to the discharge; and (3) applicable fines and penalties assessed upon the user by the city of North Bend for noncompliance with this chapter. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.150).


13.32.160 Septage and liquid hauled wastes.

A. Residential/domestic septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at a designated receiving structure within the treatment plant area, or at a site authorized by the director and at such times as are established by the director. Such wastes shall not violate this chapter or any other requirements established or adopted by the city, except as authorized by the director.

B. Permits for individual vehicles to use such facilities shall be issued by the city. Wastewater discharge permits may be issued to each septage hauling business, and may encompass more than one vehicle.

C. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the director. The director may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards. The director may require the hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.

D. Septage haulers shall utilize a waste tracking form (manifest) provided by the director for every load discharged. Any discharge without a manifest form is an unauthorized discharge and the hauler will receive an administrative fine of not less than $5,000, and may have their discharge permit revoked or suspended.

E. Wastewater discharge permit fees for liquid waste haulers shall be established and charged in addition to any license and volume fees charged. License and volume fees shall be established as part of the user fee system utilizing the principles established above. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.160).


13.32.170 Requirements to complete industrial user surveys.

The director shall periodically notify new, existing, and potential users of the requirement to complete a user survey form. Upon notification, users shall fully and accurately complete the survey form, and return the completed form to the director within 30 days of receipt. Each user shall maintain a copy of the latest completed survey form at their place of business. Failure to fully or accurately complete a survey form, or to maintain the latest survey form on the premises where a wastewater discharge is occurring shall be a violation of this chapter. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.170).

The city shall also endeavor to promote appropriate waste reduction strategies for all users through educational materials. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.175).


13.32.180 Wastewater discharge permitting – Requirements for discharge.

A. No significant industrial user (SIU) shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a statement from the director that the POTW has the hydraulic, and/or loading capacity to accept the discharge. Each SIU must also comply with the state requirements listed in NBMC 13.32.070, and in particular, apply for and receive a wastewater discharge permit from the department which authorizes the discharge. The director may require proof of application as a condition of new or continued discharge. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve an SIU of his/her obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local regulation including the requirement for applying AKART.

B. The director may require other users, including liquid waste haulers, to apply for, and obtain, applicable wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

C. The director may also establish, and require users, by letter, permit, or rule, to implement those best management practices determined by the director to be representative of AKART, or to discontinue use of any substance for which an effective substitute is available which will either: (1) lessen the potential for violating this chapter or any water quality standard, or (2) may represent a significant decrease either singly, or in combination with other similar users, in the toxicity of pollutant loadings to the POTW.

D. The city may require any user, or category of users, to complete pollution prevention planning and to submit the completed plan to the city for approval. The city may require users who must submit a pollution prevention plan under the state’s Hazardous Waste Reduction Act to provide this plan to the director as a condition of initial or continued discharge.

E. Whenever a moratorium has been imposed upon the POTW preventing the addition of new users, the director may require any or all users of the POTW to develop plans to reduce their discharges through water reuse, recycling, reclamation or other applicable management practices, and to implement such plans or other measures deemed appropriate by the director to preserve the availability of public sewage treatment services. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.180).

Users which discharge to the POTW shall abide by all applicable wastewater monitoring requirements of this chapter, any applicable order, and any state or federal regulation or permit, including a state waste discharge or NPDES permit. The director may require any user to engage in self-monitoring as a requirement of discharge to the POTW, or may conduct city of North Bend monitoring of any discharge to the POTW.

B. Categorical User Sampling Requirements. Categorical users with combined discharges shall measure flows and pollutant concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula of 40 CFR 403.6(e). Where feasible, such users shall sample immediately downstream from any pretreatment facilities, unless the department determines end-of-pipe monitoring to be more stringent or applicable.

C. Noncategorical Users. All other users where required to sample, shall measure the flows and pollutant concentrations necessary to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards and requirements.

D. Data Required. Users which analyze wastewater samples shall record and report with the sampling results, the information required by NBMC 13.32.230(B). All required reports shall also certify that the samples are representative of normal work cycles and wastewater discharges from the user. Whenever a user analyzes wastewater samples for any regulated pollutant more frequently than required, using methodologies in 40 CFR Part 136, the results of such analyses shall be submitted with the next required wastewater discharge report. Reports containing incomplete information shall not demonstrate compliance with this chapter, or a wastewater discharge permit.

E. Noncompliance Reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation of its wastewater discharge permit or this chapter, the user shall notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.240).

A. Records kept by the city of North Bend with respect to the nature and frequency of dis-charges from any user shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city of North Bend, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to confidentiality under the law.

B. Users shall clearly mark “confidential” on all areas of correspondence they wish to be held confidential from the public, and feel is afforded such protection. The city of North Bend shall determine if such information is legally afforded this protection under the law upon receipt of a request for such information. Only information marked “confidential” and determined by the city to legally qualify as such shall be withheld from the public.

C. No correspondence claimed as “confidential” shall be withheld from any state or federal agency responsible for oversight of the city’s NPDES permit or authority to implement the NPDES, or state or federal pretreatment programs. Wastewater constituents and characteristics, and other “effluent data” as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.310).


13.32.320 State responsibility for administrative actions.

The department is charged with permitting and regulating SIUs discharging to the city POTW. Except for emergency actions, it shall be the policy of the director to coordinate actions in regard to control of such users with the department until such time as a local pretreatment program for the city may be authorized by the state. Failure to conduct such coordination, however, shall not invalidate any action of the city authorized by this chapter. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.320).

Such consent orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time schedule also specified by the consent order.

B. Compliance schedules, when included in consent orders, may not extend the compliance date beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as compliance orders issued pursuant to this chapter, and shall be judicially enforceable.

C. Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a consent order by the user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or for any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the director. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.340).


13.32.350 Compliance orders.

A. Whenever the director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, the director may issue a compliance order to the user responsible for the violation. This order shall direct that adequate pretreatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances be installed and properly operated and maintained. The order shall specify that wastewater services, including collection and treatment, shall be discontinued and/or applicable penalties imposed unless, following a specified time period, the directed actions are taken.

B. Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the violation or noncompliance, including, but not limited to, the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance beyond any applicable state or federal deadlines, nor does a compliance order release the user from liability from any past, present, or continuing violation(s). Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the user.

C. Failure to comply with any terms or requirements of a compliance order by a user shall be an additional and independent basis for termination of wastewater services, including collection and treatment, or any other enforcement action authorized under this chapter and deemed appropriate by the director. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.350).


13.32.360 Administrative show cause hearing.

A. A user shall be afforded the opportunity to an administrative hearing to contest the city’s determination to suspend services, impose penalties, recover costs, or establish compliance schedules. A user shall also have the right to a hearing prior to termination of a user’s wastewater collection and treatment services.

B. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the administrative hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served on an authorized representative of the user (return receipt requested) at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing date.

C. An administrative hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.360).


13.32.370 Cease and desist orders.

A. The director may issue a cease and desist order upon finding a user has or is violating either: this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued by the department, any other pretreatment standard or requirement. The decision to issue a cease and desist order shall consider the likelihood that a user’s violations in conjunction with other discharges could cause a threat to the POTW, POTW workers, or the public, or cause pass through, interference, or a violation of the POTW’s NPDES permit. The order issued by the director will direct the user to cease and desist all such violations and to:

1. Immediately cease such actions or discharges as described;

2. Comply with all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements;

3. Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.370).


13.32.375 Administrative fines.

A. When the director finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the director may fine such user in an amount not less than $250.00 and not to exceed $10,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. Said administrative fines shall constitute a sewer service surcharge, and upon assessment, shall be subject to collection in the same manner as all other sewer utility rates, charges and penalties.

B. Unless other arrangements have been made with, and authorized by the director, unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall accrue thereafter at a rate of one percent per month. After 90 days, if charges, fines, and penalties have not been paid, the city may revoke the user’s discharge permit.

C. The city shall recover the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, including the cost of additional inspections, sampling and analysis, and may add them to the fine.

D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.375).


13.32.380 Emergency suspension of wastewater services.

A. The director may immediately suspend wastewater services, including collection and treatment, after informal notice to the user, if it appears to the city that such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to either the environment, normal operation of the POTW, or the health or welfare of any person or the general public.

B. Any user notified of a suspension of its wastewater discharge shall immediately cease all such discharges. In the event of a user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the director shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or the danger to the public. The director may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings pursuant to this chapter are initiated against the user.

C. It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent or attempt to prevent the director and/or city from terminating wastewater collection and treatment services in an emergency situation, by barring entry, by physically interfering with city employees or contractors, or by any other means.

D. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the director prior to the date of any administrative hearing authorized by this chapter.

E. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an administrative hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.380).


13.32.390 Termination of treatment services (nonemergency).

A. The director shall have authority to terminate wastewater services, including collection and treatment, through the issuance of a termination order to any user upon determining that such user has:

1. Refused access allowed by this chapter thereby preventing the implementation of any purpose of this chapter;

2. Violated any provision of this chapter including the discharge prohibitions and standards of this chapter; or

3. Violated any lawful order of the city issued with respect to this chapter.

B. For users holding permits to discharge to the city POTW, violation of the following conditions is also grounds for terminating discharge services:

1. Failure to accurately report wastewater constituents or characteristics;

2. Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater constituents or characteristics; or

3. Violation of any term or condition of the user’s waste discharge permit.

C. Issuance of a termination order by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.390).


13.32.395 Appeal procedures.

A. Appeals.

1. Any user seeking to dispute a notice of violation, order, fine, or other action of the director may file an appeal.

2. The appeal must be filed in writing and received by the director, in writing, within 10 days of the receipt of the disputed action. If the notice of appeal is not received by the director within the 10-day period, the right to an appeal is waived. The notice of appeal shall state with particularity the basis upon which the appellant is disputing the action taken.

3. Upon receipt of a timely appeal, the director shall set a date and time for an appeal hearing in accordance with NBMC 2.20.150. The appellant shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place for the appeal hearing. The appeal shall be heard by the city’s hearing examiner.

B. Appeal Hearing.

1. The hearing examiner may admit and give probative effect to evidence which possesses probative value commonly accepted by reasonably prudent men in the conduct of their affairs. The hearing examiner shall give effect to the rules of privilege recognized by law. The hearing examiner may exclude incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial and unduly repetitious evidence. Factual issues shall be resolved by a preponderance of evidence.

2. Documentary evidence may be received in the form of copies or excerpts or by incorporation by reference.

3. Every party shall have the right to cross examine witnesses who testify and shall have the right to submit rebuttal evidence; provided, that the hearing examiner may control the manner and extent of the cross examinations and rebuttal.

4. The hearing examiner may take notice of judicially cognizable facts.

C. Appeal Conclusion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing examiner shall determine if the disputed action was proper, and shall approve, modify, or rescind the disputed action. The final determination of the hearing examiner shall be in writing, and all parties shall be provided a copy of the final determination.

D. Administrative Costs. The appellant shall be responsible for all costs associated with conducting the appeal hearing including but not limited to advertisement, hearing examiner fees, reproduction costs, and other associated expenses.

E. Judicial Review of Appeal.

1. Any party, including the city, the Washington State Department of Ecology, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or the user/appellant, is entitled to review of the final determination of the hearing examiner in the King County superior court; provided, that any petition for review shall be filed no later than 30 days after date of the final determination.

2. Copies of the petition for review shall be served as in all civil actions.

3. The filing of the petition shall not stay enforcement of the final determination except by order of the superior court and on posting of a bond to be determined by the court naming the city as beneficiary.

4. The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury. The record shall be satisfied by a narrative report certified by the hearing examiner and no verbatim record of proceedings before the hearing examiner shall be required to be presented to the superior court.

5. The court may affirm the final determination or remand the matter for further proceedings before the hearing examiner; or the court may reverse the final determination if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the final determination was:

a. In violation of constitutional provisions; or

b. In excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the hearing examiner. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.395).


13.32.400 Injunctive relief.

When the director finds that a user has violated (or continues to violate) any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, he/she may petition the King County superior court through the city attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate. Such injunction shall restrain or compel specific compliance with an applicable wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the user. The city may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.400).


13.32.410 Civil penalties.

A. A user which has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an order issued hereunder, a wastewater discharge permit, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement not reserved by a permit by the department shall be liable to the city for a maximum civil penalty of $10,000 per violation per day. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. In the case of noncompliance with a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of such noncompliance.

B. In addition to the penalty amounts assessable under subsection A of this section, the director may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with compliance and enforcement activities authorized under this chapter. This shall include recovery of costs for sampling and monitoring, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the city of North Bend including penalties for noncompliance with the city of North Bend NPDES permit to the extent attributable to the user.

C. The city shall petition the King County superior court to impose, assess, and recover such sums. In recommending the amount of civil liability, the director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires, and shall present this analysis as evidence in support of the recommended penalty.

D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.410).


13.32.420 Criminal prosecution.

A. A user which has willfully or negligently violated any provision of this chapter, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than $10,000 per violation, per day, plus costs of prosecution or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the King County superior court.

B. The above provision applies to any user which knowingly makes any false statements, representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to this chapter, wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this chapter.

C. Where willful or negligent introduction of a substance into the POTW causes personal injury or property damage, this action shall be in addition to any other civil or criminal action for personal injury or property damage available under the law. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.420).


13.32.430 Remedies nonexclusive.

The enforcement provisions of this chapter are not exclusive remedies. The city reserves the right to take any, all, or any combination of these actions concurrently or sequentially against a noncompliant user or to take other actions as warranted by the circumstances. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.430).


13.32.440 Water supply severance.

Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user’s expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.440).


13.32.450 Public nuisances.

A violation of any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the director. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of Chapter 8.08 NBMC governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the city for any costs incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.450).


13.32.460 Performance bonds and liability insurance.

The director may decline to reinstate wastewater collection and treatment service to any user whose wastewater services were suspended or terminated under the provisions of this chapter, unless such user, at the sole discretion of the director, either: (A) first files with the city a satisfactory bond, payable to the city, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the director to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance; or (B) first submits proof that the user has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.460).


13.32.470 Innovative settlements and supplemental environmental projects.

A. In any enforcement action allowed under this chapter, the director may recommend, and the city may agree to set aside all or portions of the recommended penalty amount in favor of requiring completion of a project of environmental benefit to the POTW of equal or greater value than the proposed penalty. Such projects must be proposed or agreed to in writing by the user.

B. In recommending this option, the director shall consider all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following criteria: (1) the net environmental benefit, (2) the ability of the project to help achieve or ensure compliance, (3) the willingness of the party to change the circumstances that led to the noncompliance, and (4) the responsible party’s technical and financial ability to successfully complete the project.

C. In enforcement actions taken by the department, the city may make written recommendations either for, or against, an innovative settlement agreement with a noncompliant user based on the above criteria. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.470).


13.32.480 General prohibited discharge standards.

A. The city may allow an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against a user for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in NBMC 13.32.050(A) and (B)(3) through (7). An affirmative defense requires the user to prove to the satisfaction of the director that:

1. The user did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference; and

2. The discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user’s prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit; and

3. In the case of interference, the user was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

B. This defense does not relieve the user from responsibility for enforcement to recover costs as provided under this chapter. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.480).


13.32.490 Upset.

A. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements upon reduction, loss, or failure of its wastewater treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

B. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset to an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

1. An upset occurred; the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; and it was not due to improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation; and

2. The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

3. The user has submitted the following information to the POTW and the director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, the user must submit a written report within five days containing this same information:

a. A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; and

b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

c. Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

C. Users will only have the opportunity for a judicial determination on a claim of upset in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards. In any such enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.490).


13.32.500 Bypass.

A. A user may allow a bypass to occur if it does not cause applicable pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, and if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient wastewater treatment operations. These bypasses are subject to the provisions of subsections B and C of this section.

B. Requirements for bypasses subject to pretreatment standards or requirements:

1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.

2. A user shall give verbal notification to the director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours of becoming aware of the bypass, and submit a written report to the director within five days of becoming aware of the bypass.

3. The written report shall contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times; the anticipated time when any ongoing bypass is expected to be halted; and, the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The director may waive the written report if the verbal notification has been received within 24 hours.

C. Exceptions. Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:

1. The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage (as defined herein); and

2. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated or inadequately treated wastewaters, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and

3. The user submitted notices as required, above, in subsection B of this section.

D. The director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if he/she determines that it will meet all three conditions listed in subsection C of this section. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.500).


13.32.505 Pretreatment charges and fees.

The director may adopt reasonable fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the city’s pretreatment program. These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this chapter and are separate from all other rates or charges for sewer service; provided, that the city shall collect said charges in the same manner as other sewer utility rates are collected, including but not limited to the sewer lien procedures provided under Chapter 35.67 RCW.

A. Fees may include:

1. Fees for monitoring, inspection, surveillance and enforcement procedures including the cost of collecting and analyzing a user’s discharge;

2. Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction;

3. Fees for preparing and executing enforcement action;

4. Fees for filing appeals;

5. Fees for high strength waste and industrial process flow; and

6. Other fees as the city may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein.

B. Monitoring Fees. Fees for semiannual inspections and semiannual sampling events of categorical users and significant industrial users are set at $100.00 per visit plus the cost of any lab fees. Any user establishing a pattern of noncompliance, or having a history of noncompliance, or suspected of being in noncompliance, may require additional monitoring visits as deemed appropriate by the director. Any additional inspections, sampling, surveillance monitoring activities, and analysis performed which detect noncompliance will be billed directly to the user.

C. Enforcement Actions. All expenses in preparing enforcement actions will be billed directly to the user.

D. High Strength Waste Fees. Users having effluent concentrations of BOD and/or TSS in excess of 250 mg/L may be billed a high strength waste surcharge. Surcharge rates will be established by the director, and based on cost of conveyance and treatment in the POTW.

E. Industrial Flow Surcharge. An industrial flow surcharge will be billed to significant industrial users and categorical users (and may be billed to other users where deemed appropriate by the director) and based upon the amount of industrial waste flow. The surcharge rate shall be determined at the time of permit application and shall be based upon the cost of administering the pretreatment program.

F. Direct Billing. All fees or charges will be collected by direct billing. Unless the director has been made aware of extenuating circumstances that would prevent prompt payment, all fees are payable within 30 days of the billing. Fees past due will be considered a violation of this chapter. Users not paying fees within 60 days of the billing period will be subject to termination of service. The director may change existing or adopt new fees. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1242 § 3 (part), 2006. Formerly 13.34.505).

This chapter shall be referred to as “The North Bend Stormwater Utility Ordinance.” (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 1, 2001. Formerly 13.44.010).


13.36.020 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for revenue for a city of North Bend stormwater management program to plan, manage, construct, maintain, use, and carry out activities related thereto. This chapter provides these revenues by fixing rates and charges pursuant to RCW 35.67.020. There is hereby created an enterprise fund known as the “city of North Bend stormwater fund.” All fees and charges imposed herein shall be placed in said fund for the purpose of paying any and all expenses related to the acquisition, installation, addition, improvement, replacement, repair, maintenance, operation, or administration of stormwater management program facilities and activities. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 2, 2001. Formerly 13.44.020).


13.36.030 Applicability.

The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all parcels of real property in the city of North Bend, including publicly and privately owned property. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 3, 2001. Formerly 13.44.030).


13.36.040 Definitions.

“Capital facilities charge” shall mean the charge levied for a pro rata share of the existing physical stormwater system and future stormwater system as represented in the comprehensive stormwater management plan, as now in effect or as may be subsequently amended.

“City” shall mean the city of North Bend, Washington, or as indicated by the context, may mean any official, officer, employee or agency representing the city in the discharge of his or her duties.

“City roads” shall mean public rights-of-way, excluding state and county roads, in the city of North Bend.

“Developed parcel” shall mean a parcel of real property which has been altered by development coverage.

“Equivalent service unit (ESU)” shall mean a configuration of impervious surface estimated to contribute an amount of runoff to the city’s stormwater management system which is approximately equal to that created by the average single-family residential developed parcel in North Bend.

“Impervious surfaces” shall mean hard surfaced areas that prevent or hinder the entry of water into the soil mantle and/or cause water to run off the surface in greater quantities or at an increased rate of flow than under natural conditions. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, concrete or asphalt roads, sidewalks and paving, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots or storage areas and gravel, hard-packed dirt, oiled or other surfaces which similarly impede the natural infiltration of stormwater, or runoff patterns existent prior to development.

“Manager” shall mean the city administrator or his or her designee.

“Parcel” shall mean the smallest separately segregated unit or plot of land having an identified owner, boundaries, and surface area which constitutes a separate lot or tract capable of being conveyed without further subdivision.

“Service charges” shall mean the amount owed after applying the appropriate rate to a particular parcel of real property based upon factors established by this chapter.

“Single-family residence” shall mean a residential structure accommodating one dwelling unit, including mobile homes, as defined by the city of North Bend land use codes.

“Undeveloped land” shall mean unimproved land and open space as defined by the city of North Bend land use codes.

“Undeveloped parcel” means any parcel of real property which has not been altered by grading or filling of the ground surface, or by construction of any improvement or other impervious surface area which affects the hydraulic properties of the parcel.

“Unit rate” shall mean the dollar amount charged per ESU. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 4, 2001. Formerly 13.44.040).


13.36.050 Rate structure.

The rates and service charges shall be based on the service provided and the relative contribution of stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the stormwater control facilities. The estimated or measured impervious surface area will be used to determine the relative contribution of stormwater runoff from the parcel.

Service charges shall be determined as described below:

A. Undeveloped Parcels. Undeveloped parcels shall not be charged.

B. Single-Family Residential Parcels. The monthly service charge for each single-family residential parcel shall be the unit rate for one equivalent service unit.

C. Other Developed Parcels. The monthly service charge for all other developed parcels, including publicly owned properties and including public streets, shall be computed by multiplying the unit rate times the number of equivalent service units applicable to the parcel minus any approved rate adjustment for the parcel as determined under NBMC 13.36.080 and 13.36.085. 

D. Minimum Charge. There shall be a minimum monthly service charge for all developed properties equal to the unit rate. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1175 § 2, 2003; Ord. 1117 § 5, 2001. Formerly 13.44.050).


13.36.060 Equivalent service unit.

One equivalent service unit is established at 2,920 square feet of impervious surface area. For the purpose of computation of service charges, the number of equivalent service units shall be rounded to the nearest tenth. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 5a, 2001. Formerly 13.44.060).


13.36.070 Unit rate established.

A unit rate is established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance, to be made up of a stormwater rate per month per equivalent service unit or single-family residence plus a floodplain management rate surcharge per month per equivalent service unit or single-family residence, in order to further address flooding issues directly or indirectly related to surface and stormwater within the city. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1521 § 7, 2014: Ord. 1237 § 9 (part), 2005: Ord. 1131 § 1, 2001: Ord. 1117 § 5b, 2001. Formerly 13.44.070).


13.36.080 Service charge adjustments and appeals.

Any person billed for service charges may file a “request for service charge adjustment” with the manager. However, submittal of such a request does not relieve that person from paying any service charges due during the request consideration period.

A request for service charge adjustment may be granted by the manager only when one or more of the following conditions exist:

A. The amount charged is in error; or

B. The parcel is nonresidential and the impervious surface area on the parcel, as established by a licensed surveyor or engineer, is more than 10 percent of an equivalent service unit greater than or less than the impervious surface area used in determining the charge; or

C. The parcel includes constructed or natural on-site stormwater mitigation facilities that meet all of the following conditions:

1. The constructed or natural facilities provide either stormwater runoff rate control or treatment or both; and

2. The manager has determined that the property owner is capable of maintaining and operating the facilities; and

3. The facilities are maintained by the property owner to the city’s permitted design specifications; and

4. The facilities are available for inspection by the city; and

5. The runoff rate control facility capacity, if applicable, for the 100-year storm event is at least 110 percent of the required design capacity, the excess capacity is not used by the property owner, the facility is hydraulically accessible by means of gravity flow from public improvements facilities lacking runoff control, and the excess is available to the city, at no charge, for related public purposes.

The request for adjustment shall be in writing. The request shall be accompanied by a copy of the permitted drainage plan, a copy of the approved hydraulic calculations for the permitted facilities, calculations of the requested adjustment based on site-specific data signed and stamped by a licensed civil engineer, information, as required by the manager, to determine that the property owner is willing and has the capacity to maintain the facility, and an agreement from the property owner making available to the city any excess capacity in the runoff rate control facility.

Under no circumstances shall the amount of the adjustment exceed either the amount of cost savings to the utility or the unadjusted service charge. Service charge adjustments will only apply to the bill due and payable at the time of request and bills subsequently issued. The property owner shall have the burden of proving that the service charge adjustment should be granted.

The adjustment is revocable under conditions where the facilities no longer operate at the design level established during the drainage plan review/approval process, or if any of the conditions in this subsection C are no longer met.

Decisions on requests for service charge adjustments shall be made by the manager based on information submitted by the applicant and shall be made within 30 days of the adjustment request, except when additional information is needed. The applicant shall be notified in writing of the manager’s decision. If an adjustment is granted which reduces the service charge, the applicant shall be credited the amount overpaid in subsequent bills.

If the manager finds that a service charge bill has been undercharged, then either an amended bill shall be issued which reflects the increase in service charge, or the undercharged amount will be added to the next bill. This amended bill shall be due and payable under the provisions set forth in NBMC 13.36.050.

Decisions of the manager on requests for service charge adjustments shall be final unless appealed within 30 days of the date of the manager’s decision. The appeal of the manager’s decision must be mailed to the King County superior court. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1175 § 3, 2003. Formerly 13.44.075).


13.36.085 Service charge adjustment calculation.

The service charge adjustment shall be the greater of the adjustments for (1) excess on-site retention/detention volume or (2) on-site runoff quality treatment. The adjustments shall be calculated as follows:

A. Excess Retention/Detention Volume Calculation. The calculation shall be based on the retention/detention facility design release rate to accommodate the 100-year storm runoff event. For facilities designed using the Santa Barbara Urban Hydrograph Method, the calculation shall be based on the facility design release rate to accommodate the 100-year storm runoff event before adding the 30 percent factor of safety. For facilities designed using the KCRTS Method, the calculation shall be based on the facility design release rate to accommodate the 100-year storm runoff event before adding the 20 percent factor of safety. The adjustment formula is expressed mathematically as follows:

A = 0.9 x F x (1-(Qr/Qd))

Where:

A = The adjustment amount to be subtracted from the monthly fee;

F = The total monthly charge without the adjustment;

Qr = The designed 100-year storm event release rate before the factor of safety pond volume adjustment;

Qd = The 100-year storm event runoff rate from the site in its predeveloped condition.

B. Runoff Quality Treatment Calculation. The quality treatment adjustment is only applicable when treatment facilities are constructed in accordance with the King County Surface Water Design Manual to treat all applicable on-site impervious areas. The adjustment is expressed mathematically as follows:

A = F x 0.1

(Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1369 § 1, 2009: Ord. 1175 § 4, 2003. Formerly 13.44.085).


13.36.090 Use of funds.

Service charges collected under this chapter shall be deposited into a special fund or funds to be used only for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost and expense of maintaining and operating stormwater control facilities, all or any part of the cost and expense of planning, designing, establishing, acquiring, developing, constructing, maintaining and improving the stormwater management program and drainage facilities. Proceeds from the floodplain management rate surcharge shall be used only for initial floodplain management planning, coordination, and funding acquisition. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1117 § 7, 2001. Formerly 13.44.090).


13.36.100 Capital facilities charges.

A. The capital facilities charge for property owners other than the city of North Bend seeking to develop real property within the boundaries of the city shall be:

1. Single-Family Residential Parcels. The capital facilities charge for each single-family residential parcel shall be one equivalent service unit, and shall be referred to as the “base charge.” Areas within single-family residential short plats or subdivisions that are outside of new single-family lots to be created through the short plat or subdivision (i.e., new rights-of-way, parks, tracts, etc.) shall be subject to the charge established under subsection (A)(2) of this section.

2. Other Parcels. The capital facilities charge for all other parcels, including publicly owned properties but excluding public streets, shall be computed by multiplying the base charge times the number of equivalent service units applicable to the parcel upon development. The formula is expressed mathematically as follows:

Capital facilities charge = Base charge multiplied by the number of equivalent service units

3. Minimum Charge. There shall be a minimum capital facilities charge for all developing properties equal to the base charge.

B. Capital Facilities Charge – Proceeds. All proceeds of the stormwater capital facilities charge shall be placed in the stormwater capital improvements fund for the following uses: construction of stormwater expansion made necessary by system growth, debt service for indebtedness resulting from construction of stormwater expansion made necessary by system growth, and the repair, replacement, and maintenance of existing stormwater facilities. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1402 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2010: Ord. 1117 § 8, 2001. Formerly 13.44.100).


13.36.110 Capital facilities charge established.

A capital facilities base charge is established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule ordinance. The capital facilities base charge shall be adjusted on an annual basis on January 1st of each year using the Engineering News-Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index for the Seattle area. (Ord. 1660 § 3, 2018: Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1461 § 1, 2012: Ord. 1402 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2010: Ord. 1237 § 9 (part), 2005: Ord. 1117 § 8a, 2001. Formerly 13.44.110).


13.36.120 Lien for delinquent charges.

Delinquent service charges shall bear interest at the rate established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance, or such rate as may hereafter be authorized by law, computed on a monthly basis from the date of delinquency until paid. Interest shall be calculated at the rate in effect at the time of payment of the charges regardless of when the charges were first delinquent.

The city shall have a lien for delinquent service charges, including interest thereon, against any property subject to service charges; the lien shall be superior to all other liens and encumbrances except general taxes and local and special assessments. Such liens shall be effective and shall be enforced and foreclosed in the manner provided by RCW 35.67.200 and 35.67.210 as now in effect or as may be subsequently amended. (Ord. 1622 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2017: Ord. 1237 § 9 (part), 2005: Ord. 1117 § 9, 2001. Formerly 13.44.120).

14.04.010 Substantive policies and goals.

A. The city recognizes the interdependence of the human race and its environment and the profound impact of man’s activity on the interrelations of all components of the environment, particularly the profound influence of population growth, high density urbanization, industrial expansion and resource utilization. It further recognizes the critical importance of restoring and maintaining environmental quality while at the same time providing the widest possible range of beneficial uses of the environment. Thus the substantive authority under the environmental review process shall be as broad as permitted by state law in order to assure that the city, as a trustee of the environment for succeeding generations, minimizes the adverse environmental impact of any and all actions within the city. In order to carry out this broad policy, and as an elaboration upon said substantive policy and not as a limitation thereof, the following general guidelines are established for the city’s exercise of substantive authority pursuant to the city’s environmental protection ordinance (Ordinance 622), and the State Environmental Policy Act:

1. Foster and promote the general welfare;

2. Create and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony;

3. Assure for all people of the city, and the surrounding area, to the extent possible, a safe, healthful, productive and aesthetically and cultural pleasing surrounding;

4. Preserve the scenic views of surrounding foothills, mountains and valleys from within the city limits;

5. Maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports diversity and variety of individual choice;

6. Achieve a balance between population and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life’s amenities;

7. Enhance the quality of renewable resources and approach the maximum obtainable recycling of depletable resource while preserving the quality of all aspects of the environment;

8. Obtain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences;

9. Maintain, and improve where possible the environmental quality to the overall welfare and development of the city’s citizens;

10. Encourage voluntary agreements allowing the city to accept payments from the proponents of a project for the purpose of mitigating what the city has identified as a direct impact on public services and/or facilities as a consequence of the proposed development.

B. To the extent possible, and to the extent not inconsistent with above-stated goals, the policies and purposes set forth in other city ordinances, resolutions and administrative regulations, as now existing or as hereinafter amended or adopted are established as substantive policies to guide the exercise of substantive authority given to the decision maker in the environmental review process. The policies and purposes so adopted include, but are not limited to:

1. The city’s subdivision codes as codified in North Bend Municipal Code Title 17;

2. The city’s zoning codes as codified in North Bend Municipal Code Title 18;

3. The city’s development standards as codified in North Bend Municipal Code Title 19;

4. The city’s health and safety standards as codified in North Bend Municipal Code Title 8;

5. The city’s building and construction codes as codified in North Bend Municipal Code Title 15;

6. The city’s shoreline master plan;

7. The city’s community land use plan;

8. The city comprehensive water plan;

9. The city comprehensive transportation master plan;

10. The city’s comprehensive sanitary sewer plan;

11. Council policies adopted by motion, resolution or otherwise; and

12. All written regulations and written policies adopted by the city staff to implement the above codes, plans and policies. (Ord. 743 § 1, 1988: Ord. 622 § 2, 1984).


14.04.020 Definitions.

All words herein shall be given their common meaning unless the context indicates otherwise. The definitions of the words set forth below shall be utilized in interpreting this chapter.

1. Action.

a. “Actions” include, as further specified below:

i. New and continuing activities (including projects and programs) entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, licensed, or approved by agencies;

ii. New or revised agency rules, regulations, plans, policies, or procedures; and

iii. Legislative proposals.

b. Actions fall within one of two categories:

i. Project Actions. A “project action” involves a decision on a specific project, such as a construction or management activity located in a defined geographic area. Projects include and are limited to agency decisions to:

(A) License, fund, or undertake any activity that will directly modify the environment, whether the activity will be conducted by the agency, an applicant, or under contract;

(B) Purchase, sell, lease, transfer, or exchange natural resources, including publicly owned land, whether or not the environment is directly modified.

ii. Nonproject Actions. “Nonproject actions” involve decisions on policies, plans, or programs:

(A) The adoption or amendment of legislation, ordinances, rules, or regulations that contain standards controlling use or modification of the environment;

(B) The adoption or amendment of comprehensive land use plans or zoning ordinances;

(C) The adoption of any policy, plan, or program that will govern the development of a series of connected actions, but not including any policy, plan, or program for which approval must be obtained from any federal agency prior to implementation;

(D) The creation of a district or annexation to the city;

(E) Capital budgets; and

(F) Road, street, and highway plans.

c. Actions do not include the activities listed above when an agency is not involved. Actions do not include bringing judicial or administrative civil or criminal enforcement actions. Actions further do not include activities for which a categorical exemption is granted elsewhere in this chapter.

2. Addendum. “Addendum” means an environmental document used to provide additional information or analysis that does not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in the existing environmental document. The term does not include supplemental EISs. An addendum may be used at any time during the SEPA process.

3. Adoption. “Adoption” means an agency’s use of all or part of an existing environmental document to meet all or part of the agency’s responsibilities under SEPA to prepare an EIS or other environmental document.

4. Affecting. “Affecting” means having, or may be having, an effect on. For purposes of deciding whether an EIS is required and what the EIS must cover, affecting refers to having probable, significant adverse environmental impacts.

5. Agency. “Agency” means the city council, the planning commission, the board of adjustment, or any other department, officer, board or commission within the city that is authorized to make law, hear contested cases, or otherwise take action as defined herein, except the municipal court.

a. “Agency with jurisdiction” means an agency with authority to approve, veto, or finance all or part of a nonexempt proposal (or part of a proposal). The term does not include an agency authorized to adopt rules or standards of general applicability that could apply to a proposal, when no license or approval is required from the agency for the specific proposal. The term also does not include a local, state, or federal agency involved in approving a grant or loan, that serves only as a conduit between the primary administering agency and the recipient of the grant or loan. Federal agencies with jurisdiction are those from which a license or funding is sought or required.

b. For any proposal requiring a Washington State Hydraulics Permit, the State Department of Game and the State Department of Fisheries shall be considered agencies with jurisdiction.

6. Applicant. “Applicant” means any person or entity, including an agency, applying to an agency for a license, permit, or other authority to take action within the city.

7. Categorical Exemption. “Categorical exemption” means a type of action, specified in this chapter, which does not significantly affect the environment. Neither a threshold determination nor any environmental document, including an environmental checklist or environmental impact statement, is required for any categorically exempt action.

8. Consolidated Appeal. “Consolidated appeal” means the procedure requiring a person to file an agency appeal challenging both procedural and substantive compliance with SEPA at the same time, as provided herein. The requirement for a consolidated appeal does not preclude the agencies from bifurcating the appeal proceedings and allowing different agency officials to hear different aspects of the appeal.

9. Consulted Agency. “Consulted agency” means any agency with jurisdiction or expertise that is requested by the lead agency to provide information during the SEPA process.

10. Cost-benefit Analysis. “Cost-benefit analysis” means a quantified comparison of costs and benefits generally expressed in monetary or numerical terms. It is not synonymous with the weighing or balancing of environmental and other impacts or benefits of a proposal.

11. Decisionmaker. “Decisionmaker” means the agency official or officials who make the agency’s decision on a proposal. The decisionmaker and responsible official are not necessarily synonymous, depending on the agency and its SEPA procedures.

12. Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS). “Determination of nonsignificance” (DNS) means the written decision by the responsible official of the lead agency that a proposal is not likely to have a significant adverse impact, and therefore an EIS is not required.

13. Determination of Significance (DS). “Determination of significance” (DS) means the written decision by the responsible official of the lead agency that a proposal is likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact, and therefore an EIS is required.

14. Early Notice. “Early notice” means the city’s response to an applicant stating whether it considers issuance of a determination of significance likely for the applicant’s proposal.

15. EIS. “EIS” means environmental impact statement. The term “EIS” refers to draft, final, or supplemental EISs.

Environment and environmental quality refer to the state of the environment and are synonymous as used herein and refer basically to physical environmental quality.

17. Environmental Document. “Environmental document” means any written public document prepared under this chapter. Under SEPA, the terms environmental analysis, environmental study, environmental report, and environmental assessment do not have specialized meanings and do not refer to particular environmental documents.

18. Environmental Review. “Environmental review” means the consideration of environmental factors as required by SEPA. The “environmental review process” is the procedure used by agencies and others under SEPA for giving appropriate consideration to the environment in agency decision-making.

19. Environmentally Sensitive Area. “Environmentally sensitive area” means an area designated and mapped by the city as such an area.

20. Expanded Scoping. “Expanded scoping” is an optional process that may be used by agencies to go beyond minimum scoping requirements.

21. Impacts. “Impacts” are the effects or consequences of actions. Environmental impacts are effects upon the elements of the environment as the same are listed under the definition of environment contained herein.

22. Incorporation by Reference. “Incorporation by reference” means the inclusion of all or part of any existing document in an agency’s environmental documentation by reference.

23. Lands Covered by Water. “Lands covered by water” means lands underlying the water areas of the city below the ordinary high water marks, including natural watercourses, lakes, ponds, artificially impounded waters, marshes and swamps. Categorical exemptions do not apply to lands covered by water.

24. Lead Agency. “Lead agency” means the agency with the main responsibility for complying with SEPA’s procedural requirements. Lead agency may be read as “responsible official” unless the context clearly requires otherwise.

25. License. “License” means any form of written permission given to any person, organization, or agency to engage in any activity, as required by law or agency rule. A license includes all or part of an agency permit, certificate, approval, registration, charter, or plat approvals or rezones to facilitate a particular proposal. The term does not include a license required solely for revenue purposes.

26. Local Agency. “Local agency” or “local government” means any political subdivision, regional governmental unit, district, municipal or public corporation, including cities, towns, and counties and their legislative bodies. The term encompasses but does not refer specifically to the departments within a city.

27. Major Action. “Major action” means an action that is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts. “Major” reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of “significantly.”

28. Mitigated DNS. “Mitigated DNS” means a DNS that includes mitigation measures and is issued as a result of the mitigation process set forth in this chapter.

29. Mitigation. “Mitigation” means:

a. Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

b. Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation, by using appropriate technology, or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

c. Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

d. Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;

e. Compensating for the impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and/or

f. Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.

30. NEPA. “NEPA” means the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 USCA 4321 et seq.; P.L. 91-190), that is like SEPA at the federal level. The federal NEPA regulations are located at 40 CFR 1500 et seq.

31. Nonproject. “Nonproject” means actions which are different or broader than a single site-specific project, such as plans, policies, and programs.

32. Phased Review. “Phased review” means the coverage of general matters in broader environmental documents, with subsequent narrower documents concentrating solely on the issues specific to the later analysis. Phased review may be used for a single proposal or EIS.

33. Preparation. “Preparation” of an environmental document means preparing or supervising the preparation of documents, including issuing, filing, printing, circulating, and related requirements.

34. Private Project. “Private project” means any proposal primarily initiated or sponsored by an individual or entity other than an agency.

35. Probable. “Probable” means likely or reasonably likely to occur, as in “a reasonable probability of more than a moderate effect on the quality of the environment.” Probable is used to distinguish likely impacts from those that merely have a possibility of occurring, but are remote or speculative. This is not meant as a strict statistical probability test.

36. Proposal. “Proposal” means a proposed action. A proposal includes both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants. A proposal exists at that stage in the development of an action when an agency is presented with an application, or has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal, and the environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated. A proposal may therefore be a particular or preferred course of action or several alternatives. For this reason, these rules use the phrase “alternatives including the proposed action.” The term “proposal” may therefore include “other reasonable courses of action,” if there is no preferred alternative and if it is appropriate to do so in the particular context.

37. Reasonable Alternative. “Reasonable alternative” means an action that could feasibly attain or approximate a proposal’s objectives, but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation. Reasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts, either directly, or indirectly through requirement of mitigation measures.

38. Responsible Official. “Responsible official” means that officer or officers, committee, department, or section of the lead agency designated by agency SEPA procedures to undertake its procedural responsibilities as lead agency.

39. SEPA. “SEPA” means the State Environmental Policy Act of 1971 which is also referred to as the act. The “SEPA process” means all measures necessary for compliance with the act’s requirements.

40. Scope.

a. “Scope” means the range of proposed actions, alternatives, and impacts to be analyzed in an environmental document.

b. To determine the scope of environmental impact statements, agencies consider three types of actions, three types of impacts, and three types of alternatives:

i. “Actions” may be:

(A) Single;

(B) Connected; or

(C) Similar.

ii. “Alternatives” may be:

(A) No action;

(B) Other reasonable courses of action; or

(C) Mitigation measures (not in the proposed action).

iii. “Impacts” may be:

(A) Direct;

(B) Indirect; or

(C) Cumulative.

c. The scope of an individual statement may depend on its relationship with other EISs or on phased review.

41. Scoping. “Scoping” means determining the range of proposed actions, alternatives, and impacts to be discussed in an EIS. Because an EIS is required to analyze significant environmental impacts only, scoping is intended to identify and narrow the EIS to the significant issues. The required scoping process provides interagency and public notice of a DS, or equivalent notification, and opportunity to comment. The lead agency has the option of expanding the scoping process, but shall not be required to do so. Scoping is used to encourage cooperation and early resolution of potential conflicts, to improve decisions, and to reduce paperwork and delay.

42. Significant.

a. “Significant” as used in SEPA means a reasonable likelihood of more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality.

b. Significance involves context and intensity and does not lend itself to a formula or quantifiable test. The context may vary with the physical setting. Intensity depends on the magnitude and duration of an impact.

c. The severity of an impact should be weighed along with the likelihood of its occurrence. An impact may be significant if its chance of occurrence is not great, but the resulting environmental impact would be severe if it occurred.

43. State Agency. “State agency” means any state board, commission, department, or officer, including state universities, colleges, and community colleges, that is authorized by law to make rules, hear contested cases, or otherwise take the actions stated in subsection 1 of this section, except the judiciary and state legislature.

44. Threshold Determination. “Threshold determination” means the decision by the responsible official of the lead agency whether or not an EIS is required for a proposal that is not categorically exempt.

45. Underlying Governmental Action. “Underlying governmental action” means the governmental action, such as zoning or permit approvals, that is the subject of SEPA compliance. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 622 § 3, 1984).


14.04.030 Designation of responsible official.

A. For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall be the community and economic development (CED) director. The CED director may delegate to department staff such tasks required of the responsible official as he deems appropriate, except for the issuance of a DNS, MDNS, DS, Scoping Notice, and the selection of the environmental consultants.

B. For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS) and perform any other functions assigned to the lead agency or responsible official.

C. The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules and make them available.

D. The city shall be the lead agency for all projects requiring a license from the city unless a state or federal agency is required to be the lead agency under state or federal law or the proposed project is one that is principally located within another jurisdiction and only a minor portion of said project requires a license from the city. 

E. The CED director shall notify adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012: Ord. 918 § 1, 1993; Ord. 622 § 4, 1984).


14.04.040 Additional timing considerations.

A. For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or draft EIS for the proposal shall accompany the city’s staff recommendation to any appropriate advisory body, such as the planning commission or board of adjustment.

B. If the city’s only action on a proposal is a decision on a building permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and specifications. Said request shall contain the location and nature of the proposed action. The applicant shall be required to pay the city’s actual cost of evaluating said request. The responsible official shall prepare an estimate of the proposed cost of review and that amount shall be paid prior to the commencement of the review process. (Ord. 918 § 2, 1993; Ord. 622 § 5, 1984).


14.04.050 Categorical exemptions.

A. A proposal that is deemed categorically exempt shall be exempt from the threshold determination requirements except in the following cases:

1. The proposal involves land wholly or partially classified as an environmentally sensitive area;

2. The proposal involves lands underwater;

3. The proposal is a segment of a proposal that includes:

a. A series of actions, physically or functionally related to each other, some of which are categorically exempt and some of which are not, or

b. A series of exempt actions that are physically or functionally related to each other, and that together may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact in the judgment of an agency with jurisdiction.

B. An agency is not required to document that a proposal is categorically exempt. Agencies may note on an application that a proposal is categorically exempt or place such a determination in agency files.

C. Minor New Construction – Flexible Thresholds.

1. The exemptions in this subsection apply to all licenses required to undertake the construction in question, except when a rezone or any license governing emissions to the air or discharges to water is required. To be exempt under this subsection, the project must be equal to or smaller than the exempt level. If the proposal involves lands located in another jurisdiction, then the threshold of the jurisdiction with the lowest threshold shall control, regardless of which agency is the lead agency.

2. The following types of construction shall be exempt:

a. The construction or location of any residential structure up to four dwelling units;

b. The construction of a barn, loafing shed, farm equipment storage building, produce storage or packing structure, similar agricultural structure, covering up to 10,000 square feet, and to be used only by the property owner or his or her agent in the conduct of farming the property. This exemption shall not apply to feed lots;

c. The construction of an office, school, commercial, recreational, service or storage building with up to 4,000 square feet of gross floor area and with associated parking facilities designed for that number of off street parking spaces required by the zoning ordinance, not to exceed 20 parking spaces;

d. The construction of a parking lot designed for 20 parking spaces;

e. Any landfill or excavation of 500 cubic yards throughout the total lifetime of the fill or excavation; and any fill or excavation classified as a class I, II, or III forest practice under RCW 76.09.050 or regulations thereunder.

D. Other Minor New Construction. The following types of construction shall be exempt and shall apply to all licenses required to undertake the construction in question, except where a rezone or any license governing admissions to the air or discharges to water is required:

1. The construction or designation of bus stops, loading zones, shelters, access facilities and pull-out lanes for taxicabs, transit and school vehicles;

2. The construction and/or installation of commercial on-premises signs, and public signs and signals;

3. The construction or installation of minor road and street improvements such as pavement marking, freeway surveillance and control systems, railroad protective devices (not including grade-separated crossings), grooving, glare screen, safety barriers, energy attenuators, transportation corridor landscaping (including the application of Washington State Department of Agriculture approved herbicides by licensed personnel for right-of-way weed control as long as this is not within watersheds controlled for the purpose of drinking water quality in accordance with WAC 248-54-660), temporary traffic controls and detours, correction of substandard curves and intersections within existing rights-of-way, widening of a highway by less than a single lane width where capacity is not significantly increased and no new right-of-way is required, adding auxiliary lanes for localized purposes, (weaving, climbing, speed change, etc.), where capacity is not significantly increased and no new right-of-way is required, channelization and elimination of sight restrictions at intersections, street lighting, guard rails and barricade installation, installation of catch basins and culverts, and reconstruction of existing roadbed (existing curb-to-curb in urban locations), including adding or widening of shoulders, addition of bicycle lanes, paths and facilities, and pedestrian walks and paths, but not including additional automobile lanes;

4. Grading, excavating, filling, septic tank installations, and landscaping necessary for any buildings or facility exempted by subsections C and D of this section, as well as fencing and the construction of small structures and minor facilities accessory thereto;

5. Additions or modifications to or replacement of any building or facility exempted by subsections C and D of this section when such addition, modification or replacement will not change the character of the building or facility in a way that would remove it from an exempt class;

6. The demolition of any structure or facility, the construction of which would be exempted by subsections C and D of this section, except for structures or facilities with recognized historical significance;

7. The installation of impervious underground tanks, having a capacity of ten thousand (10,000) gallons or less;

8. The vacation of streets or roads;

9. The installation of hydrological measuring devices, regardless of whether or not on lands covered by water;

10. The installation of any property, boundary or survey marker, other than fences, regardless of whether or not on lands covered by water.

E. Repair, Remodeling and Maintenance Activities. The following activities shall be categorically exempt: The repair, remodeling, maintenance, or minor alteration of existing private or public structures, facilities or equipment, including utilities, involving no material expansions or changes in use beyond that previously existing; except that, where undertaken wholly or in part on lands covered by water, only minor repair or replacement of structures may be exempt (examples include repair or replacement of piling, ramps, floats, or mooring buoys, or minor repair, alteration, or maintenance of docks). The following maintenance activities shall not be considered exempt under this subsection:

1. Dredging;

2. Reconstruction/maintenance of groins and similar shoreline protection structures; or

Y. Emergencies. Action that must be undertaken immediately or within a time too short to allow full compliance with this chapter, to avoid an imminent threat to public health or safety, to prevent an imminent danger to public or private property, or to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental degradation, shall be exempt. Agencies may specify these emergency actions in their procedures. 

Z. Individual Battery Charging or Battery Exchange Stations. The construction of an individual battery charging station or an individual battery exchange station (as defined in Chapter 18.06 NBMC), that is otherwise categorically exempt pursuant to RCW 43.21C.410, shall continue to be categorically exempt even if part of a larger proposal that includes other battery charging stations, other battery exchange stations, or other related utility networks. (Ord. 1435 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2011; Ord. 622 § 6, 1984).


14.04.060 Threshold determination required.

A. A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required,

SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. A threshold determination is required for any proposal which meets the definition of action and is not categorically exempt.

B. The responsible official of the lead agency shall make the threshold determination, which shall be made as close as possible to the time an agency has developed or is presented with a proposal.

C. In most cases, the time to complete a threshold determination should not exceed fifteen (15) days. Complex proposals, those where additional information is needed, and/or those accompanied by an inaccurate checklist may require additional time. Upon request by an applicant, the responsible official shall select a date for making the threshold determination and notify the applicant of such date in writing.

D. All threshold determinations shall be documented in:

1. A determination of nonsignificance (DNS); or

2. A determination of significance (DS). (Ord. 622 § 7, 1984).


14.04.070 Environmental checklist.

A completed environmental checklist shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license, certificate or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter; except a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been initiated by another agency. When an environmental checklist is required, the city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal if either the city has technical information on a question or questions that is unavailable to the private applicant, or the applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous proposals or have proposals currently under consideration. The checklist shall be prepared on a checklist form that may be obtained, upon request, from the responsible official. The items in the environmental checklist are not weighted. The mention of one or many adverse environmental impacts does not necessarily mean that the impacts are significant. Conversely, a probable significant adverse impact on the environment may result in the need for an EIS. (Ord. 918 § 3, 1993: Ord. 622 § 8, 1984).


14.04.080 Threshold determination process.

An EIS is required for proposals for legislation and other major actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment. The lead agency decides whether an EIS is required in the threshold determination process, as described below:

A. In making a threshold determination, the responsible official shall:

1. Review the environmental checklist, if used:

a. Independently evaluate the responses of any applicant and indicating the result of its evaluation in the DS, in the DNS, or on the checklist, and

b. Conduct its initial review of the environmental checklist and any supporting documents without requiring additional information from the applicant;

2. Determine if the proposal is likely to have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, based on the proposed action, the information in the checklist, and any additional information as requested by the responsible official or as may be required for purposes of a mitigated DNS; and 

3. Consider mitigation measures which an agency or the applicant will implement as part of the proposal.

B. In making a threshold determination, the responsible official shall determine whether:

1. All or part of the proposal, alternative, or impacts have been analyzed in a previously prepared environmental document, which can be adopted or incorporated by reference;

2. Environmental analysis would be more useful or appropriate in the future, in which case the agency shall commit to timely, subsequent environmental review, consistent with other provisions of this chapter.

C. In determining an impact’s significance, the responsible official shall take into account the following, that:

1. The same proposal may have a significant adverse impact in one location but not in another location;

2. The absolute quantitative effects of a proposal are also important, and may result in a significant adverse impact regardless of the nature of the existing environment;

3. Several marginal impacts when considered together may result in a significant adverse impact;

4. For some proposals, it may be impossible to forecast the environmental impacts with precision, often because some variables cannot be predicted or values cannot be quantified;

5. A proposal may to a significant degree:

a. Adversely affect environmentally sensitive or special areas, such as loss or destruction of historic, scientific, and cultural resources, parks, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or wilderness,

b. Adversely affect endangered or threatened species or their habitat,

c. Conflict with local, state, or federal laws or requirements for the protection of the environment, and

d. Establish a precedent for future actions with significant effects, involve unique and unknown risks to the environment, or may affect public health or safety.

D. If after the responsible official has received information that is reasonably sufficient to evaluate the environmental impact of a proposal and he reasonably believes that a proposal may have a significant adverse impact, then an EIS is required.

E. A threshold determination shall not balance whether the beneficial aspects of a proposal outweigh its adverse impacts, but rather shall consider whether a proposal has any probable significant adverse environmental impacts under the rules stated in this section. For example, proposals designed to improve the environment, such as sewage treatment plants or pollution control requirements, may also have significant adverse environmental impacts. (Ord. 918 §§ 4, 5, 6, 1993; Ord. 622 § 9, 1984).


14.04.090 Threshold determination – Additional information.

The responsible official shall make his threshold determination based upon information reasonably sufficient to evaluate the environmental impact of a proposal. The responsible official may take one or more of the following actions if, after reviewing the checklist, he concludes that there is insufficient information to make his threshold determination:

A. Require an applicant to submit more information on subjects in the checklist;

B. Make his own further study, including physical investigations on a proposed site;

C. Consult with other agencies, requesting information on the proposal’s potential impacts which lie within the other agencies’ jurisdiction or expertise; or

D. Decide that all or part of the action or its impacts are not sufficiently definite to allow environmental analysis and commit to timely, subsequent environmental analysis. (Ord. 918 § 7, 1993: Ord. 622 § 10, 1984).


14.04.100 Determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

A. If the responsible official determines there will be no probable significant adverse environmental impacts from a proposal, then he shall prepare and issue a determination of nonsignificance (DNS).

B. When a DNS is issued for any of the proposals listed as follows, the requirements in this subsection shall be met:

1. The responsible official shall not act upon a proposal for fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance of a DNS if the proposal involves:

a. Another agency with jurisdiction;

b. Demolition of any structure or facility not categorically exempt;

c. Issuance of a clearing or grading permit not categorically exempt; or

d. The DNS is issued based upon a mitigated checklist prepared after an applicant requests from the responsible official information as to whether or not he is considering issuing a DS, or if no early notice is requested by the applicant and the lead agency still specifies mitigation measures that would allow the issuance of a DNS, then the proposal is subsequently changed in order to incorporate those measures or where a DS has been issued and the proposal is subsequently changed so that it appears there is no probable significant adverse environmental impact, and thus a DNS is issued.

2. The responsible official shall send the DNS and environmental checklist to agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, and affected tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal, and shall give notice under NBMC 14.04.250.

3. Any person, affected tribe, or agency may submit comments to the lead agency within fifteen (15) days of the date of issuance of the DNS.

4. The date of issue for the DNS is the date the DNS is sent to the Department of Ecology and agencies with jurisdiction and is made publicly available.

5. An agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status only within this fifteen (15) day period.

6. The responsible official shall reconsider the DNS based on timely comments and may retain or modify the DNS or, if the responsible official determines that significant adverse impacts are likely, withdraw the DNS or supporting documents. When a DNS is modified, the lead agency shall send the modified DNS to agencies with jurisdiction.

C.1. The responsible official shall withdraw a DNS if:

a. There are substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts;

b. There is significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts; or

c. The DNS was procured by misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure; if such DNS resulted from the actions of an applicant, any subsequent environmental checklist on the proposal shall be prepared directly by the lead agency or its consultant at the expense of the applicant.

2. Subdivision 1b of this subsection shall not apply when a nonexempt license has been issued on a private project.

3. If the responsible official withdraws a DNS, the agency shall make a new threshold determination and notify other agencies with jurisdiction of the withdrawal and new threshold determination. If a DS is issued, each agency with jurisdiction shall commence action to suspend, modify, or revoke any approvals until the necessary environmental review has occurred. (Ord. 918 § 8, 1993: Ord. 622 § 11, 1984).


14.04.110 Mitigated DNS.

The purpose of this section is to allow clarifications or changes to a proposal prior to making the threshold determination.

A. In making threshold determinations, an agency may consider mitigation measures that the agency or applicant will implement. 

B. After submission of an environmental checklist and prior to the lead agency’s threshold determination on a proposal, an applicant may ask the lead agency to indicate whether it is considering a DS. If the lead agency indicates a DS is likely, the applicant may clarify or change features of the proposal to mitigate the impacts which led the agency to consider a DS likely. The applicant shall revise the environmental checklist as may be necessary to describe the clarifications or changes. The lead agency shall make its threshold determination based upon the changed or clarified proposal. If a proposal continues to have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, even with mitigation measures, an EIS shall be prepared.

C. Whether or not an applicant requests early notice under subsection B, if the lead agency specified mitigation measures on an applicant’s proposal that would allow it to issue a DNS, and the proposal is clarified, changed, or conditioned to include those measures, the lead agency shall issue a DNS.

D. Environmental documents need not be revised and resubmitted if the clarifications or changes are stated in writing in documents that are attachments to, or incorporate by reference, the documents previously submitted. An addendum may be used.

E. Agencies may clarify or change features of their own proposal, and may specify mitigation measures in their DNSs, as a result of comments by other agencies or the public or as a result of additional agency planning.

F. An agency’s indication under this section that a DS appears likely shall not be construed as a determination of significance. Likewise, the preliminary discussion or clarifications or changes to a proposal shall not bind the lead agency to a mitigated DNS.

G. Agencies may specify procedures for enforcement of mitigation measures in their agency SEPA procedures. (Ord. 622 § 12, 1984).


14.04.120 Determination of significance (DS) – Initiation of scoping.

A. If the responsible official determines that a proposal may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, the responsible official shall prepare and issue a determination of significance (DS). The DS shall describe the main elements of the proposal, the location of the site, if a site-specific proposal, and the main areas the lead agency has identified for discussion in the EIS. A copy of the environmental checklist may be attached.

B. The responsible official shall put the DS in the lead agency’s file and shall commence scoping by circulating copies of the DS to the applicant, agencies with jurisdiction and expertise, if any, affected tribes, and to the public. Notice shall be given under NBMC 14.04.250. The lead agency is not required to scope if the agency is adopting another environmental document for the EIS or is preparing a supplemental EIS.

C. If at any time after the issuance of a DS a proposal is changed so, in the judgment of the lead agency, there are no probable significant adverse environmental impacts, the DS shall be withdrawn and a DNS issued instead. The DNS shall be sent to all who commented on the DS. A proposal shall not be considered changed until all license applications for the proposal are revised to conform to the changes or other binding commitments made by agencies or by applicants. (Ord. 918 §§ 9, 10, 1993; Ord. 622 § 13, 1984).


14.04.130 Effect of threshold determination.

A. When the responsible official makes a threshold determination, it is final and binding on all agencies, subject to the other provisions of this chapter.

B. The responsible official’s threshold determination:

1. For proposals listed in NBMC 14.04.100B, shall not be final until fifteen (15) days after issuance;

2. Shall not apply if another agency with jurisdiction assumes lead agency status;

3. Shall not apply when withdrawn by the responsible official under Sections 14.04.100 or 14.04.120;

C. Regardless of any appeals, a DS or DNS issued by the responsible official may be considered final for purposes of other agencies’ planning and decision-making unless subsequently changed, reversed, or withdrawn. (Ord. 918 § 11, 1993: Ord. 622 § 14, 1984).


14.04.140 Purpose of EIS.

A. The primary purpose of an EIS is to ensure that SEPA’s policies are an integral part of the ongoing programs and actions of the city.

B. An EIS shall provide impartial discussion of significant environmental impacts and shall inform decision-makers and the public of reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures, that would avoid or minimize adverse impacts or enhance environmental quality.

C. Environmental impact statements shall be concise, clear, and to the point, and shall be supported by the necessary environmental analysis. The purpose of an EIS is best served by short documents containing summaries of, or reference to, technical data and by avoiding excessively detailed and overly technical information. The volume of an EIS does not bear on its adequacy. Large documents may even hinder the decision-making process.

D. The EIS process enables government agencies and interested citizens to review and comment on proposed government actions, including government approval of private projects and their environmental effects. This process is intended to assist the agencies and applicants to improve their plans and decisions, and to encourage the resolution of potential concerns or problems prior to issuing a final statement. An environmental impact statement is more than a disclosure document. It shall be used by agency officials in conjunction with other relevant materials and considerations to plan actions and make decisions. (Ord. 622 § 15, 1984).


14.04.150 Preparation of EIS.

Environmental impact statements shall be prepared as follows:

A. Environmental impact statements shall be readable reports, which allow the reader to understand the most significant and vital information concerning the proposed action, alternatives, and impacts, without turning to other documents.

B. EISs need analyze only the reasonable alternatives and probable adverse environmental impacts that are significant. Beneficial environmental impacts or other impacts may be discussed.

C. The level of detail shall be commensurate with the importance of the impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or referenced.

D. Discussion of insignificant impacts is not required; if included, such discussion shall be brief and limited to summarizing impacts or noting why more study is not warranted.

E. Description of the existing environment and the nature of environmental impacts shall be limited to the affected environment and shall be no longer than is necessary to understand the environmental consequences of the alternatives, including the proposal.

F. EISs shall be no longer than necessary to comply with this chapter. Length should relate first to potential environmental problems and then to the size or complexity of the alternatives, including the proposal.

G. The basic features and analysis of the proposal, alternatives, and impacts shall be discussed in the EIS and shall be generally understood without turning to other documents; however, an EIS is not required to include all information conceivably relevant to a proposal, and may be supplemented by appendices, reports, or other documents in the agency’s record.

H. Agencies shall prepare EISs concurrently with and coordinated with environmental studies and related surveys that may be required for the proposal under other laws, when feasible.

I. The range of alternative courses of action discussed in EISs shall encompass those to be considered by the decisionmaker.

J. EISs shall serve as the means of assessing the environmental impact of proposed agency action, rather than justifying decisions already made. (Ord. 622 § 16, 1984).


14.04.160 EIS types.

A. Draft and final environmental impact statements (EISs) shall be prepared; draft and final supplemental EISs may be prepared.

B. A draft EIS (DEIS) allows the lead agency to consult with members of the public, affected tribes, and agencies with jurisdiction and with expertise. The lead agency shall issue a DEIS and consider comments received thereon.

C. A final EIS (FEIS) shall revise the DEIS as appropriate and respond to comments received thereon. An FEIS shall respond to opposing views in significant adverse environmental impacts and reasonable alternatives which the head agency determines were not adequately discussed in the DEIS.

D. A supplemental EIS (SEIS) shall be prepared as an addition to either a draft or final statement if:

1. There are substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts; or

2. There is significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal’s probably significant adverse environmental impacts. (Ord. 622 § 17, 1984).


14.04.170 EIS timing.

The lead agency shall commence preparation of the environmental impact statement as close as possible to the time the agency is developing or is presented with a proposal, so that preparation can be completed in time for the final statement to be included in appropriate recommendations or reports on the proposal. The statement shall be prepared early enough so it can serve practically as an important contribution to the decision-making process and will not be used to rationalize or justify decisions already made. EISs may be phased in appropriate situations. (Ord. 622 § 18, 1984).


14.04.180 Scoping.

A. The lead agency shall narrow the scope of every EIS to the probable significant adverse impacts and reasonable alternatives, including mitigation measures. For example, if there are only two or three significant impacts or alternatives, the EIS shall be focused on those.

B. To ensure that every EIS is concise and addresses the significant environmental issues, the lead agency shall:

1. Invite agency, affected tribes, and public comment of the DS. If the agency requires written comments, agencies, affected tribes and the public shall be allowed twenty-one (21) days from the date of issuance of the DS in which to comment, unless expanded scoping is used. The date of issuance for a DS is the date it is sent to the Department of Ecology and other agencies with jurisdiction, and is publicly available;

2. Identify reasonable alternatives and probable significant adverse environmental impacts;

3. Eliminate from detailed study those impacts that are not significant;

4. Work with other agencies to identify and integrate environmental studies required for other government approvals with the EIS, where feasible.

C. Agencies, affected tribes, and the public should comment promptly and as specifically as permitted by the details available on the proposal.

D. Meetings or scoping documents, including notices that the scope has been revised, may be used but are not required. The lead agency shall integrate the scoping process with its existing planning and decision-making process in order to avoid duplication and delay.

E. The lead agency shall revise the scope of an EIS if substantial changes are made later in the proposal, or if significant new circumstances or information arise that bear on the proposal and its significant impacts.

F. DEIS shall be prepared according to the scope decided upon by the lead agency in its scoping process.

G. EIS preparation may begin during scoping.

H. The lead agency may, on a proposal by proposal basis use such other methods as it finds helpful. (Ord. 622 § 19, 1984).


14.04.190 EIS preparation.

A. Preparation of the EIS is the responsibility of the city, by or under the direction of its responsible official. No matter who participates in the preparation of the EIS, it is the EIS of the city. The responsible official, prior to distributing an EIS, shall be satisfied that it complies with this chapter.

B. The DEIS and FEIS or draft and final SEIS shall be prepared by the city staff, the applicant, or by a consultant selected by the city or the applicant. If the responsible official requires an EIS for a proposal and determines that someone other than the city will prepare the EIS, the responsible official shall notify the applicant immediately after completion of the threshold determination. The responsible official shall also notify the applicant of the city’s procedure for EIS preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution. The responsible official shall direct areas of research and examination to be undertaken as a result of the scoping process, as well as the organization of the resulting document.

C. If a person other than the lead agency is preparing the EIS, the lead agency shall:

1. Coordinate any scoping procedures so that the individual preparing the EIS receives all substantive information submitted by any agency or person;

2. Assist in obtaining any information on file with another agency that is needed by the person preparing the EIS;

3. Allow any party preparing an EIS access to all public records of the lead agency that relate to the subject of the EIS, under RCW Chapter 42.16 (Public Disclosure and Public Records Law).

D. The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not required to supply information that is not required under this chapter or that is being requested from another agency, unless the same is information that the city may lawfully request under another ordinance or statute. (Ord. 918 §§ 12, 13, 1993; Ord. 622 § 20, 1984).


14.04.200 EIS contents.

An EIS shall contain the following:

A. A cover letter shall precede every EIS but shall not be considered part of the EIS for adequacy purposes. The cover letter shall highlight the key environmental issues and options facing decision-makers and shall include beneficial as well as adverse environmental impacts and shall identify, for SEIS, the EIS being supplemented.

B. Fact Sheet. The fact sheet shall include the following information in this order:

1. A title and brief description (a few sentences) of the nature and location (by street address, if applicable) of the proposal, including principal alternatives;

2. The name of the person or entity making the proposal(s) and the proposed or tentative date for implementation;

3. The name and address of the lead agency, the responsible official, and the person to contact for questions, comments, and information;

4. A list of all licenses which the proposal is known to require. The licenses shall be listed by name and agency; the list shall be as complete and specific as possible;

5. Authors and principal contributors to the EIS and the nature or subject area of their contributions;

6. The date of issue of the EIS;

7. The date comments are due (for DEISs);

8. The time and place of public hearings or meetings, if any and if known;

9. The date final action is planned or scheduled by the lead agency, if known. Agencies may indicate that the date is subject to change. The nature or type of final agency action should be stated unless covered in subsection A of this section;

10. The type and timing of any subsequent environmental review to which the lead agency or other agencies have made commitments, if any;

11. The location of a prior EIS on the proposal, EIS technical reports, background data, adopted documents, and materials incorporated by reference for this EIS, if any;

12. The cost to the public for a copy of the EIS.

C. Table of Contents.

1. The table of contents should list, if possible, any documents which are appended, adopted, or serve as technical reports for this EIS, but need not list each comment letter.

2. The table of contents may include the list of elements of the environment, indicating those elements or portions of elements which do not involve significant impacts.

D. Summary. The EIS shall summarize the contents of the statement and shall not merely be an expanded table of contents. The summary shall briefly state the proposal’s objectives, specifying the purpose and need to which the proposal is responding, the major conclusions, significant areas of controversy and uncertainty, if any, and the issues to be resolved, including the environmental choices to be made among alternative courses of action and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. The summary need not mention every subject discussed in the EIS, but shall include a summary of the proposal, impacts, alternatives, mitigation measures, and significant adverse impacts that cannot be mitigated. The summary shall state when the EIS is part of a phased review, if known, or the lead agency is relying on prior or future environmental review (which should be generally identified). The lead agency shall make the summary sufficiently broad to be useful to the other agencies with jurisdiction.

E. Alternatives Including the Proposed Action.

1. This section of the EIS describes and presents the proposal (or preferred alternative, if one or more exists) and alternative courses of action.

2. Reasonable alternatives shall include actions that could feasibly attain or approximate a proposal’s objectives, but at a lower environmental cost or decreased level of environmental degradation.

a. The word “reasonable” is intended to limit the number and range of alternatives, as well as the amount of detailed analysis for each alternative.

b. The “no-action” alternative shall be evaluated and compared to other alternatives.

c. Reasonable alternatives may be those over which an agency with jurisdiction has authority to control impacts either directly, or indirectly through requirement of mitigation measures.

3. This section of the EIS shall:

a. Describe the objective(s), proponent(s), and principal features of reasonable alternatives. Include the proposed action, including mitigation measures that are part of the proposal;

b. Describe the location of the alternatives including the proposed action, so that a lay person can understand it. Include a map, street address, if any, and legal description (unless long or in metes and bounds);

c. Identify any phases of the proposal, their timing, and previous or future environmental analysis on this or related proposals, if known;

d. Tailor the level of detail of descriptions to the significance of environmental impacts. The lead agency should retain any detailed engineering drawings and technical data, that have been submitted, in agency files and make them available on request;

e. Devote sufficiently detailed analysis to each reasonable alternative to permit a comparative evaluation of the alternatives including the proposed action. The amount of space devoted to each alternative may vary. One alternative (including the proposed action) may be used as a benchmark for comparing alternatives. The EIS may indicate the main reasons for eliminating alternatives from detailed study.

f. Present a comparison of the environmental impacts of the reasonable alternatives, and include the no action alternative. Although graphics may be helpful, a matrix or chart is not required. A range of alternatives or a few representative alternatives, rather than every possible reasonable variation, may be discussed.

g. Discuss the benefits and disadvantages of reserving for some future time the implementation of the proposal, as compared with possible approval at this time. The agency perspective should be that each generation is, in effect, a trustee of the environment for succeeding generations. Particular attention should be given to the possibility of foreclosing future options by implementing the proposal.

4. When a proposal is for a private project on a specific site, the lead agency shall be required to evaluate only the no action alternative plus other reasonable alternatives for achieving the proposal’s objective on the same site. This subsection shall not apply when the proposal includes a rezone, unless the rezone is for a use allowed in an existing comprehensive plan that was adopted after review under SEPA. Further, alternative sites may be evaluated if other locations for the type of proposed use have not been included or considered in existing planning or zoning documents.

F. Affected Environment, Significant Impacts, and Mitigation Measures.

1. This section of the EIS shall describe the existing environment that will be affected by the proposal, analyze significant impacts of alternatives including the proposed action, and discuss reasonable mitigation measures that would significantly mitigate these impacts. Elements of the environment that are not significantly affected need not be discussed. Separate sections are not required for each subject.

2. General requirements for this section of the EIS:

a. This section shall be written in a nontechnical manner which is easily understandable to lay persons whenever possible, with the discussion commensurate with the importance of the impacts. Only significant impacts must be discussed; other impacts may be discussed.

b. Although the lead agency should discuss the affected environment, environmental impacts, and other mitigation measures together for each element of the environment where there is a significant impact, the responsible official shall have the flexibility to organize this section in any manner useful to decision-makers and the public.

c. This subsection is not intended to duplicate the analysis in subsection E of this section and shall avoid doing so to the fullest extent possible.

3. This section of the EIS shall:

a. Succinctly describe the principal features of the environment that would be affected, or created, by the alternatives including the proposal under consideration. Inventories of species should be avoided, although rare, threatened, or endangered species should be indicated;

b. Describe and discuss significant impacts that will narrow the range or degree of beneficial uses of the environment or pose long-term risks to human health or the environment, such as storage, handling, or disposal of toxic or hazardous material;

c. Clearly indicate those mitigation measures (not described in the previous section as part of the proposal or alternatives), if any, that could be implemented or might be required, as well as those, if any, that agencies or applicants are committed to implement;

d. Indicate what the intended environmental benefits of mitigation measures are for significant impacts, and may discuss their technical feasibility and economic practicability, if there is concern about whether a mitigation measure is capable of being accomplished. The EIS need not analyze mitigation measures in detail unless they involve substantial changes to the proposal causing significant adverse impacts, or new information regarding impacts, and those measures will not be subsequently analyzed under SEPA. An EIS may briefly mention nonsignificant impacts or mitigation measures to satisfy other environmental review laws or requirements covered in the same documents.

e. Summarize significant adverse impacts that cannot or will not be mitigated.

4. This section shall incorporate, when appropriate:

a. A summary of existing plans (for example: land use and shoreline plans) and zoning regulations applicable to the proposal, and how the proposal is consistent and inconsistent with them;

b. Energy requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures, including more efficient use of energy, such as insulating, as well as the use of alternate and renewable energy resources;

c. Natural or depletable resource requirements and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures;

d. Urban quality, historic and cultural resources, and the design of the built environment, including the reuse and conservation potential of various alternatives and mitigation measures.

5. Significant impacts on both the natural environment and the built environment must be analyzed, if relevant. This involves impacts upon and the quality of the physical surroundings, whether they are in wild, rural, or urban areas. Discussion of significant impacts shall include the cost of and effects on public services, such as utilities, roads, fire, and police protection, that may result from a proposal. EISs shall also discuss significant environmental impacts upon land and shoreline use, which includes housing, physical blight, and significant impacts of projected population on environmental resources, as specified by RCW 43.21C.110(1) (d) and (f) as listed in NBMC 14.04.020.

G. Appendices. Comment letters and responses shall be circulated with the FEIS. Technical reports and supporting documents need not be circulated with an EIS, but shall be readily available to agencies and the public during the comment period.

H. The lead agency may include, in an EIS or appendix, the analysis of any impact relevant to the agency’s decision, whether or not environmental. The inclusion of such analysis may be based upon comments received during the scoping process. The provision for combining documents may be used. The EIS shall comply with the format requirements of this part. The decision whether to include such information and the adequacy of any such additional analysis shall not be used in determining whether an EIS meets the requirements of SEPA. (Ord. 622 § 21, 1984).


14.04.210 Contents of EIS on nonproject proposals.

A. The lead agency shall have more flexibility in preparing EISs on nonproject proposals, because there is normally less detailed information available on their environmental impacts and on any subsequent project proposals. The EIS may be combined with other planning documents.

B. The lead agency shall discuss impacts and alternatives in the level of detail appropriate to the scope of the nonproject proposal and to the level of planning for the proposal. Alternatives should be emphasized. In particular, agencies are encouraged to describe the proposal in terms of alternative means of accomplishing a stated objective. Alternatives including the proposed action should be analyzed at a roughly comparable level of detail, sufficient to evaluate their comparative merits (this does not require devoting the same number of pages in an EIS to each alternative).

C. If the nonproject proposal concerns a specific geographic area, site-specific analyses are not required, but may be included for areas of specific concern. The EIS should identify subsequent actions that would be undertaken by other agencies as a result of the nonproject proposal, such as transportation and utility systems.

D. The EIS’s discussion of alternatives for a comprehensive plan, community plan, or other area-wide zoning or for shoreline or land use plans shall be limited to a general discussion of the impacts of alternate proposals for policies contained in such plans, for land use or shoreline designations, and for implementation measures. The lead agency is not required under SEPA to examine all conceivable policies, designations, or implementation measures but should cover a range of such topics. The EIS content may be limited to a discussion of alternatives which have been formally proposed or which are, while not formally proposed, reasonably related to the proposed action. (Ord. 622 § 22, 1984).


14.04.220 EIS contents when prior nonproject EIS.

A. The provisions for phased review and use of existing environmental documents apply to EISs on nonproject proposals.

B. A nonproject proposal may be approved based on an EIS assessing its broad impacts. When a project is then proposed that is consistent with the approved nonproject action, the EIS on such a project shall focus on the impacts and alternatives including mitigation measures specific to the subsequent project and not analyzed in the nonproject EIS. The scope shall be limited accordingly. Procedures for use of existing documents shall be used as appropriate.

C. When preparing a project EIS under the preceding subsection, the lead agency shall review the nonproject EIS to ensure that the analysis is valid when applied to the current proposal, knowledge, and technology. If it is not valid, the analysis shall be reanalyzed in the project EIS. (Ord. 622 § 23, 1984).


14.04.230 Issuance of DEIS.

A. A draft EIS shall be issued by the responsible official and sent to the following:

1. The Department of Ecology (two copies);

2. Each federal agency with jurisdiction over the proposal;

3. Each agency with jurisdiction over or environmental expertise on the proposal;

4. Each city in which adverse environmental impacts identified in the EIS may occur, if the proposal were implemented;

5. Each local agency or political subdivision whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal;

6. The applicable local, area-wide, or regional agency, if any, that has been designated under federal law to conduct intergovernmental review and coordinate federal activities with state or local planning;

7. Any person requesting a copy of the EIS from the lead agency;

8. Any affected tribe.

B. The date of issue is the date the DEIS is publicly available and sent to the Department of Ecology and other agencies with jurisdiction.

C. Any person or agency shall have thirty (30) days from the date of issue in which to review and comment upon the DEIS.

D. Upon request, the lead agency may grant an extension of up to fifteen (15) days to the comment period. Agencies and the public must request any extension before the end of the comment period. (Ord. 622 § 24, 1984).


14.04.240 Issuance of FEIS.

A. A final EIS (FEIS) shall be issued by the responsible official and sent to the Department of Ecology (two copies), to all agencies with jurisdiction, to all agencies who commented on the DEIS, and to anyone requesting a copy of the FEIS.

B. The responsible official shall send the FEIS, or a notice that the FEIS is available, to anyone who commented on the DEIS and to those who received but did not comment on the DEIS. If the agency receives petitions from a specific group or organization, a notice or EIS may be sent to the group and not to each petitioner. Failure to notify any individual under this subsection shall not affect the legal validity of any agency’s SEPA compliance.

C. The lead agency should make additional copies available in its offices for review.

D. The date of issue is the date the FEIS, or notice of availability, is sent to the persons and agencies specified in the preceding subsections and the FEIS is publicly available. Copies sent to the Department of Ecology shall satisfy the statutory requirement of availability to the Governor and to the ecological commission.

E. Agencies shall not act on a proposal for which an EIS has been required prior to seven (7) days after issuance of the FEIS.

F. The lead agency shall issue the FEIS within sixty (60) days of the end of the comment period for the DEIS, unless the proposal is unusually large in scope, the environmental impact associated with the proposal is unusually complex, or extensive modifications are required to respond to public comments. (Ord. 622 § 25, 1984).


14.04.250 Public notice.

A. Whenever the city issues a DNS or DS, the city shall give notice as follows:

1. Posting the property, for site-specific proposals;

2. Notifying public or private groups which have expressed interest in a certain proposal or in the type of proposal being considered;

3. Notifying the news media; and

4. Posting the declaration on the official posting places for the city.

B. When the city issues a DS, the city shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS and in the public notice.

C. When the city issues a DEIS, or a SEIS, notice of the availability of those documents shall be given by:

1. Indicating the availability of the DEIS in any public notice required for a nonexempt license;

2. Posting the property for site-specific proposals;

3. Notifying the news media;

4. Notifying public or private groups which have expressed interest in a certain proposal or in the type of proposal being considered; and

5. By posting the notice on the city’s official posting places.

D. The city may require an applicant to complete the public notice requirements for the applicant’s proposal at his or her expense. The responsible official may require additional methods to be used in order to assure adequate public notice on a proposal by proposal basis. (Ord. 918 § 14, 1993; Ord. 622 § 26, 1984).


14.04.260 Public hearings.

A. A public hearing shall be held no earlier than fifteen (15) days from the date a draft EIS is issued, nor later than fifty (50) days from its issuance. Notice of said hearing shall be given as required under the public notice section of this chapter.

B. A public hearing may be required for any aspect of the environmental consideration process if, in the discretion of the city administrator, in his sole discretion, determines that a public hearing would assist in meeting his responsibility to implement the purposes and policies of this chapter.

C. Informal public meetings or workshops may be held. Such gatherings may be more flexible than public hearings. (Ord. 622 § 27, 1984).


14.04.270 Effect of no comment.

A. Consulted Agencies. If a consulted agency does not respond with written comments within the time periods for commenting on environmental documents, the lead agency may assume that the consulted agency has no information relating to the potential impact of the proposal as it relates to the consulted agency’s jurisdiction or special expertise. Any consulted agency that fails to submit substantive information to the lead agency in response to a draft EIS is thereafter barred from alleging any defects in the lead agency’s compliance with the requirements relating to the preparation of a DEIS/EIS.

B. Other Agencies and the Public. Lack of comment by other agencies or members of the public on environmental documents, within the time periods specified by these rules, shall be construed as lack of objection to the environmental analysis, if the requirements of NBMC 14.04.250 are met. (Ord. 622 § 28, 1984).


14.04.280 Specificity of comments.

A. Comments on an EIS, DNS, scoping notice or proposal shall be as specific as possible and may address either the adequacy of the environmental document or the merits of the alternatives discussed or both.

B. Commenters shall briefly describe the nature of any documents referenced in their comments, indicating the material’s relevance, and should indicate where the material can be reviewed or obtained.

C. Methodology. When an agency criticizes a lead agency’s predictive methodology, the commenting agency should describe, when possible, the alternative methodology which it prefers and why.

D. Additional Information. A consulted agency shall specify in its comments whether it needs additional information to fulfill other applicable environmental reviews or consultation requirements and what information it needs, to the extent permitted by the details available on the proposal.

E. Mitigation Measures. When an agency with jurisdiction objects to or expresses concerns about a proposal, it shall specify the mitigation measures, if any are possible, it considers necessary to allow an agency to grant or approve applicable licenses.

F. Comments by Other Agencies. Commenting agencies that are not consulted agencies shall specify any additional information or mitigation measures the commenting agency believes are necessary or desirable to satisfy its concerns.

G. Citizen Comments. Recognizing their generally more limited resources, members of the public shall make their comments as specific as possible and are encouraged to comment on methodology needed, additional information, and mitigation measures in the manner indicated in this section.

H. An agency shall consider and may respond to comments as the agency deems appropriate; the requirements for responding in a FEIS shall be met. (Ord. 622 § 29, 1984).


14.04.290 FEIS response to comments.

A. The lead agency shall prepare a final environmental impact statement whenever a DEIS has been prepared, unless the proposal is withdrawn or indefinitely postponed. The lead agency shall respond by one or more of the means listed below, including its response in the final statement. Possible responses are to:

1. Modify alternatives including the proposed action;

2. Develop and evaluate alternatives not previously given detailed consideration by the agency;

3. Supplement, improve, or modify the analysis;

4. Make factual corrections;

5. Explain why the comments do not warrant further agency response, citing the sources, authorities, or reasons that support the agency’s response and, if appropriate, indicate those circumstances that would trigger agency reappraisal or further response.

B. All substantive comments received on the draft statement shall be appended to the final statement or summarized where comments are repetitive or voluminous, and the summary appended. If a summary of the comments is used, the names of the commenters shall be included (except for petitions).

C. In carrying out subsection A of this section, the lead agency may respond to each comment individually, respond to a group of comments, cross-reference comments and corresponding changes in the EIS, or use other reasonable means to indicate an appropriate response to comments.

D. If the lead agency does not receive any comments critical of the scope or content of the DEIS, the lead agency may so state in an updated fact sheet which shall be circulated as required for the issuance of a DEIS. The FEIS shall consist of the DEIS and updated fact sheet.

E. If changes in response to comments are minor and are largely confined to the responses described in subsection A 4 and 5 of this section, agencies may prepare and attach an addendum, which shall consist of the comments, the responses, the changes, and an updated fact sheet. The FEIS, consisting of the DEIS and the addendum, shall be issued in the same manner as an FEIS, except only the addendum need be sent to anyone who received the DEIS. (Ord. 622 § 30, 1984).


14.04.300 Preparation of written comments in response to consultation.

The city administrator shall be responsible for preparation of written comments for the city in response to a consultation request prior to a threshold determination, participation in scoping, and reviewing a DEIS. (Ord. 622 § 31, 1984).


14.04.310 Existing environmental documents – Use.

A. An agency may use environmental documents that have previously been prepared in order to evaluate proposed actions, alternatives, or environmental impacts. The proposals may be the same as, or different than, those analyzed in the existing documents.

B. Other agencies acting on the same proposal shall use an environmental document unchanged, except in the following cases:

1. For DNSs, an agency with jurisdiction is dissatisfied with the DNS, in which case it may assure lead agency status;

2. For DNSs and EISs, preparation of a new threshold determination or supplemental EIS is required if there are:

a. Substantial changes to a proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, or lack of significant adverse impacts, if a DS is being withdrawn, or

b. New information indicating a proposal’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts. This includes discovery of misrepresentation or lack of material disclosure. A new threshold determination or SEIS is not required if probable significant adverse environmental impacts are covered by the range of alternatives and impacts analyzed in the existing environmental documents;

3. For EISs, the agency concludes that its written comments on the DEIS warrant additional discussion for purposes of its action than that found in the lead agency’s FEIS (in which case the agency may prepare a supplemental EIS at its own expense).

C. Existing documents may be used for a proposal by employing one or more of the following methods:

1. “Adoption,” where an agency may use all or part of an existing environmental document to meet its responsibilities under SEPA. Agencies acting on the same proposal for which an environmental document was prepared are not required to adopt the document; or

2. “Incorporation by reference,” where an agency preparing an environmental document includes all or part of an existing document by reference;

3. An addendum, that adds analyses or information about a proposal but does not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives in the existing environmental document;

4. Preparation of a SEIS if there are:

a. Substantial changes so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, or

b. New information indicating a proposal’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts;

5. If a proposal is substantially similar to one covered in an existing EIS, that EIS may be adopted; additional information may be provided in an addendum or SEIS. (Ord. 622 § 32, 1984).


14.04.320 Existing environmental documents – Adoption.

A. The agency adopting an existing environmental document must independently review the content of the document and determine that it meets the adopting agency’s environmental review standards and needs for the proposal. However a document is not required to meet the adopting agency’s own procedures for the preparation of environmental documents (such as circulation, commenting, and hearing requirements) to be adopted.

B. An agency shall adopt an environmental document by identifying the document and stating why it is being adopted, using the adoption form supplied by the city. The adopting agency shall ensure that the adopted document is readily available to agencies and the public by:

1. Sending a copy to agencies with jurisdiction that have not received the document, as shown by the distribution list for the adopted document; and

2. Placing copies in libraries and other public offices, or by distributing copies to those who request one.

C. When an existing EIS is adopted and:

1. A supplemental environmental impact statement or addendum is not being prepared, the agency shall circulate its statement of adoption as follows:

a. The agency shall send copies of the adoption notice to the Department of Ecology, to agencies with jurisdiction, to cities in which the proposal will be implemented, and to local agencies or political subdivisions whose public services would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal.

b. The agency is encouraged to send the adoption notice to persons or organizations that have expressed an interest in the proposal or are known by the agency to have an interest in the type of proposal being considered, or the lead agency should announce the adoption in agency newsletters or through other means.

c. No action shall be taken on the proposal until seven (7) days after the statement of adoption has been issued. The date of issuance shall be the date the statement of adoption has been sent to the Department of Ecology and other agencies and is publicly available;

2. A SEIS is being prepared, the agency shall include the statement of adoption in the SEIS; or

3. An addendum is being prepared, the agency shall include the statement of adoption with the addendum and circulate both as in subsection C1 of this section.

D. A copy of the adopted document must accompany the current proposal to the decisionmaker; the statement of adoption may be included.

E. If known, the adopting agency shall disclose in its adoption notice when the adopted document or proposal it addresses is the subject of a pending appeal or has been found inadequate on appeal. (Ord. 622 § 33, 1984).


14.04.330 Substantive authority and mitigation.

A. Any governmental action on public or private proposals that are not exempt may be conditioned or denied under SEPA to mitigate the environmental impact subject to the following limitations:

1. Mitigation measures or denials shall be based on policies, plans, rules, or regulations formally designated by the agency (or appropriate legislative body, in the case of local government) as a basis for the exercise of substantive authority and in effect when the DNS or DEIS is issued.

2. Mitigation measures shall be related to specific, adverse environmental impacts clearly identified in an environmental document on the proposal and shall be stated in writing by the decisionmaker. The decisionmaker shall cite the agency SEPA policy that is the basis for any condition or denial under this chapter (for proposals of applicants). After its decision, each agency shall make available to the public a document that states the decision. The document shall state the mitigation measures, if any, that will be implemented as part of the decision, including any monitoring of environmental impacts. Such a document may be the license itself, or may be combined with other agency documents, or may reference relevant portions of environmental documents.

3. Mitigation measures shall be reasonable and capable of being accomplished.

4. Responsibility for implementing mitigation measures may be imposed upon an applicant only to the extent attributable to the identified adverse impacts of its proposal. Voluntary additional mitigation may occur.

5. Before requiring mitigation measures, agencies shall consider whether local, state, or federal requirements and enforcements would mitigate an identified significant impact.

6. To deny a proposal under SEPA, an agency must find that:

a. The proposal would be likely to result in significant adverse environmental impacts identified in a final or supplemental environmental impact statement prepared under this chapter; and

b. Reasonable mitigation measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified impact.

B. Decisionmakers should judge whether possible mitigation measures are likely to protect or enhance environmental quality. EISs should briefly indicate the intended environmental benefits of mitigation measures for significant impacts. EISs are not required to analyze in detail the environmental impacts of mitigation measures, unless the mitigation measures:

1. Represent substantial changes in the proposal so that the proposal is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts, or involve significant new information indicating, or on, a proposal’s probable significant adverse environmental impacts; and

2. Will not be analyzed in a subsequent environmental document prior to their implementation. (Ord. 622 § 34, 1984).


14.04.340 Appeals.

As set forth in RCW 43.21C.075, when any proposal or action is conditioned or denied on the basis of an environmental determination by the city under SEPA, the environmental determination shall be appealable to superior court as part of an appeal of the underlying proposal or action. The appeal fee shall be as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. (Ord. 1237 § 10 (part), 2005: Ord. 1134 § 1, 2001: Ord. 918 § 15, 1993; Ord. 622 § 35, 1984).


14.04.350 Fees.

The city shall require fees as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance for its activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter:

A. Threshold Determination. For every environmental checklist the city will review when it is lead agency, the city shall collect the fee from the proponent of the proposal prior to undertaking the threshold determination. The time periods provided by this chapter for making a threshold determination shall not begin to run until payment of the fee. The fee shall be a minimum and the applicant shall be responsible for the payment of the actual costs incurred by the city in making the threshold determination, including, but not limited to, secretarial, engineering, legal, planning, structural and other professional services that may be needed. This amount shall be paid at the time the checklist is completed. If the actual costs exceed the initial fee, the balance shall be paid before the determination is issued. The time periods for making a determination shall be tolled until costs are paid.

B. Mitigated Declaration of Nonsignificance. If an applicant requests that pursuant to NBMC 14.04.110 the city consider the issuance of an MDNS, then the applicant shall pay an additional initial review fee at the time the request is made. The city shall then review the checklist with proposed mitigation measures, in order to determine if an MDNS would be appropriate. The fee shall be a minimum and the applicant shall be responsible for the payment of the actual costs incurred by the city in reviewing the proposed mitigation measures, including, but not limited to, secretarial, engineering, legal, planning, structural and other professional services that may be needed. If the actual costs exceed the initial fee, the balance shall be paid before the determination is issued. The time periods for making a determination shall be tolled until the costs are paid.

C. Environmental Impact Statement.

1. When the city is the lead agency for a proposal requiring an EIS, the city may charge and collect supplemental fees to compensate for additional review, processing and publication costs associated with the preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS). Supplemental fees shall be based on an hourly charge for time spent by city employees in the review, preparation, supervision of preparation and/or distribution of an EIS. The supplemental EIS review fee for city employees is established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule referenced above. The supplemental EIS review fee for engineering and legal shall be the actual hourly rate charged by the city consultants. Supplemental fees shall also include all costs, if any, for experts not employed by the city, including engineering and legal, and for texts, printing or other actual costs required for the preparation and distribution of the EIS. In no case shall supplemental fees be charged for review of the completed EIS by city officials’ part of the decision-making process or for existing studies or general information already in city files. Supplemental fees shall be collected at regular intervals as the preparation of the EIS proceeds, provided a deposit shall be collected prior to commencement of EIS preparation to cover initial costs. Any unexpended balance shall be refunded.

C. Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC, commonly referred to as “critical area regulations,” shall apply concurrently with review under Chapter 14.04 RCW, State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), and Chapter 14.20 RCW, Shoreline Management Act (SMA), if applicable.

D. Compliance with the provisions of these chapters does not constitute compliance with other local, state, or federal regulations and permit requirements.

E. Critical Areas Map Series as referenced in Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC are hereby adopted as critical areas inventory maps to support identification of potential critical areas and shall be on file with the city and subject to updating from time to time. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to:

A. Protect the public health, safety, and welfare by preventing adverse impacts of development;

B. Protect the public, and public resources and facilities, from injury, loss of life, property damage, or financial loss due to flooding, erosion, landslides, soils subsidence, or steep slope failure;

C. Implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city of North Bend comprehensive plan and Chapter 36.70A RCW, the Growth Management Act;

D. Preserve and protect critical areas while allowing for the reasonable use of private property. Preservation and protection shall be provided by regulating development within and adjacent to critical areas and ensuring adequate mitigation for allowable impacts consistent with best available science and mitigation sequencing, as described in NBMC 14.05.250;

E. Protect existing wetlands and maintain no net loss of their functions and values;

14.05.050 Designation of critical areas.

A. The city has designated critical areas by defining their characteristics. An applicant shall determine, and the city shall verify, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the definitions in NBMC 14.05.040, whether a critical area exists and is regulated under this chapter, or whether a critical area is on or in close proximity to the subject property. Critical areas may also require a setback or buffer pursuant to Chapters 14.06, 14.09, and 14.11 NBMC.

B. The city has prepared a series of critical area inventory maps which show approximate boundaries for the following critical areas within the city limits: special flood hazard areas; channel migration zone; critical aquifer recharge areas; wetlands; erosion/debris flows; and streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas. Critical areas have been determined by local studies, King County published geographic information system (GIS) data, and information provided by other federal or state agencies. These maps provide only approximate boundaries of known features and are not adequate substitutes for more detailed maps and/or studies that could identify alternative locations of known features or additional critical area features not illustrated on the maps. Copies of the maps are available for viewing at the city’s community and economic development department.

C. The city maps and data indicate where some critical areas may exist or do exist based on previous studies completed. These resources may not identify all critical areas and should only be used as a guide. Actual field observations shall supersede information in these resources. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.060 Applicability.

A. The provisions of this title shall apply to all lands, all land uses, and all structures and facilities in the city, whether or not a permit or authorization is required, and shall apply to every person, firm, partnership, corporation, group, governmental agency, or other entity that owns, leases, or has other interest in land within the city. No person, company, agency, or applicant shall alter a critical area or buffer except as consistent with the purpose and requirements of this title.

B. The city shall not approve any development permit or otherwise issue any authorization to alter the condition of any land, water, or vegetation, or to construct or alter any structure or improvement in, over, or on a critical area or associated buffer, without first assuring compliance with the requirements of this title.

C. Critical areas review shall be required if a proposed development would occur within a potential critical area and/or associated buffer, and shall generally be required if a proposed development would occur within an area adjacent to an identified wetland, stream, or landslide hazard area located on an adjoining property.

D. Approval of a permit or development proposal pursuant to the provisions of this title does not discharge the obligation of an applicant to comply with other provisions of the NBMC. Types of development permits and approvals are set forth in Chapter 20.01 NBMC.

E. Compliance with the provisions of this title does not constitute compliance with other federal, state, and local regulations and permit requirements. An applicant is responsible for complying with these requirements, in addition to the process established in this title. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.070 Preapplication conference.

When an applicant knows or suspects that critical areas are located on or near the subject property, the applicant is required, as set forth in Chapter 20.02 NBMC, to contact the city prior to finalizing development plans and applying for development permits. Early disclosure of critical areas will reduce delays during the permit review process. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.080 Submittal requirements.

In addition to the information required for a development permit, any entity undertaking development activity that is subject to the provisions of the critical area regulations may be required to submit a critical area report as described in NBMC 14.05.240 and/or a floodplain habitat assessment pursuant to NBMC 14.12.210; provided, that these additional requirements shall not apply to exceptions in NBMC 14.05.140. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.090 Financial assurance.

A. Mitigation Performance Assurance.

1. Prior to issuance of any permit or approval that authorizes site disturbance under the provisions of this title, the city shall require the applicant to submit mitigation performance assurance to guarantee that all work or actions required by this title are satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved plans, specifications, permit or approval conditions, and applicable regulations, and to assure that all work or actions not satisfactorily completed will be corrected to comply with approved plans, specifications, requirements, and regulations to eliminate hazardous conditions, to restore environmental damage or degradation, and to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public. Projects outside wetlands, streams, steep slopes, or erosion soil areas and their buffers shall be exempt from a bond or performance security under this title.

2. The city shall require the applicant to post a mitigation performance assurance in a form and amount acceptable to the city for completion of any work required to comply with this title at the start of construction. The mitigation performance assurance shall be in the amount of 150 percent of the estimated cost of the completed action.

3. The mitigation performance assurance shall be in the form of a security bond, performance bond, assignment of savings account, or an irrevocable letter of credit guaranteed by an acceptable financial institution with terms and conditions acceptable to the city. This may be combined with other performance bonds for the project as otherwise required by the NBMC and/or the North Bend public works standards, at the discretion of the director.

4. For projects (e.g., compensatory storage) outside of a wetland or stream buffer, security shall be released upon completion and city acceptance of the work. The bond may be held for longer periods upon written finding by the city that it is necessary to continue to hold the bond to ensure the mitigation project has met all elements of the approved mitigation plan.

B. Mitigation Maintenance Assurance.

1. If a development proposal is subject to mitigation, the applicant shall post a mitigation maintenance assurance in a form and amount deemed acceptable by the city to cover long-term monitoring, maintenance, and performance for mitigation projects, and to ensure mitigation is fully functional for the duration of the monitoring period. The mitigation maintenance assurance shall be in place prior to the release of the mitigation performance assurance set forth in subsection A of this section.

2. The mitigation maintenance assurance shall be in the amount of 20 percent of the estimated cost of the completed action.

3. Bonds or other security authorized for mitigation shall remain in effect until the city determines, in writing, that the bonded standards have been met. Bonds or other security for required mitigation projects shall be held by the city for a minimum of five years to ensure that the mitigation project has been fully implemented and demonstrated to function.

C. Depletion, failure, or collection of bond funds shall not discharge the obligation of an applicant or violator to complete required mitigation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration.

D. Any failure to satisfy critical area requirements established by law or condition including, but not limited to, the failure to provide a monitoring report within 30 days after it is due or to comply with other provisions of an approved mitigation plan shall constitute a default, and the city may demand payment of any financial guarantees or initiate code compliance pursuant to Chapter 1.20 NBMC.

E. Any funds recovered pursuant to this section shall be used to complete the required mitigation. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.100 Inspection and enforcement.

A. The applicant consents to entry upon the site by the director or his/her designee during regular business hours for the purposes of making reasonable inspections to verify information provided by the applicant and to verify that work is being performed in accordance with the approved plans and permits and requirements of this title.

B. When a critical area or its buffer has been altered in violation of this title, the director may order that all ongoing development work shall stop and that the critical area be restored. Consistent with Chapters 1.20 and 19.10 NBMC, the director shall have the authority to issue a stop work order to cease all ongoing development work, and order restoration, rehabilitation, and/or replacement measures at the owner’s or other responsible party’s expense to compensate for violation of the provisions of this title. The director may require work to remain stopped until approval of a restoration plan. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.110 Costs.

All costs associated with an applicant’s critical area review and processing, and other services provided by the city for critical areas review, shall be paid for by the applicant and processed pursuant to NBMC 20.09.040. Unless otherwise indicated in this title, the applicant shall be responsible for the initiation, preparation, submission, and expense of all required reports, assessments, studies, plans, reconnaissance, or other work prepared in support of or necessary for the application. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.120 Appeals.

Appeals of administrative decisions shall be governed by Chapter 20.06 NBMC. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.130 General exemptions.

The following development, activities, and associated uses shall be exempt from the provisions of this title, provided they are consistent with the provisions of other local, state, and federal laws and regulations:

A. Emergencies.

1. Emergencies are those instances that threaten public health, safety, welfare, or risk of damage to private or public property, and that require remedial or preventative action in a time frame too short to allow for review of compliance with the requirements of this title. The director shall be notified of the emergency action within 48 hours;

2. Emergency responses must have the least possible impact on critical areas and/or their buffers;

3. Within one year after an emergency, the person or agency undertaking the emergency response action may be required by the director to fully restore and/or mitigate any impacts to critical areas and/or their buffers resulting from the emergency in accordance with an approved critical area report and mitigation plan, prepared in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter, for a new development permit. Restoration and/or mitigation activities shall be initiated within 90 days of the date of the emergency; and

4. Restoration may be waived by resolution of the city council in the case of natural emergencies where a state of emergency has been declared by the mayor pursuant to the city’s emergency management plan;

B. Passive recreation, including, but not limited to, hiking, fishing, river rafting, and wildlife viewing that does not involve the construction of trails;

C. Operation, maintenance, or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees, or drainage systems that do not require construction permits, including existing platted tracts, if the activity does not further alter or increase the impact to, or encroach further into, the critical area or buffer and there is no increased risk to life or property as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance, or repair. Operation and maintenance also includes normal maintenance of vegetation in existence prior to the city’s aerial photographs taken April 3, 2004, in accordance with best management practices; provided, that such management actions are part of regular and ongoing maintenance, do not expand further into the critical area, are not the result of an expansion of the structure or utility, and do not directly impact an endangered or threatened species. Properties within the floodplain, critical aquifer recharge area, or seismic liquefaction area, and located outside of other critical areas, are exempted from the maintenance area expansion restriction of this subsection;

D. Ongoing maintenance can take place in native growth protection easements (NGPE) or tracts; provided only state-listed invasive and noxious weeds and additional aggressive nonnative species identified in NBMC 14.05.140(A)(2)(e) shall be removed or cut, hand removal is the only method utilized, and no mechanical or chemical activities are employed. Maintenance shall minimize disturbance to the critical area and/or buffer, shall not involve the use of hazardous substances, and shall be associated with subsequent enhancement, restoration, or ongoing maintenance activities. All removed plant material shall be taken away from the site and appropriately disposed of; and

E. Existing and ongoing agriculture as defined in Chapter 18.06 NBMC. Such activities shall not allow critical areas or their buffers that are not currently under agricultural use to be converted to agricultural use. Normal and routine maintenance of existing irrigation and drainage ditches, reservoirs, and ponds that do not meet the criteria for being considered a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area shall be exempt. Agricultural activities shall not be considered ongoing when the use has become nonconforming as defined in NBMC 14.05.160. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.140 Exceptions.

Except as prohibited in Chapter 14.20 NBMC the following are exceptions from the provisions of this chapter when applicable criteria, performance standards, and approvals are met:

A. Administrative Exceptions.

1. An applicant shall submit a written request for exception from the director that describes the proposed activity and exception that applies.

2. The director shall review the exception requested to verify that the proposed activity complies with Chapters 14.05 through 14.20 NBMC and shall approve or deny the exception. Exceptions that may be requested include:

a. Determination of nonconforming status pursuant to NBMC 14.05.160;

b. Operation, maintenance, or repair of existing structures, infrastructure improvements, existing utilities, public or private roads, dikes, levees, or drainage systems, if the activity does not increase impacts to the critical area functions and values as a result of the proposed operation, maintenance or repair;

c. Activities within an improved right-of-way. Activities within an improved right-of-way include the replacement, modification, installation or construction of utility facilities, lines, pipes, mains, streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, equipment or appurtenances, not including substations, when such facilities are located within the improved portion of the public right-of-way or a city-authorized private roadway, except those activities that alter a wetland or watercourse, such as new culverts or bridges, or result in the transport of sediment, subject to the following:

i. The activity shall result in the least possible impact and have no practical alternative with less impact on the critical area and/or its buffer;

ii. An additional, contiguous, and undisturbed critical area buffer shall be provided, equal in area to the disturbed critical area buffer; and

iii. Retention and replanting of native vegetation shall occur wherever possible along the right-of-way improvement and resulting disturbance;

d. Minor Utility Projects. Minor utility projects are those utility projects that have minor or short-term impacts to critical areas, as determined by the director in accordance with the criteria below, and that do not significantly impact the functions and values of a critical area(s), such as the placement of a utility pole, anchor, vault, or other small component of a utility facility; provided, that such projects are constructed with best management practices and additional restoration measures are provided. Minor activities shall not interrupt the transport of sediment. Such exceptions shall meet the following criteria:

i. There is no practical alternative to the proposed activity with less adverse impacts on critical areas and all attempts have been made first to avoid impacts, next to minimize impacts, and lastly to mitigate unavoidable impacts;

ii. The activity will not change or diminish the overall critical area hydrology or flood storage capacity;

iii. The minor utility project shall be designed and constructed to prevent spills and leaks into critical areas;

iv. To the maximum extent practicable, utility corridor access for maintenance is at limited access points into the critical area buffer rather than by a parallel access road; and

v. The site shall be revegetated to at least its former condition;

e. Nonexempt vegetation removal activities, including enhancement and restoration activities. Removal of invasive and noxious weeds that appear on the lists maintained by the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board and King County noxious weed control board, and additional aggressive nonnative species including Japanese knotweed, scotch broom, English ivy, Himalayan blackberry, and evergreen blackberry, and enhancement and restoration activities for the purpose of restoring functions and values of critical area(s) that do not require construction permits, shall be encouraged by individual property owners. These projects shall use approved, limited-spectrum, water-safe herbicides, hand labor, and light equipment that minimize disturbance to the critical area and buffer. Nonexempt vegetation removal and enhancement and restoration activities in wetlands, streams, and wildlife habitat areas and their buffers shall be coordinated with the director to ensure revegetation of the site with native planting that will preserve or enhance the functions and values of the critical area and/or its buffer; and

f. Hazardous tree removal; provided, that the hazard is documented by a qualified professional consistent with the requirements of Chapter 19.10 NBMC; and provided, that the responsible party removing the hazardous tree(s) replaces any trees that are removed with new trees at a ratio of three replacements for each tree removed (3:1). Replacement trees shall be located within critical areas and buffers, and shall be species that are native and indigenous to the site, and shall be a minimum of five-gallon container plant material size.

B. Public Agency or Utility Exception. If the application of this title would prohibit a development proposal by a public agency or public utility that is essential to its ability to provide service, the agency or utility may apply for an exception pursuant to this subsection. After holding a public hearing pursuant to Chapter 20.03 NBMC, the hearing examiner may approve the exception if the hearing examiner finds that:

1. There is no other practical alternative to the proposed development with less impact on the critical areas, based on the demonstration by the applicant of the following factors:

a. The applicant has considered all reasonably possible construction techniques based on available technology that are feasible for the proposed project and eliminated any that would result in unreasonable risk of impact to the critical area; and

b. The applicant has considered all available sites and alignments within the range of potential sites and alignments that meet the project purpose and for which operating rights are available; and

2. The proposal minimizes and mitigates unavoidable impacts to critical areas and/or critical area buffers.

C. Reasonable Use. If the application of this title would deny all reasonable use of the property, the applicant may apply for an exception pursuant to this section. After holding a public hearing pursuant to Chapter 20.03 NBMC, the hearing examiner may approve the exception if the hearing examiner finds that:

1. The critical area regulations would otherwise deny all reasonable use of the property;

2. There is no other reasonable use consistent with the underlying zoning of the property that has less adverse impact on the critical area and/or associated buffer;

3. The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare on or off the property;

4. Any alteration to critical areas is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property;

5. The inability of the applicant to derive reasonable use of the property is not the result of actions by the applicant after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or its predecessor;

6. Impacts to critical areas will be mitigated to the greatest extent feasible to ensure no net loss of critical area functions and values, in accordance with an approved mitigation plan; and

7. For residences within a residentially zoned area, reasonable use of the property will be granted on the basis of a finding of consistency with the minimum reasonable use for such a residence as defined by the lesser of (a) 40 percent of the area of the lot, or (b) 2,550 square feet. Included in the total allowed area for a residence is:

a. The area of the first floor of the residence;

b. The area of any covered or uncovered decks or patios proposed, and any lawn areas proposed;

c. The area of roof overhangs greater than two feet;

d. The area of any living space or decks on any floor other than the first floor that extend beyond the walls of the first floor unless its area is already included in subsection (C)(7)(b) or (c) of this section; and

e. The area of any accessory structure.

The area should be the same as the area covered by structures and lawn as seen in a birds-eye view of the site looking directly down, with the exceptions of not counting the roof overhangs of not more than two feet. Application of this provision does not allow wetlands, streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas, geologically hazardous areas, or their buffers to be converted to residential landscaping.

D. Farm Plan. A farm plan exception may be used on public open space lands designated for farm use in an adopted master plan, on lands that meet the definition of “agricultural land” in NBMC 18.06.030, or for existing and ongoing agricultural activities. A farm plan shall implement USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Field Office Technical Guide Best Management Practices and a qualified professional shall address potential impacts to critical areas from livestock, nutrients, farm chemicals, soil erosion, and sediment control and agricultural drainage infrastructure. The King County conservation district and the city must approve a written farm plan.

E. Mitigation Required. Any authorized alteration to a wetland or stream and other fish and wildlife habitat area or its associated buffer, as approved under subsection B or C of this section, shall be subject to conditions established by the city and shall require mitigation under an approved mitigation plan pursuant to NBMC 14.05.260. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.150 Variance.

Where avoidance of the impact to wetlands, streams, and other fish and wildlife habitat areas, geologically hazardous areas, and critical aquifer recharge areas is not possible consistent with requirements of Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC, and the proposal does not qualify for any other type of exception, a variance shall be obtained to permit the impact. The applicant for the variance shall provide a site plan and description for city review and written analysis consistent with the following requirements:

A. Variance Site Plan and Written Analysis. An applicant seeking a variance shall submit the following in support of his/her request for a variance:

1. The date the applicant acquired or leased the property and the applicable zoning in effect at that time;

2. A map of all critical areas on or adjacent to the subject property;

3. A map demonstrating zoning setbacks per NBMC;

4. A written explanation of the impact on functions and values of critical areas that will result from the proposal, including removal of large trees and existing vegetation;

5. A map showing the location of septic drainfields and reserve areas, if applicable;

6. A written explanation of the opportunity for mitigation to minimize or eliminate the adverse impacts of the proposed variance;

7. An alternative site plan and written analysis of the proposal demonstrating the practicable alternative with the least impact on the critical area and buffer;

8. A written explanation of why such variance is necessary, due to special circumstances and/or conditions relating to the size, shape, topography, critical areas, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with those relative rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located. The phrase “relative rights and privileges” is used to ensure that the property rights and privileges for the subject property are considered primarily in relation to current city land use regulations;

9. A written demonstration that the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property, neighborhood, or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the subject property is situated;

10. A demonstration that the proposed variance is the minimum necessary to provide relief to the applicant, as provided in the NBMC; and

11. Any other information determined by the director or his/her designee to be reasonably necessary to analyze the proposal. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.160 Nonconforming uses and structures.

This section establishes the terms and conditions for continuing nonconforming uses, structures and lots near or in critical areas which were lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. For those areas not subject to critical area regulation, Chapter 18.30 NBMC applies.

A. Establishing Status.

1. A legally established nonconforming lot, use, or structure may be continued, transferred, conveyed, and/or used as if conforming.

2. The burden of establishing that any nonconforming lot, use, or structure lawfully existed as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter shall, in all cases, rest with the owner and/or applicant and not with the city.

3. A nonconforming lot, use, or structure may be deemed legally nonconforming by providing documentation that the use in question occurred prior to the CAO in 1993, or was permitted prior to the effective date of the latest critical area amendments from one of the following:

a. A local agency permit;

b. An orthophoto, aerial photo or planimetric mapping recognized as legitimate by the agency; or

c. Tax records.

B. Maintenance and Repair of Nonconforming Structures. Normal maintenance and incidental repair of legal nonconforming structures shall be permitted; provided, that:

1. The maintenance shall not increase the degree of nonconformity; and

2. The cumulative cost of such maintenance or repair within any 180-day period shall not exceed 50 percent of the assessed valuation of such building, structure, or land (as applicable) at the time such maintenance is completed.

C. Reconstruction or Replacement. Reconstruction, restoration, remodeling, or repair of a legal nonconforming structure damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, falling trees or limbs, or other disasters shall be permitted except where prohibited or conditioned in NBMC 14.12.170 and 14.12.180; provided, that such reconstruction shall not result in the expansion of the nonconforming structure into or towards the critical area or its buffer, or in a manner that increases the potential impact to the critical area, or causes risk of harm to public safety. Legal nonconforming status will be lost if a building permit is not secured within one year of the date damage occurred. See applicable critical area performance standards, such as NBMC 14.12.200, for structures in a floodway.

D. Expansion of Nonconforming Use or Structure. Within a critical area or its buffer, no legal nonconforming use or structure may be expanded, enlarged, extended, or intensified in any way (including extension of hours of operation) unless such modification is in full compliance with this title or the terms and conditions of approved permits pursuant to this title, or is allowed as provided below, or is considered an exception as provided in NBMC 14.05.140. Approved expansions must be consistent with the standards of the zoning code in which the building, structure, or land use lies and with limitations set forth in NBMC 14.12.170 and 14.12.180. In no case shall any prohibited uses as designated under NBMC 18.10.030 be permitted to enlarge or expand. The following legal nonconforming expansions or uses are allowed:

1. Vegetation management, including landscaping or gardening revisions on lawfully established and maintained portions of a critical area or its buffer;

2. Fences, decks, and accessory structures that are exempt from a building permit can be established or expanded on lawfully established and maintained portions of a critical area or its buffer without demonstrating full compliance with the requirements of this title;

3. Building modifications or additions that are not considered substantial improvements; and

4. Single-family residential building permits are exempt from the requirements of the critical area regulations when the development proposal involves any of the above activities and:

a. Structural modifications to or replacement of an existing single-family residential structure with a new residential structure where construction and associated disturbance do not increase the footprint of any existing structure;

b. The structure is not located closer to the critical area; and

c. The existing impervious surface within the critical area or buffer is not expanded.

E. Discontinuance of Nonconforming Use or Structure. All legal nonconforming uses shall be encouraged to convert to a conforming use whenever possible. Conformance shall be required when:

1. A change of use is proposed;

2. The use is terminated or discontinued for more than one year, or the structure(s) that houses the use is vacated for more than one year; or

3. The structure(s) or activity that occurs on the land in which the use is conducted is proposed for relocation. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.170 Administrative rules.

The community and economic development department shall have the authority to adopt administrative rules not inconsistent with this chapter as necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.180 Building setback line (BSBL).

A building setback line (BSBL) is established to reduce conflict with hazardous trees and vegetation buffers, to enhance wildfire safety, and to prevent construction intrusions into certain buffer areas. A minimum BSBL of 15 feet is required from the edge of any stream and other fish and wildlife habitat area buffer, wetland buffer, or erosion and landslide buffer. The setback shall be identified on the site plan, which is filed as an attachment to the notice on title required by NBMC 14.05.200. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.190 Land segregation.

Subdivisions, short subdivisions, boundary line adjustments, and planned residential developments of land in critical areas and associated buffers are subject to the following:

A. Land that is wholly within a wetland or stream critical area or associated buffer may not be subdivided except as approved under a reasonable use exception;

B. Land that is partially within a wetland or stream critical area or associated buffer area may be subdivided or the boundary line adjusted; provided, that an accessible and contiguous portion of each new or adjusted lot is:

1. Located outside the critical area and buffer; and

2. Large enough to accommodate the intended use; and

C. Accessory roads and utilities may be permitted within the wetland or stream critical area and associated buffer only if the director determines that no other feasible alternative exists and an exception is approved as provided in NBMC 14.05.140. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.200 Notice on title.

A. Purpose. To inform subsequent purchasers of real property of existing critical areas excluding soil liquefaction, Category II critical aquifer recharge areas, and floodplains outside of the floodway or channel migration zone. The owner of any real property containing an existing critical area or buffer on which a development proposal is submitted and approved shall file a notice on title with the records division of King County.

1. The notice shall run with the property and state the following:

a. The presence of the critical area or buffer on the property;

b. That the use of the property is subject to the provisions of this chapter, or subsequent provisions related thereto; and

c. That limitations on actions in or adjacent to the critical area and buffer may exist.

2. Exceptions to notice on title:

a. Where the work on existing structures or uses is not a substantial improvement to the existing structure or use and does not increase the area of impact to the critical area or its buffer;

b. Activities within a recorded easement or right-of-way; or

c. Where the area has been or will be placed in a critical area tract.

B. A notice on title shall not be required for a development proposal by a public agency or public or private utility:

1. Within a recorded easement or right-of-way;

2. Where the agency or utility has been adjudicated the right to an easement or right-of-way; or

3. Where the area has been or will be placed in a critical area tract.

C. The applicant shall submit proof that the notice has been filed for public record prior to issuance of a permit as specified in Chapter 18.38 NBMC. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.210 Native growth protection easements.

A. As part of the implementation of approved development applications and alterations, critical areas and their buffers (except soil liquefaction seismic hazard areas, floodplains including floodways, and Category II critical aquifer recharge areas) shall remain undeveloped and shall be designated as native growth protection easements (NGPE). The city may waive NGPE designation requirements for utility projects where there will be limited or no ongoing operation impact to the adjacent critical area following construction.

B. The native growth protection easement (NGPE) is an easement granted to the city for the protection of a critical area and/or its associated buffer. NGPEs shall be required as specified in these rules and shall be recorded on final development permits and all documents of title and with the county recorder at the applicant’s expense. The required language is as follows:

Dedication of a Native Growth Protection Easement (NGPE) conveys to the public a beneficial interest in the land within the easement. This interest includes the preservation of existing vegetation for all purposes that benefit the public health, safety, and welfare, including control of surface water and erosion, maintenance of slope stability, visual and aural buffering, and protection of plant and animal habitat. The NGPE imposes upon all present and future owners and occupiers of land subject to the easement the obligation, enforceable on behalf of the public of the city of North Bend, to leave undisturbed all trees and other vegetation within the easement. The vegetation in the easement may not be cut, pruned, covered by fill, removed, or damaged without express written permission from the city of North Bend.

C. When the subject development is a formal subdivision, short subdivision (short plat), binding site plan, contract rezone, master site plan, site plan/design review, or planned residential development (PRD), the critical area and its buffers shall be placed in a critical area tract and designated as an NGPE, as described below.

D. In addition to the requirements specified in subsections A through C of this section, the following shall also apply for streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas:

1. An NGPE shall be designated for Type S, F and N streams, unless the director has waived the NGPE requirements for Type N streams (see below). Where a stream or its buffer has been altered on the site prior to approval of the development proposal, as a result of the development proposal, the area altered shall be restored using native plants and materials. The restoration work shall be done pursuant to an approved mitigation plan.

2. Public and private trails (e.g., for educational purposes) may be allowed within all critical area buffers where it can be demonstrated in a critical area report that the buffer functions and values will not be degraded by trail construction or use. Trail planning, construction, and maintenance shall adhere to the criteria set forth in NBMC 14.06.030. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.220 Critical area tracts.

A. Critical area tracts are legally created nonbuildable land areas containing critical areas and their buffers that shall remain undeveloped pursuant to the critical area regulations. Separate critical area tracts are not an integral part of the lot in which they are created; are not intended for sale, lease, or transfer; and shall be incorporated in the area of the parent lot for purposes of subdivision and method of allocation and minimum lot size. The following development proposals shall identify such areas as separate tracts:

1. Subdivisions;

2. Short subdivisions;

3. Planned residential developments;

4. Contract rezones;

5. Binding site improvement plans; and

6. Master site plans.

B. Responsibility for maintaining tracts shall be held by a homeowners’ association, adjacent lot owners (in an undivided interest), the permit applicant or designee, or other appropriate entity as approved by the city.

C. The following note shall appear on the face of all plats, PRDs, binding site improvement plans, master site plans, site plan/design review, or contract rezones and shall be recorded on the title for all affected lots:

Note: All lots adjoining separate tracts identified as native growth protection easements are jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance and protection of the tracts. Maintenance includes ensuring that no alteration occurs within the separate tract and that vegetation remains undisturbed unless the express written permission of the city of North Bend has been received.

(Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.230 Marking and/or fencing.

A. Temporary Markers. The outer perimeter of a wetland, stream, and other fish and wildlife habitat area, steep slope, associated buffer, and the limits of these areas to be disturbed pursuant to an approved permit or authorization, shall be marked in the field in a manner approved by the city to notify and protect the buffer. Markers and/or fencing are subject to inspection by the director or his/her designee prior to the commencement of permitted activities. This temporary marking shall be maintained throughout construction and shall not be removed until authorized by the director, or until permanent signs and/or fencing, if required, are in place.

B. Permanent Markers. Following the implementation of an approved development plan or alteration, the outer perimeter of the critical area or buffer that is not disturbed shall be permanently identified. This identification shall include permanent wood or metal signs on treated wood or metal posts. Signs shall be worded as follows:

CRITICAL AREA BOUNDARY

Protection of this natural area is in your care. Alteration or disturbance is prohibited. Please call the city of North Bend for more information. Removal of this sign is prohibited.

The director shall approve sign locations during review of the development proposal. Along residential boundaries, the signs shall be at least four inches by six inches in size and spaced one per centerline of lot or every 75 feet for lots whose boundaries exceed 150 feet. At road endings, crossings, and other areas where public access to the critical area is allowed, the sign shall be a minimum of 18 inches by 24 inches in size and spaced one every 75 feet.

C. Permanent Fencing. The director shall require permanent fencing where the development proposal creates a substantial likelihood of intrusion into the critical area. Permanent fencing shall be required around a wetland, stream, or buffer when domestic grazing animals are present or may be introduced. Fencing shall be designed so as to not interfere with species migration, including fish runs, and shall be constructed in a manner that minimizes impacts to the wetland and associated habitat. The director shall also require such fencing when, subsequent to approval of the development proposal, other intrusions threaten conservation of critical areas. The director may use any appropriate enforcement actions including, but not limited to, fines, abatement, or permit denial to ensure compliance. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.240 Critical area reports/studies.

A. Timing of Studies. When an applicant submits an application for any development proposal, it shall indicate whether any critical area or buffers are located on or could be adjacent to the site. The presence of critical areas may require additional studies and time for review. However, disclosure of critical areas early will reduce delays during the permit review process. If the applicant discloses that there are no known critical areas, further studies may be required for verification.

B. Studies Required.

1. When sufficient information to evaluate a proposal is not available, the director shall notify the applicant that a critical area study and report is required.

2. If a critical area report is required, the director may retain independent qualified professionals, at the applicant’s expense, to assist in review of studies that are outside the range of staff expertise.

3. A qualified professional, as defined in NBMC 14.05.040, shall prepare critical area reports. A critical area report shall include all information required pursuant to subsection C of this section. A monitoring and maintenance program shall be required to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigating measures.

4. Studies generated as part of an expanded State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) environmental checklist or an environmental impact statement may qualify as a critical area report if the project is developed in enough detail to have provided an evaluation of site-specific impacts and mitigation measures.

C. General Critical Area Report Requirements.

1. A critical area report shall have three components: (a) a site analysis; (b) an impact analysis; and (c) proposed mitigation measures. More or less detail may be required for each component depending on the size, severity, and potential impacts of the project. The director may waive the requirement of any component when adequate information is otherwise available.

2. In addition to the specific requirements for each critical area as set forth in Chapters 14.06 through 14.12 NBMC, all studies shall contain, at a minimum, the following information unless it is already available in the permit application:

a. Description of local, state, and federal regulations and permit requirements;

b. A site map displaying all of the following features:

i. All critical areas;

ii. Critical area buffers;

iii. Standard and proposed buffer widths (if different);

iv. Existing and proposed easements, rights-of-way, trail corridors, and structures;

v. Reference streets and property lines;

vi. The proposed development(s);

vii. Any areas to be cleared or altered; and

viii. The topography of the site;

c. Written report details, including the following:

i. A copy of the site plan for the development proposal, including a description of the proposed stormwater management plan for the development and consideration of impacts to drainage alterations;

ii. The dates, names, and qualifications of the persons preparing the report and documentation of any fieldwork performed on the site (including methodology and techniques);

iii. Identification and characterization of all critical areas and buffers adjacent to the proposed project area;

iv. A description of the proposal, including, but not limited to, descriptions of filling, dredging, modification for stormwater detention or discharge, clearing, grading, restoring, enhancing, grazing, or other physical activities that change the existing vegetation, hydrology, soils, or habitat;

v. An assessment of the probable cumulative impacts to critical areas resulting from development of the site;

vi. A description of reasonable efforts to apply a mitigation sequencing approach to avoid, minimize, and mitigate impacts to critical areas;

vii. Plans for any proposed mitigation measures, as needed, to offset any impacts, in accordance with mitigation plan requirements set forth in NBMC 14.05.260, including but not limited to:

A. The impacts of any proposed development within or adjacent to a critical area or buffer on the critical area; and

B. The impacts of any proposed alteration of a critical area or buffer on the development proposal, other properties and the environment;

viii. A discussion of performance standards applicable to the critical area and proposed activity; and

ix. Financial guarantees to ensure compliance. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.250 General mitigation requirements.

This section provides general mitigation requirements applicable to alteration of critical areas. Additional mitigation requirements specific to each type of critical area are set forth in Chapters 14.06 through 14.12 NBMC.

A. Mitigation Sequencing. Consistent with WAC 197-11-768, protection of critical areas shall observe the following sequence, unless part of a restoration plan for a significantly degraded wetland or stream buffer:

1. Avoid impacts by refraining from certain actions or parts of an action;

2. Where impacts to critical areas and/or their buffers cannot be avoided, the applicant shall demonstrate that the criteria for granting a variance or other applicable exception as set forth in NBMC 14.05.130 through 14.05.150 are met;

3. Minimize impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action, by using affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts, or by using appropriate technology;

4. Rectify impacts by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment;

5. Reduce or eliminate impacts over time by preservation and maintenance operations;

6. Compensate for impacts by creating, replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

7. Monitor impacts and take appropriate corrective measures.

B. The buffer for a created, restored, or enhanced critical area proposed as compensation for approved alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the category of the created, restored, or enhanced critical area. For the purposes of restoration, creation, or enhancement, buffers shall be fully vegetated and shall not include lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas. Mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbances and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development, or when seasonally appropriate. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, and water quality.

C. Restoration/rehabilitation is required when a critical area or its buffers have been altered on a site in violation of city regulations prior to development approval, and as a consequence its functions and values have been degraded. Restoration is also required when the alteration occurs in violation of city regulations during the construction of an approved development proposal. At a minimum, all impacted areas shall be restored to their previous condition pursuant to an approved mitigation plan.

D. Reestablishment/rehabilitation is required when the critical area or its buffers will be temporarily altered during the construction of an approved development proposal. At a minimum, all impacted areas shall be restored to their previous condition pursuant to an approved mitigation plan.

E. Compensatory Mitigation. The goal of compensation is no net loss of critical area and/or buffer functions on a development site. Compensation includes creation, restoration (or reestablishment, rehabilitation), enhancement, and preservation of the critical area or its buffer depending on the scope of the approved alteration and what is needed to maintain or improve the critical area and/or buffer functions. Compensation for approved critical area or buffer alterations shall meet the following minimum performance standards and shall occur pursuant to an approved mitigation plan:

1. The buffer for a created, restored, or enhanced critical area proposed as compensation for approved alterations shall be the same as the buffer required for the existing critical area. For the purposes of restoration, creation, or enhancement, buffers shall be fully vegetated and shall not include lawns, walkways, driveways, and other mowed or paved areas.

2. Mitigation Location Preference. Where on-site mitigation opportunities that result in enhancement of critical areas resources within the city are feasible, on-site approaches should be implemented. The director may facilitate and approve alternate mitigation projects based on considerations of best available science. Consistent with the following priorities for mitigation location preference, alternate mitigation strategies may be approved by the director only where on-site approaches are documented as not feasible.

a. On Site and In Kind. Except where shown to be infeasible and consistent with the standards of this section, all critical area impacts shall be compensated for through restoration or creation of replacement areas that are in kind, on site, and of similar or better critical area category. Mitigation shall be timed prior to or concurrent with the approved alteration and shall have a high probability of success.

b. Off Site and In Kind. The director may consider and approve off-site compensation where the applicant demonstrates that greater biological and hydrological functions and values will be achieved than through on-site mitigation. The preferred location for off-site mitigation is within city limits, although off-site locations within the surrounding upper Snoqualmie River Valley may be approved. The compensation ratios specified under the “on-site” compensation section for each critical area shall apply for off-site compensation as well. The director may request contractual linkage to the off-site parcel to ensure its availability and landowner willingness. Use of a city approved mitigation receiving site could include either of the following approaches; provided, that either off-site mitigation approach meets all state and federal permit requirements:

i. Developers may contribute payment towards an identified city mitigation project with approval from the director; or

ii. Developers may design and implement off-site mitigation at the approved mitigation receiving site with approval from the director.

c. Advance mitigation, in-lieu fee programs, or mitigation banking are examples of alternative mitigation approaches allowed under the provisions of this section if it is demonstrated that all of the following circumstances exist:

i. There are no reasonable opportunities for on-site or off-site mitigation within the city or upper Snoqualmie River Valley;

ii. The off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved critical areas functions than the altered critical area, and there is a clear potential for success of the proposed mitigation at the identified mitigation site; and

iii. Credits from an approved (state-certified) wetland mitigation bank are used as compensation, and the use of credits is consistent with the terms of the approved bank instrument; or, fees are paid to an approved in-lieu fee program to compensate for the impacts.

3. Increased Replacement Ratios. The director may increase the replacement ratios under the following circumstances:

a. Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed restoration or creation due to an unproven methodology or proponent; or

b. A significant period of one year or more will elapse between impact and replication of wetland functions; or

c. The impact was unauthorized.

4. Decreased Replacement Ratios. The director may decrease the replacement ratios required in the “on-site” ratios specified under the compensation section of each critical area when all of the following criteria are met:

a. A minimum replacement ratio of 1.5:1 will be maintained;

b. Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions have a very high rate of success;

c. Documentation by a qualified professional demonstrates that the proposed mitigation actions will provide functions and values that are significantly greater than the critical area being impacted; and

d. The proposed mitigation actions are conducted in advance of any anticipated impact and have been shown to be successful.

5. Critical Areas Enhancement as Mitigation.

a. Impacts to wetland and stream functions may be mitigated by enhancement of existing significantly degraded areas. Applicants proposing to use enhancement must produce a critical area report that identifies how enhancement will increase the functions of the degraded resource and how this increase will adequately mitigate for the loss of critical area and its function at the impact site. An enhancement proposal must also show whether existing critical area functions will be reduced by the enhancement actions.

b. For wetlands, minimum mitigation ratios for enhancement are provided in subsection G of this section. Proposals for enhancement in combination with other forms of mitigation shall implement mitigation ratios consistent with Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011, or as revised, or may determine mitigation requirements using Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington, Department of Ecology, Publication No. 10-06-011, or as revised.

F. Mitigation shall be completed immediately following disturbances and prior to use or occupancy of the activity or development, or as soon as seasonally appropriate. Construction of mitigation projects shall be timed to reduce impacts to existing fisheries, wildlife, water quality, and vegetation.

G. Wetland Mitigation Requirements. In addition to the requirements in subsections A through F of this section, the following mitigation measures to minimize and reduce wetland impacts are required:

1. No net loss of wetland functions and values shall occur as a result of the overall project.

2. Mitigation shall achieve equivalent or greater biological functions. Mitigation plans shall be consistent with the Wetland Mitigation in Washington State – Part 2: Developing Mitigation Plans – Version 1 (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011b, or as revised) and Selecting Wetland Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach, Western Washington (Ecology Publication No. 09-06-32).

3. Approaches to Compensatory Mitigation. Mitigation for lost or diminished wetland and buffer functions shall rely on the following approaches:

a. Permittee-Responsible Mitigation. With this approach, the permittee performs the mitigation after the permit is issued and is ultimately responsible for implementation and success of the mitigation. Permittee-responsible mitigation shall occur at the site of the permitted alteration. Alternative mitigation strategies may be implemented only where on-site approaches are documented as not feasible. If available, city-owned or approved mitigation receiving sites within the city or upper Snoqualmie River Valley should be used as a first preference for off-site mitigation actions.

b. Wetland Mitigation Banks. Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the mitigation bank instrument. Use of credits from a wetland mitigation bank certified under Chapter 173-700 WAC is allowed if:

i. The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that there are no feasible mitigation opportunities within the city and within the upper Snoqualmie River Valley that would provide adequate compensation for proposed impacts, consistent with subsection E of this section;

ii. The director determines that it would provide appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts;

iii. The impact site is located in the service area of the bank;

iv. The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the certified mitigation bank instrument; and

v. Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits are consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified mitigation bank instrument.

c. In-Lieu-Fee Mitigation. Credits from an approved in-lieu-fee program may be used when all of the following apply:

i. The applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that there are no feasible mitigation opportunities within the city and within the upper Snoqualmie River Valley that would provide adequate compensation for proposed impacts, consistent with subsection E of this section;

ii. The director determines that it would provide environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts;

iii. The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and conditions of the approved in-lieu-fee program instrument;

iv. Projects using in-lieu-fee credits shall have debits associated with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant’s qualified wetland professional using the credit assessment method specified in the approved instrument for the in-lieu-fee program; and

v. The impacts are located within the service area specified in the approved in-lieu-fee instrument.

4. Preference of Mitigation Actions. Compensatory wetland and buffer mitigation shall occur in the following order of preference.

a. Restoration. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former or degraded wetland. For the purpose of tracking net gains in wetland acres, restoration is divided into:

i. Reestablishment. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of returning natural or historic functions to a former wetland. Reestablishment results in a gain in wetland acres (and functions). Examples of such activities could include removing fill material, plugging ditches, breaking drain tiles, and the like; and

ii. Rehabilitation. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site with the goal of repairing natural or historic functions of a degraded wetland. Rehabilitation results in a gain in wetland function but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Examples of such activities could involve breaching a dike to reconnect wetlands to a floodplain or returning tidal influence to a wetland, and the like.

b. Establishment (Creation). The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a site to develop a wetland on an upland or deepwater site where a wetland did not previously exist. Establishment results in a gain in wetland acres. Activities typically involve excavation of upland soils to elevations that will produce a wetland hydroperiod, create hydric soils, and support the growth of hydrophytic plant species.

i. If a site is not available for wetland restoration to compensate for expected wetland and/or buffer impacts, the director may authorize creation of a wetland and/or buffer upon demonstration by the applicant’s qualified wetland professional that:

A. The hydrology and soil conditions at the proposed mitigation site are conducive for sustaining the proposed wetland and that creation of a wetland at the site will not likely cause hydrologic problems elsewhere;

B. Adjacent land uses and site conditions do not jeopardize the viability of the proposed wetland and/or buffer (e.g., due to the presence of invasive plants or noxious weeds, stormwater runoff, noise, light, or other impacts); and

C. The proposed wetland and/or buffer will eventually be self-sustaining with little or no long-term maintenance.

c. Enhancement. The manipulation of the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a wetland site to heighten, intensify, or improve specific function(s) or to change the growth stage or composition of the vegetation present. Enhancement is undertaken for specified purposes such as water quality improvement, floodwater retention, or wildlife habitat. Enhancement results in a change in some wetland functions and can lead to a decline in other wetland functions but does not result in a gain in wetland acres. Typical activities are planting vegetation, controlling nonnative or invasive species, modifying site elevations or the proportion of open water to influence hydroperiods, or some combination of these activities. Applicants proposing to enhance wetlands and/or associated buffers shall demonstrate how the proposed enhancement will increase the wetland’s/buffer’s functions, how this increase in function will adequately compensate for the impacts, and how existing wetland functions at the mitigation site will be protected.

d. Protection/Maintenance (Preservation). Removing a threat to, or preventing the decline of, wetland conditions by an action in or near a wetland. This includes the purchase of land or easements or repairing water control structures or fences. This term also includes activities commonly associated with the term “preservation.” Preservation does not result in a gain of wetland acres. Permanent protection of a Category I or II wetland and associated buffer at risk of degradation can be used only if:

i. The director determines that the proposed preservation is the best mitigation option;

ii. The proposed preservation site is under threat of undesirable ecological change due to permitted, planned, or likely actions that will not be adequately mitigated under existing regulations;

iii. The area proposed for preservation is of high quality or critical for the health of the watershed or basin due to its location. Some of the following features may be indicative of high-quality sites:

A. Category I or II wetland rating (using the Wetland Rating System for Western Washington);

B. Rare or irreplaceable wetland type (e.g., bogs, mature forested wetlands, and estuarine wetlands) or an aquatic habitat that is rare or a limited resource in the area;

C. Presence of habitat for priority or locally important wildlife species;

D. Provides biological and/or hydrological connectivity; and

E. Priority sites in an adopted watershed plan;

iv. Permanent preservation of the wetland and buffer shall be provided through a conservation easement or tract held by an appropriate natural land resource manager, such as a land trust;

v. The director may approve other legal and administrative mechanisms in lieu of a conservation easement if it determines they are adequate to protect the site; and

vi. Ratios for preservation in combination with other forms of mitigation generally range from 10:1 to 20:1, as determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the quality of the wetlands being impacted and the quality of the wetlands being preserved. Ratios for preservation as the sole means of mitigation generally start at 20:1.

5. Wetland Mitigation Ratios.

	Category and Type of Wetland	Creation or Reestablishment	Rehabilitation	Enhancement

	Category I: Bog, Natural Heritage site	Not considered possible	Case by case	Case by case

	Category I: Mature Forested	6:1	12:1	24:1

	Category I: Based on functions	4:1	8:1	16:1

	Category II	3:1	6:1	12:1

	Category III	2:1	4:1	8:1

	Category IV	1.5:1	3:1	6:1

6. Credit/Debit Method. To more fully protect functions and values, and as an alternative to the mitigation ratios found in the joint guidance Wetland Mitigation in Washington State Parts I and II (Ecology Publication No. 06-06-011a and b, Olympia, WA, March 2006), the director may allow mitigation based on the “credit/debit” method developed by the Department of Ecology in Calculating Credits and Debits for Compensatory Mitigation in Wetlands of Western Washington: Final Report (Ecology Publication No. 10-06-011, Olympia, WA, March 2012, or as revised).

H. Streams and Other Fish and Wildlife Habitat Area Mitigation Requirements. In addition to the requirements in subsections A through F of this section, the following minimum performance standards shall be met for alterations to streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas:

1. Achieve equivalent or greater functions, including, but not limited to, habitat functions and hydrologic functions;

2. Maintain or improve stream channel dimensions, including depth, length, and gradient;

3. Restore disturbed stream buffer areas with native vegetation;

4. Create an equivalent or improved channel bed;

5. Create equivalent or improved biofiltration;

6. Replace disturbed stream and stream buffer habitat features and areas;

7. Unless it is demonstrated that a higher level of stream function would result from an alternate mitigation approach, compensatory mitigation should be either in kind and on site, or in kind and within the city or upper Snoqualmie River Valley. Mitigation actions should be conducted on site and within the upper Snoqualmie River Valley, except when:

a. There are no reasonable on-site or upper Snoqualmie River Valley opportunities in the affected stream with a high likelihood of success;

b. Off-site mitigation has a greater likelihood of providing equal or improved functions; and

c. Established watershed goals for water quality, flood conveyance, habitat, or other functions, including priorities and recommendations set forth in the WRIA 7 Salmon Conservation Plan, justify location of mitigation at another site;

8. For temporary alterations to a stream buffer permitted by administrative exception (NBMC 14.05.140(A)), altered areas shall be restored. Restoration of other on-site areas is allowable at a 1:1 ratio if desired; and

9. Consistent with mitigation location preferences located in subsection (E)(2) of this section, stream restoration or enhancement, including illegal alterations, must attain the following ratios of area of mitigation to area of alteration for stream channel impacts:

a. For mitigation on the site of the proposed impact, or within one half-mile upstream or downstream within the city limits:

i. Two to one ratio for a Type S or F stream; and

ii. One to one and one-half ratio for a Type N stream;

b. For proposed mitigation located further off site than as provided by subsection (H)(9)(a) of this section, and only when located at a city-owned or approved off-site location:

i. Three to one ratio for a Type S or F stream; and

ii. Two to one ratio for a Type N stream. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.260 Mitigation plans.

A. The scope and content of a mitigation plan shall be decided on a case-by-case basis; as the impacts to the critical area increase, the mitigation measures to offset these impacts will increase in number and complexity. The city shall determine during the review of the requested studies which of the components listed in subsection B of this section shall be required as part of the mitigation plan. Key factors in this determination shall be the size and nature of the development proposal, the nature of the impacted critical areas, and the degree of cumulative impacts on the critical area from other development proposals.

B. At a minimum, a complete mitigation plan shall include the following:

1. Baseline Information. The mitigation plan shall provide existing conditions information for both the impacted critical areas and/or buffers, and the proposed mitigation site as described in NBMC 14.05.240;

2. Environmental Goals and Objectives. The mitigation plan shall include a written report identifying environmental goals and objectives of the compensation proposed and include:

a. A description of the anticipated impacts to the critical areas, the mitigating actions proposed, and the purposes of the compensation measures, including the site selection criteria, identification of compensation goals, identification of resource functions, and dates for beginning and completing site compensation construction activities. The goals and objectives shall be related to the functions and values of the impacted critical area;

b. A description of how the project design has been modified to avoid, minimize, or reduce impacts to wetlands; and

c. A review of the best available science supporting the proposed mitigation;

3. Performance Standards. The mitigation plan shall include measurable specific criteria for evaluating whether or not the goals and objectives of the mitigation project have been successfully attained and whether or not the requirements of this title have been met. They may include water quality standards, species richness and diversity targets, habitat diversity indices, or other ecological, geological, or hydrological criteria;

4. Detailed Construction Plan. The mitigation plan shall include a detailed construction plan with written specifications and descriptions of mitigation techniques. This plan should include the proposed construction sequencing, grading and excavation details, erosion and sedimentation control features, a native planting plan, detailed site diagrams, and any other drawings appropriate to show construction techniques or the anticipated final outcome;

5. Monitoring and/or Evaluation Program. The mitigation plan shall include a program for monitoring construction of the compensation project and for assessing a completed project, as set forth in NBMC 14.05.270; and

6. Contingency Plan. The mitigation plan shall identify potential courses of action, and any corrective measures to be taken, when monitoring or evaluation indicates that projected performance standards have not been met. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.270 Monitoring.

A. The city requires long-term monitoring of development proposals, unless otherwise accepted in NBMC 14.05.090, where alteration of critical areas or their buffers are approved. Such monitoring shall be an element of the required mitigation plan and shall be required for a period necessary to establish that performance standards have been met, but generally not for a period of less than five years, with such monitoring to occur on an annual basis. Monitoring may include, but is not limited to:

1. Establishing vegetation transects or plots to track changes in plant species’ composition over time;

2. Using aerial or other photography to evaluate vegetation community response;

3. Sampling surface and groundwaters to determine pollutant loading;

4. Measuring base flow rates and stormwater runoff to model and evaluate water quantity predictions;

5. Measuring sedimentation rates;

6. Sampling fish and wildlife populations to determine habitat utilization, species abundance, and diversity; and

7. Sampling water temperatures for wetlands and streams.

B. The city may require that a qualified professional, at the direction of the director and at the applicant’s expense, monitor the proposed development site during construction and for a sufficient period of time after construction to ensure satisfactory mitigation of impacts on the critical area. The qualified professional shall monitor the proposed development site pursuant to the provisions set forth in the approved mitigation plan based on the conditions or restrictions imposed by the city and such administrative rules as the director shall prescribe. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.280 Contingencies/adaptive management.

When monitoring reveals a significant deviation from anticipated impacts or a failure of mitigation measures, the applicant shall be responsible for appropriate corrective action. Contingency plans developed as part of the original mitigation plan shall apply, but may be modified to address a specific deviation or failure. Contingency plan measures shall be subject to the monitoring requirement to the same extent as the original mitigation measures. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.290 Limited density transfer (on site).

A. Density Credit of Critical Areas.

1. An owner of property containing a critical area may be permitted to transfer the unusable density in the critical area to another portion of the same site or property that does not contain a critical area, subject to the limitations of this section.

2. Up to 25 percent of the density that could be achieved on the critical area and buffer portion of the site can be transferred to a portion of the site not containing a critical area, subject to the following:

a. The density limitation of the underlying zoning classification;

b. The minimum lot size of the underlying zoning classification may be reduced approximately 25 percent in order to accommodate the transfer in densities;

c. Applicable bulk and dimensional standards established in NBMC Table 18.10.040 shall be reviewed by the director and may be modified subject to approval of an administrative adjustment to standards (AATs) per Chapter 18.25 NBMC; and

d. The area to which density is transferred shall not be constrained by other critical areas regulations. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).


14.05.300 Transfer of development rights (off site).

The city has created a transfer of development rights voluntary program (Chapter 18.36 NBMC) to aid in the preservation of lots with critical areas. Development rights may be transferred off site so that the applicant may realize property rights from critical areas. (Ord. 1688 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019).1

Chapter 14.06 WETLAND CRITICAL AREAS1

Sections:

14.06.010    Designation.

14.06.020    Buffers.

14.06.030    Permitted alterations.


14.06.010 Designation.

Identification of wetlands and delineation of their boundaries pursuant to this chapter shall be done in accordance with the approved federal wetland delineation manual and applicable regional supplement pursuant to RCW 36.70A.175. All areas within the city meeting the wetland designation criteria in that procedure are hereby designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter.

Wetlands identified by the city and King County are shown on the map series associated with these amendments on file with the city. The map may be periodically revised by the city to add or remove areas based on additional information. The map is not a comprehensive map of all wetlands in North Bend and is to be used as a guide for the city, project applicants, and/or property owners. It is a reference and does not provide a final critical area designation.

For the purpose of categorization, wetlands shall be rated according to the Washington Department of Ecology wetland rating system, as set forth in the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029), or as revised and approved by Ecology, which contains the definitions and methods for determining whether the criteria set forth in this section are met.

A. Category I. (1) Relatively undisturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; (2) wetlands of high conservation value that are identified by scientists of the Washington Natural Heritage Program/DNR; (3) bogs; (4) mature and old-growth forested wetlands larger than one acre; (5) wetlands in coastal lagoons; (6) interdunal wetlands that score eight or nine habitat points and are larger than one acre; and (7) wetlands that perform many functions well (scoring 23 points or more). These wetlands: (1) represent unique or rare wetland types; (2) are more sensitive to disturbance than most wetlands; (3) are relatively undisturbed and contain ecological attributes that are impossible to replace within a human lifetime; or (4) provide a high level of function.

B. Category II. Category II wetlands are: (1) estuarine wetlands smaller than one acre, or disturbed estuarine wetlands larger than one acre; (2) interdunal wetlands larger than one acre or those found in a mosaic of wetlands; or (3) wetlands with a moderately high level of functions (scoring between 20 and 22 points).

C. Category III. Category III wetlands are: (1) wetlands with a moderate level of functions (scoring between 16 and 19 points); (2) can often be adequately replaced with a well-planned mitigation project; and (3) interdunal wetlands between 0.1 and one acre. Wetlands scoring between 16 and 19 points generally have been disturbed in some ways and are often less diverse or more isolated from other natural resources in the landscape than Category II wetlands.

D. Category IV. Category IV wetlands have the lowest levels of functions (scoring fewer than 16 points) and are often heavily disturbed. These are wetlands that potentially could be replaced, or in some cases improved, although not guaranteed. These wetlands may provide some important functions and should be protected to the extent possible. (Ord. 1688 § 2 (Exh. B (part)), 2019).


14.06.020 Buffers.

Standard buffer widths presume the existence of a relatively intact native vegetation community in the buffer zone adequate to protect the wetland functions and values at the time of the proposed activity. If the vegetation is inadequate, then the buffer width shall be increased, or the buffer should be enhanced by planting or other means to maintain the standard functions and values for the required width. The following buffer widths have been established in accordance with the best available science. They are based on the category of wetland and the habitat score as determined by a qualified wetland professional using the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by Ecology). The adjacent land use intensity is assumed to be high.

A. For all wetlands, the buffers in Table 14.06.020.1 can be used only when all of the measures in Table 14.06.020.2 are implemented, where applicable and feasible, to minimize the impacts of the adjacent land uses.

B. If an applicant chooses not to apply the mitigation measures in Table 14.06.020.2 to the extent determined reasonable and necessary by the city, then a 25 percent increase in the standard buffers provided in Table 14.06.020.1 may be required.

C. The buffer widths in Table 14.06.020.1 assume that the buffer is vegetated with a native plant community appropriate for the ecoregion. If the existing buffer is unvegetated, sparsely vegetated, or vegetated with invasive species that do not perform needed functions, the buffer should either be planted to create the appropriate plant community, or the buffer should be widened to ensure that adequate functions of the buffer are provided.

Table 14.06.020.2. Required Measures to Minimize Impacts to Wetlands  

	Disturbance 	Required Measures to Minimize Impacts

	Lights	• Direct lights away from wetland

	Noise	• Locate activity that generates noise away from wetland

• If warranted, enhance existing buffer with native vegetation plantings adjacent to noise source immediately adjacent to the wetland buffer

	Toxic runoff	• Route all new, untreated runoff away from wetland while ensuring wetland is not dewatered

• Establish covenants limiting use of pesticides within 150 feet of wetlands

• Apply integrated pest management

	Stormwater runoff	• Retrofit stormwater detention and treatment for roads and existing adjacent development

• Prevent channelized flow from lawns that directly enters the buffer

• Use low impact development techniques (per PSAT publication on LID techniques)

	Change in water regime	• Infiltrate or treat, detain, and disperse into buffer new runoff from impervious surfaces and new lawns

	Pets and human disturbance	• Use privacy fencing or plant dense vegetation to delineate buffer edge and to discourage disturbance using vegetation appropriate for the ecoregion

• Place wetland and its buffer in a separate tract or protect with a conservation easement

	Dust	• Use best management practices to control dust

	Disruption of corridors or connections	The following measures are only required for wetlands with score for habitat functions greater than 5:

• Maintain connections to off-site areas that are undisturbed

• Restore corridors or connections to off-site habitats by replanting

• Where other priority habitats as defined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife are located on the site or immediately off site, a relatively undisturbed, vegetated corridor at least 100 feet wide must be protected between the wetland and the other priority habitat (required for wetlands with 6 or more points for habitat functions; encourage for all other wetlands)

D. Measurement of Buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the critical area boundary as surveyed in the field. The width of the buffer shall be determined according to the category of the wetland rating and habitat score.

E. Any wetland created as compensation for an approved wetland alteration shall have the standard buffer required for the new classification of the created wetland. Wetlands to be created shall be located such that the new associated wetland buffer does not cross onto an adjacent property, unless the same property owner owns the adjacent property or secures a native growth protection easement (NGPE) for the buffer on the adjoining property.

F. Averaging Buffers. The director will consider the allowance of wetland buffer averaging only when the buffer area width after averaging will not adversely impact the critical area and/or buffer functions and values. At a minimum, any proposed buffer averaging shall meet the following criteria:

1. The buffer area after averaging is no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer;

2. The buffer width shall not be reduced by more than 25 percent at any one point as a result of the buffer averaging;

3. The additional buffer area shall be enhanced if necessary, to achieve no net loss of the critical areas functions and values;

4. The additional buffer is contiguous with the standard buffer;

5. Encroachment into the buffer does not occur waterward of the top of an associated steep slope or into a channel migration zone;

6. Encroachment does not occur into the buffer of an associated wetland except as otherwise allowed.

G. Increased Buffers. The director may require increased buffer sizes when a critical area report shows that it is necessary to protect the function and value of the critical areas when either the critical area is particularly critical to disturbance or the development poses unusual impacts. Examples of circumstances that may require buffers beyond minimum requirements include, but are not limited to:

1. Unclassified uses;

2. The critical area is a fish and wildlife habitat area for spawning or rearing as determined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

3. Land located within the development proposal that is adjacent to the critical area and its associated buffer is classified as an erosion hazard area; or

4. A trail or utility corridor in excess of 10 percent of the buffer width is proposed for inclusion in the buffer. (Ord. 1688 § 2 (Exh. B (part)), 2019).


14.06.030 Permitted alterations.

A. The requirements provided in this section supplement those identified in Chapter 14.05 NBMC. Activities and uses shall be prohibited from wetlands and wetland buffers, except that the following activities may be permitted only if the applicant can demonstrate that the activity will not degrade the functions and values of the wetland and other critical areas:

1. Conservation or preservation projects that will not change the structure or functions of the existing wetland; and

2. Projects which propose modifications to existing structures where no further alteration or increase in footprint will occur.

B. The director may require the preparation of a critical area report to confirm compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

C. Trails. Public and private trails may be allowed within wetland buffers where it can be demonstrated in a critical area report that the wetland and wetland buffer functions and values will not be degraded by trail construction or use, and that the location of the trail provides educational benefit to multiple users. Trail planning, construction, and maintenance shall adhere to the following criteria:

1. Permeable surface trail alignment generally shall be parallel to the perimeter of the wetland, located only in the outer 25 percent of the wetland buffer area, except as needed to access viewing platforms which may be located in the outer 50 percent of the wetland buffer, or as needed to cross the wetland. Trails may be placed on existing levees, railroad grades, or road grades within these limits;

2. Trails and associated viewing platforms shall be constructed of pervious materials no more than five feet in width for pedestrian use only, unless impervious surfaces are necessary for conformance to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Raised boardwalks utilizing nontreated pilings and decking may be acceptable for wildlife viewing platforms of no more than eight feet in width and totaling no more than 60 square feet of footprint, and for wetland crossings. The trail surface shall be limited to minor crossings having no adverse impact on water quality, and meet all other requirements, including water quality standards set forth in the King County Surface Water Design Manual, 2016, or as revised; and

3. Trail alignment shall avoid removal of trees to the greatest extent feasible, and shall provide mitigation for all unavoidable impacts.

D. Stormwater Management Facilities. A wetland or its buffer can be physically or hydrologically altered to meet the requirements of a LID for runoff treatment or flow control utilizing best management practices if all of the following criteria are met:

1. The wetland is classified as a Category IV or a Category III wetland with a habitat score of three to four points;

2. There will be “no net loss” of functions and values to the wetland;

3. The wetland does not contain a breeding population of any native amphibian species;

4. The hydrologic functions of the wetland can be improved as outlined in questions 3, 4, and 5 of Chart 4, and questions 2, 3, and 4 of Chart 5 in the “Guide for Selecting Mitigation Sites Using a Watershed Approach” (available at http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/0906032.html); or the wetland is part of a priority restoration plan that achieves restoration goals identified in a shoreline master program or other local or regional watershed plan;

5. The wetland lies in the natural routing of the runoff, and the discharge follows the natural routing;

6. All regulations regarding stormwater and wetland management are followed, including but not limited to local and state wetland and stormwater codes, manuals, and permits; and

7. Modifications that alter the structure of a wetland or its soils will require permits. Existing functions and values that are lost shall be compensated/replaced.

E. Public Roads and Utilities. Normal and routine maintenance and repair of any existing public or private facility is allowed within an existing right-of-way; provided, that the maintenance or repair does not expand the footprint of the facility or right-of-way.

F. All isolated Category IV wetlands less than 4,000 square feet meeting criteria included in this subsection may be exempt from the mitigation sequencing requirement to avoid impacts, and may be filled when all impacts are fully mitigated as verified by the director. In order to verify the following conditions, a critical area report shall be required consistent with requirements in NMBC 14.05.240. An isolated Category IV wetland less than 4,000 square feet shall:

1. Not be associated with riparian areas or their buffers;

2. Not be associated with shorelines of the state or their associated buffers;

3. Not be part of a wetland mosaic;

4. Not score five or more points for habitat function based on the Washington State Wetland Rating System for Western Washington: 2014 Update (Ecology Publication No. 14-06-029, or as revised and approved by the Washington State Department of Ecology); and

14.07.010    Purpose.

14.07.020    Designation.

14.07.030    Prohibited uses and activities.

14.07.040    Performance standards.


14.07.010 Purpose.

To protect groundwater quality and quantity for public water supply and to maintain hydrologic functions of aquatic areas. Critical aquifer recharge areas contribute significantly to the replenishment of groundwater and due to their prevailing geologic conditions associated with infiltration rates, have a high potential for contamination of ground water resources. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.07.020 Designation.

Critical aquifer recharge areas (CARAs) are those areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water. CARAs are areas where an aquifer that is a source of drinking water is vulnerable to contamination that would affect the potability of the water, as defined by WAC 365-190-030(3). The Critical Aquifer Recharge Area and Wellhead Protection Area Map on file with the city designates CARAs in North Bend according to King County’s analysis. The map may be periodically revised by the city to add or remove areas based on additional information.

A. Critical aquifer recharge areas are categorized in the city as follows:

1. Category I critical aquifer recharge areas include those areas designated on the Critical Aquifer Recharge Area Map on file with the city as highly susceptible to groundwater contamination and that are located within a sole source aquifer or wellhead protection area; and

2. Category II critical aquifer recharge areas include those mapped areas designated that:

a. Have a medium susceptibility to groundwater contamination and are located in a sole source aquifer or wellhead protection area; or

b. Are highly susceptible to groundwater contamination and are not located in a sole source aquifer or wellhead protection area.

B. An applicant can request that the city declassify a specific area included in the map. The application must be supported by a critical area report that includes a hydrogeologic assessment demonstrating that the designation is not warranted based on the physical character of the aquifer. The application to declassify an area shall be reviewed by the city and the director shall make a determination whether to amend the map as appropriate. (Ord. 1688 § 3 (Exh. C (part)), 2019: Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.07.030 Prohibited uses and activities.

A. The following new uses or activities are not allowed in Category I critical aquifer recharge areas:

1. Hazardous liquid transmission pipelines;

2. Sand, gravel, and hard rock mining on land that is not zoned for mining;

3. Mining of any type below the groundwater table;

4. Processing, storage, and disposal of radioactive wastes;

5. Hydrocarbon extraction (unless part of an approved decommissioning plan);

6. Commercial wood treatment facilities on permeable surfaces;

7. Wrecking yards; and

8. Landfills for hazardous waste, municipal solid waste, or special waste, except Class A biosolids when applied pursuant to Washington State Department of Ecology (WSDOE) standards.

B. The following new uses and activities are not allowed in a Category II critical aquifer recharge area:

1. Mining of any type below the water table;

2. Processing, storage, and disposal of radioactive substances;

3. Hydrocarbon extraction (unless part of an approved decommissioning plan);

4. Commercial wood treatment facilities on permeable surfaces;

5. Wrecking yards; and

6. Landfills for hazardous waste, municipal solid waste, or special waste, except Class A biosolids when applied pursuant to WSDOE standards.

C. The activities listed below may be conditioned or allowed pending further evaluation to determine if measurable degradation in the quality of groundwater (in a critical aquifer recharge area) will occur. Applicants of development proposals or alterations involving the following types of uses or land activities shall prepare and submit, as part of their critical area study, a hydrogeologic assessment of the proposed site to determine if the development proposal or alteration will cause contaminants to enter a critical aquifer recharge area:

1. Golf courses;

2. Cemeteries;

3. Asphalt and concrete facilities; and

4. Concentrated animal feeding operations. (Ord. 1688 § 3 (Exh. C (part)), 2019: Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.07.040 Performance standards.

For development proposals within a critical aquifer recharge area, the director may require preparation of a critical area report as specified in NBMC 14.05.240. In addition, the following standards will apply:

A. Containment. Every development proposal involving hazardous substance processing or handling that is located in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall provide on-site containment devices adequate in size to contain any unauthorized release of hazardous substances from any area where these substances are either stored, handled, treated, used, or produced. Containment devices shall prevent such substances from penetrating into the ground. This provision also applies to releases that may mix with storm runoff. 

B. Hazardous Substances Management Plan. Every development proposal involving hazardous substance processing or handling that is located in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall prepare a spill plan containing procedures to be followed to prevent, control, collect, and dispose of any unauthorized release of a hazardous substance. Individual hazardous substance waste and typical retail waste will typically not require a spill plan. A spill plan may be required for businesses holding or disposing of either bulk chemicals such as oil, anti-freeze, etc., or truly hazardous chemicals such as acids or other corrosive substances. The plan must ensure the development can maintain spill clean-up of materials in a quantity sufficient to capture the largest container if spilled. 

C. Hazardous Substance Storage Tanks.

1. All hazardous substance storage tanks containing hazardous substances proposed to be located in a critical aquifer recharge area must comply with local building code requirements and must conform to the International Fire Code requirements for secondary containment.

2. Underground Tanks. No new underground storage tanks with hazardous substances shall be allowed in Category I critical aquifer recharge areas. All new underground hazardous substance tanks located in a Category II critical aquifer recharge area or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall be designed and constructed to: 

a. Prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank; 

b. Protect against corrosion, using noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or including a secondary containment system to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance; and 

c. Use material in the construction or lining of the tank that is compatible with the substance to be stored.

3. Aboveground Tanks. No new aboveground storage tank for hazardous substances located in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall be installed, used or maintained in any manner that may allow the release of a hazardous substance to the ground, groundwaters, or surface water. 

D. Agriculture. Agricultural activities in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall use Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) best management practices to prevent ground quality degradation from livestock waste. 

E. Sewage Disposal. All lots of residential, commercial, or industrial development proposals located in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area and within 150 feet of a public sewer system shall be connected to the sewer system. 

F. Golf Courses. Golf course operations proposed in or adjacent to a critical aquifer recharge area shall be subject to a golf course maintenance plan using best management practices to protect groundwater quality. The plan shall detail the proposed use of fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides, or other maintenance agents, with projected application methods, schedules and measures to prevent pollution of groundwater. 

G. Commercial Vehicle Repair and Servicing. Commercial vehicle repair and servicing must be conducted over impermeable pads and within a covered structure capable of withstanding normally expected weather conditions. Chemicals used in the process of vehicle repair and servicing must be stored in a manner that protects them from weather and provides containment should leaks occur. Proper capture and treatment of runoff per the King County Surface Water Design Manual, 2016, or as revised, should occur prior to discharge either off site or into infiltration systems. 

H. The uses listed in the table below shall be conditioned in accordance with the applicable state and federal regulations as necessary to protect critical aquifer recharge areas:

2. Habitats of local importance, including, but not limited to, areas designated as priority habitat by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife and fish habitat associated with resident fish species within the upper Snoqualmie Watershed, including all habitats associated with the following resident native fish species likely to occur in North Bend rivers and streams: cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, largescale sucker, longnose dace, shorthead sculpin, mottled sculpin, western brook lamprey, and threespine stickleback;

3. Naturally occurring ponds under 20 acres and their submerged aquatic beds that provide fish and or wildlife habitat;

4. Waters of the state, including lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams;

5. State natural area preserves and natural resource conservation areas; and

6. Land essential for preserving connections between habitat blocks and open spaces.

B. All areas within the city meeting one or more of the above criteria, regardless of any formal identification, are designated critical areas and are subject to the provisions of this chapter. The approximate location and extent of known streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas are depicted within the map series on file with the city. These mapped areas are comprised of Type S and F streams and their buffers, and associated wetlands. Associated wetlands may be partially or fully within a neighboring wetland, stream, and their buffers, or adjacent to designated fish and wildlife habitat areas. The map may be periodically revised by the city to add or remove areas based on additional information. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.020 Stream typing.

A. Streams within the city shall be classified by the following stream typing system, as defined in WAC 222-16-030:

1. Type S (Shorelines). All waters designated as “shorelines of the state” (according to Chapter 14.20 NBMC, Shoreline Regulations);

2. Type F (Fish). Segments of natural waters other than Type S waters that are within the bankfull widths of defined channels and periodically inundated areas of their associated wetlands, or within lakes, ponds, or impoundments having a surface area of one-half acre or greater at seasonal low water that in any case contain fish habitat or are described by one of the four categories in WAC 222-16-030(2);

3. Type Np (Non-Fish Perennial). All segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of defined channels that are perennial non-fish-habitat streams. Perennial streams are waters that do not go dry at any time during a year of normal rainfall. However, for the purpose of water typing, Type Np waters include the intermittent dry portions of the perennial channel below the uppermost point of perennial flow;

4. Type Ns (Non-Fish Seasonal). All segments of natural waters within the bankfull width of the defined channels that are not Type S, F, or Np waters. These are seasonal, non-fish-habitat streams in which surface flow is not present for at least some portion of a year of normal rainfall and are not located downstream from any stream reach that is a Type Np water. Ns waters must be physically connected by an aboveground channel system to Type S, F, or Np waters.

B. Streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas are shown in the city’s map series on file and identify the approximate locations of rivers and streams in the North Bend vicinity and is intended to be used as a guide for development proposals. Those streams that have not been classified will be typed according to the system summarized in subsection A of this section on the characteristics observed in the field. The map and/or map series may be periodically revised by the city to add or remove areas based on additional information. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.030 Buffers.

The following buffers are the minimum requirements for streams. Some existing developments are vested and do not meet these buffers. All buffers shall be measured from the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) as surveyed in the field.

A. Aquatic Buffers for Streams.

1. Buffers for Type S streams shall be determined according to Chapter 14.20 NBMC.

2. Type F streams shall have a 115-foot buffer on each side of the channel.

3. Type Np streams shall have a 65-foot buffer on each side of the channel.

4. Type Ns streams in open space or undeveloped areas shall have a 65-foot buffer on each side of the channel, unless otherwise noted in subsection (A)(5) of this section.

5. Type Ns streams in existing built out developed areas as depicted within the map series on file with the city shall have a 25-foot buffer on each side of the channel. These areas are primarily existing single-family residential lots in the Silver Creek neighborhood east of Ballarat. No reduction in this 25-foot buffer is allowed.

B. Terrestrial Buffers. Buffer widths and setbacks for the protection of listed species outside of streams and stream buffers shall be determined on a site-specific basis. Appropriate buffers shall be documented in an approved habitat management plan.

C. Averaging Buffers and Reducing Buffers. The director will consider the allowance of stream buffer averaging and reduction only when any reductions in buffer area width would not adversely impact the critical area and/or buffer functions and values. At a minimum, any proposed buffer averaging or buffer reduction shall meet the following criteria:

1. Buffer averaging shall be preferred over buffer reduction; proposals for buffer reduction shall only be approved on a case-by-case basis, and only where the existing buffer condition is degraded (due to existing development within the prescribed buffer width, the presence of significant amount of invasive vegetation that impairs buffer function, and/or lack of native vegetation); provided, that the following criteria are met:

a. Any buffer reduction proposal must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that it will not result in direct, indirect or long-term adverse impacts to watercourses; and

b. The remaining buffer is enhanced in accordance with an approved buffer enhancement plan, prepared by a qualified professional, to retain existing native vegetation and install additional native vegetation in order to improve the buffer function;

2. Wherever buffer averaging is proposed, the buffer area after averaging shall be no less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer, and shall demonstrate how variations in the existing function of the buffer are integrated into the averaging proposal to maximize retention of forest canopy and native vegetation;

3. The approved Type F and Type Np buffer widths shall not be reduced by more than 25 percent at any one point as a result of the buffer averaging or reduction, and Type Ns buffer widths shall not be reduced by more than 50 percent at any one point as a result of the buffer averaging or reduction;

4. For buffer averaging proposals, the additional buffer area shall be enhanced if necessary, to achieve no net loss of the critical areas functions and values;

5. For buffer averaging proposals, the additional buffer is contiguous with the standard buffer; and

6. For any buffer averaging or reduction proposal, encroachment into the buffer does not occur waterward of the top of an associated steep slope or into a channel migration zone.

D. Increased Buffers. The director may require increased buffer sizes when a critical area report shows that it is necessary to protect the function and value of the critical area when either the critical area is particularly critical to disturbance or the development poses unusual impacts. Examples of circumstances that may require buffers beyond minimum requirements include, but are not limited to:

1. Unclassified uses;

2. The critical area is a fish and wildlife habitat area for spawning or rearing as determined by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

3. Land located within the development proposal that is adjacent to the critical area and its associated buffer is classified as an erosion hazard area; or

4. A trail or utility corridor in excess of 10 percent of the buffer width is proposed for inclusion in the buffer. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.040 Permitted alterations.

A. Applicability – No Degradation. The requirements provided in this section supplement those identified in Chapter 14.05 NBMC. The following activities or uses may be permitted in streams and/or their buffers when the mitigation sequencing requirements of NBMC 14.05.250 are followed, and the applicant can show that the proposed activity will not degrade the functions and values of the stream, stream buffer, or other critical area:

1. Stream Crossings. Stream crossings shall be minimized, but when necessary they shall conform to the following standards as well as other applicable laws (see 2013 Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Water Crossing Design Guidelines along with consideration of NMFS’s 2011 Anadromous Salmonid Passage Facility Design):

a. The stream crossing is the only reasonable alternative that has the least impact;

b. It has been shown in the critical area report that the proposed crossing will not decrease the stream and associated buffer functions and values;

c. The stream crossing shall use bridges instead of pipe or box culverts unless it can be demonstrated that a pipe or box culvert would result in equal or less ecological impacts;

d. All stream crossings using pipe culverts shall use super span or oversized culverts with appropriate fish enhancement measures. Culverts shall not obstruct fish passage;

e. Stream crossings shall be designed according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Fish Passage Design at Road Culverts, 1999, and the National Marine Fisheries Service Guidelines for Salmonid Passage at Stream Crossings, 2000;

In addition, corridors shall not be aligned parallel with any stream channel unless the corridor is outside the buffer, and crossings shall be minimized. Installation shall be accomplished by boring beneath the scour depth and hyporheic zone of the water body where feasible. Crossings shall be contained within the existing footprint of an existing or new road or utility crossing where possible. Otherwise, crossings shall be at an angle greater than 60 degrees to the centerline of the channel. The criteria for stream crossing shall also apply.

4. Stormwater conveyance facilities; provided, that they are only located in the buffer when no practicable alternative exists outside the buffer. Stormwater facilities shall be planted with native plantings where feasible to provide habitat, and/or less intrusive facilities should be used.

5. Septic Systems. New septic systems are prohibited in the inner stream buffers.

6. Stream bank stabilization shall only be allowed when it is shown, through a stream bank stability assessment conducted by a qualified fluvial geomorphologist or hydraulic engineer, that such stabilization is required for public safety reasons, that no other less intrusive actions are possible, and that the stabilization will not degrade instream or downstream channel stability. Stream bank stabilization shall utilize bioengineering or soft armoring techniques unless otherwise demonstrated. Stream bank stabilization shall conform to the Integrated Streambank Protection Guidelines developed by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, 2002, or as revised. Stabilization measures must demonstrate the following:

a. Natural shoreline processes will be maintained. The project will not result in increased erosion or alterations to, or loss of, shoreline substrate within one-quarter mile of the project area;

b. The stabilization measures will not degrade streams and other fish or wildlife habitat areas or associated wetlands; and

c. Adequate mitigation measures ensure that there is no net loss of the functions or values of riparian habitat.

7. Maintenance, repair, or replacement of lawfully established existing bank stabilization is allowed, provided it does not increase the height or linear amount of bank and does not expand waterward or into aquatic habitat landward.

8. Activities and uses as allowed under Chapter 14.05 NBMC. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.050 General performance standards.

The requirements provided in this section supplement those identified in NBMC 14.05.240, Critical area reports/studies. Streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas may be altered only if the proposed alteration or the mitigation proposed does not degrade the qualitative functions and values of the habitat. All new structures and land alterations shall be prohibited from streams and other fish and wildlife habitat areas, except in accordance with this chapter. Additional standards follow:

A. No development shall be allowed within a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area or any associated buffer with which state or federally endangered, threatened, priority, or critical species have a primary association.

B. Whenever development is proposed adjacent to a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area with which state or federally endangered, threatened, or critical species have a primary association, such areas shall be protected through the application of protection measures in accordance with a critical area report prepared by a qualified professional and approved by the director.

C. Habitat Assessment. An applicant of a development proposal or alteration in or adjacent to a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area shall prepare and submit, as part of its critical areas study, a habitat study that identifies which, if any, listed species are using that stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area. If one or more listed species are using stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area, the following additional requirements shall apply:

1. An applicant shall include in its critical area study a habitat management plan that identifies the qualities that are essential to maintain feeding, breeding, and nesting of listed species using the stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area and that identifies measures to minimize the impact on these ecological processes from proposed activities. The applicant shall be guided by the document Management Recommendations for Washington’s Priority Habitats and Species, issued by the Washington State Department of Wildlife, May 1991, and as may be amended, and by any recovery and management plans prepared by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife for the listed species pursuant to WAC 232-12-297(11); and

2. Conditions shall be imposed, as necessary, based on the measures identified in the habitat management plan.

D. Consultation with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife and the appropriate federal agency for approval of alteration of land in streams or other fish and wildlife habitat areas, buffers, or any associated setback zones is encouraged and required only in specific circumstances at the discretion of the director.

E. No plant, wildlife, or fish species not indigenous to the region shall be introduced into a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area unless authorized by a state or federal permit or approval.

F. Alteration of natural watercourses shall be avoided, if feasible. If unavoidable, the following provisions shall apply to the alteration:

1. Watercourse alteration projects shall not result in blockage of side channels. Known fish barriers into side channels shall be removed as part of an approved watercourse alteration project;

2. Removal of large woody debris (LWD) and vegetation, including salvage logging, shall be avoided or minimized unless it is demonstrated that the LWD poses an imminent safety hazard to the public, property, or structures, or when it is part of a larger restoration project. Any removal that is unavoidable shall be mitigated by replanting with native vegetation and by augmenting lost LWD where LWD can be anchored in such a way to provide fisheries, riparian, or shoreline erosion benefits, and to avoid safety hazards where recreational boating and swimming are expected; and

3. The applicant shall maintain the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse to ensure that the flood carrying capacity is not diminished. Maintenance shall be bonded for a period of five years and be in accordance with an approved maintenance program.

G. The director shall condition approval of activities allowed within a stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area or its buffer, as necessary, pursuant to the approved critical area report and habitat management plan to minimize or mitigate any potential adverse impacts. Conditions may include:

1. Establishment of buffer zones outside of the required stream and wetland buffers, on a case-by-case basis, as may be necessary to retain adequate natural habitat for listed species;

2. Preservation of critical, important vegetation and/or habitat features (e.g., snags);

3. Limitation of access to the habitat area, including fencing (on a case-by-case basis) to deter unauthorized access (note: fencing shall not create a barrier to habitat function);

4. Seasonal restrictions of construction activities;

5. Establishment of a duration and timetable for periodic review of mitigation activities; and

6. Requirement of a performance bond, when necessary, to ensure successful completion. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.060 Special provisions – Resident fish species of importance.

A. Activities, uses, and alterations proposed to be located in water bodies used by resident fish species of local importance, including cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, mountain whitefish, largescale sucker, longnose dace, shorthead sculpin, mottled sculpin, western brook lamprey, and threespine stickleback, or in areas that affect such water bodies, shall give special consideration to the preservation and enhancement of fish habitat, including, but not limited to, the following:

1. Activities shall be timed to occur only during the allowable work window as designated by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife;

2. An alternative alignment or location for the activity is not feasible;

3. The activity is designed so that it will minimize the degradation of the functions or values of the fish habitat or other critical areas; and

4. Any impact to the functions and values of the stream or other fish and wildlife habitat area are mitigated in accordance with an approved critical area report.

B. Structures that prevent the migration of resident fish species shall not be allowed in the portion of water bodies currently or historically used by resident fish. Fish bypass facilities shall be provided that allow the upstream migration of adult fish and shall prevent juveniles migrating downstream from being trapped or harmed.

C. Fills, when authorized, shall minimize the adverse impacts to fish habitat, shall mitigate any unavoidable impacts, and shall only be allowed for water-dependent uses. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).


14.09.070 Special provisions – Wildlife.

Project applicants shall certify that development proposals are in compliance with federal bald eagle guidelines as a condition of local permit approval. (Ord. 1688 § 5 (Exh. D (part)), 2019).

Chapter 14.10 CHANNEL MIGRATION ZONES1

Sections:

14.10.010    Purpose.


14.10.010 Purpose.

Channel migration zones are identified by King County to reduce the risk of property or casualty loss due to stream bank destabiliza­tion, rapid stream incision, stream bank ero­sion, and shifts in location of stream channels. Figure 5, Special Flood Hazard Map2 identi­fies channel migration zones in the North Bend area. The city of North Bend does not regulate these channel migration zone areas. The city’s decision not to regulate the channel migration zones is based on the following facts:

The channel migration zones of the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River are identified as “avulsion” hazard channel migration areas associated with catastrophic flooding events by the 1996 King County Three Forks Sno­qualmie River Channel Migration study. As such the potential channel migration would only occur in conjunction with a major flood event. In 2005, the flood insurance rate map was revised to incorporate and regulate the same general channel migration areas as flood­ways. The flood regulations provide substan­tially similar health and safety protection for the “avulsion” hazard channel migration areas, and the creation of duplicate, overlapping reg­ulatory standards was not found to be in the best public interest by the city council.      

The majority of the existing Silver Creek neighborhood affected by the channel migra­tion zones of the Middle Fork of the Sno­qualmie River is already developed in public open space ownership, or protected by existing public roadways that will likely be restored if ever damaged by a major flood event, includ­ing a channel migration by “avulsion.”

The remaining large parcels of land that may be developed in the Silver Creek neigh­borhood are likely to be reviewed under the SEPA process, and any channel migration zones of the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River identified as “avulsion” hazard channel migration areas that are not regulated by the flood regulations can be addressed and miti­gated in the SEPA process. 

The channel migration zones of the South Fork of the Snoqualmie River are identified as lateral migration hazard areas in the 1996 King County Three Forks Snoqualmie River Chan­nel Migration study. The areas at risk are wholly located in the Tollgate Farm public open space purchased in part to protect them from development because of the risk associ­ated with the critical areas on the property. As with the Silver Creek residential areas, the floodways on the 2005 FIRM cover similar areas to the channel migration areas and if any development was proposed on the public open space it likely would be reviewed under the SEPA process. In the SEPA process any avul­sion channel migration zones of the South Fork or Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River that are not regulated by the flood regulations could be addressed and mitigated. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).1

14.11.010 Purpose.

To prevent incompatible development activity from being conducted in or near geologically hazardous areas in order to reduce the risk to public health and safety. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.11.020 Designation.

Geologically hazardous areas include areas susceptible to erosion, sliding, earthquake, or other geological events. They pose a threat to the health and safety of citizens when incompatible development is sited in areas of significant hazard. Such incompatible development may not only place itself at risk, but may also increase the hazard to surrounding development and uses. Areas susceptible to one or more of the following types of hazards shall be designated as geologically hazardous areas:

A. Erosion hazard;

B. Landslide hazard (including steep slopes);

C. Seismic hazard; and

D. Other geological events including mass wasting, debris flows, rock falls, and differential settlement.

Figure 6, Seismic Hazards1 depicts areas subject to soil liquefaction in an earthquake and Figure 7, Erosion and Debris Flow2 identifies geologically hazardous areas in the North Bend area. These maps may be periodically revised by the city to add or remove areas based on additional information. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.11.030 Designation of specific geologic hazard areas.

A. The adopted critical areas maps include: 

1. U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) landslide hazard, seismic hazard, and volcanic hazard maps;

2. Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) seismic hazard maps of Western Washington, as they are available;

3. WDNR slope stability maps, as they are available; and

4. Local geologic hazard maps, as adopted.

These maps are to be used as a guide for the city of North Bend, project applicants, and/or property owners, and may be continuously updated as new critical areas are identified. They are a reference and do not provide a final critical area designation.

B. Other geologic hazardous areas regulated by this chapter include:

1. Erosion Hazard Areas. Erosion hazard areas are at least those areas identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as having “severe” or “very severe” rill and inter-rill erosion hazard.

2. Landslide Hazard Areas. Landslide hazard areas are areas potentially subject to landslides based on a combination of geologic, topographic, and hydrologic factors. They include areas susceptible because of any combination of bedrock, soil, slope (gradient), slope aspect, structure, hydrology, or other factors. Examples of these may include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Areas of historic failure, such as:

i. Those areas delineated by the NRCS as having a “severe” limitation for building site development; or

ii. Areas designated as quaternary slumps, earth flows, mudflows, debris flow, or landslides on maps published by the USGS, WDNR, or the city of North Bend;

b. Areas with all three of the following characteristics:

i. Slopes steeper than 15 percent; and

ii. Hillsides intersecting geologic contacts with a relatively permeable sediment overlaying a relatively impermeable sediment or bedrock; and

iii. Springs or groundwater seepage;

c. Areas that have shown movement during the Holocene epoch (from 10,000 years ago to the present) or that are underlain or covered by mass wastage debris of that epoch;

d. Slopes that are parallel or sub-parallel to planes of weakness (such as bedding planes, joint systems, and faults) in subsurface materials;

e. Slopes having a gradient steeper than 80 percent subject to rock fall during seismic shaking;

f. Areas potentially unstable because of rapid stream incision, stream bank erosion, and undercutting by water action;

g. Areas located in a canyon or on an active alluvial fan, presently or potentially subject to inundation by debris flows or catastrophic flooding; and

h. Any area with a slope of 40 percent or steeper and with a vertical relief of 10 or more feet except areas composed of consolidated rock. A slope delineated by establishing its toe and top and measured by averaging the inclination over at least 10 feet of vertical relief.

3. Seismic Hazard Areas. Seismic hazard areas are subject to severe risk of damage as a result of earthquake-induced ground shaking, slope failure, settlement, soil liquefaction, lateral spreading, or surface failure. The strength of ground shaking is primarily affected by:

a. The magnitude of an earthquake;

b. The distance from the source of an earthquake;

c. The type and thickness of geologic materials at the surface; and

d. The type of subsurface geological structure. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.11.050 Performance standards.

A. All projects shall be evaluated to determine whether the project is proposed to be located in a geologically hazardous area, the project’s potential impact on the geologically hazardous area, and the potential impact of the proposed project. The director may require the preparation of a critical area report to determine the project’s ability to meet the performance standards.

B. Alterations to erosion or landslide hazardous areas or associated buffers may only occur for activities that:

1. Will not increase the threat of the geological hazard to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;

2. Will not adversely impact other critical areas;

3. Are designed so that the hazard to the project is eliminated or mitigated to a level equal to or less than predevelopment conditions; and

4. Are certified as safe as designed and under anticipated conditions by a qualified geotechnical engineer or geologist, licensed in the state of Washington.

C. Vegetation in erosion or landslide hazardous areas shall be retained unless it can be shown that the removal will not increase the geologic hazards and a vegetation management plan is submitted with the request.

D. Approved clearing and grading in erosion and landslide hazardous areas shall only be allowed from May 1st to October 1st of each year; provided, that the city may extend or shorten the dry season on a case-by-case basis depending on the actual weather conditions, except that timber harvest, not including brush clearing or stump removal, may be allowed pursuant to an approved forest practices permit issued by WDNR.

E. Access roads and utilities may be permitted within the erosion or landslide hazard area and associated buffers if the city determines that no other feasible alternative exists.

F. Utility lines and pipes shall be permitted in the erosion or landslide hazard areas only when the applicant demonstrates that no other practical alternative is available. The line or pipe shall be located above ground and be properly anchored and/or designed so that it will continue to function in the event of an underlying slide. Stormwater conveyance shall be allowed only through a high-density polyethylene pipe with fuse-welded joints, or similar product that is technically equal or superior.

G. Sheet flow discharges from impervious surfaces and point discharges from surface water facilities and roof drains onto or upstream from an erosion or landslide hazard area shall be prohibited except that conveyance is allowed via continuous storm pipe downslope to a point where there are no erosion hazard areas downstream from the discharge.

H. The division of land in erosion or landslide hazard areas and associated buffers is subject to provisions established for all critical areas in Chapter 14.05 NBMC. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.11.060 Special provisions – Erosion and landslide areas.

Activities on sites containing erosion or landslide hazards shall meet the following requirements:

A. Buffers Required. A buffer shall be established for all edges of erosion or landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the director, based on the recommendations of the critical areas study, to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death, or injury resulting from erosion and landslides caused in whole or in part by the development, based upon review of and concurrence with a critical area report prepared by a qualified professional.

B. Minimum Buffers. The typical buffer for landslide hazard areas is the height of the slope or 50 feet, whichever is greater. The buffer may be reduced or enlarged depending upon site-specific conditions and the nature of the hazard, as analyzed by a qualified geologist. There is no minimum buffer for erosion areas. Erosion protection shall be based on site-specific analysis to achieve no net loss or impact to the erosion area. Best management practices (BMPs), mitigation, monitoring, and where necessary an erosion and control plan. 

C. Buffer Reduction. The buffer may be reduced to zero when a qualified professional demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that the reduction will adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent developments and uses, and the subject critical area.

D. Increased Buffer. The buffer may be increased when the director determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed and existing development.

E. Alterations. Alterations of an erosion or landslide hazard area and/or buffer may only occur for activities for which a geotechnical analysis is submitted and certifies that:

1. The development will not increase the surface water discharge rate or sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond the predevelopment condition;

2. The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent properties; and

3. Such alteration will not adversely impact other critical areas. (Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006).


14.11.070 Design standards – Erosion and landslide hazard areas.

Development within an erosion or landslide hazard area and/or buffer shall be designed to meet the following basic requirements unless it can be demonstrated that an alternative design that deviates from one or more of these standards provides greater long-term slope stability while meeting all other provisions of this chapter. The requirements for long-term slope stability shall exclude designs that require regular and periodic maintenance to maintain their level of function. The basic development design standards are:

A. Structures and improvements shall be clustered to avoid geologically hazardous areas and other critical areas;

B. Structures and improvements shall minimize alterations to the natural contours of the slope and foundations shall be tiered where possible to conform to existing topography;

14.12.010 Applicability.

This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards (also referred to as “special flood hazard areas” or “SFHA”) within the city. Special flood hazard areas shall have the meaning ascribed in NBMC 14.05.200(S)(4), which areas shall be determined by consideration of the following:

A. Special flood hazard areas identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for King County, Washington, and Incorporated Areas” dated April 19, 2005, and any revisions thereto, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), and any revisions thereto, which are hereby adopted by reference as though fully set forth. The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the FIRM are on file at North Bend City Hall. The best available information for flood hazard area identification as outlined in subsection B of this section shall be the basis for regulation until a new FIRM is issued that incorporates data utilized under subsection B of this section; and

B. When base flood elevation data has not been provided by the FIS or FIRM, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from federal, state, county, or other valid sources.

C. In the event of a conflict, the more restrictive provision shall apply. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016: Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006)


14.12.020 Severability.

If any provision of this chapter is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.030 Floodplain development permit.

A. A floodplain development permit shall be obtained before new construction, substantial improvement, or development begins within any SFHA. The permit shall be for all structures, including mobile and manufactured homes or nonlicensed recreational vehicles on site for more than 180 days, as set forth in NBMC 14.12.140 and 14.12.150, and for all other development including fill and other activities as defined in NBMC 14.05.200.

B. The fee and/or review cost for a floodplain development permit shall be as set forth in the city’s taxes, rates and fees schedule, as now adopted or as may be amended from time to time.

C. The fee and/or review cost for a floodplain development permit shall be waived by the city when the permit is for a structure under 200 square feet in size.

D. The fee and/or review cost for a floodplain development permit shall be waived by the city when the permit is associated with a building permit for any of the following improvements:

1. Electrical repairs;

2. Furnace repairs or replacements;

3. Water heater or boiler repairs or replacements;

4. Air conditioner repairs or replacements;

5. Re-roofs;

6. Re-siding;

8. Roof-mounted or existing structure mounted solar collectors;

9. Window and door replacements; or

10. Renovation or remodel projects that cost less than $2,500;

provided, that waiver under this subsection D shall not apply if the project includes other improvements that are not listed above, increases the structure’s floor area or footprint, causes a floodplain encroachment, or constitutes a substantial improvement under NBMC 14.12.170.

The cost of improvements that qualify for a waiver under this subsection D shall not be included in the cumulative calculation required by NBMC 14.12.170, unless the improvements are part of a substantial damage calculation or estimate.

E. Permit Application. Application for a floodplain development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the director. Required application materials may include:

1. Plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question, native vegetation, existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and other information as identified on the application information sheet. These documents shall be maintained by the city for inspection of all records pertaining to the provisions of these critical areas regulations;

2. A critical areas report, if required, pursuant to Chapter 14.05 NBMC;

3. Habitat assessment, if required, pursuant to this chapter;

4. The base flood elevation in relation to the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures located in the AE zone or within the AO zone. Identify the highest adjacent natural grade next to the building prior to construction;

5. Proposed floodproofing elevation in relation to the base flood elevation or highest adjacent natural grade next to the building prior to construction;

6. Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in NBMC 14.12.130;

7. A description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of a proposed development; and

8. An elevation certificate for all new or substantially improved structures. The elevation certificate must be certified by a licensed professional land surveyor.

F. All development permits for the site must be reviewed to ensure all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state, or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required, prior to floodplain development permit issuance. (Ord. 1681 § 3, 2019: Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016: Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1353 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006. Formerly 14.12.050).


14.12.040 Review of building permits.

Where base flood elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from another authoritative source identified within NBMC 14.12.010(B), applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding; provided, that the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) shall be at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade in those zones. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.050 Information to be obtained and maintained.

A. Where base flood elevation data is provided through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or other source in accordance with NBMC 14.12.010, the applicant shall obtain and record the actual (as-built) elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and whether or not the structure contains a basement.

B. For all new or substantially improved floodproofed nonresidential structures where base flood elevation data is provided through the FIS, FIRM, or other source in accordance with NBMC 14.12.010:

1. The applicant shall obtain and record the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure was floodproofed; and

2. The city shall maintain the floodproofing certifications required in NBMC 14.12.130.

C. The city shall maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provision of this chapter. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.060 Alteration of watercourses.

Adjacent communities and the Department of Ecology must be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and evidence of such notification must be submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.070 Performance standards – Flood hazard areas.

The following standards apply to development proposals and alterations on sites within special flood hazard areas:

A. A development proposal shall not increase the base flood elevation unless revisions to the FIRM are approved by FEMA in accordance with 44 CFR 70, and appropriate legal arrangements have been made and documents filed prior to issuance of a construction permit;

B. The following circumstances are presumed to produce no increase in base flood elevation and shall not require special studies to establish this fact:

1. Reconstruction or remodeling of existing structures in the floodway where the structure’s footprint is not increased;

2. Development of new residential structures outside the FEMA floodway on lots in existence before November 17, 1998;

3. Substantial improvements to existing residential structures in the floodplain but outside the FEMA floodway;

4. New development or substantial improvement in the area identified in the downtown commercial zoning district which is within the AO-1, AO-2, AO-3 or AE (outside the floodway) flood zone; provided, that in the AE flood zone the difference between the highest adjacent grade of the site and the base flood elevation as measured on the Flood Insurance Rate Map is no greater than two feet; and/or

5. Minor accessory structures exempt from building permits under the International Building Code;

C. The cumulative effect of any proposed development, where combined with all other existing and anticipated development on the site, shall not reduce the effective base flood storage volume of the floodplain. Except as exempted in subsection B of this section, grading or other activity that would reduce the effective storage volume shall be mitigated by creating compensatory storage on site, or off site if legal arrangements can be made, to assure that the effective compensatory storage volume will be preserved over time; provided, however, that no increased upstream or downstream flood hazard shall be created by any fill authorized in the floodplain by this chapter or other applicable chapters;

D. If a lot has a buildable site or sites out of the special flood hazard area, all new structures shall be located there, when feasible. If a lot is fully in the floodplain, structures must be located to have the least impact on riparian habitat and listed species. All structures must be set back at least 15 feet from the protected area, as practicable. The city has prepared maps identifying the approximate boundaries of the protected area and the riparian habitat zone used to establish the protected area which are available on the city’s website. The protected area has been defined using the CMZs identified in the study titled Channel Migration in the Three-Forks Area of the Snoqualmie River, prepared by King County in January 1996. This study identified that little channel migration is expected to occur on the Middle Fork upstream from Tanner due to channel stability, nor on the South Fork upstream of the Burlington Northern Railroad (Snoqualmie Valley Trail) due to levee channelization. Therefore, channel migration was not used as a factor to determine the protected area within these reaches;

E. If the proposed project will create new impervious surfaces so that more than 10 percent of the portion of the lot in the regulatory floodplain is covered by impervious surface, the applicant shall demonstrate that there will be no net increase in the rate and volume of the stormwater surface runoff that leaves the site or that the adverse impact is mitigated per the approved habitat mitigation assessment;

F. When fill is proposed to achieve elevated construction, a report by a registered professional engineer is required demonstrating that the proposal will not increase the base flood elevation;

G. If grading or other activity will displace any effective flood storage volume, compensatory storage shall be created on site, or off site if legal arrangements can be made, to assure that the effective compensatory storage volume will be preserved over time, in equivalent volume, at equivalent elevations to that being displaced. Compensatory storage areas must be hydraulically connected to the source of flooding. Alternatively, if feasible, the applicant may provide an increase in side channel habitat as mitigation for floodway alterations;

H. Approved alterations shall not block side channel habitats; and

I. An analysis of bioengineering and/or vegetation enhancements will be required when existing levees or dikes are proposed to be repaired or renovated as specified in King County’s Guidelines for Bank Stabilization. (Ord. 1681 § 4, 2019: Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016: Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1353 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 1272 § 1, 2007; Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006. Formerly 14.12.020).


14.12.080 Construction materials and methods.

Utilities and on-site sewage facilities shall meet the following criteria:

A. All new and replacement utilities including sewage treatment facilities shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation;

B. New on-site sewage disposal systems shall be located outside the limits of the floodway and may be installed in the floodplain if no feasible alternative site is available. On-site sewage disposal systems that are located within the flood hazard areas must be sited to avoid impairment of the system during flooding and to avoid contamination from the system during flooding;

C. Sewage and manure waste storage facilities, if allowed, shall be floodproofed to the flood protection elevation;

D. Buried utility transmission lines transporting hazardous substances (as defined by the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act in RCW 70.105.010) shall be buried a minimum of four feet beneath the maximum depth of scour of the base flood for the entire width of the floodway and shall achieve sufficient negative buoyancy so that any potential for flotation or upward migration is eliminated;

E. Aboveground utility transmission lines, not including electrical transmission lines, shall only be allowed in the floodway for the transportation of nonhazardous materials, as defined by the Washington State Department of Ecology, where a bridge or other structure is capable of transporting the line; and

F. Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the floodway. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.100 Subdivision and development proposals.

E. Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authorized source, it shall be generated for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments that contain at least 50 lots or five acres (whichever is less); and

F. The following note shall appear on the face of the recorded documents and shall be recorded on the title of records for all affected lots:

Note: Lots and structures located within special flood hazard areas may be inaccessible to emergency vehicles during flood events. Residents and property owners should take appropriate advance precautions to provide access.

(Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.110 Residential construction.

New residential construction and substantial improvements within the SFHA shall meet the following criteria:

A. The lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated two feet or more above base flood elevation.

B. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are prohibited. The area and rooms below the lowest floor shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

1. A minimum of two openings shall be provided on two different walls having a total new area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;

2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and

3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices; provided, that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the base flood elevation.

D. The elevation of the interior crawlspace grade must be at or above the lowest elevation of the exterior grade; provided, that below-grade crawlspace foundations may be allowed when all of the following conditions are met:

1. The interior grade of the crawlspace below the base flood elevation is no more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade; and

2. The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall, does not exceed four feet at any point; and

3. The crawlspace contains an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior of the crawlspace, such as natural drainage through porous, well-drained soils, and/or constructed drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means; and

4. Any building utility systems within the crawlspace are elevated to the flood protection elevation or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. In particular, all ductwork is elevated above the design flood elevation or sealed from floodwaters; and

5. The velocity of floodwaters at the site does not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace; and

6. All other minimum criteria set forth in this section are satisfied. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.120 Accessory structures.

This provision applies to accessory structures that are used for parking or storage only, such as garages or small storage sheds. The following standards shall apply in the SFHA:

A. Accessory structures shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;

B. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters;

C. Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation that may result in damage to other structures;

14.12.130 Nonresidential construction.

New construction and substantial improvements of any existing commercial, industrial, or other nonresidential structure shall either:

A. Elevate the lowest floor, including the basement, a minimum of two feet or more above base flood elevation and meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in NBMC 14.12.110; or

B. Floodproof the structure to the same elevation. If the structure is floodproofed, the following criteria are required:

1. The floodproofing must be certified by a professional engineer or architect registered in the state of Washington stating that the floodproofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood-depths, pressures, velocities, impacts, uplift forces, and other factors associated with the base flood. The certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in NBMC 14.12.050.

2. Approved building permits for floodproofed nonresidential buildings shall contain a statement to notify applicants that flood insurance premiums will be based upon rates that are one foot below the floodproofed level. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.140 Mobile and manufactured homes.

For all mobile and manufactured homes, all standards for flood hazard protection for residential construction shall apply. All mobile and manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. For existing mobile and manufactured homes where the value of the repair or reconstruction of the utilities and pad equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of utilities and pad before the repair or reconstruction has commenced, all standards for flood hazard protection applicable for residential construction shall apply. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.150 Recreational vehicles.

Recreational vehicles placed on sites in the SFHA are required to either:

A. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or

B. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and have no permanently attached additions; or

C. Meet the manufactured home elevation and anchoring requirements. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.160 Shallow flooding areas.

Shallow flooding zones appear on FIRMs as AO zones with depth designations. The base flood depths in these zones range from one to three feet above ground where a clearly defined channel does not exist, or where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is usually characterized as sheet flow. In these areas, the following provisions apply:

A. Residential Structures. New construction and substantial improvements of residential structures within AO zones shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, two feet or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);

B. Nonresidential Structures. New construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures that require a building permit within AO zones shall either:

1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade of the building site, one foot or more above the depth number specified on the FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or

2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. If this method is used, compliance shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect as defined under qualified professional. Where hazardous velocities were noted on the FIRM, consideration shall be given to mitigating the effects of these velocities through proper construction techniques and methods; or

C. Drainage for Residential and Nonresidential Structures. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes are required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016: Ord. 1243 Exh. B (part), 2006. Formerly 14.12.040).


14.12.170 Substantial improvement.

A project is considered a substantial improvement when the cost of any repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a building or other structure equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure (1) before the improvement or repair is started; or (2) if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. Substantial improvements are calculated on a cumulative basis, beginning with improvements commenced five years prior to the date of the current building permit application. When the total cost of all improvements within the five-year period equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure, the project is considered a substantial improvement and the structure must be brought into compliance with this chapter. The cumulative calculation provision does not include tenant improvements of commercial structures, exclusions listed in NBMC 14.05.200(S)(12), or improvements that qualify for waiver under NBMC 14.12.030(D). (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.180 Additions.

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, additions to existing buildings or structures must comply with all floodplain regulations as set forth in this chapter.

B. Additions that meet the following criteria shall not be required to elevate, but must be flood resistant to a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation:

1. Expansion of existing building or structure does not exceed 500 square feet; and

2. Expansion of existing building or structure does not increase the building footprint by more than 25 percent; and

3. The addition shares a common wall (one full side) with the primary structure; and

4. The addition does not constitute a substantial improvement under NBMC 14.12.170. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.190 Critical facilities.

Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment plants, potable water and sanitary sewer system components, and hazardous materials production. Construction of new critical facilities shall only be allowed within the floodplain when no reasonable alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the floodplain shall have the lowest floor elevated to three or more feet above the level of the base flood elevation, except that factory assembled portable school classrooms shall have the lowest floor elevated to two feet or more above the base flood elevation. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure toxic or hazardous substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the 100-year frequency flood shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.200 Floodways.

Floodways are special flood hazard areas as determined in NBMC 14.12.010 due to the velocity of floodwaters that can actually carry debris and increase erosion potential. The following provisions apply in all designated floodways within the city:

A. Construction of new residential, commercial or industrial structures is prohibited within the floodway.

B. Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other developments, are prohibited unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating, through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice, that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

C. Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is prohibited within the floodway, except for:

1. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and

2. Repairs, reconstruction, or improvements to a structure, which are not considered a substantial improvement as defined in NBMC 14.20.190.

D. Any new construction and substantial improvement permitted under subsection B of this section shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction standards of this chapter. (Ord. 1631 § 1, 2017: Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016: Ord. 1594 § 1 (part), 2016).


14.12.205 Hazardous materials.

The storage or processing of chemicals, petroleum products or by-products, fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides, lime, cement, or other materials that, when inundated, will constitute a hazard to life, health and safety, or adversely affect the quality of surface waters is prohibited at or below three feet above the base flood elevation within the SFHA. (Ord. 1606 § 5 (part), 2016).


14.12.210 Floodplain habitat assessment.

A. Assessment Required. A floodplain habitat assessment is required unless the project is exempt under subsection B of this section. A habitat assessment determines if the project is likely to have no effect, not likely to adversely affect, or likely to adversely affect critical habitat or threatened and endangered species. If required, the habitat assessment shall be prepared at the applicant’s sole expense by a qualified consultant in accordance with the requirements of the Floodplain Habitat Assessment and Mitigation Regional Guidance 2013 prepared by FEMA Region X, or any successor guidance document approved by FEMA for habitat assessment and mitigation. The city’s actual costs of review of applicant’s habitat assessment and mitigation plan shall be paid by the applicant pursuant to the city’s adopted taxes, rates and fee schedule.

B. Exemptions. Any of the following activities do not require the preparation of a floodplain habitat assessment or consideration of associated mitigation measures, even if they may require a floodplain permit:

1. Nondevelopment activities, including, but not limited to:

a. Routine maintenance of existing landscaping that does not involve grading, excavation, or filling;

b. Removal of noxious weeds and hazard trees and replacement of nonnative vegetation with native vegetation;

c. Normal maintenance of aboveground utilities and facilities, such as replacing power lines and utility poles;

d. Normal road maintenance, including filling potholes, repaving, and installing signs and traffic signals, but not including expansion of paved areas;

Article I. Findings of Fact, Need, and Purpose


14.16.010 Findings of fact.

The city of North Bend council hereby finds that:

A. Stormwater and drainage problems can cause flooding, substantial damage to public and private property, and public health hazards.

B. High volumes of stormwater can harm aquatic resources and their habitats. The frequency, duration and intensity of peak flows can erode and undercut streambanks, scour streambeds, and deposit excessive amounts of sediments. 

C. Stormwater pollution is a problem associated with land use and development. If stormwater is not treated, pollutants can degrade surface waters. Common pollutants carried by stormwater runoff include pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, petroleum products, metals, pathogens, sediments and organic toxins.

D. Stormwater problems and dangers can be reduced or avoided if property owners and future developers follow best management practices (BMPs) when clearing land and install stormwater facilities to control and treat stormwater runoff.

E. In order to perform as intended, stormwater facilities must be properly designed and constructed, and periodically inspected and maintained. If this is not done, these facilities can actually become sources of pollutants to surface water and groundwater. (Ord. 1118 § 1.1, 2001).


14.16.020 Purpose.

The provisions of this chapter are intended to guide and advise all who conduct new development and redevelopment within the city. The provisions of this chapter establish the minimum level of compliance which must be met to permit a property to be developed or redeveloped within the city. It is the purpose of this chapter to:

A. Minimize or eliminate the impacts of increased runoff, erosion and sedimentation caused by land disturbance, development and redevelopment;

B. Promote site planning and construction practices that seek to maintain the natural topographical, vegetative and hydrological conditions;

C. Authorize the city to require that stormwater facilities be operated, maintained and repaired in conformance with this chapter;

D. Guide all that own and/or maintain stormwater facilities within the city. The provisions of this chapter establish the minimum level of compliance that must be met for maintaining stormwater facilities within the city; and

E. Provide for inspection and maintenance of stormwater facilities in the city to provide for an effective, functional stormwater drainage system. (Ord. 1118 § 1.2, 2001).

Article II. Definitions


14.16.030 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:

“Approval” means proposed or completed work conforms to this chapter in the opinion of the director.

Article I. Authority and Purpose


14.20.110 Authority.

The Shoreline Management Act (SMA) of 1971, Chapter 90.58 RCW, is the authority for the enactment and administration of this shoreline master program (SMP). (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.120 Applicability.

All proposed uses, activities, or development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to the intent and requirements of Chapter 90.58 RCW, the SMA, and this SMP whether or not a permit or other form of authorization is required. For all proposed uses, activities, or development occurring on a property or properties that are only partially within shoreline jurisdiction, only the portion of uses, activities, or development that is within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to the intent and requirements of the SMA and this SMP. See NBMC 14.20.200 for the shoreline jurisdiction description and NBMC 14.20.190 for the definition of uses, activities, and development.

The SMP applies to shoreline jurisdiction in city limits and predesignates shoreline jurisdiction in the urban growth area (UGA); this SMP will apply to shorelines in the UGA upon annexation.

Pursuant to WAC 173-27-060, direct federal agency activities affecting shoreline jurisdiction must be consistent with the SMA, SMP guidelines, and this SMP.

As recognized by RCW 90.58.350, the provisions of this SMP shall not affect treaty rights of Indian nations or tribes. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.130 Findings.

The SMP is based on the SMA, SMP guidelines, a shoreline analysis report,1 and a public visioning process.2 Key findings are identified below.

Between late 2009 and June 2012, the city completed a comprehensive update of this SMP. The update effort included a series of meetings with the North Bend planning commission, communities meetings and presentations, coordination with Ecology, meetings with the North Bend city council, as well as public involvement with local, state and federal agencies, tribes, and other interested parties (hereinafter called “stakeholders”). In 2012, public hearings were held with the North Bend planning commission and city council.

In March 2012, the city council passed Resolution 1578 and forwarded the proposed SMP update to the Washington State Department of Ecology for review and comment prior to the city’s formal adoption of the SMP in accordance with WAC 173-26-110.

The Department of Ecology accepted written public comments as required by the SMA, and reviewed the updated SMP providing specific required and recommended changes as a condition of DOE approval. The city council concurred with required changes, resulting in final adoption of the updated SMP through Ordinance 1476.

North Bend is required to periodically review and update this SMP to ensure ongoing consistency with updates to SMA guidelines (WAC 173-26-090), with the current periodic review cycle deadline of June 2019. The North Bend planning commission initiated periodic review in 2018, with a first public hearing on August 23, 2018, and a second hearing on January 10, 2019. Updates to the SMP are focused and limited to those minor updates required by SMA guidelines as well as integration of updated critical areas regulations standards. Integrated critical areas standards will ensure protection of wetlands, tributary streams, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas, and geologically hazardous areas consistent with updates to best available science (BAS), supporting the city in ongoing protection of shoreline ecological functions.

In accordance with RCW 36.70A.480, the city incorporates by reference the goals and policies of the SMP into the North Bend comprehensive plan. No updates to SMP goals and policies will occur for the 2018/19 periodic review and update. Public review of the 2018/19 periodic update will occur concurrently by the North Bend city council and DOE, consistent with WAC 173-26-090.

The shoreline jurisdiction and environment designation map is hereby adopted to support identification of known shoreline jurisdiction and shall be on file with the city and subject to updating from time to time. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.140 Purpose.

The purposes of this SMP are:

A. To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city by providing comprehensive policies and effective, reasonable regulations for development, use and protection of jurisdictional shorelines; and

B. To further assume and carry out the local government responsibilities established by the SMA in RCW 90.58.050 including planning and administering the regulatory program consistent with the policy and provisions of the SMA in RCW 90.58.020; and

C. To provide a high-quality shoreline environment where:

1. Recreational opportunities are abundant;

2. The public enjoys access to and views of shoreline areas;

3. Natural systems are preserved, restored or enhanced;

4. Ecological functions of the shoreline are maintained and improved over time;

5. Water-oriented uses are promoted consistent with the shoreline character and environmental functions; and

D. To apply special conditions to those uses which are not consistent with the control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment or are not unique to or dependent upon use of the state’s shoreline; and

E. To assure no net loss of ecological functions associated with the shoreline. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.150 Relationship to other codes, ordinances and plans.

A. All applicable federal, state, and local laws shall apply to properties in the shoreline jurisdiction.

B. In the event provisions of this SMP conflict with provisions of federal, state, county or city regulations, the provision that is most protective of shoreline resources shall prevail. It is understood that the provisions of this chapter may not allow development to occur at what otherwise might be the property’s full zoning potential.

C. The policies in the SMP, contained in the shoreline element, state the underlying objectives the regulations are intended to accomplish. The policies guide the interpretation and enforcement of the SMP regulations contained in NBMC 14.20.110 through 14.20.750. The policies are not regulations in themselves and, therefore, do not impose requirements beyond those set forth in the regulations.

D. This shoreline chapter references critical area regulations of this title applicable in shoreline jurisdiction consistent with the integrating provisions of Article III, NBMC 14.20.290. Integrated provisions provide a level of protection to critical areas assuring no net loss of shoreline ecological functions necessary to sustain shoreline natural resources (RCW 36.70A.480). Within the shoreline areas no pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics, vaccines, growth stimulants, anti-fouling agents or other chemicals shall be used until approved by all appropriate state and federal agencies. Those agencies shall include, but shall not be limited to, the Washington State Departments of Fish and Wildlife, Agriculture, and Ecology, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Evidence of such approval shall be submitted to the city. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.160 Liberal construction.

As provided for in RCW 90.58.900, the SMA is exempted from the rule of strict construction. The city shall therefore interpret the SMP not only on the basis of actual words and phrases used in it, but by also taking purposes, goals, and policies into account. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.170 Severability.

Should any section or provision of this SMP be declared invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of this SMP as a whole. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.180 Effective date.

This shoreline master program of the city of North Bend took effect 14 days after the date of the Department of Ecology’s final action approving the city’s shoreline master program. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).

Article II. Shoreline Environment Designations


14.20.210 Natural.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the “natural” environment is to protect those shoreline areas that are relatively free of human influence or that include intact or minimally degraded shoreline functions intolerant of human use. These systems require that only very low-intensity uses be allowed in order to maintain the ecological functions and ecosystem-wide processes.

B. Designation Criteria. Natural environment designation should be assigned to shoreline areas if any of the following characteristics apply:

1. The shoreline is ecologically intact and therefore currently performing an important, irreplaceable function or ecosystem-wide process that would be damaged by human activity;

2. The shoreline is considered to represent ecosystems and geologic types that are of particular scientific and educational interest; or

3. The shoreline is unable to support new development or uses without significant adverse impacts on ecological functions or risk to human safety.

C. Management Policies.

1. Any use or development activity that would degrade the ecological functions or adversely alter the natural character of the shoreline area should be severely limited or prohibited.

2. Development activity in the natural environment should only be permitted when no suitable alternative site is available on the subject property outside of shoreline jurisdiction.

3. The following new uses should not be allowed in the natural environment:

a. Commercial uses.

b. Industrial uses.

c. Non-water-oriented recreation.

d. Roads, utility corridors, and parking areas that can be located outside of natural-designated shorelines.

4. Single-family residential development may be allowed as a conditional use within the natural environment if the density and intensity of such use is limited as necessary to protect ecological functions and be consistent with the purpose of the environment.

5. Commercial forestry may be allowed as a conditional use provided it meets the conditions of the State Forest Practices Act and its implementing rules, and is conducted in a manner consistent with the purpose of this environment designation.

6. Development, when feasible, should be designed and located to preclude the need for shoreline stabilization, flood control measures, native vegetation removal, or other shoreline modifications.

a. Development activity or land surface modification that would reduce the capability of vegetation to perform normal ecological functions should be prohibited.

b. Subdivision of property in a configuration that, to achieve its intended purpose, will require significant vegetation removal or shoreline modification that adversely impacts ecological functions should not be allowed. Each new parcel must be able to support its intended development without significant adverse ecological impacts on the shoreline ecological functions.

7. Limited access may be permitted for scientific, historical, cultural, educational and low-intensity water-oriented recreational purposes, provided there are no significant adverse ecological impacts. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.220 Urban conservancy.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the “urban conservancy” environment is to protect and restore ecological functions of open space, parks, floodplains and floodways, other critical areas, and other undeveloped areas with low levels of alteration, while allowing a variety of compatible uses. The urban conservancy environment contains two sub-environments: urban conservancy – residential for areas with moderate to high levels of ecological function that can or do appropriately accommodate shoreline priority residential uses, or urban conservancy – recreation/open space for areas that are highly valued for recreation and public access, contain critical areas such as wetlands or floodplains, and/or have low levels of alteration corresponding to moderate to high ecological function.

B. Urban Conservancy – Residential Designation Criteria. This designation is appropriate for lands containing or planned for low-density single-family uses, which:

1. Have potential for ecological restoration;

2. Retain important ecological functions, even though partially developed; and/or

3. Have potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.

C. Urban Conservancy – Recreation/Open Space Designation Criteria. This designation is appropriate for lands:

1. Containing or suitable for parks and recreation facilities or other water-enjoyment uses;

2. Suitable for water-related uses;

3. Designated as open space, floodplain or other sensitive areas that should not be more intensively developed;

4. Having potential for ecological restoration;

5. Retaining important ecological functions, even though partially developed; or

6. Having potential for development that is compatible with ecological restoration.

D. Management Policies. All urban conservancy environments should be managed consistent with the following policies:

1. Allowed uses should be those that preserve the natural character of the area and/or promote preservation and restoration within critical areas and public open spaces either directly or over the long term.

2. Uses that result in restoration of ecological functions should be allowed if the use is otherwise compatible with the purpose of the environment and the setting.

3. Restoration of shoreline ecological functions should be a priority.

4. Development, when feasible, should be designed to ensure that any necessary shoreline stabilization, flood control measures, native vegetation removal, or other shoreline modifications do not result in a net loss of shoreline ecological function or further degrade other shoreline values.

5. Public access and public recreation objectives should be implemented, except on existing single-family lots, whenever feasible and significant adverse ecological impacts can be mitigated.

6. Recognize that single-family residential development is a preferred use, and is a priority use when developed in a manner consistent with control of pollution and prevention of damage to the natural environment.

7. Water-oriented uses should be given priority over non-water-oriented uses.

8. Commercial and industrial uses, other than limited commercial activities conducted accessory to a public park, should be prohibited. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.230 Commercial conservancy.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the “commercial conservancy” environment is to accommodate commercial and employment park land uses, such as office, retail, transportation, warehouse, manufacturing, and mixed use developments, together with appropriate accessory uses, while protecting the existing ecological functions of floodways, floodplains and other critical areas.

B. Designation Criteria. Assign a commercial conservancy environment designation to shoreline areas within city limits and urban growth areas if they currently support commercial, employment park, or mixed use developments, are suitable and planned for such uses, or are located near the core of downtown North Bend. This environment designation recognizes that in North Bend’s shoreline jurisdiction, undeveloped lands planned for such uses are typically constrained by critical areas and the governing regulations as integrated by reference by NBMC 14.20.290.

C. Management Policies.

1. Allowed urban uses should be sited outside of critical areas and their buffers and should be preferentially located to minimize alteration of other vegetated areas consistent with the commercial conservancy development standards and the shoreline vegetation conservation regulations.

2. Give first priority to water-dependent uses, and second to water-related and water-enjoyment uses.

3. Non-water-oriented uses may be allowed as part of an existing or mixed use development, where they do not conflict with or limit opportunities for water-oriented uses, on sites where there is no direct access to the shoreline, or when associated with public access or ecological restoration.

4. Visual and physical access should be implemented whenever feasible and adverse ecological impacts can be avoided. Continuous public access along the shoreline should be provided, preserved or enhanced consistent with the public access regulations in NBMC 14.20.320.

5. Aesthetic objectives should be implemented by means such as sign control regulations, appropriate development siting, screening and architectural standards, and maintenance of natural vegetative buffers where they exist.

6. Full utilization of existing urban areas should be achieved before further expansion of the commercial conservancy designation is allowed.

7. No net loss of shoreline ecological functions as a result of new development should be assured by application of SMP policies and regulations.

8. Where applicable, new development shall include environmental cleanup and restoration of the shoreline to comply in accordance with any relevant state and federal law. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019; Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.240 Shoreline residential.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the shoreline residential environment is to accommodate current and planned higher-density residential development and appurtenant structures, as well as appropriate public access and recreational uses, in areas suited for urban densities.

B. Designation Criteria. Assign a shoreline residential environment designation to properties in the city limits or urban growth areas with predominantly single-family or multifamily residential development or that are planned and platted for residential development.

C. Management Policies.

1. Standards for buffers, lot coverage limitations, shoreline stabilization, vegetation conservation, critical area protection, and water quality should mitigate adverse impacts on and maintain shoreline ecological functions.

2. Access, utilities, and public services should be available and adequate to serve existing needs and/or planned future development.

3. Visual and physical access should be implemented whenever feasible and adverse ecological impacts can be avoided. Continuous public access along the shoreline should be provided, preserved or enhanced.

4. Water-dependent recreational uses should be permitted.

5. Limited water-oriented uses which depend on or benefit from a shoreline location should also be permitted provided the underlying zoning classifications permit such uses. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.250 Aquatic.

A. Purpose. The purpose of the “aquatic” environment is to protect, restore, and manage the unique characteristics and resources of the areas waterward of the OHWM.

B. Designation Criteria. Assign an aquatic environment designation to lands waterward of the OHWM.

C. Management Policies.

1. Provisions for the management of the aquatic environment should be directed towards maintaining and restoring shoreline ecological functions.

2. Shoreline uses and modifications should be designed and managed to prevent degradation of water quality and alteration of natural hydrographic conditions.

3. All developments and uses should be located and designed to protect public recreational uses of the water; to minimize adverse visual impacts; and to allow for the safe, unobstructed passage of fish and wildlife, particularly those species dependent on migration.

4. New overwater structures for public access and public infrastructure are permitted, provided they are the minimum size necessary to support the structure’s intended use and will not preclude attainment of ecological restoration.

5. Underwater pipelines and cables should not be permitted unless demonstrated that there is no feasible alternative location based on an analysis of technology and system efficiency, and that the adverse environmental impacts are not significant or can be shown to be less than the impact of upland alternatives.

6. Uses that adversely impact the ecological functions of critical freshwater habitats should not be allowed except where necessary to achieve the objectives of RCW 90.58.020, and then only when their impacts are mitigated according to NBMC 14.20.290(B) as necessary to assure no net loss of ecological functions. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.260 Use environment interpretation.

A. Any areas within shoreline jurisdiction that are not mapped and/or designated due to minor mapping inaccuracies in the lateral extent of shoreline jurisdiction from the shoreline waterbody related to site-specific surveys of OHWM are automatically assigned the category of the contiguous waterward shoreline environment designation provided the error does not extend onto a new parcel.

B. All other areas that were not mapped in shoreline jurisdiction, but which do meet criteria in NBMC 14.20.200, Shoreline jurisdiction, shall be assigned an urban conservancy – recreation/open space designation until the shoreline can be redesignated through an SMP amendment.

C. Property shown in shoreline jurisdiction that does not meet the applicability criteria in NBMC 14.20.200, Shoreline jurisdiction, shall not be subject to the requirements of this SMP. The actual location of the OHWM must be determined at the time a development is proposed.

D. In the event of an environment designation mapping error, the shoreline administrator shall use the environment designation criteria contained in NBMC 14.20.210 through 14.20.250 to establish the appropriate shoreline environment designation. Appeals of such interpretations may be filed pursuant to Article VI of this chapter, Administration and Enforcement. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.270 Shoreline use and modification matrix.

A. Table 14.20.270 indicates which shoreline activities, uses, developments and modifications may be allowed or are prohibited in shoreline jurisdiction within each shoreline environment designation. Activities, uses, developments, and modifications are classified as follows:

1. “Permitted uses” require a shoreline substantial development permit or a shoreline exemption.

2. “Conditional uses” require a shoreline conditional use permit per NBMC 14.20.680.

3. “Prohibited” activities, uses, developments, and modifications are not allowed.

Article III of this chapter, General Regulations, and Article IV of this chapter, Use-Specific and Modification Regulations, shall be consulted for additional limitations.

B. Accessory uses shall be subject to the same shoreline permit process as their primary use.

C. Where there is a conflict between the chart and the written provisions in this SMP, the written provisions shall control.

D. Authorized uses and modifications shall be allowed only in shoreline jurisdiction where the underlying zoning allows for it and are subject to the policies and regulations of this SMP.

E. A use is considered unclassified when it is not listed in Table 14.20.270, Article III of this chapter, General Regulations, or Article IV of this chapter, Use-Specific and Modification Regulations. Any proposed unclassified use shall be classified by the shoreline administrator as permitted, conditional, or prohibited, based on the listed use to which the proposed use is most similar. If the shoreline administrator determines that the proposed use is not similar to any use in this SMP, the proposed use shall be considered prohibited.

F. If any part of a proposed activity, use, modification or development is not eligible for exemption per NBMC 14.20.660, then a shoreline substantial development permit or shoreline conditional use permit shall be required for the entire proposed development project.

G. When a specific use or modification extends into the aquatic environment and an abutting upland environment without clear separation (e.g., private moorage facility, shoreline stabilization), the most restrictive permit process shall apply to that use or modification.

H. Shoreline and critical areas buffers found in NBMC 14.20.290(B) apply to all uses and modifications unless stated otherwise in the regulations.

I. None of the allowed uses could be conducted in the floodway in any environment designation, except as allowed by Chapter 14.12 NBMC, Floodplain Management.

Notes for Table 14.20.270:

1. Permitted in those areas east of the Snoqualmie Valley Trail for Meadowbrook Farm and established areas of Tollgate Farm, consistent with the Tollgate and Meadowbrook Farm master plans.

2. Non-water-oriented commercial uses are allowed consistent with shoreline buffer requirements and NBMC 14.20.380(A) if such use provides significant public benefit and implements objectives of the Shoreline Management Act.

3. Only when accessory or associated use within a public park or private recreation facility.

4. Conditional use permit if not accessory to a public park, public recreation facility, or private recreation facility open to the public.

5. Structures or modifications installed to protect or restore ecological functions may be permitted with a shoreline substantial development permit or exemption.

6. For projects in Tollgate Farm, Meadowbrook Farm, and other publicly owned parks or landward of a public roadway, these uses shall be allowed with a substantial development permit or shoreline exemption provided projects comply with mitigation sequencing, critical areas and vegetation conservation regulations of this SMP.

7. Permitted if accessory; shoreline conditional use permit if primary use.

8. Expansion to support existing and proposed shoreline uses allowed, provided the expansion is located to have the least possible adverse effect on ecological function. When feasible, expansions should be located on the landward side of the existing corridor or outside of critical areas, consistent with the SMP. Other expansions shall be permitted as new facilities.

9. In the natural environment, only passive water-oriented recreation is allowed. Sites with fragile and unique shoreline conditions, such as high-quality wetlands and wildlife habitats, shall be used only for nonintensive recreation activities, such as trails, viewpoints, interpretive signage, and similar passive and low-impact facilities that result in no net loss of shoreline ecological function, and do not require the construction and placement of permanent structures.

10. Permitted as a conditional use only when the shoreline conditional use permit review criteria are met and when no other alternative locations are feasible.

11. New trails in the natural environment limited to primitive trails a maximum of five feet wide with the use of permeable surfaces as approved by the shoreline administrator.

12. Disposal of dredge material on shorelands or wetlands within a river’s channel migration zone shall require a shoreline conditional use permit in those limited instances when it is allowed. This provision is not intended to address discharge of dredge material into the flowing current of the river or in deep water within the channel where it does not substantially affect the geohydrologic character of the channel migration zone.

13. New roads may be permitted in the outer 10 percent in the urban conservancy – recreation/open space environment if no other alternative locations are feasible.

(Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019; Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.280 Development standards.

A. To preserve the existing and planned character of the shoreline consistent with the purposes of the shoreline environment designations, development standards are provided in Table 18.10.040. These standards apply to all use and modification unless indicated otherwise. In addition, shoreline developments shall comply with all other dimensional requirements of the North Bend Municipal Code.

B. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the dimensional performance standards of this SMP not otherwise allowed by administrative reduction or administrative modification, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a shoreline variance.

Article III. General Regulations


14.20.290 Environmental protection.

A. All project proposals, including those for which a shoreline substantial development permit is not required, shall comply with Chapter 43.21C RCW, the Washington State Environmental Policy Act.

B. All project proposals, including those for which a shoreline substantial development permit is not required, shall comply with integrated critical areas standards of NBMC Title 14 (amended by Ordinance 1688 on May 21, 2019); specifically Chapter 14.06 NBMC, Wetland Critical Areas, Chapter 14.07 NBMC, Critical Aquifer Recharge Areas, Chapter 14.09 NBMC, Streams and Other Fish and Wildlife Habitat Areas, Chapter 14.11 NBMC, Geologically Hazardous Areas, and Chapter 14.12 NBMC, Floodplain Management, except the following:

1. Activities that are exempt from the critical areas code per NBMC 14.05.130 shall comply with this program. Such activities may require a shoreline letter of exemption, shoreline substantial development permit, shoreline variance or shoreline conditional use permit consistent with the administrative provisions in Article VI of this SMP.

2. Exceptions from the critical areas code per NBMC 14.05.140 (Exceptions) shall not apply in shoreline jurisdiction. Projects that propose to vary from the standards of this SMP and integrated critical areas code standards shall require a shoreline variance according to the provisions of this SMP and Chapter 173-27 WAC.

3. Variances from the critical areas code per NBMC 14.05.150 (Variances) shall not apply in shoreline jurisdiction. All requests for variances within shoreline jurisdiction shall require a shoreline variance according to the provisions of this SMP and Chapter 173-27 WAC.

4. Procedural provisions, such as definitions in NBMC 14.05.040, appeals per NBMC 14.05.120, and enforcement and inspections per NBMC 14.05.100, within shoreline jurisdiction shall be governed by this SMP and not the critical areas code.

5. Permitted activities provided in NBMC 14.06.030 (permitted alterations – wetlands), 14.09.040 (permitted alterations – streams and other fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas), and 14.11.050 (performance standards – geologically hazardous areas) shall be permitted and shall not require a shoreline variance when consistent with this SMP and all applicable critical areas ordinance standards. Such activities shall be reviewed and permitted consistent with this SMP, and shall require a shoreline letter of exemption, shoreline substantial development permit, or shoreline conditional use permit consistent with the administrative provisions in Article VI of this SMP.

6. Buffers. The following buffers are the minimum requirements for streams in shoreline areas. All buffers shall be measured horizontally from the OHWM, and may be modified consistent with the critical area provisions.

a. Type S streams shall have the following buffers:

i. Natural environment designation: 150 feet (regulated entirely as “inner buffer”).

ii. Urban conservancy – recreational/open space environment designation: 150 feet, divided between the waterward 100 feet (“inner buffer”) and the landward 50 feet (“outer buffer”).

iii. Urban conservancy – residential environment designation: 100 feet or 20 feet from the edge of the floodway, whichever is greater, divided between the waterward 75 feet (“inner buffer”) and the remainder of the buffer (“outer buffer”).

iv. Shoreline Residential Environment Designation.

(A) Middle Fork Snoqualmie River: 85 feet, divided between the waterward 50 feet (“inner buffer”) and the landward 35 feet (“outer buffer”).

(B) South Fork Snoqualmie River: 35 feet from the OHWM or 20 feet from the edge of the floodway, whichever is greater, except that development landward of a levee shall have a buffer measured 30 feet from the riverside top of the levee. The waterward 25 feet measured from OHWM shall be regulated as “inner buffer” and the remainder of the buffer shall be regulated as “outer buffer” (see diagrams below).

v. Commercial Conservancy Environment Designation.

(A) Middle Fork Snoqualmie River: 75 feet from the OHWM or 20 feet from the edge of the floodway, whichever is greater, divided between the waterward 50 feet (“inner buffer”) and the remainder of the buffer (“outer buffer”).

(B) South Fork Snoqualmie River: 100 feet from the OHWM or 20 feet from the edge of the floodway, whichever is greater, divided between the waterward 75 feet (“inner buffer”) and the remainder of the buffer (“outer buffer”).

vi. When environment designations are parallel, the buffer of the waterward environment extends only to the upland edge of that environment. The buffer for the landward environment, if it extends onto the upland environment as measured from the OHWM, would apply to uses and modifications in that upland environment.

b. Type FF streams: 100 feet, divided between the waterward 75 feet (“inner buffer”) and the landward 25 feet (“outer buffer”).

c. Type Np streams shall have a 50-foot buffer on each side of the channel.

d. Type Ns streams shall have a 25-foot buffer on each side of the channel.

C. Applicants shall apply the following sequence of steps in order of priority to avoid or minimize significant adverse effects and significant ecological impacts, with subsection (C)(1) of this section being top priority:

1. Avoiding the adverse impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action;

2. Minimizing adverse impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation by using appropriate technology or by taking affirmative steps to avoid or reduce impacts;

3. Rectifying the adverse impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment to the conditions existing at the time of the initiation of the project;

4. Reducing or eliminating the adverse impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations;

5. Compensating for the adverse impact by replacing, enhancing, or providing substitute resources or environments; and

6. Monitoring the adverse impact and the compensation projects and taking appropriate corrective measures.

D. Projects that cause significant adverse ecological impacts, as defined in NBMC 14.20.190, Definitions, are not allowed unless mitigated according to subsection B of this section to avoid reduction or damage to ecosystem-wide processes and ecological functions. As part of this analysis, the applicant shall evaluate whether the project may adversely affect existing hydrologic connections between streams and wetlands, and either modify the project or mitigate any impacts as needed.

E. The city shall require mitigation measures and/or permit conditions based on the provisions of this SMP in order to mitigate adverse impacts. In order to determine acceptable mitigation or permit conditions, the shoreline administrator may require the applicant to provide the necessary environmental information and analysis, including a description of existing conditions/ecological functions and anticipated shoreline impacts, along with a mitigation plan outlining how proposed mitigation measures would result in no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

F. When compensatory measures are appropriate pursuant to the mitigation priority sequence above, preferential consideration shall be given to measures that replace the adversely impacted functions directly and in the immediate vicinity of the adverse impact. However, alternative compensatory mitigation within the watershed that addresses limiting factors or identified critical needs for shoreline resource conservation based on watershed or comprehensive resource management plans, including the shoreline restoration plan, applicable to the area of adverse impact may be authorized. Authorization of compensatory mitigation measures may require appropriate safeguards, terms or conditions as necessary to ensure no net loss of ecological functions.

G. In addition to any requirements for specific critical areas found in this title, Environmental Protection, mitigation plans for any adverse impacts on ecological functions resulting from use, activity or development in shoreline jurisdiction, both inside and outside of critical areas, shall address the following:

1. Inventory existing shoreline environment including the physical, chemical and biological elements and provide an assessment of their condition;

2. A discussion of the project’s compliance with mitigation sequencing requirements and remaining unavoidable adverse impacts on the ecological functions;

3. A discussion of any federal, state, or local special management recommendations which have been developed for critical areas or other species or habitats located on the site;

4. A discussion of measures to preserve existing habitats and opportunities to restore habitats that were degraded prior to the proposed land use activity;

5. A discussion of proposed measures which mitigate the adverse impacts of the project to ensure no net loss of shoreline ecological functions;

6. Scaled drawings of existing and proposed conditions, materials specifications, and a five-year maintenance and monitoring plan, including performance standards;

7. A discussion of proposed management practices which will protect fish and wildlife habitat both during construction and after the project site has been fully developed;

8. Contingency plan if the mitigation fails to meet established success criteria; and

9. Any additional information necessary to determine the adverse impacts of a proposal and mitigation of the impacts. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.300 Shoreline vegetation conservation.

A. Vegetation conservation standards shall not apply retroactively to existing uses and developments. Vegetation associated with existing structures, uses and developments may be maintained within shoreline jurisdiction as stipulated in the approval documents for the development.

B. Regulations specifying establishment and management of shoreline buffers are located in NBMC 14.20.290(B), Streams. Vegetation within shoreline buffers, other stream buffers, and wetlands and wetland buffers shall be managed consistent with critical area regulations as integrated by NBMC 14.20.290.

C. Vegetation outside of shoreline buffers, other stream buffers, and wetlands and wetland buffers and within shoreline jurisdiction shall be managed according to this section, NBMC 14.20.290, Environmental protection, and any other regulations specific to vegetation management contained in other articles of this chapter.

D. Vegetation clearing outside of wetlands and wetland and stream buffers shall be limited to the minimum necessary to accommodate approved shoreline development that is consistent with all other provisions of this SMP. Mitigation sequencing shall be applied so that the design and location of the structure or development minimizes native vegetation removal. Development or uses that require vegetation clearing shall be designed to avoid the following in the order indicated below, with subsection (D)(1) of this section being the most desirable vegetation to retain:

1. Native significant trees.

2. Nonnative significant trees.

3. Native and nonnative nonsignificant trees.

4. Other native vegetation.

E. Tree Retention and Removal Requirements. Tree retention and removal standards within shoreline jurisdiction shall be enforced consistent with applicable sections of Chapter 19.10 NBMC, including standards for tree retention and tree density requirements within NBMC 19.10.091, 19.10.092, 19.10.093, 19.10.094, and 19.10.095.

F. Repealed by Ord. 1701.

G. Repealed by Ord. 1701.

H. Revegetation Option. Based upon recommendations in a report by the shoreline administrator, removal of areas of vegetation that might normally be saved may be permitted if extensive revegetation is accomplished. Such alternative may be desirable for sites with significant physical limitations such as topography or soil type, or where limitations of existing trees such as particular species or deteriorated health of a particular tree stand may make such options desirable. On a site with documented special circumstances, an alternative allowing removal of vegetation normally saved may be approved with a comprehensive revegetation plan prepared by an arborist and reviewed and approved by the shoreline administrator or her/his designee. At a minimum, the plan shall include:

1. Information required under NBMC 14.20.650, and any additional requirements found in NBMC 19.10.050 through 19.10.070;

2. Consideration of the standards provided in subsection E of this section;

3. An evaluation of what circumstances are present in specific areas of the site to make incorporation of topography and existing vegetation undesirable and recommendations on what areas if any can be designed to accommodate existing vegetation;

4. Consideration of overstory and understory vegetative species to provide wildlife habitat and meet specific purposes important to the neighborhood environment and project design such as buffers, green belts, open spaces, street trees, urban beautification, solar access and other functions and purposes deemed desirable and appropriate to the anticipated use;

5. A comprehensive map showing location, number, types of species and size of planned vegetative improvements;

6. A timeline for completion of improvements;

7. An estimate of the value of vegetation that would normally be saved but that is being removed under this option. Said estimate must be accomplished pursuant to the most recent guidelines established by the International Society of Arboriculture in its “Guide to the Professional Evaluation of Landscape Trees, Specimen Shrubs and Evergreens”;

8. Said plan shall provide for a commensurate value of vegetation to be installed as is to be taken out under this option. Said amount shall be 150 percent of what is normally required for landscaping in the projects not utilizing this option. The calculated value of the vegetation shall include only vegetative material and shall not include the applicant’s administrative or labor costs, or the costs of the city’s arborist;

9. A maintenance plan which includes provision for a grass, shrub and tree maintenance program and provides for adequate water supply until the plantings are established;

10. If any existing vegetation is to be saved, a plan shall be provided for the protection of said vegetation during construction activity, including fencing and other protective measures deemed necessary by the shoreline administrator; and

11. The performance and maintenance bond requirements of the city landscape code shall apply to revegetation plans.

I. Where adverse impacts on shoreline vegetation are permitted after mitigation sequencing has been applied as outlined in NBMC 14.20.290(B), new developments or site alterations shall be required to develop and implement a mitigation plan. Mitigation plans shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall contain information required in NBMC 14.20.290(F). Mitigation measures shall be maintained over the life of the use and/or development.

J. Where native shoreline vegetation must be removed to accommodate a temporary staging area necessary to implement an allowed use, the area must be immediately stabilized and restored with native vegetation once construction is complete.

K. Selective pruning of trees for safety or view protection is allowed. Where trees pose a significant safety hazard as indicated in a written report by a certified arborist or other qualified professional, they may be removed or converted to wildlife snags if the hazard cannot be eliminated by pruning, crown thinning or other technique that maintains some habitat function.

L. Vegetation removal conducted without city authorization requires the submittal and approval of a restoration plan prepared by a qualified professional as defined in NBMC 14.20.190. The mitigation plan must utilize only native vegetation, and should be designed to compensate for temporal loss of function and address the specific functions adversely impacted by the unauthorized vegetation removal.

M. With the exception of hand removal or spot-spraying of invasive or noxious weeds on shorelands, the determination of whether nonnative vegetation removal may be allowed in shoreline jurisdiction must be evaluated in conformance with this section, NBMC 14.20.290 (Environmental protection), and critical area regulation as integrated by reference by NBMC 14.20.290. Such removal of noxious weeds and/or invasive species shall be incorporated in mitigation plans, as necessary, to prevent erosion and facilitate establishment of a stable community of native plants.

N. Aquatic weed control shall only be permitted where the presence of aquatic weeds will adversely affect native plant communities, fish and wildlife habitats, or an existing water-dependent recreational use. Aquatic weed control efforts shall comply with all applicable laws and standards. Removal using mechanical methods is preferred over chemical methods. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh.

a. To protect an existing primary structure, including residences, when conclusive evidence, documented by a geotechnical analysis, is provided that the structure is in danger from erosion caused by shoreline forces. Normal sloughing or shoreline erosion itself, without a scientific or geotechnical analysis, is not demonstration of need. The geotechnical analysis should evaluate on-site drainage issues and address drainage problems before considering shoreline stabilization.

b. In support of new non-water-dependent development, including single-family residences, when all of the conditions below apply:

i. The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as drainage or the loss of vegetation.

ii. Nonstructural measures, such as placing the development farther from the shoreline, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient to adequately address adverse erosion impacts.

iii. The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report. The damage must be caused by conditions beyond the control of the applicant, such as natural processes.

c. In support of water-dependent development when all of the conditions below apply:

i. The erosion is not being caused by upland conditions, such as drainage, the presence of upstream development, or the loss of vegetation.

ii. Nonstructural measures, such as planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements, are not feasible or not sufficient to adequately address erosion causes or adverse impacts.

iii. The need to protect primary structures from damage due to erosion is demonstrated through a geotechnical report.

d. To protect projects for the restoration of ecological functions or for hazardous substance remediation projects pursuant to Chapter 70.105D RCW when nonstructural measures, planting vegetation, or installing on-site drainage improvements is not feasible or not sufficient to adequately address erosion causes or adverse impacts.

C. Replacement of Existing Shoreline Stabilization Structures.

1. For purposes of this section, “replacement” means the construction of new shoreline stabilization to perform the shoreline stabilization function of an existing structure which can no longer adequately serve its purpose due to age, deterioration, or increased flood flow rates and volumes. Replacements that include additions to or increases in size of existing shoreline stabilization measures shall be considered new structures.

2. An existing structural stabilization structure may be replaced subject to the following provisions:

a. There is a demonstrated need to protect principal uses or structures from erosion caused by shoreline forces.

b. Replacement hard structural shoreline stabilization measures protecting existing residences shall not encroach waterward of the OHWM or waterward of the existing shoreline stabilization measure unless the residence was occupied prior to January 1, 1992, and there are overriding safety or environmental concerns. In such cases, the replacement structure shall abut the existing shoreline stabilization structure. All other replacement hard structural shoreline stabilization measures shall be located at or landward of the existing shoreline stabilization structure.

c. Hard shoreline stabilization measures may allow some accessory fill (gravel, cobble or smaller material only) waterward of the OHWM to provide enhancement of shoreline ecological functions through improvements in substrate condition or gradient.

d. Soft shoreline stabilization measures that provide restoration of shoreline ecological functions may be permitted waterward of the OHWM.

3. When replacement is allowed pursuant to the provisions of subsection (C)(2) of this section, an existing structural stabilization structure shall be replaced with the softest stabilization measure that will provide the necessary level of stabilization consistent with the findings of the required submittal documents outlined in subsection H of this section.

D. Repair of Existing Shoreline Stabilization Structures.

1. For purposes of this section, “repair” means modifications or improvements to an existing shoreline stabilization structure that are designed to ensure the continued function of the structure by preventing failure of any part.

2. “Repair” shall not include:

a. Additions to or increases in size of existing shoreline stabilization structures. Such additions or increases shall be considered new or enlarged structures.

b. The placement of a new shoreline stabilization structure landward of a failing shoreline stabilization structure. Such placement shall be considered a new structure.

c. Replacement of greater than 50 percent of the linear length of existing shoreline stabilization structure when an existing structure, including its footing or bottom course of rock, is removed prior to placement of new shoreline stabilization materials (repairs that involve only removal of material above the footing or bottom course of rock are not considered replacement). Such activity must be designed and reviewed as a replacement structure.

E. General Design and Construction Standards.

1. Areas of temporary disturbance within the shoreline buffer shall be stabilized within seven days of project completion, and revegetated within 30 days using plant species that will return the area to its preproject condition or better.

2. Soft shoreline stabilization structures shall be used to the maximum extent practicable for new, enlarged, and replacement of legally established shoreline stabilization structures, limiting hard shoreline stabilization structures to the portion or portions of those sites determined necessary to protect or support existing shoreline structures or trees, or where necessary to connect to existing hard structural shoreline stabilization structures on adjacent properties. Hard structural shoreline stabilization transition areas between the applicant’s otherwise soft shoreline structure and the adjacent hardened shoreline, when needed on the subject property to prevent destabilization of adjacent hardened shorelines, shall be minimized and extend into the subject property from the property line no more than 10 feet.

3. For enlarged or replacement shoreline stabilization structures, the following location and design standards are preferred in descending order:

a. Conduct excavation and fill activities associated with the structural shoreline stabilization landward of the existing OHWM except as authorized above.

b. Where subsection (E)(3)(a) of this section is not practicable because of overriding safety or environmental concerns, conduct necessary excavation and fill activities waterward of the existing OHWM as needed to implement a soft structural shoreline stabilization technique or to mitigate the adverse impacts of adjacent hard structural shoreline stabilization.

4. All shoreline stabilization activities shall minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts on ecological functions resulting from short-term construction. Impact minimization techniques may include compliance with appropriate timing restrictions, use of BMPs to prevent adverse water-quality impacts related to upland or in-water work, and stabilization of exposed soils following construction.

5. New and enlarged shoreline stabilization structures shall mitigate any adverse impacts on ecological functions by incorporating the following measures, at a minimum, if appropriate for local conditions:

a. Restoration of appropriate substrate conditions waterward of the OHWM, including substrate composition and gradient. The material should be sized and placed to remain stable during a two-year flood event.

b. Plant native riparian vegetation, as necessary, along at least 75 percent of the shoreline frontage affected by the new or enlarged stabilization. The vegetated portion of the shoreline buffer shall average 10 feet in depth from the OHWM, but may be a minimum of 10 feet wide to allow for variation in landscape bed shape and plant placement. Restoration of native vegetation shall consist of a mixture of trees, shrubs, and ground cover and be designed to improve habitat functions. At least six trees per 100 linear feet of shoreline must be included in the plan. Plant materials must be native to King County. An alternative planting plan or mitigation measure in lieu of meeting these requirements may be allowed if approved by other state and federal agencies.

6. The shoreline stabilization structure shall not interfere with normal surface and/or subsurface drainage into the waterbody.

7. Shoreline stabilization structures shall not extend waterward of the OHWM, except for shoreline stabilization which enhances shoreline ecological functions or is allowed under subsection (C)(2)(b) of this section.

8. When repair or replacement shoreline stabilization structures intended to improve ecological functions shift the OHWM landward of the premodification location, any buffers from the OHWM or lot area for the purposes of calculating lot coverage shall be measured from the premodification location. The premodification OHWM shall be noted in a record of survey approved by the city of North Bend and recorded at the King County recorder’s office.

9. Repair or replacement shoreline stabilization measures which relocate the OHWM landward of the premodification location, and result in an expansion of the shoreline jurisdiction on any property other than the subject property, shall not be approved until the applicant submits a copy of a statement signed by the legal owners of all affected properties, on a form approved by the city of North Bend and recorded at the King County recorder’s office, consenting to the shoreline jurisdiction creation and/or increase on such property.

10. The use of car bodies, scrap building materials, or any other form of solid waste for shoreline stabilization is prohibited. Organic materials normally used for habitat enhancement or bioengineering methods shall not be considered solid waste under this provision.

11. Proponents shall mitigate for any adverse impacts on ecological functions, and shall restore all fish or wildlife habitat damaged or degraded as a result of their project. Where applicants demonstrate that restoration is not feasible, adverse impacts shall be mitigated with the creation of in-kind habitat near the project.

12. All soft structure shoreline stabilization projects and mitigation for hard structural shoreline stabilization projects shall use an appropriately diverse variety of self-sustaining native plant materials including trees, shrubs and grasses, unless demonstrated to be impractical for the particular site.

13. All cleared areas shall be replanted following construction and vegetation shall be fully reestablished within three years. Cleared areas shall continue to be replanted until such time as vegetation is adequately reestablished.

14. Shoreline stabilization projects shall be periodically monitored and maintained as necessary. Damaged areas shall be promptly repaired.

15. All construction and planting activities shall be scheduled to minimize impacts on water quality and fish and wildlife aquatic and upland habitat and to optimize survival of new vegetation.

F. Design and Construction Standards for Soft Shoreline Stabilization Structures.

1. The soft structural shoreline stabilization design shall provide sufficient protection of adjacent properties by tying in with the existing contours of the adjoining properties to prevent erosion at the property line. Projects that include necessary use of hard structural shoreline stabilization measures only near property lines in order to tie in with adjacent properties shall be permitted as soft shoreline stabilization measures. The length of hard structural shoreline stabilization transition area to adjacent properties should be minimized to the maximum extent practicable, and extend into the subject property from adjacent properties no more than 10 feet. The hard structural shoreline stabilization transition area shall not extend waterward of the OHWM, except as necessary to make the connection to the adjoining stabilization, and shall not extend onto the adjacent property.

2. The soft shoreline stabilization design shall size and arrange any gravels, cobbles, logs, and boulders so that the project remains stable during a two-year flood event.

3. The sizing and placement of all materials shall be selected to accomplish the following objectives:

a. Protect the primary structures from erosion and other damage over the long term and accommodate the normal amount of alteration from shoreline forces; and

b. Allow safe passage and migration of fish and wildlife.

G. Design and Construction Standards for Hard Structural Shoreline Stabilization Structures.

1. All new, enlarged, or replacement hard structural shoreline stabilization structures should minimize any long-term adverse impacts on ecological functions by incorporating the following measures into the design:

a. Limiting the size of hard shoreline stabilization structures to the minimum necessary to protect existing upland development, including length, height, depth, and mass.

b. Shifting the hard shoreline stabilization structures landward and/or sloping the hard shoreline stabilization structures landward to provide some dissipation of energy and increase the quality or quantity of habitat.

2. When hard structural shoreline stabilization is approved on a site where hard structural shoreline stabilization is not located on adjacent properties, the construction of hard structural shoreline stabilization shall tie in with the existing contours of the adjoining properties, as feasible, such that the proposed stabilization would not cause erosion of the adjoining properties.

3. The following provisions apply when hard structural shoreline stabilization is approved on a site where hard structural shoreline stabilization is located on adjacent properties:

a. The proposed stabilization may tie in flush with existing stabilization measures on adjoining properties; provided, that:

i. The new stabilization does not extend waterward of the OHWM, except as necessary to make the connection to the adjoining stabilization, and

ii. The new stabilization does not extend onto the adjacent property.

b. Where a portion of stabilization extends waterward of the OHWM per subsection (G)(3)(a)(i) of this section, the remaining portion of the stabilization shall be placed landward of the existing OHWM such that no net intrusion into the waterbody occurs nor does net creation of uplands occur.

c. The length of hard structural shoreline stabilization transition area to adjacent properties should be minimized to the maximum extent practicable, and extend into the subject property from adjacent properties no more than 10 feet.

4. Backfill behind hard structural shoreline stabilization intended to protect single-family residences shall be limited to one cubic yard per running foot of stabilization. Any filling in excess of this amount shall be considered a regulated activity subject to the regulations in this SMP pertaining to fill activities and the requirement for obtaining a shoreline substantial development permit or shoreline conditional use permit.

H. Submittal Requirements.

1. For all new, enlarged, or replacement structural shoreline stabilization structures (including soft shoreline stabilization structures), detailed construction plans, including, but not limited to, the following:

a. Plan and cross-section views of the existing and proposed shoreline configuration, showing accurate existing and proposed topography and OHWMs.

b. Detailed construction sequence and specifications for all materials, including gravels, cobbles, boulders, logs, and vegetation.

a. An assessment of the necessity for structural shoreline stabilization by estimating time frames and rates of erosion and reporting on the urgency associated with the specific situation. New hard shoreline stabilization structures shall not be authorized, except when a report confirms that there is a significant possibility that an existing structure will be damaged within three years as a result of shoreline erosion in the absence of such hard shoreline stabilization structures, or where waiting until the need is immediate results in the loss of opportunity to use measures that would avoid adverse impacts on ecological functions. Where the geotechnical report confirms a need to prevent potential damage to a primary structure, but the need is not as immediate as three years, the report may still be used to justify more immediate authorization to protect against erosion using soft structures.

b. An assessment of the cause of erosion, looking at processes occurring both waterward and landward of the ordinary high water line.

c. An assessment of alternative measures to shoreline stabilization, including:

i. Placing the development farther from the OHWM.

ii. Correcting any on-site groundwater or drainage issues that may be causing shoreline erosion.

d. Where structural shoreline stabilization is determined to be necessary, the assessment must evaluate the feasibility of using soft shoreline stabilization structures in lieu of hard structural shoreline stabilization structures. Soft shoreline stabilization may include the use of gravels, cobbles, boulders, and logs, as well as vegetation.

e. Design recommendations for minimum sizing of hard or soft structural shoreline stabilization materials, including gravel and cobble beach substrates necessary to dissipate wave energy, eliminate scour, and provide long-term shoreline stability.

3. For replacements of existing hard shoreline stabilization structures with a similar hard structure, the applicant shall submit a written narrative providing a demonstration of need. The narrative must be prepared by a qualified professional and shall consist of the following:

a. An assessment of the necessity for continued structural shoreline stabilization, considering site-specific conditions such as water depth, orientation of the shoreline, flow velocities, and location of the nearest primary structure.

b. An assessment of erosion potential resulting from natural processes operating at or waterward of the OHWM in the absence of the hard structural shoreline stabilization.

c. An assessment of alternative measures to shoreline stabilization, including:

i. Relocating the development farther from the OHWM.

ii. Correcting any on-site groundwater or drainage issues that may be causing shoreline erosion.

d. An assessment of the feasibility of using soft shoreline stabilization measures in lieu of hard structural shoreline stabilization measures. Soft structural shoreline stabilization may include the use of gravels, cobbles, boulders, and logs, as well as vegetation.

e. Design recommendations for minimizing adverse impacts of any necessary hard structural shoreline stabilization.

f. A demonstration of need may be waived when an existing hard shoreline stabilization structure is proposed to be repaired or replaced using soft shoreline stabilization structure that would result in significant restoration of shoreline ecological functions or processes. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).

3. Plant security and safety features such as fences, signage, etc.; and

4. Other accessory or auxiliary uses or features, necessary to the effective and efficient operation of the plant and which cannot feasibly be located outside the shoreline jurisdiction.

C. Expansion of existing primary utility facilities within shoreline jurisdiction must demonstrate:

1. The expansion is designed to protect adjacent shorelands from erosion, pollution, or other environmentally detrimental factors during and after construction.

2. The project is planned to fit existing natural topography as much as practical and avoid alteration of the existing natural environment.

3. Debris, overburden, and other construction waste materials shall be disposed of so as to prevent erosion or pollution of a waterbody.

D. Primary utility facilities and expansions shall include provisions to control the quantity and quality of surface water runoff to natural waterbodies, using BMPs to retain natural flow rates. A maintenance program to ensure continued proper functioning of such facilities shall be required.

E. Applications for installation of utility facilities shall include the following (at a minimum):

1. Reason why the utility facility must be in shoreline jurisdiction;

2. Alternative locations considered and reasons for their elimination;

3. Location of the same, similar, or other utility facilities in the vicinity of the proposed project;

4. Proposed method(s) of construction;

6. Landscape plans;

7. Methods to achieve no net loss of ecological function and minimize clearing of native vegetation; and

8. Consistency with city or county comprehensive plans for utilities, where such plans exist.

F. Where feasible, utilities shall be consolidated within a single easement and utilize existing rights-of-way. Any utility located within property owned by the utility provider which must of necessity cross shoreline jurisdiction shall be designed and operated to reserve the option of general public recreational usage of the right-of-way in the future. This option shall be exercised by the public only where:

1. The public will not be exposed to dangers from the utility equipment; and

2. The utility itself will not be subjected to unusual risks of damage by the public.

G. In areas where utilities must cross shoreline jurisdiction, they shall do so by the most direct route feasible, unless such a route would negatively affect an environmentally critical area, obstruct public access to the shoreline, or interfere with the navigability of a water body regulated by this SMP. See NBMC 14.09.040 for regulations governing crossings of non-shoreline streams located in shoreline jurisdiction.

H. Utility facilities shall be designed and located in a manner that protects scenic views and minimizes adverse aesthetic impacts. They must be landscaped to enhance the appearance from surrounding areas in accordance with landscape standards applicable to the underlying zone.

I. New utilities which must be constructed across shoreline jurisdiction must submit a mitigation plan demonstrating the restoration of the shoreline to at least its existing condition. Upon completion of utility installation or maintenance, any disturbed areas shall be regraded to be compatible with the natural terrain of the area and revegetated with appropriate native plants to prevent erosion.

J. All underwater pipelines or those paralleling the waterway transporting liquids potentially injurious to aquatic life or water quality shall be prohibited, unless no other alternative exists to serve a public interest. In those limited instances where permitted, shutoff valves shall be provided at both sides of the waterbody except for public sanitary sewers of a gravity or siphon nature. In all cases, no net loss of ecological functions shall be maintained.

K. Where utilities cannot cross a shoreline waterbody via a bridge or other existing water crossing, the utilities shall be bored beneath the waterbody such that the substrate is not disturbed. In channel migration areas, migration processes and depth of erosion must be analyzed. Underground utilities must be placed lower than potential scour and erosion depth. Construction of pipelines placed under aquatic areas shall be placed in a sleeve to avoid the need for excavation in the event of a failure in the future.

L. Minor trenching to allow the installation of necessary underground pipes or cables is allowed if no alternative, including boring, is feasible, and if:

1. Impacts on fish and wildlife habitat are avoided to the maximum extent possible.

2. The utility installation shall not increase or decrease the natural rate, extent, or opportunity of channel migration.

3. Appropriate BMPs are employed to prevent water quality impacts or other environmental degradation.

M. Utility installation and maintenance operations shall be conducted in a manner that does not negatively affect surface water quality or quantity.

1. Applications for new utility projects in shoreline jurisdiction shall include a list of BMPs to protect water quality.

2. Outfalls shall be designed and installed so that during periods of heavy rainfall the velocity and quantity of runoff will not be detrimental to important aquatic life in the receiving waters, and so that it does not flood adjacent land. The shoreline administrator may condition the proposed outfall location and design to assure aesthetic compatibility and to reduce adverse environmental impacts.

3. Storm drain lines for any substantial development shall be designed so that they can be economically connected to a common collector system when the level of development makes that feasible. A common collection system and outfall will be preferred to a large number of outfalls from individual parcels of land.

N. New utility lines shall be located underground, except when:

1. The presence of critical areas, groundwater, a flood threat, bedrock, or other obstructions make such placement infeasible;

2. Underground placement would create greater adverse environmental impacts than aboveground transmission; or

3. Underground placement is not feasible as the term is defined in this SMP. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).

Article V. Existing Uses,  Structures and Lots


14.20.585 Administrative provisions.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish the legal status of nonconforming uses, structures and other site improvements in shoreline jurisdiction by creating provisions through which such uses, structures and other improvements may be established, maintained, and altered.

B. Applicability.

1. All nonconformances in shoreline jurisdiction shall be subject to the provisions of this article. For nonconformance of use, structures and lots within shoreline critical areas, NBMC 14.05.160 applies. When there is a conflict between this article and critical area regulations as integrated by reference applicable to critical areas, the more restrictive standards shall apply.

2. The provisions of this article do not supersede or relieve a property owner from compliance with:

a. The requirements of the International Building and Fire Codes; or

b. The provisions of the SMP beyond the specific nonconformance addressed by this article.

3. A change in the required permit review process (e.g., shoreline substantial development permit versus a shoreline conditional use permit) shall not create a nonconformance.

4. Any nonconformance that is brought into conformance for any period of time shall forfeit status as nonconformance, except as specified in Chapter 18.30 NBMC.

5. A nonconforming lot, use, or structure may be deemed legally nonconforming by providing documentation that the use in question occurred prior to the effective date of this SMP, from one of the following:

a. Local agency permit;

b. Orthophoto, aerial photo or planimetric mapping recognized as legitimate by the agency; or

c. Tax record. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.590 Nonconforming uses.

A. If, at the effective date of this SMP and any amendment thereto, a lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this SMP or amendments thereto, such use may be continued as a nonconforming use so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following conditions:

1. No nonconforming use shall be intensified, enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the effective date of this SMP or amendment that made the use no longer permissible; provided, that a nonconforming use may be enlarged, increased or extended in conformance with applicable bulk and dimensional standards of this SMP upon approval of a shoreline conditional use permit.

2. No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot which contains the nonconforming use.

3. If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of one year over a three-year period, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this SMP for the use environment in which such land is located.

4. A structure which is being or has been used for a nonconforming use may be used for a different nonconforming use only upon a finding that:

a. No reasonable alternative conforming use is practical; and

b. The proposed use will be at least as consistent with the policies and provisions of the Act and the SMP and as compatible with the uses in the area as the preexisting use.

c. In addition, such conditions may be attached to the permit as are deemed necessary to assure compliance with the above findings, the requirements of the master program and the Act and to assure that the use will not become a nuisance or a hazard. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.600 Nonconforming structures.

A. If, at the effective date of this SMP or any amendment thereto, a lawful structure or other improvement exists which is made no longer permissible under the terms of this SMP or amendment thereto, such structure or other improvement may be continued as a nonconforming structure or other improvement so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following conditions:

1. No nonconforming structure or other improvement shall be altered or changed in a way which increases its nonconformity except as allowed in subsection (A)(2) of this section.

2. Expansions of structures that are nonconforming with respect to a required shoreline buffer:

a. May not encroach any farther waterward into the required shoreline buffer.

b. Are limited to lateral extensions adding no more than 25 percent of the length of the original wall as it existed prior to SMP adoption, subject to other applicable requirements of this SMP, including mitigation sequencing, and city development regulations.

c. Any lateral enlargement of the building footprint within the shoreline buffer shall not exceed 25 percent of the gross floor area of the structure prior to the expansion. Enlargements upland of the existing building footprint are not limited.

d. Applicants for such expansions in subsection (2)(b) or (c) of this section shall restore a portion of the shoreline buffer with riparian vegetation at a 1:1 area ratio to offset the adverse impact, such that the shoreline buffer will function at an equivalent or higher level than the existing conditions. When such expansions occur upland of an existing levee, the applicant’s critical areas report may justify a smaller ratio; provided, that the study demonstrates no net loss of ecological functions.

e. Greater expansions or alterations of a nonconforming structure require a shoreline variance.

3. Nothing in this section will prohibit vertical expansion up to the height allowed in the applicable use environment, provided all other applicable requirements of city development regulations are met.

4. Upkeep, repairs and maintenance of a nonconforming structure or other improvement shall be permitted.

B. Residential structures and appurtenant structures that were legally established and are used for a conforming use, but that do not meet standards for the following, shall be considered a conforming structure: setbacks, buffers, or yards; area; bulk; height; or density.

C. Redevelopment, expansion, change with the class of occupancy, or replacement of the residential structure shall be consistent with the master program, including requirements for no net loss of shoreline ecological functions.

D. For purposes of this section, “appurtenant structures” means garages, sheds, and other legally established structures. “Appurtenant structures” does not include bulkheads and other shoreline modifications or over-water structures. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.610 Maintenance, repair, discontinuation or reconstruction of damaged nonconforming structures or other improvements.

A. This section only applies to nonconformities to this SMP.

B. A legal nonconforming structure may be maintained, repaired, renovated or structurally altered provided such maintenance, repair or alteration does not increase its nonconformity.

C. All expansion, extension, maintenance or repair activities of nonconforming structures or improvements shall be consistent with all other provisions of this code, provided the cumulative cost of such maintenance or repair within any 180-day period shall not exceed 50 percent of the assessed valuation of such building, structure, or land (as applicable) at the time such maintenance is completed.

D. A nonconforming structure or other improvement destroyed by fire or acts of nature may be repaired or reconstructed to the same or smaller nonconformity that existed at the time the structure was destroyed; provided, that:

1. The repair or reconstruction does not increase the previous nonconformity;

2. The building permit application for repair or reconstruction is submitted within 12 months of the occurrence of damage;

3. The number of off-street parking stalls are not reduced; and

4. Landscaping fully complies with applicable city requirements.

E. Should such structure or other improvement be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the use environment in which it is located. Conformance shall be required when:

1. A change of use is proposed;

2. The use is terminated or discontinued for more than one year, or the structure(s) that houses the use is vacated for more than one year; or

3. The structure(s) or activity that occurs on the land in which the use is conducted is proposed for relocation. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).

B. The city shall consult with Ecology if formal written interpretations are developed as a result of a lack of clear guidance in the Act, the SMP guidelines, or this master program to ensure that any are consistent with the purpose and intent of Chapter 90.58 RCW and Chapter 173-26 WAC. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.640 Statutory noticing requirements.

The city and applicants shall follow the noticing requirements of Chapter 20.03 NBMC. At a minimum the city shall provide notice in accordance with WAC 173-27-110, and may provide for additional noticing requirements. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.650 Application requirements.

A. A complete application for a shoreline substantial development, shoreline conditional use, or shoreline variance permit shall contain, at a minimum, the information listed in WAC 173-27-180.

B. The shoreline administrator may vary or waive these requirements according to administrative application requirements on a case-by-case basis.

C. The shoreline administrator may require additional specific information depending on the nature of the proposal and the presence of sensitive ecological features or issues related to compliance with other city requirements, and the provisions of this SMP. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.660 Exemptions from shoreline substantial development permits.

A. An exemption from the shoreline substantial development permit process is not an exemption from compliance with the SMA or this SMP, or from any other regulatory requirements. All proposed uses, activities, or development occurring within shoreline jurisdiction must conform to the intent and requirements of Chapter 90.58 RCW, the SMA, and this SMP whether or not a permit or other form of authorization is required.

B. The city shall exempt from the shoreline substantial development permit requirement the shoreline developments listed in WAC 173-27-040 and RCW 90.58.030(3)(e) (substantial development less than $7,047), RCW 90.58.030(3)(e)(xiii) (Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), 90.58.140(9) (governor certification), 90.58.147 (improvements for fish and wildlife habitat or fish passage), 90.58.355 (hazardous substance remedial actions) and 90.58.515 (watershed restoration projects).

C. Letters of exemption shall be issued by the city when an exemption applies or when a letter of exemption is required by the provisions of WAC 173-27-050.

D. Interpretations of Exemptions.

1. Exemptions shall be construed narrowly. Only those developments that meet the precise terms of one or more of the listed exemptions may be granted exemption from the shoreline substantial development permit process.

2. A development or use that is listed as a conditional use pursuant to this SMP, or is an unlisted use, must obtain a shoreline conditional use permit even though the development or use does not require a shoreline substantial development permit. When a development or use is proposed that does not comply with the bulk, dimensional and performance standards of this SMP, such development or use can only be authorized by approval of a shoreline variance.

3. The burden of proof that a development or use is exempt from the permit process is on the applicant.

4. If any part of a proposed development is not eligible for exemption, then a shoreline substantial development permit is required for the entire proposed development project.

5. The city may attach conditions to the approval of exempted developments and/or uses as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the SMA and this SMP. Additionally, nothing shall interfere with each responsible local government’s ability to require compliance with all other applicable laws and plans. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.670 Shoreline substantial development permits.

A. A shoreline substantial development permit shall be required for all development of shorelines, unless the proposal is specifically exempted per NBMC 14.20.660. Shoreline substantial development permits shall be processed with a Type I administrative permit as set forth in NBMC 20.01.004.

B. A shoreline substantial development permit shall be granted only when the development proposed is consistent with:

1. The policies and procedures of the Act, Chapter 90.58 RCW;

2. The applicable provisions of Chapter 173-27 WAC; and

3. This SMP.

C. The city may attach conditions to the approval of permits as necessary to assure consistency of the project with the SMA and this SMP.

D. Nothing shall interfere with the city’s ability to require compliance with all other applicable plans and laws. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.680 Shoreline conditional use permits.

A. Uses specifically classified or set forth in this SMP as conditional uses shall be subject to review and condition by the hearing examiner and by Ecology. Applications for a shoreline conditional use permit shall be processed with a Type II permit as set forth in NBMC 20.01.004.

B. Other uses which are not classified or listed or set forth in this SMP may be authorized as conditional uses provided the applicant can demonstrate consistency with the requirements of this section and the requirements for conditional uses contained in this SMP.

C. Uses which are specifically prohibited by this SMP may not be authorized as a conditional use.

D. Review Criteria for SCUP. Uses which are classified or set forth in the applicable master program as conditional uses may be authorized; provided, that the applicant demonstrates all of the following:

1. That the proposed use is consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and the master program;

2. That the proposed use will not interfere with the normal public use of public shorelines;

3. That the proposed use of the site and design of the project are compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and shoreline master program;

4. That the proposed use will cause no significant adverse effects to the shoreline environment in which it is to be located; and

5. That the public interest suffers no substantial detrimental effect.

E. In the granting of all conditional use permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if conditional use permits were granted for other developments in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the conditional uses shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not produce substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment.

F. In authorizing a conditional use, special conditions may be attached to the permit by the city or Ecology to prevent undesirable effects of the proposed use and/or to assure consistency of the project with the SMA and this SMP.

G. Nothing shall interfere with the city’s ability to require compliance with all other applicable plans and laws. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.690 Shoreline variance permits.

A. The purpose of a variance is to grant relief to specific bulk or dimensional requirements set forth in this SMP where there are extraordinary or unique circumstances relating to the property such that the strict implementation of this SMP would impose unnecessary hardships on the applicant or thwart the policies set forth in RCW 90.58.020. Variances from the use regulations of the SMP are prohibited. Applications for shoreline variance permits shall be processed with a Type II procedure as set forth in NBMC 20.01.004.

B. Review Criteria.

1. Variance permits should be granted in circumstances where denial of the permit would result in a thwarting of the policy enumerated in RCW 90.58.020. In all instances the applicant must demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances shall be shown and the public interest shall suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

2. Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located landward of the OHWM, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), and/or landward of any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

a. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the SMP precludes, or significantly interferes with, reasonable use of the property;

b. That the hardship described in criterion subsection (B)(2)(a) of this section is specifically related to the property, and is the result of unique conditions such as irregular lot shape, size, or natural features and the application of the SMP, and not, for example, from deed restrictions or the applicant’s own actions;

c. That the design of the project is compatible with other authorized uses within the area and with uses planned for the area under the comprehensive plan and SMP and will not cause adverse impacts on the shoreline environment;

d. That the variance will not constitute a grant of special privilege not enjoyed by the other properties in the area;

e. That the variance requested is the minimum necessary to afford relief; and

f. That the public interest will suffer no substantial detrimental effect.

C. Variance permits for development and/or uses that will be located waterward of the OHWM, as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(b), or within any wetland as defined in RCW 90.58.030(2)(h), may be authorized provided the applicant can demonstrate all of the following:

1. That the strict application of the bulk, dimensional or performance standards set forth in the applicable master program precludes all reasonable use of the property;

2. That the proposal is consistent with the criteria established under subsections (B)(2)(a) through (f) of this section can be met; and

3. That the public rights of navigation and use of the shorelines will not be adversely affected.

D. In the granting of all variance permits, consideration shall be given to the cumulative impact of additional requests for like actions in the area. For example, if variances were granted to other developments and/or uses in the area where similar circumstances exist, the total of the variances shall also remain consistent with the policies of RCW 90.58.020 and shall not cause substantial adverse effects to the shoreline environment. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.700 Duration of permits.

The duration of permits shall be consistent with WAC 173-27-090. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.710 Initiation of development.

A. Each permit for a substantial development, shoreline conditional use or shoreline variance issued by local government shall contain a provision that construction pursuant to the permit shall not begin and is not authorized until 21 days from the date of filing with Ecology, as defined in RCW 90.58.140(6) and WAC 173-27-130, or until all review proceedings initiated within 21 days from the date of filing of the decision, except as provided in RCW 90.58.140(5)(a) and (b). The “date of filing” for a substantial development permit means that date of the actual receipt by Ecology of the final decision from the city; the applicant shall receive telephone or electronic notice from Ecology that it has received the decision followed by a written communication. With regard to a permit for a shoreline variance or a shoreline conditional use, “date of filing” means the date of transmittal of the written decision from Ecology to the city and the applicant.

B. Permits for substantial development, shoreline conditional use, or shoreline variance may be in any form prescribed and used by the city including a combined permit application form. Such forms will be supplied by the city.

C. A permit data sheet shall be submitted to Ecology with each shoreline permit. The permit data sheet form shall be consistent with WAC 173-27-990. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.720 Review process.

A. After the city’s approval of a shoreline conditional use or variance permit, the city shall submit the permit to the department for Ecology’s approval, approval with conditions, or denial. Ecology shall render and transmit to the city and the applicant its final decision approving, approving with conditions, or disapproving the permit within 30 days of the date of submittal by the city pursuant to WAC 173-27-110.

B. Ecology shall review the complete file submitted by the city on shoreline conditional use or variance permits and any other information submitted or available that is relevant to the application. Ecology shall base its determination to approve, approve with conditions or deny a conditional use permit or variance on consistency with the policy and provisions of the SMA and, except as provided in WAC 173-27-210, the criteria in WAC 173-27-160 and 173-27-170.

C. The city shall provide timely notification of Ecology’s final decision to those interested persons having requested notification from local government pursuant to WAC 173-27-130. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.730 Appeals.

A. Appeals of Shoreline Permit Decisions. City of North Bend decisions on shoreline permits may be appealed to the following “bodies” in this sequence:

1. North Bend hearings examiner or in accordance with Chapter 20.06 NBMC.

2. State Shorelines Hearings Board (SHB) in Tumwater.

3. SHB decisions may be appealed to superior court.

4. Superior court decisions may be appealed to the Court of Appeals.

5. Appeals Court decisions may be appealed to the Washington Supreme Court.

6. Appeals to the SHB and courts are governed by RCW 90.58.180 and 43.21B.001, Chapter 34.05 RCW, Part V, and Chapter 461-08 WAC.

B. Regarding administrative appeals of shoreline administrator interpretations, see NBMC 14.20.110 and 20.06.001.

C. All requests for review of any final permit decisions under Chapter 90.58 RCW and Chapter 173-27 WAC are governed by the procedures established in RCW 90.58.180 and Chapter 461-08 WAC, the rules of practice and procedure of the shorelines hearings board. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.740 Amendments to permits.

A. A permit revision is required whenever the applicant proposes substantive changes to the design, terms or conditions of a project from that which is approved in the permit. Changes are substantive if they materially alter the project in a manner that relates to its conformance to the terms and conditions of the permit, the SMP and/or the policies and provisions of Chapter 90.58 RCW. Changes which are not substantive in effect do not require approval of a revision.

B. Revisions to permits shall be considered consistent with WAC 173-27-100. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.750 Enforcement.

A. The Act provides for a cooperative program between the city and the Department of Ecology to implement and enforce the provisions of the Act and this SMP. This section provides for a variety of means of enforcement, including civil and criminal penalties, orders to cease and desist, and orders to take corrective action, in accordance with WAC 173-27-270, 173-27-280, 173-27-290, and 173-27-300 and NBMC 14.20.740. The enforcement means and penalties provided herein are not exclusive and may be taken or imposed in conjunction with, or in addition to, any other civil enforcement actions and civil penalties, injunctive or declaratory relief, criminal prosecution, actions to recover civil or criminal penalties, or any other action or sanction authorized by this section, or any other provision of the North Bend Municipal Code and land use code, or any other provision of state or federal law and regulation.

B. The shoreline administrator, with the assistance of the city attorney, shall have authority to commence and prosecute any enforcement action authorized by this section. In determining the appropriate enforcement actions to be commenced and prosecuted, the administrator shall consider the following factors:

1. The nature of the violation;

2. The extent of damage or potential future risk to the shoreline environment and its ecological functions or to the public health and safety, caused by or resulting from, whether directly or indirectly, the alleged violation;

3. The existence of knowledge, intent, or malice on behalf of the violator;

4. The economic benefit or advantage that accrued to the violator(s) as a result of the violation; and

5. The estimated actions and costs of providing adequate mitigation, restoration, rehabilitation, or enhancement, to repair or minimize any substantial adverse impacts upon the shoreline environment and its ecological functions, or the public health and safety.

C. The shoreline administrator may commence and prosecute enforcement action jointly with the Department of Ecology. Pursuant to Chapter 173-27 WAC, the Department of Ecology may initiate and prosecute enforcement action separate from the shoreline administrator. (Ord. 1701 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).


14.20.760 Cumulative effects of shoreline developments.

A. The city will periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the shoreline master program update at achieving no net loss of shoreline ecological functions with respect to shoreline permitting and exemptions in order to comply with WAC 173-26-191(2)(a)(iii)(D).

B. The shoreline administrator will, to the extent feasible, coordinate with other city departments or restoration partners, as well as adjacent jurisdictions, to assess cumulative effects of shoreline development. (Ord. 1476 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2012).1

510.5.3 Acceptance Test procedure. Acceptance testing for Emergency responder radio amplification system is required, upon completion of installation. It is the building owner’s responsibility to have the radio system tested by qualified personnel to ensure a minimum of 95% two-way coverage on each floor of the building.

A report shall be submitted to the Fire Marshal at the conclusion of acceptance testing containing a floor plan and the signal strengths at each location tested and other relevant information. A representative of the Fire Marshal’s Office may oversee the acceptance test. Acceptance testing is also required whenever changes occur to the building that would materially change the original field performance test. The test procedure shall be conducted as follows:

1. Each floor of the building shall be divided into a grid of approximately forty (40) equal areas.

2. Testing shall use a two (2) watt, portable transceiver with speaker/microphone and flexible antenna (or any calibrated device which will produce signal levels useable by the prescribed portable radio). Field strength testing instruments must have been calibrated within one (1) year of the date of the acceptance test. Field strength testing instruments must be of the frequency selective type incorporating a flexible antenna similar to the ones used on the hand held transceivers. City Radio System Manager may designate alternate methods of measuring the signal level, which satisfy appropriate levels of public safety coverage.

3. A maximum of two (2) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test.

4. In the event that three (3) of the areas fail the test, the floor may be divided into eighty (80) equal areas in order to be more statistically accurate. In such event, a maximum of four (4) nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test. After the eighty (80) area tests, if the system continues to fail, the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the 95% coverage requirement.

5. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and from the outside of the building through the Regional 800 MHz Radio System. Once the spot has been selected, prospecting for a better spot within the grid area is not permitted. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the results kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

6. The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified during annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become lost, the building owner shall be required to rerun the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values.

7. As part of the installation a spectrum analyzer or other suitable test equipment shall be utilized to ensure spurious oscillations are not being generated by the subject signal booster. This test shall be conducted at time of installation and subsequent annual inspections.

510.5.5 Approval Prior to Occupancy. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued to any structure if the building fails to comply with Section 510.

510.6 Maintenance. The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be maintained operational at all times in accordance with Sections 510.6.1 through 510.6.3.

510.6.1 Testing and proof of Compliance. The emergency responder radio coverage system shall be inspected and tested annually, or whenever structural changes occur including additions or remodels that could materially change the original field performance tests. Testing shall consist of the following:

1. In-building coverage test as described in Section 510.5.3.

Exception: Group R Occupancy annual testing is not required within dwelling units.

2. Signal boosters shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance.

3. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load of a period of 1 hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the 1-hour test period the battery exhibits symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional 1-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined.

4. All other active components shall be checked to verify operation within the manufacturer’s specifications.

5. At the conclusion of the testing, a report, which shall verify compliance with Section 510.5.3, shall be submitted to the fire code official.

510.6.2 Identification. Radio Coverage system shall be identified by a sign located on or near the Fire Alarm Control Panel stating “This building is equipped with an Emergency Responder Radio Coverage System.”

510.6.3 Field Testing. Police and Fire Personnel shall at any time have the right to enter onto the property to conduct its own field-testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present.

1. Create a parcel of land that would qualify as a building site; or

B. All contiguous parcels divided in violation of this title that are under common ownership at the time of application for innocent purchaser status shall be recognized only as a single lot.

C. Innocent purchaser status shall not be granted to any individual or group more than once for a given subdivision, short subdivision, binding site plan, or lot line adjustment. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012: Ord. 1188 § 2 (part), 2003).

Dedication or deeding to the city of right-of-way or a portion thereof for public streets shall be required within or along the boundaries of all binding site plans, subdivisions and short subdivisions or of any lot or lots within them, under the following circumstances, where facts support that such dedication is reasonably necessary as a result of the impact created by the proposed development:

These limitations may preclude the construction of buildings, driveways, drainage facilities or other improvements within the specified areas. (Ord. 1188 § 2 (part), 2003).

The following standards shall be applied to the layout and design of subdivisions and short subdivisions:

17.25.065 Trails.

A. Trail Provision Requirements. The following provisions apply to any single-family, cottage or multifamily residential development of five or more units. These trail provision requirements may not be provided via a fee-in-lieu per NBMC 17.25.080.

1. Trail Access Connections. Where any residential development of five or more units abuts a public trail corridor, access connections shall be provided from streets within the development to the public trail corridor. The number of access connections provided shall be proportional to the size of the development. Shared access connections are encouraged at parcel boundaries between developments. The area of the access connection shall be owned and maintained by the applicable homeowners’ association or management company. The trail within the access connection shall be constructed per the trail construction standards below.

2. Trail Corridor Extensions. Residential developments of five or more units that contain future trail corridors as identified on the trail plan map of the parks element of the comprehensive plan shall provide trail extensions across or through the development in approximate alignment with that shown on the trail plan map, or per an alternative alignment as approved by the community and economic development director. The area of the trail extension may count toward the recreational space requirement for the development, and shall be dedicated and conveyed in a tract to the city of North Bend, or an easement granted to the city for public access along the trail. Should the provision and dedication of the trail corridor use more recreational space land than what is required by this chapter and thereby create a situation that could require nonconforming lot sizes, the area of the trail corridor tract adjacent to such lots may be used for calculating the minimum lot size of those lots. 

B. Trail Construction Standards. Trails provided for access connections or trail corridor extensions per subsection A of this section shall be constructed in accordance with the following standards:

1. The trail shall be a minimum of eight feet in width and shall be provided with a corridor a minimum of 12 feet in width maintained clear of brush, debris or other visual obstructions, with exceptions for significant trees and with exceptions for other existing obstructions per the discretion of the community and economic development director. Within major trail corridors including but not limited to: the Tanner Trail, trails along Bendigo Boulevard and SW Ribary Way, and trails along levees of the Middle Fork and South Fork Snoqualmie Rivers, the trail shall be a minimum of 10 feet in width. The trail and corridor may be reduced where particular site constraints make this necessary, as approved by the community and economic development director. 

2. The trail surface shall be constructed of crushed rock at a minimum of six inches in depth. Soft-surface materials (hog fuel) may be utilized in place of crushed rock as approved by the community and economic development director, depending on the site and trail characteristics and anticipated trail usage. Trails may be paved at the discretion of the developer. Within the Tanner Trail corridor, the trail shall be paved per the trail requirements provided within the North Bend public works standards.

3. Any trails constructed within critical areas or their buffers shall be constructed in conformance to the requirements of the applicable critical area regulations. 

4. The Tanner Trail shall include pedestrian-scaled full cutoff lighting to provide for enhanced pedestrian visibility and safety. Lighting fixtures and specs shall be as provided per the North Bend public works standards or as otherwise approved by the city. (Ord. 1685 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1355 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009).


17.25.070 Sustainability – Design and construction methods and materials.

A park is a place to play, relax, explore and socialize. Parks act as a connection between our human environment and the natural environment. Parks can also educate though sustainable design and construction methods. Park design and construction should build connections with the natural environment. Design and construction of parks should incorporate such sustainable techniques as detailed below: 

A. All parks and recreation areas should to the extent feasible incorporate the following minimum sustainable techniques:

1. Preserve and incorporate existing natural areas and native vegetation into park site planning; and

2. Reduce impervious cover; and 

3. Use native drought-tolerant plants; and

4. Use organic mulch to retain water and suppress weeds.

B. The city highly encourages the use of the following sustainable techniques:

1. Use recycled materials and FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified wood; and

2. Pervious pavers or pervious pavement; and

3. Rain gardens to address stormwater generated by park features. (Ord. 1685 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1355 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1329 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.25.080 Fee in lieu of provisions.

A. When land is dedicated for recreational space requirements, the developer is required to construct the park and install the facilities (e.g., play equipment, walkways, trails, benches, and other improvements) as approved by the city with the preliminary plat. 

B. When a fee in lieu of dedication of land and park improvement is proposed or required for recreational space requirements, the fee shall be computed on a square-foot unit cost basis, by any licensed appraiser with an MAI designation, or other appraiser acceptable to the city. By summary appraisal report, or other form of report acceptable to the city, the appraiser shall appraise the value of the total undeveloped land within the proposed development and calculate the fee based on the total square footage otherwise required to be developed as parks and/or trails. An additional charge equal to 20 percent of the required fee in lieu of dedication shall also be paid for the required park improvements, such as play equipment, walkways, trails, benches, and other park improvements. The required appraisal report must be provided to the city prior to engineering plan approval of the associated development applications. The fee in lieu shall be paid prior to final plat, site plan or binding site plan or other applicable final permit. (Ord. 1685 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1355 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1329 § 1 (part), 2008).

17.28.010 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to provide procedures and criteria for the review and approval of minor adjustments to boundary lines of legal lots or building sites in order to rectify defects in legal descriptions, to allow the enlargement or merging of lots to improve or qualify as a building site, to achieve increased setbacks from property lines or sensitive areas, to correct situations wherein an established use is located across a lot line, or for other similar purposes. (Ord. 1708 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2019: Ord. 1188 § 2 (part), 2003).

8. Be inconsistent with applicable city code;

D. The elimination of lines between two or more lots for the purpose of creating a single lot that meets requirements as a building site shall in all cases be considered a minor adjustment of boundary lines and shall not be subject to the subdivision and short subdivision provisions of this title;

E. Recognized lots in an approved site plan for a conditional use permit shall be considered a single site and no lot lines on the site may be altered by a boundary line adjustment to transfer density or separate lots to another property not included in the original site plan of the subject development;

F. Lots that have been subject to a boundary line adjustment process that resulted in the qualification of an additional building site shall not be permitted to utilize the boundary line adjustment process again for five years to create an additional building site; and

G. All applicable processing fees and/or deposits specified by Chapter 20.09 NBMC and any civil penalty assessed pursuant to Chapter 1.20 NBMC against a site being reviewed under this section shall be paid prior to recording.

The city council of the city of North Bend finds and determines that growth and development activity in the city will create additional demand and need for fire protection facilities in the city, and the council finds that growth and development activity should pay a proportionate share of the cost of such facilities needed to serve that growth and development activity. Therefore, pursuant to the Growth Management Act (Chapter 36.70A RCW), and RCW 82.02.050 through 82.02.100, which authorize cities to impose and collect impact fees to partially fund public facilities to accommodate new growth, the council adopts this chapter imposing fire protection impact fees for fire protection facilities as set forth in NBMC 17.34.070. The provisions of this chapter shall be liberally construed in order to carry out the purposes of the council in establishing fire protection impact fees. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


17.34.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings ascribed below:

2. The applicant provides studies and data that, when considered, suggest that adjustment of the fire protection impact fee would be appropriate; provided, that the study is supported by a data base adequate for the conclusions in such study, the study is prepared using generally accepted methods of planning, engineering, and financial analysis and the study is performed by a person with qualifications and experience in the costs, benefits, and financing of public facilities; or

3. Unusual circumstances exist that, when considered, suggest that imposition of the standard fire protection impact fee would be unfair.

B. The director shall consider the documentation submitted by the applicant, but is not required to accept such documentation that the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or unreliable.

C. Any appeal of the decision of the city with regard to fire protection impact fee amounts shall follow the process for the appeal of the underlying development permit, as set forth in NBMC 17.34.120 and other provisions of the North Bend Municipal Code. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


17.34.090 Fire protection impact fee accounts and refunds.

A. Fire protection impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and retained in a special interest-bearing account established by the city solely for fire protection impact fees. All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which said fees were imposed. Annually, the city shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all fire protection impact fees collected, interest earned, and the fire protection facilities that were financed in whole or in part by said fees.

B. Fire protection impact fees shall be expended by the city only in conformance with the capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan.

C. Fire protection impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city for a permissible use within six years of receipt by the city, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for said fees to be held longer than six years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified in written findings by the city.

D. The current owner of property on which a fire protection impact fee has been paid may receive a refund of such fees if the city fails to expend or encumber the fees on fire protection facilities within the service area within six years of receipt of the fees by the city. In determining whether fire protection impact fees have been encumbered, such fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis. The city shall notify potential claimants by first-class mail deposited with the United States Postal Service at the last known address of the claimants.

E. An owner’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any fire protection impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the city in conformance with the capital facilities element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of fire protection impact fees shall include interest earned on such fees.

F. Should the city seek to terminate any or all fire protection impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the finding that any or all fire protection impact fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first-class mail to the last known address of claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, and must be expended by the city consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The notice requirements set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account being terminated.

G. An applicant may request and shall receive a refund, including interest earned on the fire protection impact fees, when:

1. The applicant does not proceed to finalize the development; and

2. No impact on the city has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the city has expended or encumbered the fire protection impact fees in good faith prior to the application for refund. In the event that the city has expended or encumbered the fire protection impact fees in good faith, no refund shall be forthcoming; provided, however, within a period of three years, if the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a credit. The owner must petition the city and provide receipts of fire protection impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in NBMC 17.34.120.

H. Interest due upon the refund of fire protection impact fees required by this chapter shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the city on invested funds throughout the period during which the fire protection impact fees were retained. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


17.34.100 Processing.

The city shall determine any applicable fire protection impact fees as a normal part of processing a development permit. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


17.34.110 Other authority.

Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the city’s authority under the State Environmental Policy Act or any other source. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).


17.34.120 Appeals.

A fire protection impact fee may be appealed under the appeal process for the underlying development permit set forth in the North Bend Municipal Code. Where no other administrative appeal process is available, an appeal may be taken to the hearing examiner using the appeal procedures for variances. (Ord. 1621 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2017).1

The lien, covenant, or other contractual provision shall run with the land and apply to subsequent owners and assigns.

2. Any claim or request for an exemption under this section shall be made no later than the time of application for a building permit. If a building permit is not required for the development, then the claim shall be made when the first development permit is applied for. Any claim not made when required by this section shall be deemed waived.

B. Accessory Dwelling Units. A development permit for an accessory dwelling unit, as defined in NBMC 18.06.030, shall not be assessed a park impact fee.

A. The city shall impose and collect park impact fees on every development permit within the city limits, except as provided in NBMC 17.36.050.

B. Any park impact fee imposed shall be reasonably related to the impact caused by the new development and shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of park facilities that are reasonably related to the new development.

C. The park impact fee imposed may include costs for park facility improvements previously incurred by the city to the extent that new development will be served by the previously constructed improvements; provided, that such fee shall not be imposed to correct any system improvement deficiencies.

D. The park impact fee imposed for any development shall be calculated and determined by the procedures established by this chapter.

E. Park impact fees shall be used for park facilities that will reasonably benefit the new development, and only for those park facilities addressed by the city’s capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).


17.36.070 Fee calculation methods.

A. Each development application shall mitigate its impacts on the city’s park facilities by payment of the park impact fee.

The impact fees are based upon a rate study. No development permit shall be issued until the park impact fee has been paid in full by the applicant; provided, that the payment of fees may be proportionately phased if the development permit for the development is also phased. The park impact fee shall be collected by the city, and maintained in a separate account, as required by NBMC 17.36.090.

B. An inflationary adjustment shall be made in the fee rates at the beginning of each calendar year. This annual inflationary adjustment shall be the same percentage amount as the change in the Engineering News-Record Construction Cost Index for the Seattle area from the date of the previous year’s adjustment. (Ord. 1657 § 2, 2018: Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).


17.36.090 Park impact fee accounts and refunds.

All interest shall be retained in the account and expended for the purpose or purposes for which said fees were imposed. Annually, the city shall prepare a report on the source and amount of all park impact fees collected, interest earned, and the park facilities that were financed in whole or in part by said fees.

B. Park impact fees shall be expended by the city only in conformance with the capital facilities element of the comprehensive plan.

C. Park impact fees shall be expended or encumbered by the city for a permissible use within 10 years of receipt by the city, unless there exists an extraordinary or compelling reason for said fees to be held longer than 10 years. Such extraordinary or compelling reasons shall be identified in written findings by the city.

D. The city shall refund to the payer park impact fees if the city fails to expend or encumber the fees on park facilities within the service area within 10 years, or any extended period pursuant to subsection C of this section, of receipt of the fees by the city. In determining whether park impact fees have been encumbered, such fees shall be considered encumbered on a first in, first out basis.

E. An owner’s or other payer’s request for a refund must be submitted to the city in writing within one year of the date the right to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is later. Any park impact fees that are not expended or encumbered by the city in conformance with the capital facilities element within these time limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within this one-year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the provisions of this section. Refunds of park impact fees shall include the interest actually earned by the city on such fees.

F. Should the city repeal any or all park impact fee requirements, all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be refunded pursuant to this section. Upon the repeal of any or all park impact fee requirements, the city shall place notice of such repeal and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all payers by first-class mail to the last known address of such payers. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, and must be expended by the city consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The notice requirements set forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account being terminated.

G. An applicant may request and shall receive a refund, including interest actually earned by the city on the park impact fees, when:

1. The applicant does not proceed to finalize the development; and

2. No impact on the city has resulted. “Impact” shall be deemed to include cases where the city has expended or encumbered the park impact fees in good faith prior to the application for refund. In the event that the city has expended or encumbered the park impact fees in good faith, no refund shall be made; provided, however, within a period of three years, if the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner or other payer shall be eligible for a credit. The owner or other payer must petition the city and provide receipts of park impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by following the procedures set forth in NBMC 17.36.120.

H. Interest due upon the refund of park impact fees required by this chapter shall be calculated according to the average rate received by the city on invested funds throughout the period during which the park impact fees were retained. (Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).


17.36.100 Processing.

The city shall determine any applicable park impact fees as a normal part of processing a development permit. (Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).


17.36.110 Other authority.

Nothing in this chapter is intended to limit the city’s authority under the State Environmental Policy Act or any other source. (Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).


17.36.120 Appeals.

A park impact fee may be appealed under the appeal process for the underlying development permit set forth in the North Bend Municipal Code. Where no other administrative appeal process is available, an appeal may be taken to the hearing examiner using the appeal procedures for variances. (Ord. 1591 § 1 (part), 2016).1

The city council of the city of North Bend (the “council”) hereby finds and determines that new growth and development, including but not limited to new residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial development, in the city of North Bend will create additional demand and need for public facilities in the city of North Bend, and the council finds that new growth and development should pay a proportionate share of the cost of new facilities needed to serve the new growth and development. The city of North Bend has conducted extensive studies documenting the procedures for measuring the impact of new developments on public facilities, has prepared the Transportation Impact Fee Rate Calculations for City of North Bend (“rate study”), and hereby incorporates this rate study into this chapter by reference.

17.38.030 Assessment of impact fees.

A. Unless exempted pursuant to NBMC 17.38.040, an applicant seeking development approval from the city for any development activity within the city shall pay, and the city shall collect prior to building permit issuance, impact fees calculated by the director according to the rates set forth in NBMC 17.38.120 and the taxes, rates and fees schedule set forth in Ordinance No. 1551 as it may be subsequently amended from time to time. Development activity subject to the impact fees assessed herein shall include, but is not limited to, the development of residential, commercial, retail, office, and industrial land, and includes the expansion of existing uses that creates a demand for additional public facilities, as well as a change in use that creates a demand for additional public facilities.

B. For a change in use of an existing building or dwelling unit, including any alteration, expansion, replacement or new accessory building, the impact fee shall be the applicable impact fee for the land use category of the new use, less any impact fee previously paid for the land use category of the prior use. If no impact fee was paid for the prior use, the impact fee for the new use shall be reduced by an amount equal to the current impact fee rate for the prior use.

C. For mixed use developments, impact fees shall be imposed at the applicable rate set forth in NBMC 17.38.120 for each separate type of land use contained in the mixed-use development. For cottage dwellings no greater than 1,200 square feet in size or carriage units developed under Chapter 18.11 NBMC, impact fees shall be imposed at the applicable rate set forth in NBMC 17.38.120 for condominiums; for cottage dwellings with more than 1,200 square feet in size, impact fees shall be imposed at the rate for single-family houses.

H. The service area for impact fees shall be a single citywide service area. (Ord. 1657 § 3, 2018; Ord. 1562 § 2, 2015: Ord. 1522 § 2, 2014: Ord. 1485 § 1 (Exh. A), 2013: Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).

B. The director shall be authorized to determine whether a particular development activity falls within an exemption identified in this section, in any other section, or under other applicable law. Determinations of the director shall be in writing and shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in NBMC 17.38.070. (Ord. 1562 § 3, 2015: Ord. 1522 § 3, 2014: Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012: Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.050 Credits.

A. A feepayer can request that a credit or credits for impact fees be awarded to him/her for the total value of dedicated land, improvements, or construction provided by the feepayer. Credits will be given only if the land, improvements, and/or the facility constructed are:

1. Included within the capital facilities plan or would serve the goals and objectives of the capital facilities plan; and

2. At suitable sites and constructed at acceptable quality as determined by the city.

B. The director shall determine if requests for credits meet the criteria in subsection A of this section.

C. Credits shall be based on a certified statement of actual costs of the improvements incurred by the feepayer. The statement shall include copies of invoices paid for such work.

The appraiser must possess an MAI or other equivalent certification and shall not have a fiduciary or personal interest in the property being appraised. A description of the appraiser’s certification shall be included with the appraisal, and the appraiser shall certify that he/she does not have a fiduciary or personal interest in the property being appraised. The appraiser shall be directed to determine the total value of the dedicated land, improvements, and/or construction provided by the feepayer on a case-by-case basis. The feepayer shall pay for the cost of the appraisal or may request that the cost of the appraisal be deducted from the credit in the event that a credit is awarded. If no credit is awarded, the feepayer shall pay the cost of the appraisal.

E. After receiving the certified statement of actual costs and any appraisal, the director shall provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, the legal description of the site donated where applicable, and the legal description or other adequate description of the project or development to which the credit may be applied. The applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or certificate indicating his/her agreement to the terms of the letter or certificate, and return such signed document to the director before the impact fee credit will be awarded. The failure of the applicant to sign, date, and return such document within 60 calendar days shall nullify the credit.

F. No credit shall be given for project improvements.

The director shall determine the amount of credits, if any, for significant past tax payments for park and transportation public facilities.

H. Any claim for credit must be made no later than 20 calendar days after the submission of an application for a building permit. The failure to timely file such a claim shall constitute a final bar to later request any such credit. 

I. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeals procedures set forth in NBMC 17.38.070. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.060 Tax adjustments.

Pursuant to and consistent with the requirements of RCW 82.02.060, the rate study provides adjustments for future taxes to be paid by the new development which are earmarked or proratable to the same new public facilities which will serve the new development. The impact fee rates in NBMC 17.38.120 have been reasonably adjusted for taxes and other revenue sources which are anticipated to be available to fund system improvements. (Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.070 Appeals.

3. No administrative fee will be imposed for the request for review by the director; and

4. The director shall issue his/her determination in writing.

D. Determinations of the director with respect to the applicability of the impact fees to a given development activity, the availability or value of a credit, or the director’s decision concerning the independent fee calculation which is authorized in NBMC 17.38.120, or the fees imposed by the director pursuant to 



NBMC 17.38.120, or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, may be appealed to the hearing examiner only as provided below.

E. An appeal must be filed no later than 14 calendar days of the director’s issuance of a written determination, by filing with the department a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of such decisions. The director shall transmit to the office of the hearing examiner all papers constituting the record for the determination, including, where appropriate, the independent fee calculation.

F. The hearing examiner shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same as provided in the North Bend Municipal Code. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.

17.38.080 Establishment of impact fee accounts.

A. Impact fee receipts shall be earmarked specifically and deposited in special interest-bearing accounts.

B. There is hereby established the roads impact fee account for the fees collected pursuant to this chapter.

C. On an annual basis, the finance director shall provide a report to the council on the impact fee account showing the source and amount of all moneys collected, earned, or received, and the system improvements that were financed in whole or in part by impact fees.

D. Impact fees shall be expended or encumbered within six years of receipt, unless the council identifies in written findings extraordinary and compelling reason or reasons for the city to hold the fees beyond the six-year period. Under such circumstances, the council shall establish the period of time within which the impact fees shall be expended or encumbered. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.090 Refunds.

A. If the city fails to expend or encumber the impact fees within six years of when the fees were paid, or where extraordinary or compelling reasons exist, such other time periods as established pursuant to NBMC 17.38.080, the current owner of the property on which impact fees have been paid may receive a refund of such fees. In determining whether impact fees have been expended or encumbered, impact fees shall be considered expended or encumbered on a first in, first out basis.

Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation at least two times and shall notify all potential claimants by first class mail at the last known address of the claimants. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the appropriate public facilities. This notice requirement shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances within the account or accounts being terminated.

G. The city shall also refund to the current owner of property for which impact fees have been paid all impact fees paid, including interest earned on the impact fees, if the development activity for which the impact fees were imposed did not occur; provided, that if the city has expended or encumbered the impact fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund, the director can decline to provide the refund. If, within a period of three years, the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or substantially similar development activity, the owner may petition the director for an offset. The petitioner must provide receipts of impact fees previously paid for a development of the same or substantially similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The director shall determine in writing whether to grant an offset, and the determination of the director may be appealed pursuant to the procedures in NBMC 17.38.070. (Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).

C. Impact fees may also be used to recoup street and/or transportation system improvement costs previously incurred by the city to the extent that new growth and development will be served by the previously constructed system improvements.

D. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been issued for the advanced provision of street and/or transportation system improvements for which impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and are used to serve the new development. (Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.110 Review.

A. The fee rates set forth in NBMC 17.38.120 may be reviewed and adjusted by the council as it deems necessary and appropriate in conjunction with the annual update of the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan. The council may determine the amount of the adjustment and revise the fee rates set forth in NBMC 17.38.120. 

B. An inflationary adjustment shall be made in the fee rates at the beginning of each calendar year whether or not the council adjusts the fee rates under subsection A of this section. This annual inflationary adjustment shall be the same percentage amount as the change in the Engineering News Record Construction Cost Index for the Seattle area from the date of the previous year’s adjustment. (Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).


17.38.120 Transportation impact fee.

The transportation impact fee rates are generated from the formula for calculating impact fees set forth in the rate study, which is incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise provided for independent fee calculations in NBMC 17.38.030, exemptions in NBMC 17.38.040, and credits in NBMC 17.38.050, all development activity in the city shall pay the street and/or transportation impact fee based on the trip generation data in the below table applicable to the type of development activity at the rates established by the taxes, rates, and fees schedule adopted by ordinance:

17.38.130 Independent fee calculations.

A. If in the judgment of the director none of the fee categories or fee amounts set forth in NBMC 17.38.120 accurately describes or captures the impacts of a new development on roads, the department may conduct independent fee calculations and the director may impose alternative fees on a specific development based on those calculations. The alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the feepayer.

B. If a feepayer opts not to have the impact fees determined according to NBMC 17.38.120, then the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the director an independent fee calculation for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.

C. Any feepayer submitting an independent fee calculation will be required to pay the city of North Bend a fee to cover the cost of reviewing the independent fee calculation. The fee required by the city for conducting the review of the independent fee calculation shall be the actual cost incurred by the city paid from an engineering fee deposit provided by the feepayer prior to initiation of review.

D. While the calculations set forth in the roads study shall be presumed valid, the director shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer. The director is not required to accept any documentation or analysis which the director reasonably deems to be inaccurate or not reliable, and the director may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. The director is authorized to adjust the impact fees on a case-by-case basis based on the independent fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, and/or principles of fairness. The fees or alternative fees and the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the feepayer.

E. Determinations made by the director pursuant to this section may be appealed to the office of the hearing examiner as set forth in NBMC 17.38.070. (Ord. 1324 § 1 (part), 2008).

Chapter 17.42 METHODS TO MITIGATE DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS

Sections:

17.42.010    Purpose.

17.42.020    Determination of direct impact.

17.42.030    Costs.

17.42.040    Mitigation of direct impacts.

17.42.050    Methods of mitigation.

17.42.060    Appeals.


17.42.010 Purpose.

It is the purpose of this chapter to provide alternatives for prospective developers of land within the city to mitigate the direct impacts that have been specifically identified by the city as a consequence of proposed development, and to make provisions for, including without limitation, bicycle and pedestrian facilities. The provisions of this chapter shall be considered in conjunction with the provisions of Chapters 17.32 (School Impact Fees), 17.34 (Fire Impact Fees), 17.36 (Park Impact Fees), and/or 17.38 (Transportation Impact Fees) NBMC. No development shall be required to provide duplicate mitigation for the same impacts. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).


17.42.020 Determination of direct impact.

Before any development is given the required approval or is permitted to proceed, the director shall determine direct impacts, if any, that are a direct consequence of the proposed development and which require mitigation. The director shall consider the following factors:

A. Predevelopment versus postdevelopment need for services, such as: city streets, bicycle, and pedestrian facilities and other similar municipal facilities or services;

B. Likelihood that a direct impact of a proposed development would require mitigation due to the cumulative effect of such impact when aggregated with the similar impacts of future development in the immediate vicinity of the proposed development;

C. Size, number, condition, and proximity of existing facilities to be affected by the proposed development;

D. Nature and quantity of capital improvements reasonably necessary to mitigate specific direct impacts identified as a consequence of the proposed development;

E. Likelihood that the users of the proposed development will benefit from any mitigating capital improvements or programs; and

F. Any significant adverse environmental impacts of the proposed development identified in the process of complying with the Washington State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).


17.42.030 Costs.

The cost of any investigations, analysis, and/or reports necessary for a determination of direct impact shall be borne by the applicant. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).


17.42.040 Mitigation of direct impacts.

The director shall review an applicant’s proposal to mitigate any identified direct impacts and determine whether such proposal is a reasonable and acceptable mitigation measure considering the cost and land requirements of the required improvement and the extent to which the necessity of the improvement is attributable to the direct impacts of the proposed development. No official or body shall approve a development unless reasonable provisions have been made to mitigate identified direct impacts that are direct consequences of such development. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).


17.42.050 Methods of mitigation.

A. The methods to mitigate identified direct impacts required as a condition of any development approval may include, but are not limited to: dedication of land to any public body; off-site improvements; on-site improvements; and other capital or noncapital methods that may effectively reduce direct impacts.

B. In lieu of a dedication of land or to mitigate a direct impact that has been identified as a consequence of a proposed development, the city may approve a voluntary payment agreement with the developer, which shall be subject to the following provisions:

1. The director must find that the money offered will mitigate or is a satisfactory alternative to mitigate the identified direct impact. Bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation shall be assessed based on the mitigation fee study dated September 2018, for bicycle and pedestrian facilities, prepared by Fehr and Peers on file with the city clerk and as listed in the city taxes, rates and fees schedule. 

2. The administration shall review the bicycle and pedestrian facilities mitigation fee rates annually to determine when new rate studies should be prepared. An inflationary adjustment should be made in the city taxes, rates and fees schedule at the beginning of each calendar year in the same percentage as the change in the Engineering News Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (CCI) for the Seattle area from the prior year’s rate.

3. Mitigation rates may be adjusted by the director, if one of the following circumstances exists:

a. The applicant demonstrates that a mitigation fee assessment was improperly calculated; or

b. Studies and data provided by the applicant demonstrate that one or more of the factors used to calculate the mitigation fee may not be appropriate.

4. Payment of any mitigation fee shall be held in a reserve account and may only be expended to fund a capital improvement or program to mitigate the identified direct impact. 

5. No building permit shall be issued until the voluntary payment has been paid in full by the applicant; provided, that payment of mitigation fees may be phased if the building permit for the development is also phased.

C. The following types of development shall be exempted from the mitigation required under this chapter: development of commercial uses, attached senior housing, and the construction of one single-family home outside of a plat or any other larger development. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).


17.42.060 Appeals.

Determinations made by the director pursuant to this chapter may be appealed as set forth below:

A. Any feepayer may pay the voluntary payment imposed by this chapter under protest in order to obtain a building permit. No appeal shall be permitted, and no building permit issued, until the voluntary payment at issue has been paid.

B. Appeals regarding the voluntary payment imposed on any development activity may be filed only by the payor and owner of the property where such development activity will occur.

C. Before a payor may appeal, the payor must first file a request for review regarding the voluntary payment with the director, as provided herein:

1. The request shall be in writing on the form provided by the city;

2. The request for review by the director shall be filed within 14 calendar days of the payor’s payment of the voluntary payment at issue. Failure to timely file such a request shall constitute a final bar to any review or appeal;

3. No administrative fee will be imposed for the request for review by the director; and

4. The director shall issue his/her determination in writing.

D. Determinations of the director with respect to the applicability of the voluntary payment to a given development activity, or the director’s decision concerning the independent voluntary payment calculation, or the voluntary payment imposed by the director, or any other determination which the director is authorized to make pursuant to this chapter, may be appealed to the hearing examiner only as provided below.

E. An appeal must be filed no later than 14 calendar days after the director’s issuance of a written determination, by filing with the department a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and depositing the necessary fee, which is set forth in the existing fee schedules for appeals of such decisions. The director shall transmit to the office of the hearing examiner all papers constituting the record for the determination, including, where appropriate, the independent voluntary payment calculation.

F. The hearing examiner shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal, give notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same as provided in the North Bend Municipal Code. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney.

G. The hearing examiner is authorized to make findings of fact regarding the applicability of the voluntary payment to a given development activity, or the accuracy or applicability of an independent voluntary payment calculation. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final.

H. The hearing examiner may, so long as such action is in conformance with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the determinations of the director with respect to the amount of the voluntary payment imposed. (Ord. 1680 § 2 (part), 2018).

8. Promote a traditional cottage neighborhood development pattern centered around common open space, and a scale which serves to maintain and enhance existing small-city character and pedestrian orientation;

9. Implement provisions of the comprehensive plan, including the vision plan, related to residential development.

D. Purpose – Commercial Districts (NB, DC, IC, IMU). The NB, DC, IC, and IMU zoning districts have the following general and specific purposes (general purposes include subsections (D)(1) through (4) of this section; specific purposes include subsections (D)(5) through (8) of this section at densities established by a floor area ratio):

1. Provide land for different intensities and types of residential, retail, service, business, office, and entertainment uses that complement, enhance, and support residential and other land uses within North Bend.

2. Implement provisions of the comprehensive plan related to commercial land uses, including but not limited to providing economic and employment opportunities, property tax bases, necessary goods and services, and in some cases, mixed-use (commercial first floor/residential upper floor) dwelling opportunities.

3. Promote high-quality commercial development that incorporates traditional development patterns and elements, including but not limited to building locations, architectural designs, construction materials, and site features that are harmonious with North Bend’s small-city character.

4. Ensure that proper site needs and amenities, including but not limited to vehicular circulation and parking, pedestrian, bicycle, and greenbelt networks (where applicable), landscaping, lighting, public areas (e.g., greenspace, plazas), services, and utilities, and other necessary and desirable elements are integral parts of all commercial projects.

5. Neighborhood business (NB) districts are intended to be general commercial areas; however, buildings are expected to be smaller in scale, and applicable businesses to operate on less than a 24-hour basis. The NB district will accommodate a variety of residential and other land uses, including limited fabrication and light manufacturing when conducted in locations isolated from residential zoning districts. Residential is limited to the second story or to rear of the parcels zoned NB that front North Bend Way and Mount Si Road at the intersection of North Bend Way and Mount Si Road.

6. The downtown commercial (DC) district is intended to provide specialty retail goods, as well as a range of business, professional, and other services consistent with historic uses and scale of the downtown area. Buildings in the DC district are also expected to be smaller in scale; however, there is a provision for commercial buildings up to 10,000 square feet if they are “anchors.” Building sizes and floor area ratios may be increased in certain portions of the DC zone by use of transferred development rights. The DC district will also incorporate residential development, as well as encouraging upper floor dwelling units above commercial uses. New first floor residential is prohibited in the DC zone along the entire length of North Bend Way and along Bendigo Boulevard North, from West Park Street to West Third Street. See performance standards in NBMC 18.10.050(1.00(c)). Pedestrian orientation and amenities will also be emphasized.

7. The interchange commercial (IC) district is intended to accommodate businesses that typically serve passerby travelers and tourists, while also supplying goods for Upper Valley residents typical of larger-scale commercial development. Primary access to the IC is anticipated to be vehicular; however, pedestrian amenities and circulation, including linkage to the historic downtown area, will be promoted. Buildings are permitted to be larger in scale relative to other commercial districts, and select businesses are permitted to operate on a 24-hour basis.

8. The interchange mixed use (IMU) zoning district is intended to provide a transitional area between interchange commercial (IC) zoning and residential (LDR, HDR) zoning. The zoning accommodates permitted residential, interchange commercial and other commercial development to minimize adverse impacts on and maximize compatibility with adjacent land uses. Buildings in the IMU district are expected to be smaller in scale than buildings in the IC district, with select businesses permitted to operate on a 16-hour basis or less, closed between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.

E. Purpose – Employment Park Districts (EP-1 and EP-2). The EP-1 and EP-2 zoning districts have the following general and specific purposes (general purposes include subsections (E)(1) through (5) of this section; specific purposes include subsections (E)(6) and (7) of this section at densities established by a floor area ratio):

1. Provide appropriate areas for various commercial land uses, including office, warehouse, distribution, manufacturing enterprises, industrial uses, and research and development facilities which complement, enhance, and support the mix of land uses within the city of North Bend. Retail sales or related services are limited to a few select uses, or allowed only as incidental to underlying permitted uses.

2. Implement provisions of the comprehensive plan related to employment park district land uses, including but not limited to providing economic and employment opportunities, as well as balanced property tax bases and possible mixed land use opportunities.

3. Promote high-quality and well-designed business and industrial developments that are harmonious with North Bend’s small-city character, and create an environment free from adverse noise, odors, dust, smoke, air pollution, water pollution, and inappropriate truck traffic or related traffic congestion.

4. Ensure that proper site needs and amenities, including but not limited to vehicular circulation and parking, services and utilities, landscaping, lighting, pedestrian, bicycle, and greenbelt networks and linkages, and other necessary and desirable elements are integral parts of all employment park district projects.

5. Ensure sensitivity to adjacent land uses and the environment, including avoidance of incompatible uses, and that new development is integrated with physical and social linkages to the community.

6. The EP-1 district is intended to provide areas for light industrial and limited commercial uses that are compatible with, and not detrimental to, adjoining land use districts. Permitted uses in the EP-1 district include offices (professional, business, corporate), light manufacturing, warehouse and distribution, and research and development. A wider variety of manufacturing and assembly uses are permitted on a conditional use basis. Smaller-scale business enterprises are permitted to the extent they are needed to serve employees within the EP-1 district. Uses that capitalize on North Bend’s setting and geographic location are encouraged.

7. The EP-2 district is intended to provide areas for a variety of industrial land uses, including manufacturing, fabrication, and processing of natural and manmade materials. Large-scale and/or specialized industrial and commercial operations, including those having greater potential impacts to surrounding areas, will be permitted in this district. Business uses which support activities occurring in outlying rural areas, including support services for forestry or resource-based industries, are encouraged.

F. Purpose – Park, Open Space, and Public Facilities District (POSPF).

1. Recognize and designate areas for public and quasi-public parks, open space, trail, and recreation areas, as well as public facilities including but not limited to schools, community buildings, government offices, and public facilities and utilities.

2. Implement provisions of the comprehensive plan related to park, open space, and public facility land uses.

3. Ensure that adequate areas are set aside for park, open space, trail, recreation areas, and public facility land uses. (Ord. 1657 § 6, 2018: Ord. 1653 § 2 (Exh. A (part)), 2018; Ord. 1590 § 1, 2016; Ord. 1578 § 2, 2016; Ord. 1576 § 2, 2016; Ord. 1325 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1165 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1164 § 1, 2002; Ord. 1020 (part), 1997).


18.10.025 Special districts.

A. Repealed by Ord. 1657.

B. General Overlay Districts.

1. Transitional landscape area (TLA), as identified in the North Bend Comprehensive Plan Figure 1-5, includes specific locations along I-90 and North Bend Way within North Bend and the UGA, which require appropriate landscape transitions to help foster the existing small town character of North Bend, buffer incompatible uses, sustain the city’s natural assets for continued economic prosperity and quality of life, and support the regional efforts along the Interstate 90 (I-90) corridor, a designated national scenic byway that gets international tourism promotion from the Federal Scenic Byways Program. North Bend is considered the “Gateway to the Puget Sound” from westbound I-90, therefore careful consideration should be taken with regard to landscaping and buffering intensive uses near and adjacent to the I-90 corridor in order to support the goals of the national scenic byway designation along the scenic I-90 corridor. Where a TLA affects more than 20 percent of the total gross area of any parcel, the TLA may be reduced such that not more than 20 percent of the total gross area of the parcel is affected by the TLA, subject to performance standards found in NBMC 18.10.050 and landscape criteria found in Chapter 18.18 NBMC. Regional trail linkages are allowed within the TLA. The TLA applies to new commercial or industrial development applications, residential building permits, short plats, subdivisions and multifamily site plans, binding site plans, and/or clearing and grading permits associated with said applications. The TLA shall be measured from the edge of the applicable right-of-way and should either be placed in a tract to be dedicated to the applicable owners’ association, placed within an easement for transitional landscape area purposes, or subject to city approval, dedicated to the city for TLA and trail purposes.

2. Critical areas overlay district (CAOD) is intended to identify those areas within the North Bend urban growth area that include: (a) floodways, (b) channel migratory areas, (c) streams and associated buffers, and (d) wetlands and associated buffers where there are special regulations on the use and development of property in order to protect environmentally critical areas. The applicable development regulations are contained in Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC.

3. Urban Separator Overlay District (USOD). The urban separator is an area of North Bend which is located in, among and around significant natural features that help to define the community’s identity. The USOD, as identified in the North Bend Comprehensive Plan as Figure 1-6, includes land located predominately north of the Snoqualmie River, east of SR 202, and south of the boundary with the city of Snoqualmie. This area includes both Meadowbrook and Tollgate Farms. The intent of the USOD is to ensure that development occurs consistent with the goals and policies of the comprehensive plan requiring the minimum build-out of the zoning district in which the parcel is located. Property owners in the USOD may also take advantage of the transfer of development rights program to enable development rights to be transferred out of the USOD. NBMC 18.10.030, Table of permitted and conditional uses, identifies the permitted uses within the USOD. The permitted uses within the USOD must also satisfy the criteria stipulated in NBMC 18.10.040 in relation to bulk and dimensional standards, NBMC 18.10.050 in relation to performance standards and Chapter 18.34 NBMC, Design Standards and Guidelines. 

C. Master Plan Overlay Districts.

1. Process. A master plan overlay district (MPOD) provides a process by which a specific planned mix of uses and layout may be provided through a master plan to address unique site-specific opportunities and constraints.

a. The MPOD layout map shows the approximate location of future land uses, open spaces, public streets and access points.

b. All short plats, subdivisions, binding site plans, site plans or all other development approvals, including construction approvals, shall be generally consistent with the MPOD layout map, and shall conform to specific standards established under the MPOD, and the provisions of this chapter. The road location shown on the MPOD layout map may change in the final development plan, but shall be generally consistent with the layout map.

c. The first and initial land use development application for any parcel within the MPOD shall show the approximate location of all applicable land uses, open spaces, public streets and access points for the entire parcel or application site, allowing for the comprehensive planning intended by the MPOD.

2. Tanner Landing Master Plan Overlay District (Tanner Landing MPOD). The Tanner Landing MPOD is located between North Bend Way on the south and the Snoqualmie Valley Trail and King County’s Tanner Landing Park on the north.

a. Purpose. Due to the proximity of the Snoqualmie Valley Trail and King County’s Tanner Landing Park immediately north of the site, both of which are regionally significant recreation facilities, certain light industrial and manufacturing uses permitted by the underlying EP-1 zone could be inconsistent with the recreational uses and character of the immediate area. In addition, access to the eastern end of Tanner Landing Park is desired for future King County plans for improved whitewater access facilities and a more visible entrance to the park from North Bend Way. A master plan overlay district establishes a site plan and mix of uses more compatible with, and more oriented to, these important park and recreation lands and facilitates and enables future access to the eastern end of Tanner Landing Park. Should an applicant wish to propose a site layout or mix of uses alternative to that provided by the MPOD, the applicant may apply for a development agreement pursuant to Chapter 18.27 NBMC. Such development agreement shall not preclude other parcels within the MPOD from achieving conformance to the provisions of the MPOD.

b. Site Circulation. Streets and access locations to be constructed shall at a minimum include the following:

i. There shall be a maximum of three access locations into the parcel from North Bend Way, including the through street described below. An additional access point may be considered only for emergency access purposes or if warranted by a traffic study. Public and private access locations shall include minimum five-foot-wide sidewalks and minimum five-foot-wide planter strips at the intersection with North Bend Way, and may transition from there to alternative standards within the private development.

ii. A public north-south through street shall bisect the site in the eastern half of the parcel to enable future public access to the Tanner Landing Park, generally in the location identified on Figure 18.10.025-1.

(A) The north-south through street shall be constructed to curve and meander through the site as depicted in the below diagram and shall be dedicated to the city of North Bend with the recording of the final plat or final binding site plan approval, in a location so as to accommodate a minimum two-and-one-half-acre park east of the street, as further described under subsection (C)(2)(c) of this section.

(B) The north-south through street shall be constructed through the site to the boundary of the parcel containing the King County Snoqualmie Valley Trail, at approximately the location of the existing gated access into Tanner Landing Park, for future connection by King County into Tanner Landing Park. Construction of the road shall occur with the first phase of any development application.

(C) The north-south through street shall be located adjacent to the park area as depicted below in Figure 18.10.025-1.

(D) The north-south through street shall be constructed according to the standard for collector streets in Chapter 19.01 NBMC and the city of North Bend public works standards, or as otherwise approved to accommodate a low impact development design. Wherever buildings front to the street, the landscape strip shall be paved and shall include street trees and tree grates. Remaining areas of landscape strip shall be planted with street trees and ground cover.

iii. Vehicular and pedestrian connectivity shall be maintained through the site in an east-west direction between the most westerly entrance point to the north-south through street. This road shall meander throughout the site and not be a straight road. This connectivity may be via a private route or routes.

c. Site Layout and Mix of Uses. The uses allowed within the Tanner Landing MPOD are identified under Table 18.10.030, Permitted and Conditional Land Uses. Figure 18.10.025-1 identifies the locations where these uses are to be allowed on the site. Generally:

i. Residential and Retail-Commercial Area. The area west of the minimum two-and-one-half-acre park, comprising approximately 60,000 square feet, shall be reserved for retail-commercial uses and/or residential uses. Bulk and dimensional standards applicable to the residential and retail-commercial area shall be as established for the NB or HDR zone (depending on the use) per Table 18.10.040, Bulk and Dimensional Standards.

ii. Park-Oriented Retail Area. An area of approximately 10,000 square feet east of the north-south through street within the park shall be reserved for restaurant or recreation-oriented retail uses which complement the park (e.g., coffee shop, sandwich shop, and seasonal and year-round recreational uses, such as kayak, canoe, bicycle, hiking and skiing related sales, rental and repair). This area shall be dedicated to the city; provided, however, ownership of such restaurant or recreation-oriented uses may be private, subject to city approval. Such uses shall integrate with the park as determined by the CED director, based on consistency with the provisions of the city’s comprehensive plan, parks plan, or related planning documents. Bulk and dimensional standards applicable to the park-oriented retail area shall be as established for the NB zone per Table 18.10.040, Bulk and Dimensional Standards.

iii. Mixed Residential and Office Commercial Area. The area west of the residential and retail-commercial area shall be reserved for residential development and/or office commercial uses. A mix of residential and office commercial uses is preferred but not required.

(A) Bulk and dimensional standards applicable to residential uses shall be as established for the HDR zone per Table 18.10.040, Bulk and Dimensional Standards, except as follows:

(1) Density shall not exceed 10 dwelling units per acre. The retail-commercial area described in subsection (C)(2)(c)(i) of this section and the two-and-one-half-acre public park described in subsection (C)(2)(c)(iv) of this section shall not be included in calculating density;

(2) Frontage setbacks along North Bend Way shall be a minimum of 20 feet and may be increased to accommodate stormwater biochannels and other park features. Type 2 Landscaping, per Chapter 18.18 NBMC, shall be provided within the 20-foot setback along North Bend Way, except where biochannels exist;

(3) The rear yard setback shall be a minimum of 20 feet;

(4) A minimum of 30 feet shall exist between any multifamily structure or associated building within the development; and

(C) Required residential recreation and common space for the residential uses shall be as provided in Chapter 17.25 NBMC unless otherwise approved by the city in consideration of other park or open space land provided.

(D) A minimum of three trail access connections from the east-west through street to the Snoqualmie Valley Trail shall be provided within the mixed residential and office commercial area. Trail access connections shall be constructed per the requirements of Chapter 17.25 NBMC.

(E) The specific mix and locations of residential and commercial uses shall be guided by the following general provisions:

(1) The site planning for the mix of uses, if any, should be coordinated to provide view corridors from public and residential areas. Buildings shall be oriented to create a minimum of three unobstructed 60-foot-wide view corridors through the site to Mt. Si and Tanner Landing Park in locations determined by the city, providing visual penetration through the site to the natural features of Mt. Si and Tanner Landing Park. An unobstructed view corridor means there are no buildings within such view corridor.

(2) Required residential recreation and common space, as provided per Chapter 17.25 NBMC, should be located to connect with the Snoqualmie Valley Trail corridor, and coordinated with the location of the required trail access connections from the development.

(3) Commercial buildings should be oriented generally with a north-south axis to maintain view corridors through the site.

iv. Public Park. An area east of the north-south through street, and containing a minimum of two and one-half acres, shall be dedicated and conveyed to the city of North Bend for use as a public park prior to or concurrent with submittal of the first land use application, building permit application, or other development approval application on the site. A development agreement implementing these overlay zoning district regulations is not considered a development application for this purpose. Prior to the city’s acceptance of the dedication of the park site, the applicant shall remove all existing improvements from the park site, including the dilapidated house and accessory structures and equipment. A maximum of 10,000 square feet of the minimum two-and-one-half-acre park area shall be reserved for park-oriented commercial-retail development within the park as described above. The north-south through street shall not be included in the calculation of the two and one-half acres for the park. The park shall be named after the property owner upon dedication to the city of North Bend: “Dahlgren Family Park.”

d. Building Size and Orientation. In addition to the provisions of the applicable design standards in Chapter 18.34 NBMC, the following standards shall apply to the layout and orientation of buildings within the Tanner Landing MPOD:

i. Buildings constructed within the residential and retail-commercial area shall provide primary frontage to the north-south internal through street, with a focus on the intersection of the north-south through street and the east-west internal connection to the western parts of the site. Secondary frontage may be provided along the east-west internal connection;

ii. A plaza, constructed per the plaza requirements identified in NBMC 18.34.070, shall be located either on the west side of the north-south through street, or in association with a park-oriented commercial development on the east side of the north-south through street. The plaza shall be incorporated with the design of the building fronting to the plaza. The final location of the plaza will be determined by the development plan;

iii. Parking for buildings in the residential and retail-commercial area shall be located behind the buildings. Each residential unit shall provide an attached garage. Carports are not allowed. All parking must be screened from public streets by landscaping and/or architectural screening and located so their visual presence is minimized;

vi. All loading docks shall be located behind the buildings and not be visible from North Bend Way;

vii. Multifamily structures shall be designed to include usable covered decks, porches and/or balconies for each unit;

viii. Architectural features on buildings shall include large rough timbers, natural stone, handcrafted materials, use of natural materials, large roof overhangs and other architectural features typically seen in mountain or alpine buildings. No white vinyl window frames are allowed; and

ix. For residential developments, a mix and diversity of multifamily building structures shall be provided, including duplex, triplex and fourplex. No more than 20 percent of the total number of buildings in the development may contain the maximum of 10 dwelling units per building allowed under the HDR zone and such buildings shall not be located adjacent to North Bend Way.

3. East North Bend Master Plan Overlay District (ENB-MPOD).

a. Purpose. To accommodate a well coordinated mix of employment generating uses such as office, employment park, research and development and light manufacturing. Commercial truck services may be allowed subject to the provisions of this overlay district. It is the intent of the overlay district to coordinate vehicular circulation and site design to minimize possible adverse impacts to adjacent residential areas and nearby schools, while preserving the existing small town rural character of North Bend and nearby regional recreational areas. The overlay shall provide safe, efficient and well coordinated public traffic routes and minimize driveway cuts on North Bend Way and 468th Avenue SE. Buildings shall be oriented to and accessed by public streets or shared driveways as conceptually depicted in Figure 18.10.025-2.

b. Definitions.

i. “Warehouse” is a building or structure used for the storage of goods and/or materials, where the total gross floor area dedicated to the storage of goods and/or materials exceeds 65 percent; provided, however, if an applicant can provide evidence and make a showing that the primary function of the use within such building or structure is manufacturing, assembly, or reassembly of goods and materials, then it shall not be defined as a warehouse. In the event of multiple structures or buildings (e.g., campus-style layout) operated by a single user, the use is warehousing if aggregate warehousing exceeds 65 percent of the total gross floor area of all buildings associated with that single user.

ii. “Single user” means a single business entity that shares management, controlling ownership interests, storage areas or shared ingress and egress into that business entity.

iii. “Substantial improvements” means improvements worth more than

50 percent of the assessed value of the original building(s).

c. Site Circulation. Site circulation shall minimize driveway cuts and provide for safe, efficient and well coordinated traffic routes and intersections along North Bend Way and 468th Avenue SE. Public streets shall be provided within and through the ENB-MPOD generally as identified on Figure 18.10.025-2 and the following provisions. Locations of streets, depicted herein, are conceptual and may be adjusted subject to maintaining the overall circulation, connectivity and building orientation as described herein.

i. SE 144th Street shall be extended westward through the ENB-MPOD and intersect with a north/south collector street at the westerly boundary of the ENB-MPOD.

ii. A north/south collector street shall be provided between North Bend Way and SE 140th Street, at the westerly boundary of the ENB-MPOD.

iii. An additional north/south street shall be provided south to North Bend Way at approximately the west boundary of the existing or future expansion of the truck service area.

iv. One additional access point located between SE 144th Street and the existing access gate may be provided from 468th Avenue SE, which shall connect to the extension of SE 144th Street.

v. Street Standards. The public streets provided within the ENB-MPOD shall be designed per the collector street standard in Chapter 19.01 NBMC and the city of North Bend public works standards, unless otherwise approved by the city public works director. On-street parking may be prohibited to avoid overflow truck parking on public streets.

vi. Access to Parcels. Access to parcels shall be from shared driveways off the future public streets internal to the master plan and not from North Bend Way, SE 140th Street, or 468th Avenue SE. For parcels located adjacent to North Bend Way not more than four shared access points shall be permitted, one of which shall be constructed as a public street and connect to the street network internal to overlay district.

vii. No driveway access shall be allowed from the internal streets of the ENB-MPOD to the existing commercial truck center, more commonly known as Truck Town.

(B) Building footprint shall not exceed 150,000 square feet per building.

(C) Warehousing is prohibited.

(D) If any of the existing residential properties located within the ENB-MPOD are redeveloped into an EP-2 use, those properties shall be subject to the provisions of this overlay district. Access to the redeveloped sites should be via streets internal to the ENB-MPOD, to the extent feasible as determined in the reasonable discretion of the CED director.

(E) All loading docks shall be located behind the buildings and shall be screened from view from public streets using 15-foot Type 1 landscaping.

(F) Commercial truck center/service area is prohibited.

iii. Employment Park 2 – Office/Light Manufacturing. The EP-2-Office/Light Manufacturing area is located directly adjacent to North Bend Way with good exposure to I-90. All uses as permitted in the EP-2 zone as identified in NBMC Table 18.10.030, Permitted and Conditional Land Uses, are permitted, except the following uses are prohibited: automotive/vehicular uses, equipment rental, storage facilities, distribution/assembly centers and warehousing.

(A) Building Footprint Limitation. Building footprint shall not exceed 35,000 square feet per building.

(B) Buildings shall orient to and have the main entrance front North Bend Way.

(C) All loading docks shall be located behind the buildings and shall not be visible from North Bend Way.

(D) Assisted senior living and hotels are allowed subject to the following:

(1) A 30-foot Type 2 landscape buffer is provided on the side and rear property boundaries to mitigate any future conflict with incompatible uses on adjacent properties to the north.

(2) Hotels shall not exceed the district’s height limitation of 35 feet.

iv. Commercial Truck Center/Service Areas. The ENB-MPOD includes an existing commercial truck center/service area, commonly known as Truck Town, which is located on approximately 16.1 acres in the interchange commercial zone. Due to its location at the base of Snoqualmie Pass and at the gateway to the Puget Sound area, commercial truck traffic and overnight truck parking is often an issue, creating unmitigated adverse impacts to the city’s streets and air quality. This facility is currently the only commercial truck center in King County. The city has determined a new commercial truck center/service area or expansion of the existing use, beyond the current site, is not in the best interest of North Bend and therefore prohibited. The existing commercial truck center/service area may continue to operate and improve the facility, at its current site, subject to the provisions below. As used in this section, “substantial improvements” means new improvements having a market value worth more than 50 percent of the assessed value of the existing improvements as determined by the King County assessor and includes any repair or reconstruction of a structure; and/or to the site (other than a structure). “Substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration to any structure or other improvement to the site commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of any structure. The market value shall be determined by reviewing King County parcel data for improvements and the owner may be required to obtain an MAI appraisal to substantiate value. The market value and the cost of new improvements will be determined at the time of complete building permit submittal and shall take into account the cost of any improvements undertaken on the site within the 10-year period immediately preceding the date of submittal of such application. The term “substantial improvement” excludes any interior tenant improvements to a structure. The term runs with the property and not with the property owner.

(A) Substantial improvement to existing commercial truck center/service area facilities shall make available truck stop electrification capabilities, or other means for each truck to utilize to eliminate idling.

(B) Substantial improvement to existing commercial truck center/service area facilities shall require full compliance with the North Bend Municipal Code.

(C) Any redevelopment of the existing 16.1-acre commercial truck center/service area located in the interchange commercial zone shall locate all new retail, restaurants and commercial buildings along 468th Avenue SE and North Bend Way (see Figure 18.10.025-2, commercial building priority area). Truck and vehicular parking and truck service areas shall be placed to the rear and internal areas of the site. Truck parking is prohibited adjacent to North Bend Way or 468th Avenue SE. For the purposes of this subsection, “redevelopment” means construction of new buildings or demolition and reconstruction of any existing buildings or structures.

(D) Commercial truck parking areas shall not be located adjacent to public streets, unless a 30-foot, Type 2 landscape buffer is provided.

(E) Performance Standards. Commercial truck center/service area facilities and related uses shall comply with the performance standards as set forth in NBMC 18.10.050.

(F) Permitted Uses. For interchange commercial zoned property within the ENB-MPOD, all uses permitted in the IC zone as identified in Table 18.10.030, Permitted and Conditional Land Uses, are permitted including commercial truck center/service area facilities.

v. Site design for all uses within the ENB-MPOD shall provide for shared truck turning.

e. Buffering.

i. The required 40-foot transitional landscape area (TLA), located on SE 140th Street, shall be extended southward on 468th Avenue SE to SE 144th Street. If neighborhood retail/service uses are provided at the corner of SE 144th Street and 468th Avenue SE, the TLA may cease where the pedestrian oriented corner treatment of the building begins. The city may approve a reduced dimension of the TLA, in the reasonable discretion of the CED director, to accommodate architectural facade elements and other building design features.

ii. To allow for the retention of the existing and remaining evergreen trees along SE 140th Street and 468th Avenue SE, in lieu of constructing a sidewalk on the south side of SE 140th street and the west side of 468th Avenue SE, a meandering trail shall be provided within the 40-foot transitional landscape area. The trail shall meet the trail standards as set forth in Chapter 17.25 NBMC and ADA barrier-free standards.

iii. All perimeter buffer requirements as set forth in Chapter 18.18 NBMC shall apply.

4. Tanner Junction Master Plan Overlay District (Tanner Junction MPOD). The Tanner Junction MPOD includes properties zoned EP-1 that are located between North Bend Way to the north and SE 136th Street and I-90 to the south, and as further depicted on Figure 18.10.025-3.

a. Purpose. Due to the proximity of the single-family low density residential zones immediately to the south and west and the nearby Snoqualmie Valley Trail, certain light industrial and manufacturing uses permitted by the underlying EP-1 zone could be inconsistent with the recreational uses and residential character of the immediate area. A master plan overlay district establishes a site plan and mix of uses more compatible with these adjacencies. Should an applicant wish to propose a site layout or mix of uses alternative to that provided by the MPOD, the applicant may apply for a development agreement pursuant to Chapter 18.27 NBMC. Such development agreement shall not preclude other parcels within the MPOD from achieving conformance to the provisions of the MPOD.

b. Site Circulation, Frontage and Trails. Streets and access locations to be constructed shall at a minimum include the following:

i. Public and private access locations shall include minimum five-foot-wide sidewalks and minimum five-foot-wide planter strips at the public street intersections, and may transition from there to alternative standards within the private development.

ii. There shall be a maximum of two access locations from North Bend Way, including the collector street described below. The separate triangular-shaped eastern parcel ending in 9188 may have shared access with the adjoining parcel to the east onto SE North Bend Way, to allow for adequate separation from Tanner Road. An additional access point may be considered only for emergency access purposes or if warranted by a traffic study.

iii. At a minimum, a public north-south collector street shall bisect the site in the western half of the parcel to connect SE 136th Street with North Bend Way, in the location identified on Figure 18.10.025-3 connecting SE Tanner Road and SE 136th Street at 440th Place SE to the south.

(A) The north-south collector street shall be constructed and dedicated to the city of North Bend with the recording of the final plat, final binding site plan approval (if applicable), prior to final building permit, or other associated permit for a development proposal on the affected property.

(B) The north-south collector street shall be constructed according to the standard for collector streets in Chapter 19.01 NBMC and the city of North Bend public works standards, or as otherwise determined necessary by the city engineer.

(C) An additional street may be warranted depending on the type of development proposed to bisect the remaining parcel as shown dotted on Figure 18.10.025-3 and aligning with the proposed access points.

iv. The three most westerly parcels shall share one access point, to the extent feasible as determined by the city, from SE 136th Street to line up with 437th Place SE. An additional access point may be considered only for emergency access purposes, or if warranted by a traffic study approved by the city. An exit only may be allowed onto 436th Avenue SE at the city’s discretion.

v. In order to preserve existing significant trees along SE 136th Street and 436th Avenue SE, the public sidewalk shall meander through the retained significant trees, to the extent feasible as determined by the city. The CED director may allow flexible building setbacks to accommodate retention of the significant trees along the frontage and within the front yards.

vi. A 40-foot Type 2 transitional landscape area shall be provided along 136th Street on parcels where EP-1 uses are the only allowed uses and per the diagram below. A public trail, constructed per the trail construction standards in NBMC 17.25.065, shall be constructed along the southern boundary, and within the TLA, to connect the residential areas of SE 136th Street to the Snoqualmie Valley Trail. A public access trail easement containing the trail corridor shall be provided to the city, prior to final building permit approval for development on the affected parcel.

vii. A 10-foot-wide paved public trail (Tanner Trail) with 10-foot planter strip area containing street trees and associated turf and/or native shrubs and ground cover plantings, constructed per the trail construction standards in NBMC 17.25.065, built to match the existing Tanner Trail section located within downtown North Bend, shall be constructed along the SE North Bend Way frontage to connect with the King County Snoqualmie Valley Trail as shown on Figure 18.10.025-3. Existing significant trees shall be retained in this area unless there is conflict with an access point.

c. Any land use permit associated with properties fronting North Bend Way shall install a pedestrian crossing across North Bend Way providing a connection to Tanner Trail and Snoqualmie Valley Trail. The pedestrian crossing shall include at a minimum a perpendicular crosswalk at SE North Bend Way with reflective bumps and/or lights. Further safety measures may be determined necessary by the city through the development review process.

i. The applicant shall coordinate with King County Parks and the city of North Bend for a safe and efficient at-grade crossing of the Snoqualmie Valley Trail with SE North Bend Way and Tanner Trail.

ii. Trail parking of not less than three spaces shall be provided as part of any development application and shall be constructed in conjunction with the development. A bike rack is also encouraged.

d. Allowable Uses and Bulk and Dimensional Standards.

i. Uses within the Tanner Junction MPOD are as established in NBMC 18.10.030 based on the corresponding zones identified in Figure 18.10.025-3. Parcel Nos. 1423089132, 1423089136 and 1423089135 may be comprised of HDR uses and/or EP-1 uses, except single-family detached and cottage are not allowed within this overlay. A 20-foot Type 1 landscape transition area, pursuant to Chapter 18.18 NBMC Table 1, shall be installed between HDR and EP-1 uses. Except as expressly authorized in this subsection, no other HDR uses are allowed in this Tanner Junction MPOD.

ii. Bulk and dimensional standards applicable to residential uses shall be as established for the HDR zone per Table 18.10.040, Bulk and Dimensional Standards.

iii. Bulk and dimensional standards applicable to commercial and industrial uses shall be as established for the EP-1 zone per Table 18.10.040, Bulk and Dimensional Standards.

e. Building Size and Orientation. In addition to the provisions of the applicable design standards in Chapter 18.34 NBMC, the following standards shall apply to the layout and orientation of buildings within the Tanner Junction MPOD:

i. Commercial and industrial buildings constructed within the Tanner Junction MPOD shall provide primary frontage to either North Bend Way, SE Tanner Road or to the north-south internal through street, but shall not be oriented to SE 136th Street. The backs of buildings shall not be oriented to North Bend Way, SE Tanner Road or the north-south internal through street;

ii. Buffering to LDR. If any area immediately bordering SE 136th Street is used for commercial or industrial buildings rather than residential buildings, the property of the commercial or industrial building shall provide a 30-foot Type 1 landscape buffer along the frontage of SE 136th Street; and

iii. All loading docks shall be located behind the buildings and not be visible from North Bend Way.

f. Gateway Frontage at 436th Avenue SE and SE 136th Street. The intent of the open space tract at the corner is to retain the forested character, serving as a city gateway. Trees and native vegetation will be retained to the greatest extent possible as determined by the city, with clearing limited to removal of hazard trees and as necessary to accommodate trails and gateway features. The director may approve deviations to the setback or frontage improvements in order to retain trees. Additional elements for this gateway area shall include:

i. The minimum area shall be 66 feet along SE 136th and 82 feet along 436th Avenue SE;

ii. Meandering sidewalks, with pedestrian level lighting, through preserved and enhanced native vegetation as depicted below; and

iii. This area shall include small signage providing interpretation of natural flora or North Bend historic attributes.

g. Affordable Housing. HDR development on Parcel Nos. 1423089132, 1423089136 and 1423089135 in this overlay shall include no less than 20 percent affordable housing units for households earning at or below 80 percent of the area median income (AMI) for King County as reported by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (the “Local AMI”). Housing developed consistent with the requirements of this subsection shall automatically receive an exemption from ad valorem and other property taxation on the improvements. Such exemption shall be for a period of 12 successive years beginning January 1st of the year immediately following the calendar year of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy thereon.

The affordable units shall be intermixed throughout the development with the market rate units. The affordable units shall be a similar size to the market rate units within the development.

The price of affordable units is based on that amount a household can afford to pay for housing when the household pays no more than 30 percent of household income for housing expenses, and household income is at or below 80 percent of the Local AMI.

If HUD no longer publishes median figure incomes for the King County area, then the city may use any other similar method for determining the King County area median income, adjusted for household size. If the percentage of affordable units in the project required is a fraction, then the number of required affordable units shall be rounded up to the next whole number (unit) if the fraction of the whole number is at least 0.66.

Prior to issuing a certificate of occupancy, an agreement in a form acceptable to the city attorney that addresses price restrictions, eligible household qualifications, and long-term affordability requirements shall be recorded with the King County recorder’s office. This agreement shall be a covenant running with the land and shall be binding on the assigns, heirs and successors of the applicant. Housing units identified for households with household annual income restrictions that are provided under this section shall continue to be made available to households with the identified household annual income restrictions for 12 years from the date of the initial certificate of occupancy.

h. Performance Standards. All HDR development shall comply with all provisions of the NBMC and the following additional performance standards:

i. Common Open Space. HDR development shall include a minimum of 200 square feet per unit of common open space in one contiguous and usable centrally located and easily accessible area to all units within the development with a minimum dimension of 50 feet on all sides.

(A) The common open space shall be located so it will be surrounded by buildings on at least two sides;

(B) At least 50 percent of the buildings in the development shall abut the common open space. A building is considered to “abut” an area of open space if there is no structure between the unit and the open space; and

(C) The common open space should provide a sense of openness, visual relief and community; must be outside of wetlands, streams and buffers; and shall be developed and maintained to provide for passive and/or active recreational activities for the residents of the development. Land located between dwelling units, included within required yard setbacks and/or abutting rights-of-way or access easements may not serve as required common open space. Fences may not be located within common open space.

ii. Each building abutting a public right-of-way shall have an inviting facade such as a primary or secondary entrance or porch, oriented to the public right-of-way. If the building abuts more than one public right-of-way, the city shall determine to which right-of-way the inviting facade shall be oriented.

iii. Buildings and units shall be oriented to take advantage of views of Mt. Si, other mountains, rivers or other natural features.

iv. Variation in Unit Sizes, Building and Site Design. Buildings should establish building site design that promotes variety and visual interest that is compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and will comply with NBMC 18.34.060.

v. Pedestrian Flow-Through Development. Pedestrian connections shall link all buildings and units to the public right-of-way, common open space and parking areas.

vi. All parking must be provided on the subject property, must be screened from public streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping and/or architectural screening and located so their visual presence is minimized and associated noise or other impacts do not intrude into public spaces.

5. Neighborhood Business Residential Overlay District (NB MPOD). The NB MPOD includes certain parcels zoned neighborhood business district between SE 140th and SE North Bend Way (except those fronting directly to SE North Bend Way) and as further depicted on Figure 18.10.025-4.

a. Purpose. To reduce incompatible uses and provide consistency with the character and build-out of existing lots in this area, it is recognized that continuing to allow single-family detached and cottage within this portion of the NB zone should be allowed. This area is unique as 455th Avenue SE and SE 141st Street remains private, which could limit commercial development. This overlay would be in effect until such time a comprehensive plan amendment and zoning change are approved. If a comprehensive plan amendment and zoning change to these parcels are approved by council to change the land use from commercial to residential and zoning from neighborhood business to low density residential, this overlay would no longer be needed.

b. Allowable Uses and Bulk and Dimensional Standards. Uses within the Neighborhood Business MPOD are as established in NBMC 18.10.030 based on the corresponding zones identified in Figure 18.10.025-4 and may be comprised of NB uses, except single-family detached and cottage are allowed within this overlay. A 15-foot Type 1 landscape transition area, pursuant to Chapter 18.18 NBMC Table 1, shall be installed between the commercial properties abutting SE North Bend Way and the NB MPOD behind. If single-family or cottage is proposed, the bulk and dimensional standards for those uses per NBMC 18.10.040 shall apply and not NB standards.

C. Commercial accessory uses that are not permitted as primary uses within a zone may be allowed subject to review and approval of the CED director. In approving the accessory use, the director must find that the accessory use:

1. Is limited in scope to no more than 25 percent of the floor area of the primary use; 

2. Is necessary in order for the primary use to operate; and

3. Is consistent with NBMC 18.10.020, Zoning districts – Purposes.

The director may impose conditions on the accessory use to limit its scope and potential impacts to adjacent properties and uses;

D. All conditional uses shall meet standards and procedures outlined in Chapter 18.24 NBMC;

E. Said land, building, or structure meets nonconforming use provisions in Chapter 18.30 NBMC;

F. See NBMC 18.10.025 for all permitted uses within the master plan overlay districts;

G. Affordable housing projects that are not expressly permitted may be allowed subject to entering into a development agreement per Chapter 18.27 NBMC.

GENERAL NOTES – TABLE OF BULK AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS: 

A.    Relation to Table 18.10.030. Uses listed in the table of bulk and dimensional standards parallel, in sequential order, the uses listed in Table 18.10.030, except that uses in the table of bulk and dimensional standards are often aggregated. Design guidelines (Chapter 18.34 NBMC) and performance standards (NBMC 18.10.050) must also be consulted.

B.    Application. Bulk and dimensional standards from Table 18.10.040 shall apply to principal and accessory structures. Additional standards for accessory uses and structures on residential sites are addressed in NBMC 18.10.041.

FOOTNOTES – TABLE OF BULK AND DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS: 

(1)    Minimum lot size is a measure of the total area within the boundary lines of a lot (gross lot area) including the area of an easement, any critical areas and their buffers. If there is a conflict between the minimum lot size and the permitted number of dwelling units per acre, the minimum lot size controls. Minimum lot size refers to the smallest legally established single parcel of land that is required to construct a structure in that zone. The minimum lot size does not correlate to the density.

(2)    The average lot size shall be 8,000 square feet, with a minimum lot size of 7,500 square feet. Chapter 17.25 NBMC, Residential Recreation and Common Space Requirements, shall be met.

(3)    LDR Zone. Up to 25 percent of lots within a development may have a minimum front setback of 10 feet for homes with front loaded side-entry garages.

(4)    There is no minimum lot size for multifamily residential structures. The lot area per dwelling unit provision controls minimum and maximum lot sizes.

(5)    Elderly Homes and Related Uses. Minimum lot area per dwelling unit required for complexes without individually self-sufficient living quarters is 700 square feet per unit. Minimum lot area per dwelling unit required for homes with individually self-sufficient living quarters is 1,000 square feet per unit.

(6)    Front yard building projections including but not limited to awnings, cornices, eaves, bay windows, and other architectural features may project into front yard areas not more than 30 inches. Porches may project into front yard areas not more than five feet. For corner lots fronting arterial or collector streets, front yard building facades shall be set back from the street per line-of-sight requirements for fences as set forth in NBMC 18.18.175 within the clear view triangle area for traffic safety.

(7)    For single-family detached dwellings in the LDR zoning district, cottages, duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes, garages or carports shall be set back a minimum of 20 feet from the property line to the face of the garage. Rear yard and alley access garages and/or carports are preferred. Garages or carports that gain access from an alley may be set back five feet from the alley property line to the face of the garage. See design guidelines, Chapter 18.34 NBMC. For other multifamily dwellings, parking areas, including but not limited to garages or carports, shall be located in rear yard areas; provided, that understory parking may be provided below units.

(8)    The 20-foot standard is for major utilities; there is no front yard setback requirement for minor utilities.

(9)    Side yard building projections including but not limited to awnings, cornices, eaves, bay windows, and other architectural features may project into side yards not more than 24 inches. Porches may project into side yard areas not more than two feet. For corner lots, side yard building facades shall be set back 10 feet from the street, or per line-of-sight requirements in NBMC 18.18.175, to provide the clear view triangle area for traffic safety as necessary.

(10)    Where more than one multifamily building sits on a lot, interior side yards shall be a minimum of 20 feet between two multifamily buildings. Side yard setback and minimum lot width apply only to buildings as a whole, and not to lots created for zero lot line units constructed as a part of such buildings. Townhome is a single-family attached unit in one building – zero lot line side yard setback permitted.

(11)    Rear yard building projections including but not limited to awnings, cornices, eaves, bay windows, and other architectural features may project into rear yards not more than 30 inches. Porches and decks may project into rear yard areas not more than 15 feet.

(12)    Building Height.

a.    Chimneys may extend approximately six feet above the maximum height measurement; bell/clock towers or similar architectural design features may extend not more than 10 feet above the 35-foot maximum height requirement in the DC and IC zones; and in no case shall exceed 45 feet; church steeples are permitted up to 45 feet in applicable zoning districts. Rooftop mechanical equipment may extend six feet over the height limit on commercial and industrial buildings if it is set back at least 15 feet from the edge of a roof and covers not more than 10 percent of a roof area.

b.    DC Zone. Maximum building height from Sydney Avenue North to Downing Avenue North, south of West Second Street (excluding the historic district) shall be 45 feet. Maximum building height, all other areas, shall be 35 feet.

(13)    Maximum building coverage applies to principal and accessory structures on a site, including garages. It does not apply to driveways, parking lots/parking areas, decks/patios, or other nonstructural elements.

(14)    Mixed Building Provision. In the case of mixed-use buildings (e.g., first floor commercial/second floor residential), standards of the first floor use shall apply except that the minimum lot size shall meet the requirements for upper floor dwellings.

(15)    Floor area ratio is equal to the gross building floor area, divided by net on-site land area (square feet). For example, an FAR of 0.25 means a 2,500-square-foot building could be constructed on a lot with 10,000 square feet of net buildable area.

(16)    Transfer of development rights (TDR) is defined and regulated by Chapter 18.36 NBMC.

18.10.041 Bulk and dimensional standards for residential accessory units, structures and uses.

A. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs), detached garages, and carports shall be located in side yard or rear yard areas only. All other accessory uses and structures to single-family dwellings, with the exception of fences, shall be located strictly in rear yard areas.

B. Detached ADUs, detached garages, and detached carports shall maintain five-foot side yard and five-foot rear yard setbacks; however, side or rear yard setbacks may be reduced to zero feet on one side yard lot line if the side yard on the opposite side is a minimum of 15 feet for single-family and 10 feet for cottage. All other accessory uses and structures to single-family dwellings shall maintain five-foot side and rear yard setbacks.

C. For multifamily dwellings, accessory uses and structures shall be located strictly in rear yard areas, and maintain the same standards in subsections (C)(2) and (3) of this section, except that:

1. Garages may be located under residential units.

2. Clubhouses, recreation centers, pools, or sport courts may be located per site plan review and approval.

3. Fences shall be regulated per NBMC 18.18.175.

D. On corner lots, to provide a clear view/sight-distance triangle per NBMC 18.18.175, a 10-foot side yard setback is required.

E. Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) do not require additional lot area than that required for a single-family dwelling, except ADUs are not permitted on lots less than 4,000 square feet.

F. Height shall not exceed 25 feet.

G. Nonconforming Lots and/or Structures. Lots, structures, and/or land uses legally created and/or legally in existence prior to the adoption date of these standards are not subject to the bulk and dimensional standards herein; provided, that any remodeling, reconstruction, or new construction on such lots or to such structures shall meet all bulk and dimensional standards.

H. Conflict with Other Code Provisions. Where bulk and dimensional standards conflict with other standards, provisions of NBMC 18.04.020 shall apply.

I. Site perimeter landscaping requirements in Chapter 18.18 NBMC shall apply to all sites unless precluded by placement of a building to a conflicting minimum setback distance.

J. Shall comply with NBMC 18.10.050(1.52), Land Use Performance Standards. (Ord. 1334 § 3, 2008).


18.10.050 Table of performance standards.

To further implement purposes of the zoning title, and to further implement purposes of the respective zoning districts, performance standards are established for respective land uses in Table 18.10.050, Land Use Performance Standards.

PREFACE: The following table of performance standards is to be utilized in conjunction with Table 18.10.030. Within the latter table, uses that have specific performance standards are preceded with an asterisk (*). In turn, the required performance standards are listed in this table. The following standards are in relation to basic use provisions; they are not exhaustive, as additional city codes and regulations, as well as regional, state, federal, or other guidelines, standards, requirements, and/or regulations may apply to land uses and land developments. Therefore, applicants for land uses or developments must become familiar with all applicable standards. This table includes standards for some uses that are not listed in Table 18.10.030, as well as environmental quality performance standards that apply to all land uses (see Sections 7.00 and 8.00, respectively, below).

18.11.010 User guide.

This chapter provides standards when developing cottages, carriage units, and two-unit homes in zones where said uses are allowed. If you are interested in proposing development containing a mix of cottage, carriage, or two-unit homes, or you wish to participate in the city’s decision on a project including these types of housing units, you should read this chapter.

This chapter also provides provisions regulating the development of low-density residential single-family within the cottage residential zone, resulting in a mix of housing choices and densities within said zone. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.020 Standards, intent, and voluntary provisions.

For properties located within the cottage residential (CR) zone, the provisions of this chapter are required and mandated. For properties located within the downtown commercial (DC) zone and the low-density residential (LDR) zone, the provisions of this chapter are available as alternatives to the development of typical detached single-family homes, subject to the limitations in this chapter. In the event of a conflict between the standards in this chapter and the standards in other chapters of the North Bend Municipal Code (NBMC), the standards in this chapter shall control. These standards are intended to address the changing composition of households, and the need for smaller, and more diverse housing choices. Providing for a variety of housing types also encourages innovation and diversity in housing design and site development, while ensuring compatibility with surrounding single-family residential development. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.030 Housing types defined.

The following definitions apply to the housing types allowed through the provisions in this chapter:

A. “Cottage” means a detached, single-family dwelling unit containing 1,500 square feet or less.

B. “Carriage unit” means a single-family dwelling unit, not to exceed 800 square feet in gross floor area, located above a garage structure in a cottage housing development.

C. “Two-unit home” means a structure containing two dwelling units, designed to look like a detached single-family home, which does not exceed 2,000 square feet total for both units.

D. “Standard single-family home” means a detached, single-family dwelling unit containing 1,501 square feet or more. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.040 Parameters for cottages, carriage units and two-unit homes.

Within permitted cottage housing developments, any future remodels to a cottage, two-unit home, or carriage dwelling unit shall not result in the dwelling unit exceeding the size limitations for said structure established per subsection B of this section, with cottages allowed up to 1,500 square feet in size. For standalone cottages built on a single lot outside of cottage housing developments, applicants modifying a cottage dwelling to increase its size beyond 1,500 square feet shall pay the difference in impact fees due between a cottage dwelling and standard single-family residential dwelling at the rate in effect per the taxes, rates and fees schedule at the time of building permit issuance.

Q. Community buildings and community space are encouraged in cottage developments, particularly for cottage developments of 12 or more units. If provided, community buildings or space shall be clearly incidental in use and size to the dwelling units and shall meet the following:

1. Building height for community buildings shall be no greater than one story.

2. Community buildings must be located on the same site as the cottage housing development, and be commonly owned by the residents. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.050 Cottage housing design standards and guidelines.

Cottages and cottage housing developments shall meet the following design standards:

A. Applicable Provisions of Chapter 18.34 NBMC, Design Standards and Guidelines. Cottages and carriage units shall comply with NBMC 18.34.050(A) though (E), in addition to the standards in this chapter. Cottages and carriage units shall not be subject to NBMC 18.34.050(F) through (H). Single-family homes and two-unit homes within cottage developments shall comply with all applicable provisions of Chapter 18.34 NBMC. Two-unit homes shall be reviewed as one structure and shall comply with the single-family design standards of Chapter 18.34 NBMC.

B. Orientation of Dwelling Units. Dwellings within a cottage housing development should be oriented to promote a sense of community, both within the development, and with respect to the larger community, outside of the cottage project. A cottage development should not be designed to “turn its back” on the public street.

1. Where feasible, each dwelling unit that abuts a common open space shall have a primary entry and/or covered porch oriented to the common open space.

2. Each dwelling unit abutting a public right-of-way (not including alleys) shall have an inviting facade, such as a primary or secondary entrance or porch, oriented to the public right-of-way. For any lot or dwelling unit abutting more than one public right-of-way, NBMC 17.08.105, Lot layout and design, shall apply.

3. All sides of a cottage within a cottage cluster must be architecturally treated with details similar to the front of the dwelling so as to present an attractive face to all surrounding neighborhoods, including details such as window trim, wall articulation, and/or covered patios.

C. Required Common Open Space. Common open space should provide a sense of openness, visual relief, and community for cottage developments. The space must be outside of wetlands, streams and their buffers, and developed and maintained to provide for passive and/or active recreational activities for the residents of the development.

1. Land located between dwelling units and an abutting right-of-way or access easement greater than 21 feet in width may not serve as required common open space, unless the area is reserved as a separate tract, and does not contain pathways leading to individual units or other elements that detract from its appearance and function as a shared space for all residents.

2. Required common open space may be divided into no more than two separate areas per cluster of dwelling units.

3. Common open space shall be located in a central area easily accessible to all dwellings within the development.

4. Fences may not be located within required open space areas. Fences located in the front yard shall not exceed four feet in height and shall be a split rail, picket, or other visually penetrable design unless otherwise approved by the homeowners’ association.

5. Landscaping located in common open space areas shall be designed to allow for easy access and use of the space by all residents, and to facilitate maintenance needs. To the maximum extent feasible, existing mature trees shall be retained throughout the site.

6. Unless the shape or topography of the site precludes the ability to locate units adjacent to the common open space, the following standards must be met:

a. The open space shall be located so that it will be surrounded by cottages or two-unit homes on at least two sides; and

b. At least 75 percent of the units in the development shall abut a common open space. A cottage is considered to abut an area of open space if there is no structure between the unit and the open space.

7. Surface water management facilities shall not be placed within common open space areas and shall not count toward common open space requirements. Low impact development (LID) features are encouraged, provided they do not adversely impact access to or use of the common open space for a variety of activities. Conventional stormwater collection and conveyance tools, such as flow control and/or water quality vaults are permitted if located underground.

8. All common open space areas shall be owned and maintained by the homeowners’ association of the development.

D. Shared Detached Garages, Carports, and Surface Parking Design. Parking areas should be located so their visual presence is minimized, and associated noise or other impacts do not intrude into public spaces. These areas should also maintain the single-family character along public streets.

1. Shared detached garage structures may not exceed four garage doors per building, and a total of 1,200 square feet.

2. For shared detached garages or carports, the design of the structure must be similar and compatible to that of the dwelling units within the development.

3. Shared detached garage structures, carports, and surface parking areas must be screened from public streets and adjacent residential uses by landscaping or architectural screening.

4. The covenants, conditions, and restrictions of the homeowners’ association of the cottage housing development shall require that shared detached garage structures be reserved for the parking of vehicles owned by the residents of the development, and shall prohibit the storage of such quantity of items within garages as to preclude the parking of vehicles.

5. Surface parking areas may not be located in clusters of more than four spaces. Clusters must be separated by a distance of at least 10 feet and planted with Type 2 landscaping.

E. Low Impact Development. The proposed site design shall incorporate the use of low impact development (LID) strategies where feasible to meet stormwater management standards. LID is a set of techniques that mimic natural watershed hydrology by slowing, evaporating/transpiring, and filtering water, which allows water to soak into the ground closer to its source. The design should seek to meet the following objectives:

1. Preservation of natural hydrology;

2. Reduced impervious surfaces;

3. Treatment of stormwater in numerous small, decentralized structures;

4. Use of natural topography for drainageways and storage areas;

5. Preservation of portions of the site in undisturbed, natural conditions; and

6. Reduction of the use of piped systems. Whenever possible, site design should use multifunctional open drainage systems such as vegetated swales or filter strips which also help to fulfill landscaping and open space requirements.

F. Pedestrian Flow through Development. Pedestrian connections should link all buildings to the public right-of-way, common open space, and parking areas. On-site pedestrian walkways shall be a minimum of four feet wide. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.060 Low-density residential and standard single-family when mixed within CR zone.

A. To allow for a mix of housing choices and design for developments containing greater than four acres, up to 20 percent of the units may consist of standard single-family homes located to separate the cottage clusters, subject to the following provisions:

1. Lots shall have a minimum lot size of 8,000 square feet;

2. Density shall not exceed four DU/acre;

3. Height shall not exceed 35 feet, as measured per Chapter 18.06 NBMC;

4. Lot coverage shall not exceed 50 percent;

5. Standard single-family homes and lots shall comply with the North Bend Municipal Code low-density residential zone bulk and dimensional requirements per NBMC 18.10.040 and performance standards per NBMC 18.10.050 unless otherwise provided in this chapter;

6. Twenty percent of the single-family units shall be one story;

7. Two-unit homes are not allowed within any standard single-family development;

8. To preserve the significant trees and retain the existing rural character along Stilson Avenue, front yard setbacks shall be not less than 30 feet; and

9. Driveways and access points along Stilson Avenue shall be limited to four per side of road. Shared driveways are highly encouraged. (Ord. 1657 § 1 (part), 2018).


18.11.070 Cottage residential zone-wide design parameters.

A. Stilson Avenue (from North Bend Way to Cedar Falls Avenue). To retain the rural character of this existing street, the following provisions shall apply:

All parcels abutting Stilson Avenue SE shall be developed per the low-density residential zoning standards.

Existing significant trees located adjacent to the right-of-way, as depicted in 18.11.070 Figure A, shall be retained. The retained trees shall be considered the planter strip and shall be of a width necessary to preserve the trees. The required sidewalks shall be located behind or meander through the trees. Stormwater improvements shall be provided appropriately to retain trees.

Access locations off Stilson Avenue shall not exceed what currently exists: four per side, unless otherwise unavoidable. Shared driveways are highly encouraged.

1. Cedar Falls Way. A maximum of three access points shall be provided and located to line up with the following existing streets to the south:

a. Access Point 1: Salish Avenue SE; and

b. Access Point 2: La Forest Drive SE; and

c. Access Point 3: La Forest Drive SE; and

d. The city may approve additional driveways for parcels abutting Cedar Falls Way if necessary when developed independent of a larger consolidated development.

2. Views, Buffered Street Terminus, and Trails. The following standards shall be followed to the extent possible given the size of the development project submittal:

a. From Access Point 1 off Cedar Falls Way, a view corridor and view park to Mt. Si shall be provided allowing for views of Mt. Si and a natural treed terminus. This area shall be no less than 1,000 square feet.

b. From Access Points 2 and 3 off Cedar Falls Way, a view/buffer terminus providing a vegetated visual appearance when entering the area shall be provided. This area shall be not less than 800 square feet and planted with Type 2 landscaping.

c. A minimum of three north/south eight-foot paved trails shall be provided through the site connecting with Tanner Trail.

3. Cedar Falls Frontage Improvements. Frontage improvements for development within the cottage residential zone along Cedar Falls Way shall comply with the following provisions:

a. Excess Right-of-Way. A portion of the existing Cedar Falls Way right-of-way (ROW), located on the north side of the road adjacent to the public works site and east to the intersection of Salish Avenue SE across the street, contains excess ROW area and a mature forest. In this ROW area, the existing forest and significant trees shall be retained. An eight-foot meandering multipurpose trail shall be constructed pursuant to the provisions below. Additional trails may be constructed in this area subject to city approval.

b. Cedar Falls Way Buffer. A minimum 35-foot landscape buffer shall be provided along the northern edge of Cedar Falls Way for parcels zoned cottage residential, and this landscape buffer shall be dedicated to the city of North Bend. This 35-foot landscape buffer shall include the following:

i. Existing Sewer Easement. A 15-foot existing sewer easement and sewer line currently exists on the northern edge of Cedar Falls Avenue. This area shall be planted with Type 2 landscaping per Chapter 18.18 NBMC. However, adjustments to said landscaping requirements, to be approved by the city, may be necessary to address planting restrictions over an existing sewer line; and

ii. Twenty-Foot Native Frontage Buffer. In addition to the 15-foot existing sewer easement landscaping described above, a 20-foot buffer shall be provided and dedicated to the city of North Bend. This buffer shall preserve the existing native vegetation, trees and significant trees. Where areas within this 20-foot buffer do not achieve a Type 1 landscape standard, supplemental plantings shall be installed to achieve a Type 1 landscape standard per Chapter 18.18 NBMC.

c. An eight-foot-wide paved trail (per Chapters 17.25 and 19.01 NBMC and the city of North Bend public works standards) shall meander through the 35-foot buffer area preserving significant trees to the maximum extent feasible. This 35-foot buffer and trail are in lieu of the typically required curb/gutter planter strip and sidewalk required on the south side of the road.

C. Burlington Northern Railway Right-of-Way.

1. For development sites located adjacent to the Burlington Northern right-of-way (ROW), the developer may purchase the Burlington Northern ROW and dedicate no less than 40 feet for Tanner Trail and open spaces purposes to the city.

A. All off-street parking, including associated driveways and drive isles required by any city ordinance, except in the case of single-family residential uses, shall be paved. The subsurface and paving surface shall be of such materials and constructed in such a manner as the city engineer deems appropriate, given the traffic usage of the particular off-street parking involved.

B. Provided, however, in the case of recreational uses such as campgrounds, playfields, ballfields and similar uses located in the POSPF zone, the city engineer may, in his discretion, allow parking spaces to be constructed of some other surface other than concrete-asphalt paving. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 693 § 1, 1986: Ord. 336 § 4.02 (part), 1970).


18.16.025 Paving of driveways and off-street parking – Single-family residences.

Driveways and off-street parking for single-family residences need not be paved; provided, however, where said residence abuts upon a paved street, the driveway access and any parking must be paved from the paved street to the building setback line or a distance of 25 feet, whichever is greater. The subsurface and paving surface shall be of such materials and constructed in such a manner as the city engineer deems appropriate and pursuant to any applicable city design and construction standards. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 693 § 2, 1986).

D. For uses other than those specified above, not more than 500 feet. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 336 § 4.02 (A), 1970).


18.16.040 Off-street parking – Expansion, enlargement or change of use.

A. Expansion or Enlargement. Whenever any building or land use requiring parking is enlarged in height or in ground coverage, off-street parking shall be provided for said expansion or enlargement in accordance with the requirements of the schedule; provided, however, that no parking space need be provided in the case of enlargement or expansion where the number of parking spaces required for such expansion or enlargement is less than 10 percent of the parking spaces specified in the schedule for the building or land use. 

Nothing in this provision shall be construed to require off-street parking spaces for the portion of such building or land use existing at the time of passage of the ordinance codified in this title.

B. Change of Use. When a residential structure is changed into a commercial structure, excluding a home occupation use, off-street parking shall be provided for the commercial use as required by this chapter. The change of use provision shall not apply in the downtown commercial (DC) zoning district when improvements are less than 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure over a 10-year period. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 336 § 4.02 (B), 1970).


18.16.050 Off-street parking – Mixed occupancies.

In the case of mixed uses, the total requirements for the various uses shall be computed separately. Off-street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered, as specified in NBMC 18.16.070, for joint use. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 336 § 4.02 (C), 1970).


18.16.060 Off-street parking – Uses not specified.

In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this chapter, the requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be determined by the director. Such determination shall be based upon the requirements for the most comparable use listed. Where a comparable use is not listed, the director may consult standards of other jurisdictions and professional standards of organizations such as the Urban Land Institute. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 336 § 4.02 (D), 1970).

1. Landscape Soil Source. All soils required for landscape beds, lawns and planting strips for the site shall be retained and stockpiled from existing site organic soils where suitable for reuse, harvested from the A and B horizons and shall meet the criteria below. Screening/sifting is not required because this process destroys soil structure and texture, specifically peds or clods, important for soil health. If on-site soils are not acceptable or available in the volume needed, similar suitable soils from off site shall be provided.

a. Soil shall not contain more than 25 percent gravel or drain rock;

b. Soil volume shall not be comprised of more than 25 percent of roots, chips or woody material. No chemicals, construction materials or foreign materials shall be allowed in the final soil; 

c. Rock and woody materials larger than two inches diameter exposed at the surface after placement shall be raked out of the landscape and planting beds;

d. Soils shall be tested in a soil lab and analyzed for acceptable ranges of soil particles, nutrients, organic matter, salts and pH. Soil analysis shall include recommendations for amendments for soil to be acceptable. Soils shall be altered pursuant to the recommendations of the soil analysis; and 

e. Soils shall be protected from compaction and heavy moisture while being stored, and should not be moved or placed in the landscape areas while saturated. 

2. Soil Preparation in Landscape Areas. 

a. Lawns. 

i. Acceptable soils shall be incorporated to a minimum depth of 12 inches using a backhoe bucket with teeth. Soils should be tamped lightly to minimize excessive settling. Only the top two to four inches should be tilled, if needed, to provide a smooth surface. Soils should be tamped by hand or light equipment only. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. Sod or seed as specified per the landscape plans.

ii. If existing soils are unacceptable, 12 inches shall be removed. The existing subgrade shall be scarified to a minimum six-inch depth with a backhoe. Six inches of acceptable soils shall be placed over the scarified subgrade, then mixed into the subgrade and tamped lightly with backhoe or other appropriate equipment. The final six inches of acceptable topsoil should be tamped lightly to minimize settling. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. 

iii. Soils shall be incorporated to the appropriate depth such that a soil probe will plunge to 12 inches without excessive resistance. 

b. Shrub and Ground Cover Beds.

i. Acceptable soils shall be incorporated to a minimum depth of 24 inches using a backhoe bucket with teeth or other appropriate equipment. Soils should be tamped lightly to minimize excessive settling. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. 

ii. If existing soils are unacceptable, 18 inches shall be removed. The existing subgrade shall be scarified to a minimum six-inch depth with backhoe. Six inches of acceptable soils shall be placed over the scarified subgrade, then mixed into the final subgrade and tamped lightly with backhoe or other appropriate equipment. The final 12 inches of acceptable topsoil should be placed in two six-inch lifts and tamped lightly to minimize settling. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. 

iii. Soils shall be incorporated to the appropriate depth such that a soil probe will plunge to 24 inches without excessive resistance.

c. Tree Planter Strips, and within 10 Feet of Tree Planting Locations in Planter Beds and Lawns.

i. Acceptable soils shall be incorporated to a minimum depth of 36 inches using a backhoe bucket with teeth or other appropriate equipment. Soils should be tamped lightly to minimize excessive settling. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. 

ii. If existing soils are unacceptable, 24 inches of soil shall be removed. The existing subgrade shall be scarified to a minimum 12-inch depth with a backhoe. The applicant shall ensure that soil excavation for amended or supplemental soils within the planter strip does not destabilize soils under the adjacent sidewalk or curb, retaining a two to one side slope of underlying structural soils adjacent to the curb and sidewalk, or as otherwise necessary to ensure structural stability. Six inches of acceptable soils shall be placed over the scarified subgrade, mixed into the subgrade and tamped lightly with a backhoe. The final 18 inches of acceptable topsoil shall be placed in two nine-inch lifts and tamped lightly to minimize settling. Slightly mounding the final grade is recommended to compensate for likely settling. 

iii. Soils shall be incorporated to the appropriate depth such that a soil probe will plunge to 36 inches without excessive resistance.

3. Drainage. All landscape soils must drain. If drainage from landscape areas does not meet or exceed one-inch depth drainage in one hour, then additional drainage shall be provided.

a. Exemptions.

i. Areas exceeding a four to one slope are exempt from additional drainage requirements. 

ii. Soils with proven natural drainage greater than one inch per hour are exempt.

b. Drainage, where necessary, shall consist of installing four-inch perforated pipe in linear layout or no less than 10 feet apart at the 18-, 24- or 30-inch depth, depending on the type of planting bed or strip. The trench for the pipe shall be 12 inches by 12 inches to accommodate the four-inch perforated pipe. The pipe shall be connected to a storm drain or outfall for positive flow. No filter fabric is recommended around or over the pipe. The pipe shall be covered and surrounded by four inches of drain rock on all sides. Soil preparation shall follow as described above. (Ord. 1671 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 1390 § 1, Exh. A (part), 2010: Ord. 1305 § 1, Exh. A (part), 2008).

A. Request. An applicant may request a modification of the landscaping requirements set forth in NBMC 18.18.060 through 18.18.140; provided, that modifications shall not allow disturbance of protected or environmentally sensitive critical areas and that street frontage landscaping shall be maintained.

B. Review. The planning director may approve modifications to the standards set forth in NBMC 18.18.060 through 18.18.140 if the proposed landscaping is superior to that which could be achieved by strict compliance with those standards.

C. Findings. In approving modifications to the standards set forth in NBMC 18.18.060 through 18.18.140, the planning director shall prepare written findings that the proposed modification is justified based on one of the following:

3. The modifications better accommodate or improve the existing physical conditions of the subject property; or

4. The modifications incorporate elements to provide for wind protection, or maintain solar access or incorporate best available low impact or sustainable landscaping techniques; or

5. A reduction may be allowed to the perimeter landscape buffers for lots one acre in size or less that are adjacent to properties within the same zoning district or a more intensive zoning district (i.e., residential to commercial, commercial to industrial), when such buffers occupy more than 20 percent of the gross area of the lot. (Ord. 1671 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 1390 § 1, Exh. A (part), 2010: Ord. 1305 § 1, Exh. A (part), 2008: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997: Ord. 801 § 9, 1989).

C. Setbacks. 

1. Collector and Arterial Street Setback. Fences taller than four feet in height along the property line of a collector or arterial street shall be set back a minimum of five feet off the edge of the right-of-way.

2. Corner Line-of-Sight Setback. For corner lots (either street or alley), or where other relevant safety considerations are present, including major driveways, any solid fences or continuous hedges that are taller than three and one-half feet in height shall be placed behind a “sight triangle” area. The sides of a sight triangle shall be two perpendicular lines each varied in length based on classification of street and measured from the edge of the vehicle travel lane of the right-of-way (either the curb or fog line) of the two intersecting streets or street and alley. The hypotenuse of the sight triangle shall be the line that crosses the corner lot and connects the two sides of the triangle. The length of perpendicular measurement shall be 30 feet for local streets, and 50 feet for collector or arterial streets. In addition, solid fences and hedges higher than three and one-half feet on corner lots shall maintain a minimum five feet side yard setback from the edge of pavement or back side of any sidewalk or open drainage ditch along the street frontage. As necessary, the community and economic development department reserves the right to utilize other methodologies in ensuring an adequate line-of-sight area for corner lots, or where other public safety considerations are present.

3. No setbacks are required for fences along property lines other than those described above.

D. Height Limits. Fences in front yard areas or along the front property line, and within the corner line-of-sight setback, may not be greater than six feet in height, except as may be approved through an administrative adjustment to standards pursuant to Chapter 18.25 NBMC or a variance, in addition to the required building permit.

E. Wildlife. To allow for the movement of wildlife, fences are not permitted on the outside of perimeter landscape buffers within the TLA, or on the outside of the perimeter landscape buffer of EP-1 zoned properties adjacent to residential zones. 

F. Additional Standards. Additional standards for fences exist within the land use performance standards in NBMC 18.10.050 and commercial design standards in Chapter 18.34 NBMC for certain land uses. (Ord. 1671 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2018: Ord. 1390 § 1, Exh. A (part), 2010: Ord. 1305 § 1, Exh.

Second, the examiner must show that the development for which the permit is sought will create or exacerbate the identified public need. Third, the examiner must show that its proposed condition tends to solve, or at least to alleviate, the identified public need. Finally, the examiner must show that the proposed solution to the identified public problem is roughly proportional to that part of the need that is created or exacerbated by the landowner’s development. The goal is to show that the proposed condition is reasonably related to all or part of an identified public need that arises from the development project.

E. A conditional use permit may be revoked by the hearing examiner. Revocation proceedings may be initiated by the director or aggrieved individuals may petition the hearing examiner to initiate revocation proceedings. A public hearing shall be held using the same procedures as required for initial consideration of an application for a conditional use permit. Such revocation or modifications shall be made on any one or more of the following grounds:

1. That the use for which such approval was granted has been abandoned;

2. That the use for which such approval was granted has at any time ceased for a continuous period of one year or more;

3. That the permit granted is being exercised contrary to the terms or conditions of such approval or in violation of any statute, resolution, code, law or regulation;

4. That the use for which the approval was granted was so exercised as to be detrimental to the public health or safety. (Ord. 1405 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2010: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006. Formerly 18.24.120).

18.25.010 AATS established.

This chapter establishes an administrative permit to gain relief from the bulk and dimensional standards established for permitted uses in each zoning district as outlined in Table 18.10.040. In addition, the AATS process may be used for exceptions to the fence height limits established in NBMC 18.18.175. An AATS permit is a Type I administrative permit. Any appeal to a decision(s) on administrative adjustment to standards shall be made to the examiner pursuant to Chapter 20.06 NBMC. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.25.020 AATS purpose.

The purpose of an administrative adjustment to bulk and dimensional standards or “AATS” is to provide flexibility in the application of bulk and dimensional standards pursuant to defined policies. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.25.025 AATS permit review process and fees.

A. AATS permits shall be processed as a Type I application in accordance with NBMC Title 20, Administration of Development Regulations.

B. Fees for an AATS permit shall be as established by city schedule and collected at the time of the AATS permit application. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.25.030 AATS application requirements.

Application for an AATS shall include the following:

A. A written explanation outlining how the proposed deviation from standards would address each of the criteria in NBMC 18.25.040(A) through (K).

B. Any associated land development permit submittals, both diagrammatic and written, shall clearly and accurately identify the administrative adjustment to standard(s) being sought.

C. An eight-and-one-half-inch by 11-inch or like-size scaled diagram depicting the adjustment property shall also be submitted. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.25.040 General criteria – AATS.

The director shall review an AATS application and make a determination of consistency with the following criteria:

A. Administrative adjustments shall apply only to limited circumstances and shall not apply in widespread fashion (e.g., to multiple subdivision lots or to other multiple applications on a site).

B. The adjustment must be consistent with the purpose, design guidelines, scale, and character of the underlying zoning district.

C. The adjustment must be consistent with city land use policies, including but not limited to those in the comprehensive plan.

D. The adjustment must not adversely impact adjacent and nearby property owners and public services, or public safety, including but not limited to necessary rights-of-way, easements, dedicated tracts, and emergency access points.

E. The adjustment shall meet any additional approval criteria in support of public health, safety, and welfare, as may be specified by the director of community services, based on his or her professional judgment.

F. The adjustment might allow development that is consistent with pre-existing, developed land uses immediately adjacent to a site.

G. The adjustment is necessary to permit the owner/occupant of a pre-existing, nonconforming building to make improvements and/or an addition to such building per nonconforming use guidelines in Chapter 18.30 NBMC.

H. The adjustment might provide flexibility for a site with natural or physical features, such as significant trees, vegetation, flood courses, or other features that might be adversely affected, or have adverse effects, if standards are inflexible.

I. The adjustment promotes innovative site or building design that promotes goals and policies of the comprehensive plan, such as clustered housing to preserve open space.

J. Any adjustment to maximum lot size provisions requires that a “shadow-plat” and/or “site-build out” schematic be submitted and made a condition of development for placement of the primary building on the site. The purpose of a “shadow-plat” and/or “site-build out” schematic is to ensure that lots and/or structures are located so as not to preclude the future orderly subdivision consistent with maximum lot size or addition of structures to land parcels or land areas.

K. For any adjustment to the maximum front yard setback along North Bend Way, from Sydney Avenue (west end) to Cedar Falls Way and the Community Park property (east end), the expanded front setback area should be utilized for a pedestrian area and include such amenities as public plazas, bench or other seating areas, landscaping, pedestrian walkways, pedestrian-scale lighting, and pedestrian-oriented building frontages. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).

18.26.060    Appeals.


18.26.010 Purpose.

A variance is a mechanism by which the city may grant relief from the provisions of this title where unusual difficulty renders compliance with the provisions of this title an unnecessary hardship, where the hardship is a result of the physical characteristics of the subject property and where the intent of this title and of the comprehensive plan can be fulfilled. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1053 § 29, 1998: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997).


18.26.020 Limitations.

The hearing examiner may not grant a variance to certain standards of the zoning code as follows:

A. A variance shall not be granted to the uses established for each zoning district in Table 18.10.030; or

B. The provisions of NBMC Title 20, Administration of Development Regulations, or any other procedural or administrative provision of this title; or

C. Any provision of this title in which it states that such provision is not subject to a variance; or

D. To relieve an applicant from conditions established during prior permit review or from provisions enacted pursuant to a property-specific development standard; or

E. To allow the creation of density beyond what is allowed by this title. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1053 § 30, 1998: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997).


18.26.030 Variances – Application, review procedure and fees.

18.26.040 Variances – Standards and criteria.

Applications for variances from the terms of these regulations shall be granted only if the hearing examiner makes written findings of fact and conclusions of law demonstrating that the application satisfies all of the criteria outlined in subsections A through G of this section. The hearing examiner shall not consider the fact the property may be utilized more profitably when granting or denying a variance.

A. The variance shall not constitute a grant of special privilege inconsistent with the limitation on use of other properties similarly affected by the code provision for which a variance is requested;

B. That such variance is necessary, because of special circumstances and/or conditions relating to the size, shape, topography, critical areas, location, or surroundings of the subject property, to provide it with those relative rights and privileges permitted to other properties in the vicinity and in the zone in which the subject property is located. The phrase “relative rights and privileges” is to ensure that the property rights and privileges for the subject property are considered primarily in relation to current North Bend land use regulations;

C. That the special conditions and/or circumstances identified in subsection B of this section giving rise to the variance application do not result from the actions of the applicant, property owner, or recent prior owner(s) of the subject property;

D. That the granting of the variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property, neighborhood, or improvements in the vicinity and zone in which subject property is situated;

E. That the reasons set forth in the application and the official record justify the granting of the variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance necessary to grant relief to the applicant;

F. That alternative development concepts in compliance with applicable codes have been evaluated, and that undue hardship would result if strict adherence to the applicable codes is required; and

G. That the granting of the variance will not adversely affect implementation of the comprehensive plan or policies adopted thereto and the general purpose and intent of the zoning title or other applicable regulations. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1053 § 33, 1998: Ord. 1048 § 1, 1998: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997. Formerly 18.26.050).


18.26.050 Variances – Conditions of approval and revocation.

B. A variance granted in accordance with this chapter relating to construction of a building or similar facility shall expire five years from the date of such approval. All construction in accordance with the variance shall be completed by the permit expiration date. A single one-year extension may be granted by the director if the applicant can show a good faith effort to complete construction and all construction is scheduled to be completed within that one-year time period. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1053 § 34, 1998: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997).

18.27.060    Form.

18.27.070    Conditions of approval.


18.27.010 Development agreement – Authorized.

The city may enter into a development agreement with a person having ownership or control of real property within its jurisdiction. The city may enter into a development agreement for real property outside its boundaries as part of a proposed annexation or a service agreement. A development agreement must set forth the development standards and other provisions that shall apply to and govern and vest the development, use, and mitigation of the development of the real property for the duration specified in the agreement. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.020 Development agreement – Purpose.

A. The purpose of this development agreement chapter is to implement RCW 36.70B.170 which authorizes the city to enter into “development agreements” with persons having ownership or control of real property. In adopting such statute, the city council concurs with the Washington State legislative findings as follows:

The lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in a waste of public and private resources, escalate housing costs for consumers and discourage the commitment to comprehensive planning which would make maximum efficient use of resources at the least economic cost to the public. Assurance to a development project applicant that upon government approval the project may proceed in accordance with existing policies and regulations, and subject to conditions of approval, all as set forth in a development agreement, will strengthen the public planning process, encourage private participation and comprehensive planning, and reduce the economic costs of development. Further, the lack of public facilities and services is a serious impediment to development of new housing and commercial uses. Project applicants and local governments may include provisions and agreements whereby applicants are reimbursed over time for financing public facilities. It is the intent of the Legislature by RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210 to allow local governments and owners and developers of real property to enter into development agreements;

B. Additionally, the city council found that development agreements may be appropriate in certain circumstances as a means to consolidate numerous issues involved in complex development projects into a single controlling instrument, benefiting the city, its citizens, and members of the regulated public; and

C. The city council found that the use of development agreements may further the objective of the comprehensive plan and development regulations adopted pursuant to the comprehensive plan. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.025 Development agreement – Review process and fees.

A. A duly noticed public hearing pursuant to RCW 36.70B.200 and recommendation on the development agreement shall be made to the city council by the planning commission. The development agreement shall be subject to review and approval by the city council based on the record of the planning commission hearing. The decision of the city council to approve or reject a request for a development agreement shall be a discretionary, legislative act.

B. Fees for a development agreement review shall be as established by city schedule and collected at the time of the development agreement application. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.030 Development agreement – Application requirements.

Applicants for a development agreement shall meet first with the technical review committee of the city to review the codes and policies applicable to the proposed application. Applications for development agreements shall include, but are not limited to, the following:

A. Project elements such as permitted uses, residential densities, and nonresidential densities and intensities or building sizes;

B. The amount and payment of impact fees imposed or agreed to in accordance with any applicable provisions of state law, any reimbursement provisions, other financial contributions by the property owner, application fees, administrative charges, inspection fees, drafting fees, or dedications;

C. Concurrent provisions of water, sewer, transportation facilities, and storm drainage under Chapter 20.12 NBMC, along with mitigation measures, development conditions, and other requirements under Chapter 14.04 NBMC, protection of critical areas under Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC, and stormwater management under Chapter 14.16 NBMC;

D. Design standards such as maximum heights, setbacks, drainage and water quality requirements, building architectural elements, lighting, landscaping, parking, and other development features in this title;

E. Affordable housing;

F. Parks and open space preservation;

G. Phasing;

H. Review procedures and standards for implementing decisions;

I. A build-out or vesting period for applicable standards;

J. A written analysis of consistency with the comprehensive plan; and

K. Any other development agreement application requirement or procedure deemed appropriate by the city council. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.040 Development standards, flexibility.

A development agreement shall be consistent with applicable development regulations to the fullest extent possible; provided, a development agreement may allow development standards different from those otherwise imposed under the North Bend Municipal Code in order to provide flexibility to achieve public benefits, respond to changing community needs, or encourage modifications that provide the functional equivalent or adequately achieve the purposes of otherwise applicable city standards. Any development standards approved pursuant to a development agreement that differ from those in this code shall not require any further zoning reclassification, variance from city standards or other city approval apart from development agreement approval. The development standards as approved through a development agreement shall apply to and govern the development and implementation of each covered site in lieu of any conflicting or different standards or requirements elsewhere in the North Bend Municipal Code. Subsequently adopted standards that differ from those of a development agreement adopted by the city as provided in this chapter shall apply to the covered development project only where necessary to address imminent public health and safety hazards or where the development agreement specifies a time period or phase after which certain identified standards can be modified. Determination of the appropriate standards for future phases which are not fully defined during the initial approval process may be postponed. Building permit applications shall be subject to the building codes in effect when the permit is applied for. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.050 Exercise of city police power and contract authority.

As provided in RCW 36.70B.170(4), the execution of a development agreement is a proper exercise of the city’s police power and contract authority. Accordingly, a development agreement may obligate a party to fund or provide services, infrastructure, or other facilities. A development agreement shall reserve authority to impose new or different regulations to the extent required by a serious threat to public health and safety. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.060 Form.

Development agreements shall be consistent with RCW 36.70B.170 through 36.70B.210. All development agreements shall be in form and content as approved by the city attorney. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).


18.27.070 Conditions of approval.

In approving a development agreement, conditions of approval shall at a minimum establish:

A. A site plan for the entire project, showing locations of critical areas and buffers, required open spaces, perimeter buffers, location and range of densities for residential development, and location and size of nonresidential development;

B. The expected build-out time period for the entire project and the various phases;

C. Project phasing and other project-specific conditions to mitigate impacts on the environment, on public facilities and services including transportation, utilities, drainage, police and fire protection, schools, and parks;

D. Road and stormwater design standards that shall apply to the various phases of the project;

E. Bulk design and dimensional standards that shall be implemented throughout subsequent development within the project;

F. The size and range of uses authorized for any nonresidential development within the project;

G. The minimum and maximum number of residential units for the project;

H. Any sewer and/or water comprehensive utility plans or amendments required to be completed before development can occur; and

I. Conceptual plans for open space, recreation, parking, landscaping, lighting and building design. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006).

18.30.060 Nonconforming use – Change of.

Upon application, evaluation, and written approval of the director, any part of a building, structure, or land occupied by a nonconforming use may be changed to a use which has the same land use impacts as the legally nonconforming use or a use currently permitted by the zoning code; but where the use of a nonconforming building, structure, or land is changed to a use that is more consistent with the current code, the nonconforming building, structure or land use shall not revert to the prior use. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1020 (part), 1997).

18.34.030    Applicability, exemptions, relation to other codes, and effect.

18.34.080    Historic buildings.

18.34.090    Related residential uses.


18.34.010 Authority, purpose, and organization.

A. Authority. These design standards and guidelines are established under the authority of the Washington State Constitution, Article XI, Section 11; Chapters 35.63, 35A.63 and 36.70A RCW. These state laws grant police powers to the city of North Bend to promote and protect the public health, safety, and welfare through a variety of land use planning and regulatory mechanisms, including design standards and guidelines.

B. Purpose. The design standards are a fundamental tool to focus on the quality of growth – to establish the physical environment, and in turn, shape the consequent, cultural, social, and economic place – the community – that North Bend can become. Communities throughout the Puget Sound region, and throughout the nation, have recognized that zoning, subdivision, and critical area regulations alone, nor cumulatively, do not achieve many of the qualitative growth and quality-of-life aspects that citizens so desire. In recent years, communities have turned to design standards as having a unique and critical role in shaping physical growth and development patterns. Unlike other codes, the design standards are comprehensive in their topic coverage, including principles that address architectural style and related matters, materials and color, building mass and scale, building orientation, site circulation, access and parking, and lot bulk and dimensional variation. Citizens have expressed the desire for a vibrant small city with dynamic and connected neighborhoods, greenbelts/pedestrian options, and architecturally appealing commercial centers that capitalize on North Bend’s unique locale. Both of these trends can be seen currently in North Bend. This is also envisioned by the city’s comprehensive plan, Resolution 639, and other policy documents, that are a concerted effort on the part of North Bend citizens, business owners, public officials, and city staff.

It is this unique combination of physical and qualitative development standards and principles that can successfully shape the future of North Bend. In addition, the following items provide the basis and applicability of this chapter:

1. Provide predictability of new design for citizens and users of the design standards and guidelines;

2. Steward the natural and cultural resource heritage, including historic, visual and aesthetic qualities, that the city of North Bend and the Upper Snoqualmie Valley are richly endowed with;

3. Provide guidance to urban design decisions that will promote development of high environmental, visual, and aesthetic quality throughout the city, and avoid noncompatible, discordant, unsightly, and poor quality design;

4. Ensure that design matters are considered comprehensively, and not in isolation, on development projects;

5. Encourage innovative and exemplary urban design and neo-traditional design and development appropriate to the North Bend context;

6. Use urban design as an important mechanism to achieve worthy environmental, economic, and social opportunities present in the community;

7. Make North Bend a more pedestrian-friendly, bicycle-friendly, and transit-friendly community with associated benefits while recognizing the role of the automobile for transportation needs;

8. Stimulate desirable economic development through quality design and construction;

9. Ensure that new development is made compatible with existing neighborhoods and areas, as appropriate to the aim of good urban design throughout the city.

C. Chapter Organization. The design standards and guidelines are broken down into commercial/mixed-use/industrial, single-family, cottage, and multifamily. 

The term “standards” or “guidelines” may be utilized throughout this chapter to refer to design standards and design guidelines. The effect of standards and guidelines is explained in NBMC 18.34.030(E).

Cross-references are made between text sections and other North Bend codes where there is a directly related reference. Users must be aware that the standards are intended to work collectively to achieve overall purposes. In general, new residential and nonresidential development will need to be attentive to all applicable standards, as prescribed, depending on the specific type of development project. (Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015: Ord. 1323 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1100 § 1 (part), 2000).


18.34.020 Users and implementation.

A. Users. The standards will be used by the following parties. Users of this document are encouraged to review the city’s comprehensive plan and Resolution 639 along with the city’s design standards and guidelines. 

1. Property Owners/Developers. The standards and guidelines acquaint property owners and developers with goals that the community has identified in planning and policy documents for the built and natural environment of their city.

2. Building Designers. The standards and guidelines will assist architects, landscape architects, and other designers of buildings and sites to know what is expected of their products and what can make their designs consistent with North Bend’s community design goals.

3. Project Neighbors/City Residents. Project neighbors and city residents will have the reassurance that new development will be held to a standard that is in line with their vision for the city of North Bend. Citizens will have more predictability regarding new development, including its fit to a site, to the neighborhood context, and to the community character.

4. City Staff/City Officials. In reviewing new development projects, city staff, city architects and city officials will rely on the standards and guidelines to help define design conditions that will be required for project approval.

B. Implementation. The standards will be implemented through public sector, private sector, and public sector-private sector initiatives.

1. Public Sector Development. Public works projects and capital improvements such as streets, public buildings, infrastructure improvements, and public open space which are developed and built by the city with tax dollars can provide the catalyst for improved design quality and tie diverse areas of the city together. 

2. Private Sector Development. Developers will use the design standards to shape their projects to be consistent with the vision of the city reflected in the comprehensive plan, including the vision plan and Resolution 639, as well as these standards. Residential, commercial and industrial development will be built through private initiatives, but to the standards of the city.

3. Public-Private Partnerships. Development of projects which may have public and private financing or share mutual elements will also implement the desired design quality. An example could be streets, built and paid for by the private sector, within a private residential or commercial development that are deeded back to the city for maintenance but developed to design standards. These streets provide access to development sites but also benefit the larger community by improved auto, pedestrian and bicycle access to other areas of the city. Another example is the use of impact fees – payments by the private sector to fund open space which is maintained by the city. (Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015: Ord. 1323 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1100 § 1 (part), 2000).


18.34.030 Applicability, exemptions, relation to other codes, and effect.

A. Applicability. As necessary, compliance with design standards is checked at both the conceptual land use approval stage and the building permit stage. The design standards apply to:

1. All new residential and nonresidential construction and exterior tenant improvements (TIs) that require a building permit under the International Building Code (IBC), except as noted under subsection B of this section, must follow these standards and guidelines. 

2. Exterior-only nonresidential building or structure tenant improvements that require a building permit, where such improvements equal or exceed 20 percent of the King County assessed valuation of a building or structure.

3. Exterior-only multifamily residential building or structure tenant improvements that require a building permit, where such improvements equal or exceed 20 percent of the assessed valuation of a building or structure.

4. In addition to building permits, design standards apply to site plan approvals that precede issuance of building- or construction-related permits. For example, the standards apply to parking and landscaping reviews, subdivisions, short subdivisions, binding site plans, development agreements, conditional use permits and variances. The degree of application depends on the specific land use action.

5. Clearing/grading permits. Where a clearing/grading permit is required, the clearing and grading plan shall be reviewed for compliance with applicable design standards.

6. Where any single development project element triggers the design standards, the standards apply to all project improvements proposed. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that development improvements properly complement and coordinate with one another.

B. Exemptions.

1. All development that does not require a building permit under the International Building Code (IBC).

2. Developments listed as exempt from other construction permits (e.g., exempt from clearing and grading permit).

3. Interior-only tenant improvements.

4. Exterior tenant improvements that do not meet threshold guidelines noted in subsections (A)(2) and (A)(3) of this section.

5. Exterior tenant improvements that are “in-kind” maintenance and/or repair only.

6. Manufactured home design is regulated under NBMC performance standards, Table 18.10.050(1.12).

Applicants are encouraged to consult with city staff at the preapplication meeting or earlier to determine applicability and exemptions. In cases where these standards conflict with a concomitant or development agreement (existing at the time of adoption of these standards), the principles set forth in the concomitant or development agreement supersede these standards.

C. Deviation from Standards. An applicant may request a deviation from strict conformance to provisions of the design standards and guidelines set forth in NBMC 18.34.010 through 18.34.090.

In approving deviations from the standards, the community and economic development director shall prepare written findings that the proposed deviation is justified based on one of the following, and must find that the deviation is otherwise consistent with the purpose and intent of the provision from which the deviation is being sought, as well as the purpose and intent of the design standards and guidelines as a whole:

1. Site-specific limitations that prevent a building design from adhering to the design standards and guidelines; 

2. The deviations better accommodate or improve the existing physical conditions of the subject property in the sole discretion of the community and economic development director; or

3. The deviations enable implementation of low impact or sustainable design techniques that may not otherwise be possible under strict conformance to the design standards and guidelines. 

D. Relation to Other Codes. The design standards supplement and/or complement the city’s zoning code (this title), critical areas regulations (Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC), International Building Code (NBMC Title 15), and other land use regulations. 

Where design standards conflict with other land use regulations, or where uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of the standards, respective provisions of NBMC 18.04.020, Conflicting regulations, and NBMC 18.04.030, Interpretation, shall apply.

Residential and nonresidential developments often use covenants, conditions and restrictions (i.e., CC&Rs). CC&Rs typically address any number of design-related matters, for example, building colors, roof materials, sign guidelines, or otherwise. CC&Rs for development projects shall not be inconsistent with the design standards. As part of city review, the CC&Rs for development projects shall be reviewed by the city for consistency with the design standards. Project-related permits shall not be issued where CC&Rs would be inconsistent with design standards.

E. Effect. The design standards and design guidelines carry the full effect of the police power to regulate the public health, safety, and welfare per enabling authority outlined in NBMC 18.34.010.

Design standards are obligatory and utilize the terms “shall,” “must,” “required” and like synonyms, as well as antonyms such as “prohibited” or “not allowed.” City staff and/or affected decision makers have authority to deny development projects where design standards are not followed.

Applicants are encouraged to follow design guidelines which utilize the terms “should,” “preferred,” “recommended” and like synonyms, as well as antonyms “discouraged,” “not preferred” and the like. City staff and/or affected decision makers shall not have authority to deny development projects where design guidelines are not summarily or cumulatively followed in a development project. (Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015: Ord. 1323 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1100 § 1 (part), 2000).


18.34.040 Procedural and submittal requirements.

A. Procedures. Compliance with applicable design standards is evaluated under the major permit or approval being sought. For example, to construct a commercial building, site plan approval and subsequent building permit is required. Applicable design standards are evaluated against the site plan. If approved, design-related conditions are part of the approval. Said design conditions are then tied to subsequent construction permits.

Regarding larger single-family subdivisions, design requirements related to the subdivision are reviewed with the plat; design requirements relating to variation in building elevations, and the requirement for porches, are reviewed at the building permit stage.

The city reserves the right to utilize design consultants (e.g., architects, landscape architects, critical areas consultants, etc.) to review project submittals. Charges to retain said consultants are billed to project applicants under provisions of Chapter 20.09 NBMC.

B. Submittal Requirements. The North Bend Municipal Code identifies a set of complete application requirements for different development project types. Complete applications address written and graphic information that is required pursuant to project review in relation to the design standards. Development project types that engage the design standards include:

1. Site plans (unless exempt as identified in NBMC 18.34.030(B));

2. Subdivisions (including plats and short plats);

3. Building permit application (some development projects do not engage any of the items in subsections (B)(1) and (B)(2) of this section, and design standards are reviewed as part of a building permit application);

4. Other construction-related permits (as an example, clearing and grading plans are reviewed against applicable design standards before a clearing/grading permit is issued).

All development project submittals are responsible to include written descriptions, scaled elevation plans and site plans, architectural drawings, renderings and/or graphics, and material and color samples (as necessary). This information enables city staff to evaluate the project’s compliance with design standards.

As previously indicated, compliance with design standards may be checked at the land use approval stage and the building permit stage. (Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015: Ord. 1323 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1172 § 26, 2002; Ord. 1100 § 1 (part), 2000).


18.34.050 Single-family and cottage residential.

A. The following section of this chapter outlines the design standards and guidelines for single-family and cottage homes over two units/lots. This section should also be read along with performance standards in NBMC 18.10.050 for associated cottage and single-family design standards. This section is organized as follows:

1. Subsection A of this section, Single-Family and Cottage Residential.

2. Subsection B of this section, Architectural Style and Related Matters.

3. Subsection C of this section, Materials and Color.

4. Subsection D of this section, Building Mass and Scale.

5. Subsection E of this section, Building Orientation.

6. Subsection F of this section, Garages.

7. Subsection G of this section, Setback Variation.

8. Subsection H of this section, Lot Layout and Design.

B. Architectural Style and Related Matters. The city of North Bend promotes a variation between homes through the use of quality materials and craftsmanship, regardless of style, in its residential development. An emphasis is placed on pedestrian-oriented development and appealing neighborhoods for all to enjoy. 

The following design standards provide guidance to help enhance future residential construction:

1. Building Variation. Buildings shall vary, and in so doing provide a range of compatible styles, elevations, designs, home sizes, home prices, and neighborhood diversity.

	# of Units/Lots	Minimum # of Floor Plans (mirrored plans do not count as different floor plans)

	16 or less	3

	17 to 49	5, one of which shall be a one-story home and shall represent at least ten percent of the total number of units

	50 or more	6, one of which shall be a one-story home and shall represent at least 12 percent of the total number of units

	# of Units/Lots	Minimum # of Elevation Plans 

	16 or less	2 per floor plan = 6

	17 to 49	3 per floor plan = 15

	50 or more	4 per floor plan = 24

All homes as permitted in Table 18.10.030 using identical building elevation plan and detail shall be separated by at least three homes with different elevations. Identical elevations may not be across the street from one another. One-story homes shall be mixed throughout the development, and not clustered.

Where varying elevation is required, a minimum of three of the following variations must be utilized, and for developments containing 17 or more units/lots subsection (B)(1)(f) of this section shall be utilized:

a. Differing window size, design and placement;

b. Differing porch or stoop size, design and placement;

c. Differing trim details – including accent trim and garage and entry doors;

d. Differing siding material, texture and appearance;

e. Differing facade modulation – including bays, projections, and recesses;

f. Differing roof form – including gable direction, projections, and pitch.

2. Building Entries. Single-family developments of over four lots shall have their front entrance articulated with a covered entry porch, covered stoop, or other similar feature integrated with the design of a home. Stoops may not constitute more than 20 percent of the total number of units. Porches shall constitute usable areas, not less than 80 square feet and 25 square feet for stoops. Porches shall have a minimum depth of seven feet on all sides as measured at the porch floor from the wall of the house to the center of the supporting post or structure. Porches may wrap around front corners to the side of buildings, and should vary in size and type.

For cottage homes each unit shall include an attached front porch not less than 64 square feet minimum, with a minimum depth of seven feet on all sides.

3. Yard Space/Balconies. See single-family and cottage performance standards in NBMC.

4. Roof Type. Multiple gables (including stepped or opposing gables), hipped roofs, dormers, sheds, and other roof variations are required as appropriate to architectural style.

a. Eaves and gables shall provide a minimum of 18 inches of overhang.

b. Developments containing more than 17 units shall provide a minimum of three differing primary roof pitches for homes within the development (e.g., some homes with a primary pitch of 7:12, some homes with a primary pitch of 5:12). The difference in pitch shall be at least two feet for every 12 feet of run.

5. Window Types. Window types and window placement should be seen as an opportunity to provide interest and individuality amongst building facades, especially street-facing facades and those in public view. Window design and placement shall be oriented to maximize views. 

To give dimension to building walls and to provide relief and shadow lines, all street-facing or street-visible windows and doors shall be trimmed a minimum of three and one-half inches in width, or be recessed from the face of the wall a minimum of two inches. 

C. Materials and Color. To obtain architectural integrity of new construction, natural building materials should be utilized along with appropriate use of color to highlight and emphasize residential homes and features, and to discourage color monotony, especially in larger development projects.

1. Siding Materials.

a. Narrower (e.g., six-inch exposure) machined (beveled or otherwise) clapboard siding is encouraged. Other appropriate materials may include cedar shakes, shingles, board and batten, and brick or stone. A combination of siding materials and embellishments can provide textural variety and visual interest to facades.

b. Due to its harmful environmental impacts and synthetic appearance, vinyl siding is prohibited. 

c. When used in conjunction with board and batten construction, panel siding such as T1-11 and like materials may be utilized in limited accent fashion, not in widespread application.

2. Roof Materials. Where asphalt shingles are used, they shall be of an architectural grade (multiple shingle-style layers rather than flat three-tab) for better durability, as well as greater texture and shadow lines. Tile, slate, high quality asphalt, metal, and synthetic roof products resembling natural material are acceptable. Fire treated cedar shake or shingle roofs are allowed.

3. Building Colors.

	# of Units	Minimum Color Variation

	2 to 16	8. 4 primary colors, with 4 trim colors. At least one trim color shall be a darker color, not white or cream.

	17 to 49	12 primary colors, with 6 trim colors. At least two trim colors shall be a darker color, not white or cream.

	50 units or more	15 primary colors, with 10 trim colors. At least three trim colors shall be a darker color, not white or cream.

A varied range of exterior residential building colors is required for new residential buildings. Color variation shall apply to building facade and trim. Singular trim color throughout a development is prohibited. The palette of exterior colors to be used within the development shall be provided to the community and economic development department prior to the issuance of the first building permit within the development for demonstrating conformance to these standards.

Continual or predominant use of monotone colors (e.g., similar beige or gray tones) on new dwellings is not acceptable. Darker, natural-tone colors are encouraged, to better blend with North Bend’s natural surroundings.

D. Building Mass/Scale. Purpose: to ensure that residential building mass and scale is appropriate to North Bend’s small city context and is human in scale.

1. Articulation and/or modulation of primary facades and facades in public view shall be used to break up building mass and scale. Unmodulated primary and publicly viewable (street-facing) facades should not extend more than approximately 30 feet. Modulation should be sufficient to break up wall planes. Roofline articulation shall also be utilized, and can be accomplished with multigabled roofs, stepped roofs, or otherwise. 

2. Facade and roofline articulation shall be complemented with other architectural features as appropriate to architectural style, including variation in building materials; variation in fenestration; variation in building color; and elements like porches, chimneys, and finer details.

E. Building Orientation. Purpose: to ensure that buildings relate to the public street, provide pedestrian orientation, and integrate well with surrounding neighborhoods and development.

1. Fences constructed between the front of the building and the public street shall be limited to four feet in height to maintain orientation of the building to the public street. 

2. The front door and/or porch shall face the street or common open space area. 

F. Garages.

1. Garage Setbacks. For single-family homes, a minimum of 50 percent of the units within any subdivision or binding site plan shall set back the garage from the front wall of the home a minimum of five feet. The remaining 50 percent of the units may contain a garage flush with the front wall of the home, provided a porch of not less than 80 square feet is provided. 

2. Driveway Widths. Within low density zones (LDR) driveway crossings at the sidewalk and/or public street (not including alleys) shall be no greater than 20 feet in width for front-loaded double or triple bay garages, and no greater than 16 feet for front-accessed side-loaded garages.

3. Garages within the downtown commercial (DC) zone shall be accessed off alleys when feasible. 

G. Setback Variation. To break up visual monotony on a straight street, no more than two homes in a row shall be sited at the same front yard setback. In no case shall a home placed at the minimum setback line be adjacent to a home set back to three feet beyond the minimum setback line. Front yard setbacks shall vary from minimum setback as follows:

1. Twenty-five percent of the total number of homes shall vary by an additional three feet beyond the minimum.

2. Twenty-five percent of the total number of homes shall vary by an additional five feet beyond the minimum.

3. Twenty-five percent of the total number of homes shall vary by an additional eight feet beyond the minimum (excluding cottage development). Varying angles are encouraged, therefore when homes are placed on the lot in such a way that results in the sidewalls of the homes not being parallel to each other (by at least 10 degrees), or placed on a meandering street achieving the same effect, the requirement to vary by an additional eight feet may be reduced to five feet (see Diagram A).

H. Lot Layout and Design. The following standards shall be applied to the layout and design of subdivisions and short subdivisions:

1. Lots shall front to a public street, a park or a common open space tract owned by the city or the applicable homeowners association, unless infeasible due to the shape of existing lot lines or the presence of topographic constraints.

2. A shared driveway/access is allowed in limited circumstances when approved by the director, and shall not be used to serve more than four residences. Where access to more than four residences is needed, a public street shall be provided, constructed to the applicable minimum planning/design street standard in Chapter 19.01 NBMC and the city of North Bend public works standards.

3. Lots with double frontages (where streets other than an alley exist on opposing property lines) are permitted only when all of the following circumstances apply:

a. When such lots are adjacent to a collector or arterial street or where necessary due to topography or other site limitations;

b. When limited to a maximum of 250 linear feet of double frontage for all applicable lots along such collector or arterial street;

c. If rear lot lines within a subdivision face a street, a minimum 15-foot landscape buffer shall be required between the rear lot line and the adjacent street right-of-way or easement. Said landscape buffer shall consist of Type 2 landscaping per the landscape regulations in Chapter 18.18 NBMC and, when provided for a subdivision, shall be placed in a tract owned and maintained by the applicable homeowners association or otherwise in collective ownership and maintenance of all homeowners within the development.

4. Subdivisions shall additionally meet the following lot size and width variation criteria:

a. Lot Width. No more than two adjacent residential lots shall have the same width. Variation shall be not less than 10 feet.

b. Lot Size. Single-family lot sizes shall vary. Not more than two adjacent lots shall be of the same size (“same size” is defined as within 500 square feet in area relative to each other) and shall vary as follows:

i. Thirty-three percent of the total number of lots shall vary from the minimum lot size by a minimum of 2,000 additional square feet.

ii. Thirty-three percent of the total number of lots shall vary from the minimum lot size by a minimum of 4,000 additional square feet. (Ord. 1628 § 1 (Exh. A), 2017: Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015).


18.34.060 Multifamily residential.

A. The following section of this chapter outlines the design standards and guidelines for multifamily buildings. This section should also be read along with performance standards in NBMC 18.10.050 for associated design standards. This section is organized as follows:

1. Architectural style and related matters.

2. Materials and color.

3. Building mass and scale.

4. Building orientation.

5. Site circulation, access and parking.

6. Lot bulk and dimensional variation.

B. Architectural Style. The city of North Bend promotes a variation between homes through the use of quality materials and craftsmanship, regardless of style, in its residential development. An emphasis is placed on creating compact, pedestrian-oriented development and appealing neighborhoods for all to enjoy. 

The following design standards provide guidance to help preserve, maintain, and enhance future residential construction:

1. Building Variation. Buildings shall vary, and in so doing provide a range of compatible styles, elevations, designs, home sizes, home prices, and neighborhood diversity.

	# of Buildings	Minimum # of Building Type	Minimum # of Elevations

	2 to 3	1	2

	4 or more	2	2

Where varying elevation is required, a differing roof form including gable direction, projections, and pitch is required. In addition a minimum of three of the following variations must be employed to be considered a separate elevation for a given floor plan:

a. Differing window size, design and placement;

b. Differing porch or stoop size, design and placement;

c. Differing trim details (including accent trim and garage and entry doors);

d. Differing siding material, texture and appearance;

e. Differing facade modulation (including bays, projections, and recesses).

All multifamily buildings of identical elevation may not be located adjacent to or across the street from one another, nor be over-utilized in a larger multifamily project.

2. Building Entries. Each building shall provide a primary pedestrian entrance, located on the front side of the building. Primary pedestrian entrances that serve ground floor dwelling units shall be distinguished by means of a covered porch or stoop. 

Primary pedestrian entrances may either serve individual dwelling units or a number of dwelling units in common. 

A walkway made of concrete, unit pavers, or brick, with a minimum width of five feet, shall directly connect primary pedestrian entrances with the nearest sidewalk.

All exterior doorways shall be trimmed with visible architectural detail, with a total minimum width of three and one-half inches.

Exterior stairs facing primary circulation routes must be designed to blend with the structure. A maximum of one flight of stairs per building may be located on the side of a building facing the street. In no case shall exterior stairs project more than five feet from the face of the building nor shall the risers of a projecting portion of the stairs be visible from the street.

3. Yard Space/Balconies. A portion of individual multifamily rear yard space should be improved, for example, with a patio or deck. Where townhouse-style designs are not utilized and individual exterior yard space is not available, upper floor balconies of usable area (e.g., five-foot width by eight-foot depth) shall be provided for respective units. 

4. Roof Type.

	# of Units	Minimum Eaves Width

	Under 4	18"

	4 or more	24"

Continuous rooflines shall be articulated with dormers, significant gables, or ridgeline offsets a minimum of two feet every 50 lineal feet.

Primary roof pitches may be a minimum of 4:12. When the minimum pitch is being used, the roofline and building elevations shall be broken with gables, with a roof width of 4:12 and greater to add architectural variety.

Building eaves shall be used to create architectural interest through shadow lines and design variety. The size of overhangs and architectural detailing shall be appropriate to the overall architectural style of the building. Eaves on roofs of 6:12 pitch or lower shall have a minimum depth of 24 inches – generous overhangs are encouraged.

To ensure that larger pieces of mechanical equipment are visually unobtrusive, rooftop mechanical equipment shall be concealed by and integrated into the roof form of the building. 

Except for solar panels, to the degree practical, vent stacks, metal chimneys, and pipes shall be clustered to avoid rooftop clutter, and where practical located on the roof slope facing away from public streets. Solar panels to the extent possible shall lay flush with the roofline. 

5. Window Types. Window types and window placement should be seen as an opportunity to provide interest and individuality amongst building facades, especially street-facing facades and those in public view. 

A minimum of 20 percent of front facades (as measured between the top and bottom plate) shall be glazed.

All windows shall be trimmed on all sides. Total trim width shall be a minimum of three and one-half inches. Such trim should provide a color appropriate to the exterior color of the building.

C. Materials and Color. To obtain architectural integrity of new construction, natural building materials that are consistent with authentic architectural styles are encouraged. This is achieved through appropriate use of color to highlight and emphasize residential homes and features, and to discourage color monotony, especially in larger development projects.

1. Siding Materials.

a. Narrower (e.g., six-inch exposure) machined (beveled or otherwise) clapboard siding is encouraged. Clapboards may be complemented with cedar shakes, shingles, board and batten, and architectural grade brick or stone accents as appropriate. A combination of siding materials and embellishments can provide textural variety and visual interest to facades.

b. Due to its harmful environmental impacts and synthetic appearance, vinyl siding is prohibited. 

c. Panel siding such as T1-11 and like materials may be utilized in limited accent fashion, not in widespread application.

2. Roof Materials. Where asphalt shingles are used, they shall be of an architectural grade (multiple shingle-style layers rather than flat three-tab) for better durability, as well as greater texture and shadow lines. Tile, slate, high quality asphalt, metal, and synthetic roof products resembling natural material are acceptable. 

3. Building Colors. A complementary palette of colors and materials shall be used with individual projects and buildings. Colors and materials selected shall provide variety, while at the same time maintaining unity within a project and compatibility with the residential character of North Bend. Color variation shall apply to building facade and trim. Singular trim color throughout a development is discouraged. 

D. Building Mass and Scale. To ensure that residential building mass and scale is appropriate to North Bend’s small city context and is human in scale.

Articulation and/or modulation of primary facades and facades in public view shall be used to break up building mass and scale. Unmodulated primary and publicly viewable facades should not extend more than 30 feet. Modulation should be sufficient to break up wall planes. Roofline articulation should also be utilized, and can be accomplished with multigabled roofs, stepped roofs, or otherwise. 

Facade and roofline articulation should be complemented with other architectural features as appropriate to architectural style, including variation in building materials; variation in fenestration; variation in building color; and elements like porches, chimneys, and finer details.

Building location on a lot, including subtle variations in front yard and side yard setbacks, should be utilized to reduce building mass and bulk, especially on larger development projects. For example, front yard setbacks might vary by five feet (see single-family and cottage performance standards in NBMC).

All structures shall have a maximum building height of 35 feet. A mix of density and building types is encouraged, but in no case shall individual buildings contain over 10 dwelling units.

E. Building Orientation. To ensure that buildings relate to the public street, provide pedestrian orientation, and integrate well with surrounding neighborhoods and development.

Fences constructed between the front of the building and the public street shall be limited to four feet in height to maintain orientation of the building to the public street. 

Primary pedestrian entrances shall face either a public street, an internal circulation route with sidewalks consistent with this chapter, or open space. 

The fronts and rears of buildings shall not face each other. This requirement may be waived for individual buildings, where there is no other practical way to provide access given the parameters. 

F. Site Circulation, Access and Parking. The following width limitations are required to minimize disruption of vehicular access on the sidewalk and streetscape:

1. Parking, Garages/Carports/Surface. Parking (both garages/carports and surface parking) shall be located to the side or rear of the building, away from the public street. Side yard parking, including garages/carports or surface parking areas, is limited to not more than 35 percent of lot width for multifamily buildings. Detached garages and carports for multifamily buildings shall be compatible with design of the main building.

Primary residential parking areas shall not front on public streets or internal circulation routes. Except for single units above garages, off-street parking (both surface and garages) shall be located to the side or rear of buildings where fronting public streets. 

Where a driveway or alley connects to a primary circulation route, parking served by the driveway or alley shall trigger landscaping at entrance.

Surface parking areas shall be limited to a maximum of eight stalls in any one location. 

Open surface parking areas at the rear of buildings shall include landscape screens to buffer parking areas from adjacent residential development. 

2. Driveway Widths. When possible minimize driveways or curb cuts, so as to not disturb the movement of pedestrians, and thereby minimize streetscape impact.

Driveway crossings are to be no wider than 20 feet.

No driveways serving individual dwelling units shall be allowed from primary or internal circulation routes constructed as public streets.

Exceptions: The city may impose additional restrictions to parking area and vehicle access point locations to reduce impacts to public safety, pedestrian movement, or on-street vehicle circulation. The city may allow additional entrances or vehicle access lanes if other compelling site planning reasons outweigh the impact of an increased number of sidewalk crossings.

3. Sidewalk Access. A continuous sidewalk a minimum of five feet in width shall connect all multifamily homes directly to the public sidewalk, rather than relying on access via an internal drive lane. 

Pedestrian access shall be provided in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Pedestrian access shall be provided from the main street off of which the parcel is located. Where a project fronts two streets, access shall be provided from both streets.

Pedestrian connections shall be provided from housing areas to adjacent open space and park areas.

On-site pedestrian circulation routes shall be shown on site plans. Pedestrian pathways are to be integrated with required on-site landscaping, including parking areas.

G. Lot Bulk and Dimensional Variation. To provide design interest and prevent monotony of subdivision designs and building layout, a variety of housing size and style options shall be developed within a neighborhood and throughout the city of North Bend.

Buildings that are part of a complex of three or more buildings should use variable lot sizes, variable front yard setbacks, and side yard setbacks, as appropriate, for design interest. (Ord. 1657 § 10, 2018; Ord. 1561 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2015).


18.34.070 Commercial, mixed-use and industrial design standards and guidelines.

18.36.010 Purpose.

The purpose of the city of North Bend TDR program is to provide a voluntary, incentive-based process to purchase and sell private residential and commercial development rights from lands that provide public benefit. Landowners who sell development rights receive a financial benefit without having to develop or sell the land itself. The permanently preserved land is then protected through conservation easements or additional restrictions. The development rights are transferred from the property that is preserved, known as a “sending site,” to a second property, known as a “receiving site.” The TDR provisions are intended to protect critical areas, to supplement land use regulations, and to increase residential and commercial development density where it can be accommodated with the fewest impacts on the environment and existing public services by:

A. Providing an effective and predictable incentive process for property owners of critical areas in order to preserve these lands for the public benefit; and

B. Providing an efficient and streamlined administrative review process to ensure that transfers of development rights to receiving sites are evaluated in a timely manner, are balanced with city goals and policies, and are adjusted to the specific conditions of each receiving site. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1189 § 1 (part), 2003).


18.36.020 Sending sites.

A. The “sending site” means the portion of a lot or lots qualified under subsections (B)(1) through (B)(4) of this section. If the sending site consists of more than one tax lot, the lots must be contiguous. For purposes of this section, lots divided by a street are considered contiguous if the lots would share a common lot line if the street were removed.

B. Sending sites shall be qualified to transfer development rights if the sending site is in private ownership and is designated in the North Bend comprehensive plan under one of the following criteria:

1. Critical areas and their buffers as required by the municipal code including rivers, streams, floodways, channel migration zones, and wetlands;

2. Agricultural land;

3. Forest land;

4. Within the urban separator overlay zone and land zoned LDR or NB.

C. Urban separator and resource land sending sites, excluding critical areas on the site, may transfer density consistent with a zoning classification as follows:

1. Low-density residential (LDR) equals four dwelling units per acre.

2. High-density residential (HDR) and cottage residential (CR) equals eight dwelling units per acre.

3. Downtown commercial (DC) equals 12 dwelling units per acre.

4. Interchange commercial (IC) equals 12 dwelling units per acre.

5. Interchange mixed use (IMU) equals 10 dwelling units per acre.

6. Neighborhood business (NB) equals eight dwelling units per acre.

7. Employment park one (EP-1) equals 12 dwelling units per acre.

8. Employment park two (EP-2) equals 12 dwelling units per acre.

D. Critical area sending sites, including critical area portions of urban separator and resource land sending areas, may transfer 25 percent of the density consistent with their zoning classification as outlined above.

E. For purposes of transfer of development rights, the transferable area of a sending site property shall be determined by subtracting from the total area of the sending site the areas of the sending site occupied by:

1. All existing and proposed structures including accessory structures;

2. Areas encumbered by easements;

3. The minimum lot area including required minimum setbacks;

4. Septic system and reserve areas;

5. Parking areas;

6. Storm drainage areas;

7. Compensatory flood storage;

8. Landscaping areas per zoning code; and

9. Submerged lands.

F. Sending site properties shall retain a minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet and a minimum of one dwelling unit (DU) of development on a parcel to provide an opportunity for continuing or future use of the site to provide a mechanism to maintain the property. The requirement to retain one dwelling unit (DU) on a parcel will be waived if:

1. The site consists exclusively of critical areas as defined in NBMC 14.05.020; or

2. The site is dedicated to a public or nonprofit agency for ownership and/or maintenance as open space; or

3. The parcel is combined with another parcel that does retain one dwelling unit (DU) via a lot line adjustment.

G. Sending site properties within the urban separator overlay district and the interchange mixed use (IMU) zoning district may transfer density consistent with the zoning classification as shown on the current city of North Bend official zoning map, subject to the limitation that all undeveloped density rights on a parcel shall be transferred, except as provided in subsections E and F of this section.

H. For the purposes of the TDR program, “acquisition” means obtaining fee simple rights in real property, or a less than a fee simple right in a form that preserves in perpetuity the public benefit supporting the qualification of the property as a TDR sending site.

I. A sending site property shall be eligible to transfer development rights if it is in private ownership and meets all of the following criteria:

1. The land is undeveloped, vacant, or used for agricultural or forestry, other than one dwelling unit, if required by subsection F of this section; and

2. The development rights have not been sold, transferred, or limited by easements, deed restrictions, or similar measures, as outlined in subsection E of this section.

J. Critical area sending sites shall be maintained in an undisturbed state subject to an approved native growth protection easement, except where modified to enhance the beneficial function of the critical area pursuant to an approved mitigation plan developed in compliance with the critical area ordinance. Agricultural or forest resource land sending sites designated in the comprehensive plan shall be maintained as resource lands subject to an approved resource management plan. Sending sites within the urban separator overlay zone shall be maintained in an undeveloped state subject to an approved open space plan.

K. If a sending site has any outstanding code violations, the person responsible for code compliance shall resolve these violations, including any required abatement, restoration, or payment of civil penalties, before a TDR sending site may be qualified. However, the community services director may qualify and certify a TDR sending site with outstanding code violations if the proposal is in the public interest. (Ord. 1464 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2012; Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1189 § 1 (part), 2003).


18.36.030 Granting and measuring development rights.

A. Sending Site – Calculation of Gross Acreage.

1. The total available development rights from the sending site property are based upon the gross acreage of the site and the gross acreage of critical areas present on the site that limit any development.

2. The sending site property owner shall receive the number of development rights (per gross acre of the property) based upon the development rights factor of the sending site property. For each fraction of a gross acre of land that meets the requirements for qualified sending site properties, the owner shall receive a fraction of the development rights in the same proportion that the fraction of an acre makes upon the gross acre of the property, with any adjustments. The following formula shall be used to calculate the number of development rights:

D = N × F + S (.25)

D    =	The number of development rights the sending site property owner shall receive.

N    =	Total net acres (including a fraction of an acre) of land meeting the requirements of eligible sending site properties. The net acres are the gross acres less the critical areas acres.

F    =	Development rights factor set for the type of zoning in which the property is located. The property classification development rights factor (F) for each gross acre of land within each zoning district as established in NBMC 18.36.020(C).

S    =	Total critical areas acres. The critical area acres are the gross acres less the net acres.

(.25)    =	Critical areas factor.

B. Sending Site Calculations.

1. The number of residential development rights that a sending site is eligible to send to a receiving site shall be determined by applying the TDR sending site base density established in NBMC 18.36.020(C) to the area of the sending site after the following has been deducted:

a. Any portion of the sending site already encumbered as defined in NBMC 18.36.020(E) and (F).

b. Other areas required by the city of North Bend to remain undeveloped.

2. Any fractions of development rights determined pursuant to subsection (A)(2) of this section shall only be applicable to use on commercial properties.

3. For purposes of calculating the amount of development rights a sending site can transfer, the amount of land contained within a sending site shall be determined as follows:

a. If the sending site is an entire tax lot, the square footage or acreage shall be determined:

i. By the King County department of assessments’ records; or

ii. By a survey that has been prepared and stamped by a surveyor licensed in the state of Washington;

b. If the sending site is a portion of a tax lot, the square footage or acreage shall be determined by a survey that has been prepared and stamped by a surveyor licensed in the state of Washington; and

c. If the sending site consists of a lot that is divided by a zoning boundary, the square footage or acreage shall be calculated separately for each zoning classification. The square footage or acreage within each zoning classification shall be determined by the city of North Bend record of the action that established the zoning. When such records are not available or are not adequate to determine the square footage or acreage within each zoning classification, the city of North Bend shall determine the square footage or acreage from a survey, provided by the applicant that has been prepared and stamped by a surveyor licensed in the state of Washington.

4. A sending site shall be entitled to send at least one development right for every legal lot created on or before July 1, 2003, if one development right is greater than the number of development rights determined under subsection A of this section.

5. A residential dwelling unit may be converted to a commercial or industrial use at a ratio of one dwelling unit (residence) to authorize an additional 2,000 square feet of building area for commercial or industrial use. Commercial or industrial square footage may be converted to residential dwelling units at a ratio of one dwelling unit per 2,000 square feet of floor area.

6. Development rights from one sending site may be allocated to more than one receiving site and one receiving site may accept development rights from more than one sending site.

7. A determination of the number of residential development rights a sending site has available for transfer to a receiving site shall be valid for transfer purposes only, shall be documented in a TDR certificate letter of intent, and shall be valid for a specific term set forth on the certificate. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1189 § 1 (part), 2003).


18.36.040 Sending site future development limitations.

Following the transfer of development rights from a sending site, the portion of the lot or lots not designated as a sending site may accommodate development on the buildable portion of said lots, consistent with the zoned base density provisions in the NBMC and other city of North Bend development regulations. For sending sites in the urban separator zone, the subdivision potential remaining after a density transfer may only be actualized through a clustered subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan that creates a permanent preservation tract as large or larger than the portion of the subdivision set aside as lots. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1189 § 1 (part), 2003).


18.36.050 Eligible receiving sites.

A. The city of North Bend eligible receiving sites are those designated areas of the city where new growth is encouraged under the Growth Management Act and the city of North Bend comprehensive plan goals and policies. The receiving sites have existing facilities and services or will have public investments in facilities and services in the near future. The eligible receiving site properties shall be limited in the TDR program to properties designated as receiving sites on the attached map (Exhibit A).

B. Except as provided in this chapter, receiving site developments shall comply with all applicable zoning code provisions for the receiving zone site.

C. Receiving sites may accept development rights from one or more sending sites up to the maximum density permitted as follows:

1. Low-density residential (LDR) equals 10 dwelling units per acre.

2. High-density residential (HDR) equals 24 dwelling units per acre.

3. Downtown commercial (DC) equals 24 dwelling units per acre.

4. Interchange commercial (IC) equals 24 dwelling units per acre.

5. Interchange mixed use (IMU) equals 20 dwelling units per acre.

6. Neighborhood business (NB) equals 16 dwelling units per acre.

7. Employment park one (EP-1) equals 24 dwelling units per acre.

8. Employment park two (EP-2) equals 24 dwelling units per acre.

D. Purchase of a TDR is not a guarantee of use; the use is subject to all other applicable development regulations. (Ord. 1256 § 1 (part), 2006: Ord. 1189 § 1 (part), 2003).


18.36.060 Procedure overview.

The process of acquiring, conveying, and recording development rights includes:

A. The issuance of certificates of development rights with assigned serial number by the community services director;

B. The approval by the community services director and recording of a TDR conservation easement;

C. The recording of a deed transferring ownership of the development rights; and

18.50.010 Purpose.

The city of North Bend is currently experiencing substantial growth. This growth will place demands on our community, transportation system, and ecosystems. As native landscapes transition into built environments, the infrastructure necessary to support the built environment will increase the impervious surface coverage as roads, parking areas, sidewalks and rooftops are constructed. These changes will reduce, disrupt or eliminate native vegetation, upper soil layers, shallow depressions, and drainage patterns that currently intercept, evaporate, store, slowly convey and infiltrate stormwater. In an effort to best maintain the existing quality of life and healthy natural environment, the city intends to guide new development and redevelopment towards environmentally and economically sustainable approaches. (Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.020 Definitions.

“Integrated management practices” are tools used in low impact development (LID) projects for water quality treatment and flow control. The controls are integrated throughout the project and provide a landscape amenity with a stormwater treatment and flow control function. These features are intended to mimic or model nature and the predevelopment hydrology.

“Rain garden” or “bioretention cell” means an engineered and vegetated small depression in ground that allows stormwater runoff directed from impervious areas such as roofs, streets, parking areas, sidewalks, driveways, walkways and compacted gravel areas to be treated and infiltrate near the source. Native plants are used within rain gardens because they are tolerant to local climate, soils and water conditions and do not require fertilizers. Water filters through engineered soil layers before entering the groundwater system (mimicking natural conditions). Plant and small tree root systems enhance infiltration, moisture redistribution and diverse microbial populations necessary for biofiltration. Rain gardens may or may not have an under-drain and are not designed as a conveyance system.

“Significant tree” means any evergreen tree of at least 15 inches DBH and any deciduous tree, other than red alder, holly, poplar and cottonwood trees, at least 12 inches DBH. Red alder, holly, poplar, cottonwood and other invasive trees of any size are not considered significant trees. (Ord. 1663 § 12, 2018: Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.030 Low impact development.

Low impact development (LID) is a stormwater management approach with a basic principle that is modeled after nature: manage rainfall and stormwater runoff at the source using decentralized small-scale controls. The goal of low impact development is to mimic a site’s predevelopment hydrology as much as practical by using design techniques that infiltrate, filter, store, recharge, evaporate, and detain runoff close to its source. Techniques are based on the premise that stormwater management should not be seen as stormwater disposal. Instead of capturing, conveying, managing and treating stormwater in large, costly end-of-pipe facilities, located at the bottom of drainage areas, LID addresses stormwater through small, cost-effective landscape features located at the lot and tract level. These landscape features, known as integrated management practices (IMPs), are the building blocks of LID. Almost all components of the urban environment have the potential to serve as an IMP. These include open spaces, rooftops, streetscapes, parking lots, sidewalks, landscape strips and medians. LID is a versatile approach that can be applied equally well to new development, urban retrofits, and redevelopment projects. The most suitable LID approaches may vary from site to site due to varying surface and sub-surface geology, topography, vegetation and site configuration. (Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.040 Benefits.

The benefits of low impact development include but are not limited to the following:

A. LID techniques protect the environment by removing pollutants from stormwater, reducing the overall volume of stormwater, managing high storm flows, and replenishing streams, wetlands and aquifers.

B. LID techniques help to reduce flooding and protect property. Reducing impervious surfaces, increasing vegetation, and dispersing and infiltrating stormwater result in less runoff. This reduces the likelihood of flooding from major storm events.

C. LID techniques help to protect human health by more effectively removing pollutants from stormwater. Untreated stormwater can be unsafe for people to drink or swim in.

D. LID techniques help to protect drinking water supplies by ensuring that rainfall infiltrates into the existing soils where it can recharge aquifers, rather than being treated as a waste and discharged to marine waters.

E. LID techniques provide cost-effective alternatives to systems upgrades. In many cases, LID systems, such as bioretention, are less expensive to use than costly stormwater vaults or land-consuming stormwater retention and storage ponds.

F. LID techniques improve the appearance and aesthetics of communities. LID projects leave more trees and plants and have less impervious surfaces, resulting in greener developments and communities.

G. LID techniques can increase public safety. One hallmark of LID is safer streets. Studies show that when vehicle traffic is slowed, there are fewer pedestrian accidents. LID techniques that serve to also slow traffic include narrower streets and integrated rain gardens doubling as traffic calming features.

H. LID techniques help to preserve a “green” and environmentally sustainable North Bend with a small town rural character. (Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.050 LID demonstration projects – Established.

In conjunction with all zoning requirements as set forth by the North Bend Municipal Code, there is hereby established a LID demonstration project provision. Due to the existing undisturbed mature significant forest located within the CLDR zoned property located north of SE 140th Street and east of the Wood River Subdivision, one LID demonstration project is allowed at this location, subject to the requirements set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.060 Review process, fees, deposits and other charges.

A. An applicant may apply for a conceptual LID demonstration project subject to the provisions set forth in this chapter. The conceptual LID demonstration project shall be an administrative approval made by the director of community and economic development. Once the applicant receives conceptual LID demonstration project approval, the applicant may submit a preliminary plat application, pursuant to NBMC Title 17 and subject to the conceptual LID demonstration project approval’s findings, conditions and project layout.

B. All applicable provisions of the North Bend Municipal Code shall stand in full effect for the conceptual LID demonstration project unless otherwise adjusted herein or approved by the city of North Bend as described in subsection C of this section.

C. If the city determines it necessary to waive any provisions of the NBMC to meet the goals and objectives of LID, the applicant must submit to the city a request in writing, identifying the code provision to be adjusted and clearly detailing the LID reasons and benefits for the alternative standard. The City shall approve, approve with condition, or deny the proposed adjustment with the conceptual LID demonstration project approval.

D. The applicant shall pay all costs associated with the review process as set forth in Chapter 20.09 NBMC. (Ord. 1610 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016: Ord. 1366 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2009).


18.50.070 LID general standards.

The following LID standards and goals shall be achieved, unless otherwise approved by the city:

A. Stormwater Flow Control. Maintain and/or restore the predeveloped, undisturbed stormwater flow volumes, flow frequencies and durations, and water quality from a developed site. Stormwater discharges shall match developed discharge durations to predeveloped durations for the range of predeveloped discharge rates from 50 percent of the two-year peak flow up to the full 50-year peak flow. The flow control objectives can be achieved through the following site design objectives:

1. Conservation Measures.

a. Maximize retention of native forest cover and restore disturbed vegetation to intercept, evaporate and transpire precipitation. Leave a minimum of 35 percent of the total site area as open space retaining native soil and vegetation. This 35 percent requirement is in addition to sensitive areas and their buffers, and park requirements. Retain or restore native soils and vegetation on 45 percent of the developable site areas, not including road rights-of-way, trail rights-of-way and park areas. Where 45 percent is not reasonably achievable, the applicant shall demonstrate how the combined use of other LID techniques will achieve the overall goal.

b. Preserve permeable, native soil, and enhance disturbed soils to store and infiltrate storm flows.

c. Retain and incorporate topographic site features that slow, store, and infiltrate stormwater.

d. Retain and incorporate natural drainage features and patterns.

2. Site Planning Techniques.

a. Place structures on those portions of a site most suitable for development retaining sensitive lands or lands that can best provide stormwater functions as open space.

b. Locate structures, roads and other impervious surfaces in a manner to reduce adversely affecting significant trees, soils and other natural features that provide effective infiltration of stormwater and natural habitat.

c. Minimize total impervious surface area. Limit the effective impervious area of the total site area to no more than 27 percent.

3. Integrated Management Practices (IMP).

a. As appropriate for each site use: bioretention, pervious surfaces, rain gardens, open space surface water dispersion, soil restoration, rooftop infiltration, and other dispersed facilities to control stormwater as close to the origin as possible by utilizing small scale distributed hydrologic controls.

b. Create a hydrological landscape that slows storm flows and increases time of stormwater concentration.

c. Increase reliability of the stormwater management system by providing multiple LID flow control practices.

d. Integrate stormwater controls into the development design and utilize the controls as amenities. Create a multifunctional landscape.

e. Reduce the reliance on traditional conveyance and pond technologies. The use of traditional conveyance and pond technologies to manage stormwater quality and quantity should only be considered after all other LID techniques have been considered and used to the greatest extent possible.

f. Bioretention areas or rain gardens shall be shallow landscaped depressions and/or swales with a designed soil mix and plants adapted to the local climate and soil moisture. Landscaping with turf and/or sod in the bioretention areas should be used sparingly. To the extent practical, bioretention areas shall be integrated throughout the site to serve as landscape amenities and receive stormwater from small contributing areas.

g. General design requirements for all bioretention features or IMPs shall meet or exceed Chapter 6 of the Low Impact Development Technical Guidance Manual for Puget Sound and the most current best management practices.

h. Types of IMPs.

i. Rain gardens or bioretention cells are typically integrated into gardens on individual lots and tracts.

ii. Off-line bioretention swales incorporate the same design features as a rain garden or bioretention cell; however, bioretention swales are designed as part of a conveyance system and have relatively gentle side slopes. Contains a common flow entrance and flow exit, and the bioretention invert placed below the swale invert to provide the proper depth.

iii. In-line bioretention swales are hybrid facilities usually installed along roadways that incorporate bioretention cell and swale characteristics.

iv. Weep garden bioretention areas are used for steeper gradients where a retaining wall is used for structural support and for allowing storm flows directly to the facility to seep out.

v. Sloped bioretention-use vegetation barriers are designed for a specific hydraulic capacity, placed along sloped contours.

vi. Tree box filters are street tree plantings with an enlarged planting pit for additional storage, a storm flow inlet from the street, and an under-drain system.

vii. The diagram below shows the basic components of a bioretention cell. Final design features and details shall be reviewed and approved by the city.

2. Urban yard garden space.

E. Significant trees may be limbed up to 30 percent of the tree height, thinned for windfall management and light, and dead or dangerous limbs removed in accordance with removal specifications from a certified arborist. Any tree that must be removed for any reason that exceeds the maximum allowed number of trees to remove, shall be replaced with three 12-foot conifers (DSH), planted on the lot, near the lot or in the plat to contribute and maintain the minimum tree cover canopy. City arborist shall approve and confirm planting. A bond and three-year warranty is required on any planting.

F. The homeowners’ association shall contract with a certified arborist for ongoing tree care of the entire neighborhood including trees located on the private lots, open spaces, critical areas and public rights-of-way. A tree removal permit shall be submitted to the city for review and approval prior to removal of any tree. The information submitted with the tree removal permit shall reference the tree protection plan and confirm the retention and maintenance of the required tree cover. All pruning shall be done in accordance with ANSI standards.

G. To the maximum degree practicable, the tree canopy over the entire site shall remain a minimum of 40 percent site area coverage in perpetuity. Supplemental plantings may be required over time. A tree protection plan, produced by the homeowners’ association, shall annually confirm a record of the retained trees and propose additional plantings to maintain the 40 percent canopy coverage required on the whole site.

H. Any clearing, grading and construction on any lot and the whole site overall shall require a tree protection plan (TPP) specific to that area or lot and the trees on it. The TPP shall identify all protected trees and all work proposed around and near those trees. The TPP shall describe all methods of tree protection that are proposed to mitigate for the work to be done on site. The developer shall hire a certified arborist to provide this plan, review implementation and to be on site during work within the interior critical root zone (CRZ). The developer’s certified arborist shall have this plan approved by the city’s certified arborist. The city’s arborist shall review, approve and monitor the work to confirm that tree protection methods are being followed.

1. Soil compaction shall not be allowed over any interior critical root zone and limited access over the perimeter CRZs. As a general guideline, the tree critical root zone shall be defined as an area equal to a one-foot radius for every one inch trunk diameter at standard height (DSH). “DSH” means the diameter at standard height; the diameter of the trunk measured 54 inches (four and one-half feet) above grade. See detail below for an explanation of the CRZ. The entire CRZ is divided in half with the outside 50 percent of the CRZ described as the perimeter CRZ and the inside 50 percent of the CRZ as the interior CRZ. At all times, the interior CRZ shall be retained without disturbance and protected from soil compaction with woodchips and/or steel plates. Any intrusion into the interior CRZ shall be approved and monitored by the city arborist. Work within the perimeter CRZ is allowed with limitations and protection.

C. Waiver of Submittal Requirement. The approval authority may waive any submittal requirement upon determination that the required submittal, or part thereof, is not reasonably related to the substantial change criteria. A waiver, to be effective, must be in writing and signed by the approval authority.

D. When Received. An eligible facilities modification application, and any supplemental submittals, shall be deemed received by the city upon the date such application, or supplemental submittal, is filed with the community and economic development department. An application, and any supplemental submittals, must be filed in person during regular business hours of the city and must be accompanied by the applicable permit review fee(s). Any application received by the city without contemporaneous payment, or deposit, of the applicable permit review fees will be rejected.

E. Completed Application – Determination – Tolling.

1. Determination of Completeness. The approval authority shall, within 30 days of receipt of the application, review the application for completeness. An application is complete if it includes the applicable permit review fee(s) and contains all of the applicable submittal requirements set forth at subsection B of this section, unless waived by the approval authority pursuant to subsection C of this section. The determination of completeness shall not preclude the approval authority from requesting additional information or studies either at the time of the determination of completeness or subsequently if new or additional information is required, or substantial changes in the proposed action occur, or the proposed facilities modification is modified by applicant, as determined by the approval authority.

2. Incomplete Application. The approval authority shall notify the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application that the application is incomplete. Such notice shall clearly and specifically delineate all missing documents or information.

3. Tolling Time Frame for Review. The application review period begins to run when the application is received, and may be tolled when the approval authority determines that the application is incomplete and provides notice as set forth below. The application review period may also be tolled by mutual agreement of the approval authority and applicant.

a. To toll the time frame for review for incompleteness, the approval authority must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of the date of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. Such delineated information is limited to submittals set forth in subsection B of this section and any supplemental information requested by the approval authority that is reasonably related to determining whether the proposed facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimension of an eligible support structure.

b. The time frame for review begins running again when the city is in receipt of applicant’s supplemental submission in response to the approval authority’s notice of incompleteness.

c. Following a supplemental submission, the approval authority shall have 10 days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this subsection (E)(3)(c). Except as may be otherwise agreed to by the applicant and the approval authority, second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.

d. A notice of incompleteness from the city will be deemed received by the applicant upon the earlier of personal service upon the authorized person, delivery by electronic mail to the authorized person (if such delivery is authorized for receipt of notice by the authorized person), or three days from deposit of the notice in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and in an envelope properly addressed to the authorized person using the address set forth in the application.

4. Modification of Application. In the event that after submittal of the application, or as a result of any subsequent submittals, applicant modifies the proposed facilities modification described in the initial application, the application as modified will be considered a new application subject to commencement of a new application review period; provided, that applicant and the approval authority may, in the alternative, enter into a mutually agreeable tolling agreement allowing the city to request additional submittals and additional time that may be reasonably necessary for review of the modified application. (Ord. 1642 § 1 (part), 2017).


18.80.080 Review of application – Approval.

A. Review of Application. The approval authority shall review an eligible facilities modification application to determine if the proposed facilities modification is subject to this chapter, and, if so, if the proposed facilities modification will result in a substantial change to the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure.

B. Time Frame for Review. Within 60 days of the date on which the city receives an eligible facilities modification application, less any time period that may be excluded under the tolling provisions of this chapter or a tolling agreement between the applicant and the approval authority, the approval authority shall approve the application and contemporaneously issue an eligible facilities modification permit unless the approval authority determines that the application is not subject to this chapter, or the proposed facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimension of an eligible support structure.

C. Approval – Denial. An eligible facilities application shall be approved, and an eligible facilities permit issued, upon determination by the approval authority that the proposed facilities modification is subject to this chapter and that it does not substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure. An eligible facilities application shall be denied upon determination by the approval authority that the proposed facilities modification is not subject to this chapter or will substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure.

D. Deemed Approved Application. An application that has been deemed approved shall be the equivalent of an eligible facilities modification permit, except as may be otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, and shall be subject to generally applicable enforcement and compliance requirements in the same manner as an eligible facilities modification permit issued pursuant to this chapter.

E. Denial of Application. A denial of an eligible facilities modification application shall set forth in writing the reasons for the denial and shall be provided to the applicant.

F. Code Requirements. Any eligible facilities modification permit issued pursuant to this chapter, and any application that has been deemed approved, shall be and is conditioned upon compliance with any generally applicable building, structural, electrical, and safety codes and other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety. Violation of any such applicable code or standard shall be deemed to be a violation of the eligible facilities modification or deemed approved application.

G. Term of Eligible Facilities Modification Permit. An eligible facilities modification permit issued pursuant to this chapter, and any deemed approved application, shall be valid for a term of 180 days from the date of issuance, or the date the application is deemed approved.

H. Remedies. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the city code, no administrative review is provided for review of a decision to condition, deny, or approve an application. Applicant and the city retain any and all remedies that are available at law or in equity. In the event no other time period is provided at law for bringing an action for a remedy, any action challenging a denial of an application or notice of a deemed approved remedy shall be brought within 30 days following the date of denial or following the date of notification of the deemed approved remedy. (Ord. 1642 § 1 (part), 2017).


18.80.090 Substantial change criteria.

A proposed facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the following criteria:

A. For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than 10 percent or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by more than 10 percent or more than 10 feet, whichever is greater.

Changes in height should be measured from the original support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings’ rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act;

B. For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet;

C. For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets; or, for towers in the public rights-of-way and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than 10 percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure;

1. It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;

2. It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support structure; or

3. It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base station equipment, provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed the thresholds identified in this section. (Ord. 1642 § 1 (part), 2017).


18.80.100 Enforcement – Violation.

Compliance with the provisions of this chapter is mandatory. Any violation hereof is subject to enforcement under the code enforcement provisions set forth at Chapter 8.08 NBMC or any other applicable legal proceeding. (Ord. 1642 § 1 (part), 2017).

19.01.010 Applicability of chapter.

The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all street and utility improvements, public or private, to be designed or constructed within the city including, but not limited to, streets, sidewalks, landscape strips, driveways, water, sewer, storm, franchise utilities, clearing, and grading. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 4, 1987).


19.01.015 Public works standards adopted.

The adopted city of North Bend public works standards shall serve as the design and construction standards for all street and utility facilities. These standards, in addition to applicable provisions of the North Bend Municipal Code, and state and federal law, shall govern all such work. The city has adopted the standards in this chapter primarily for a two-fold purpose:

A. To set forth specific, consistent street and utility design elements for developers and other private parties constructing or modifying street or utility facilities which require city licenses or permits; and

B. To establish uniform criteria to guide the city’s construction of new city facilities or reconstruction of existing facilities.

These standards cannot provide for all situations. They are intended to assist but not to substitute for competent work by design professionals. It is expected that land surveyors, engineers, and architects will bring to each project the best of skills from their respective disciplines. These standards are also not intended to limit unreasonably any innovative or creative effort which could result in better quality, better cost savings, or both. Any proposed departure from the standards will be judged, however, on the likelihood that such departure will produce a compensating or comparable result, in every way adequate for the street and utility user and city resident.

The city’s public works standards may be referred to as the “standards.” “Standard drawings” shall refer to the drawings contained in the city’s public works standards as adopted in this chapter.

The director of public works is authorized to administratively adopt operating policies and minor changes, or adjustments, to the standard drawings to better implement the standards or allow for changes in design, material, and construction technology and methods occurring after the effective date of the ordinance adopting the public works standards. A copy of the public works standards shall be publicly available at the city’s public works department. (Ord. 1666 § 22, 2018).


19.01.016 Review of development proposals.

Owners of real property in the city who wish to develop their property and owners of real property outside the city limits who wish to enter into an agreement pursuant to NBMC 19.01.200 for the extension of city utilities to such real property shall submit such proposals for review by the city engineer. An application for such review shall be accompanied by a deposit of funds to defray actual costs of review, including administrative, legal, engineering and planning fees. The amount of the required deposit will be as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. The city will keep records of the uses of the deposits. Unused deposits will be refunded at the end of the project. If the development proposal is withdrawn, the city will refund to the applicant any funds on deposit that are not spent or not required for services rendered by the city or its agents. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1237 § 17 (part), 2005: Ord. 842 § 2, 1991).


19.01.020 Project manager and job superintendent.

The landowner/developer shall appoint, in writing to the city, their project manager and on-site superintendent. All correspondence and communications from the city will be addressed to the project manager or on-site superintendent. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 5, 1987).


19.01.040 City project representatives.

The project representative for the city shall be the city engineer. All correspondence and inquiries shall be addressed to this individual. The city engineer might appoint certain other persons to be responsible for various aspects of the project. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 7, 1987).


19.01.050 Construction plan preparation, submittal and review.

The city will not provide review of incomplete plans. Complete plan packages including all facilities to be constructed for a project shall be submitted to the city for review as a single package. The city will be available for a pre-application meeting to discuss particular project requirements if requested. The city will also be available for questions during the design process, but no permits will be issued without all plans being submitted, reviewed and approved. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 8, 1987).


19.01.060 Preconstruction conference.

A preconstruction conference is required and shall be requested and scheduled at the city by the project manager, after all plans have been reviewed and approved by the city and all other regulatory agencies and permits have been issued. The project manager and job superintendent shall be present, plus pertinent representatives from subcontractors, utility companies, and city. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 9, 1987).


19.01.070 Inspections by the city.

A. The city may provide periodic inspections of the work in progress during construction. Inspection by the city will be for conformance with city requirements contained in approved plans, specifications, permits and agreements for the project as well as in applicable city ordinances. The project manager shall at all times keep the city inspector advised as to the progress of the work and shall not cover or otherwise obscure any work from the inspector’s view prior to inspection.

B. The city inspector will not direct the construction activities or otherwise administer the project or make any certifications as to the percentage of completion of any portion of the project unless the landowner/developer has entered into a developer extension agreement with the city designating the city as the project manager.

C. The lack of inspection by the city inspector will not negate the responsibilities of the owner/developer to properly construct the project. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 10, 1987).


19.01.080 Special tests.

The city may from time to time require special tests such as material tests, compaction tests, structural tests, or performance tests of mechanical items or television inspection and videotaping. When these tests are requested, they shall be completed by the owner/developer at no cost to the city. If special consultants, laboratories, materials or equipment are required to perform or complete the tests, all costs thereof shall be paid by the owner/developer prior to acceptance of the construction by the city. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 11, 1987).


19.01.090 Minimum standards.

The standards contained in this title are minimum standards. The city engineer may require more stringent standards to be followed if, in the circumstances of a particular project, more stringent standards or different materials or equipment are necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare. Additionally, the city engineer may require changes in the field during construction to correct an oversight that may have occurred during the permit review process. If any of these are the case, then the city engineer shall provide timely written notification to the project manager of the more stringent standards or corrections with an explanation as to the reasons therefor. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 12, 1987).


19.01.100 General provisions.

A. Permit Required. It is unlawful for anyone, except the city public works department or its agent, to perform clearing and grading, street, and/or utility work of any kind, without first obtaining a permit issued by the city. Permits shall not be transferable or assignable without the city’s prior written consent, and work shall not be performed under a permit in any place other than that specified in the permit. Nothing herein contained shall prevent a permittee from subcontracting the work to be performed under a permit; provided, however, that the holder of the permit shall be and remains responsible for the performance of the work under the permit, and responsible for all bonding, insurance and other requirements of this chapter and under said permit.

B. Upon suspension or revocation of a permit, all use of the permitted area shall cease, except as authorized by the director. Continued activity following revocation or suspension under this section shall subject each and every violator to the maximum penalties provided by this chapter, with every day constituting a new violation. The director may revoke or suspend any permit issued under this chapter whenever:

1. The activity does not proceed in accordance with the plans as approved, in accordance with conditions of approval, or is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or procedures, or other city ordinances, or state laws;

2. The city has been denied access to investigate and inspect how the right-of-way is being used; or

3. The permittee has misrepresented a material fact in applying for a permit (a material fact is a fact which, had the truth been known at the time of the issuance of the permit, the permit would not have been granted).

C. As a condition to the issuance of any permit under this chapter, the permittee shall be required to execute a written agreement to forever hold and save the city free and harmless from any and all claims, actions or damages of every kind and description that may accrue to or be suffered by any person by reason of the use of such place or the construction, existence, maintenance, use or occupation of any such structure, services, fixtures, equipment and/or facilities on or in a place pursuant to this chapter. In addition, such agreement shall contain a provision that the permit is wholly of a temporary nature, and that it vests no permanent right whatsoever.

D. The permittee shall at all times and at the permittee’s expense preserve and protect from injury adjoining property by complying with such measures as the director or designee may deem reasonably suitable for such purposes. The permittee shall at all times maintain access to all property adjoining the excavation or work site.

E. To ensure adjacent properties can be provided water, sewer, drainage, and street service, service shall be extended to the extreme property line of the property and design for the ultimate development of the tributary areas. Sewer and drainage service shall be provided by a gravity system unless otherwise approved or directed by the city.

F. Demand projections will be taken from the latest version of the city’s planning documents such as the general sewer plan, water system plan, or other similar document(s) for transportation and drainage systems. (Ord. 1666 § 23, 2018).1


19.01.200 Developer extension agreement.

The city hereby authorizes owners of real property within the city to enter into agreements with the city for the extension of public street and stormwater facilities to such real property and authorizes owners of real property within the city or without the city limits to enter into agreements with the city for the extension of public water and sewer facilities to such real property. The owner of the property for which the improvements are being made shall enter into a developer extension agreement with the city, executed on behalf of the city by the city engineer upon a form provided by the city attorney, post a performance bond, provide insurance as required under the developer extension agreement, and pay an administrative fee as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance, all other applicable administrative, inspection, and permit fees, and all actual costs to the city associated with the project in excess of the administrative fee, including but not limited to legal, engineering, consultant and planning fees, as set forth in the agreement. Applicants for developer extension agreements shall be in compliance with all city ordinances, rules and regulations to be eligible for processing of their application. The agreement may authorize the city to provide design and construction administration services for the required public improvements with the owner/developer paying the costs and staff time. The city public works director shall have the authority to waive the requirement for a full developer extension agreement for small public street and/or small public utility extensions depending upon such factors as project size, risk, and such other objective factors as the public works director finds pertinent; however, such projects shall require a Type B right-of-way use permit pursuant to Chapter 12.24 NBMC. Examples of “small public street and/or small public utility extensions” for purposes of this section include, but are not limited to: constructing or replacing 100 feet or less of sidewalk and/or curb and gutter associated with a single-family residence; constructing or replacing less than 100 feet of public water, sewer, or stormwater facilities; replacing a driveway apron; or construction of 100 feet or less of sidewalk through the city’s sidewalk construction-in-lieu program. (Ord. 1655 § 1, 2018: Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1237 § 17 (part), 2005: Ord. 842 § 3, 1991: Ord. 720 § 14, 1987).


19.01.210 Construction administration and inspection fees – Generally.

Construction inspection/administration fees compensate the city for the administration and inspection costs associated with the construction of improvements. Inspection and administration fees shall cover inspections during the first 12 months after issuance of permits and are payable prior to permit issuance. If construction time exceeds 12 months from the issuance of permits, additional inspection fees shall be due in proportion to the original fees and payable on each anniversary date of permit issuance for each additional year or portion thereof until final construction approval and acceptance. Supplemental construction inspection fees shall be charged for reinspection of facilities if the time period from construction approval to final facility acceptance exceeds 60 days. All overdue construction inspection fees are subject to late payment charges. Balances more than 60 days overdue from date of billing are subject to an additional late charge and subsequent monthly late charges based on percentages of the outstanding fee balance. The late charge shall be as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. Acceptance of work shall not be issued unless all fees are paid current. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1237 § 17 (part), 2005: Ord. 768 § 12, 1988).

19.01.300 Easements.

Where easements are required for any utilities to be owned, operated or maintained by the city, the landowner/developer shall prepare the easements, secure city approval of the content and adequacy, and shall obtain signatures on easements from all parties with an interest in the property over which an easement is required, and shall submit the easements to the city engineer prior to receipt of any public utility service or permits from the city. All costs for preparation, acquisition and recording shall be paid by the landowner/developer. Any required easements over property not owned by the landowner/developer shall be secured by the landowner/developer prior to issuance of permits. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 17, 1987. Formerly 19.01.400.).


19.01.310 Standards for easements.

Whenever water, sewer, and/or stormwater lines are located outside of public rights-of-way, the easement shall be of sufficient width to allow for future replacement of the facility without damage to permanent adjacent improvements. In general, if the water, sewer, and/or stormwater line is located in the center of the easement, its minimum width shall be 15 feet. Special circumstances may require additional widths such as for deep pipe lines. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 842 § 3, 1991. Formerly 19.01.410.).


19.01.400 Bill of sale and original design drawings.

Upon completion of construction, the landowner/developer shall furnish the city with an itemization of all costs associated with the construction of the public streets and/or utilities in order that a bill of sale can be prepared. Record construction drawings (commonly known as “as-builts”) drawn on mylar, record drawings provided electronically on a compact disk in AutoCAD format, and other necessary data shall also be submitted at the completion of construction and shall remain the property of the city. In addition, the developer shall furnish the city with a guarantee of workmanship and materials for a period of two years. Such guarantee may be in the form of a cash deposit or a security device in a form and amount approved by the director. (Ord. 1666 § 27, 2018: Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 17, 1987. Formerly 19.01.500.).


19.01.500 Reimbursement agreement.

Owners entering into developer extension agreements, as authorized under NBMC 19.01.200, for the construction of street or utility improvements may apply to the city to enter into a reimbursement agreement for recovery of a pro rata share of the cost of constructing the improvements from property owners that will benefit from the extended improvements and did not share in the cost; provided, however, that any sewer, water or stormwater improvements covered by a reimbursement agreement must lie within the city limits or within the city’s planned and approved service areas for the associated improvements. Such an agreement may be executed by the city engineer in a form prepared by the city attorney. No reimbursement agreement shall extend for a period longer than 15 years from the date of final acceptance of such improvements by the city. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 842 § 4, 1991: Ord. 720 § 15, 1987. Formerly 19.01.300.).


19.01.510 Application for reimbursement agreement.

Application for a reimbursement agreement shall be made to the city engineer and shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee as established by the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. Applicants for reimbursement agreements shall be in compliance with all city ordinances, rules and regulations to be eligible for processing of their application. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1237 § 17 (part), 2005: Ord. 842 § 5, 1991. Formerly 19.01.310.).


19.01.520 Procedures for reimbursement agreements.

The procedures to be followed for reimbursements for street and utility improvements shall be as follows:

A. Subject to approval by the city, the applicant will formulate an assessment reimbursement area (“benefit area”) including all property whose owners did not contribute to the original cost of such street and utility improvements and who may subsequently tap onto, drain to, or use such utility improvements, including users connected to laterals or branches connecting thereto, or whose property would require such street improvements.

B. The applicant will establish the costs of the street and utility improvements based on actual costs of design and construction and the pro rata share of such costs to be assessed against each parcel within the benefit area, determined on an acre, front footage, or other equitable basis, which costs and basis for assessment must be approved by the city engineer. The applicant shall provide such documentation as necessary by the city engineer to confirm actual costs incurred including but not limited to copies of invoices from the designer and contractor, checks issued for payments by the owner, etc.

C. The city council will hold a hearing regarding the proposed benefit area and the assessments applicable to property in the benefit area. Notice of the date of the hearing, along with the preliminary determination of the boundaries of the benefit area and the assessments for each parcel within the benefit area, shall be sent by regular mail to the property owners of record within the benefit area as shown on the records of the King County assessor. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed no later than 20 days before the date of the hearing. At the hearing, the city council shall consider comments from property owners within the benefit area and shall set the boundaries of the benefit area and the assessments to be borne by property owners within the benefit area.

D. The reimbursement agreement may then be executed on behalf of the city by the city engineer. The reimbursement agreement must be recorded in the King County auditor’s office within five days of its execution. It shall be the sole responsibility of the reimbursement applicant to record the reimbursement agreement. Once recorded, the reimbursement agreement shall be binding on owners of record within the benefit area.

E. All notice requirements set forth herein shall be the sole responsibility of the applicant for reimbursement agreement and shall be satisfied by a notarized affidavit that the applicant has mailed the notices in accordance with the requirements set forth herein.

F. Where a reimbursement agreement applies to utility improvements, the city will not allow any property owner within the benefit area to tap into the sewer, water, or storm sewer system without prior payment of the reimbursement assessment applicable to such property owner. Where a reimbursement agreement applies to street improvements, the city will not allow any property owner within the benefit area to receive preliminary plat approval, a development permit, or change of use on the property that would otherwise qualify for frontage improvements without prior payment of the reimbursement assessment applicable to such property owner. The city shall use its best efforts to assure compliance with this section, but the city shall incur no liability for an unauthorized tap. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 842 § 6, 1991. Formerly 19.01.320.).


19.01.530 Rights and nonliability of city.

The city reserves the right to refuse to enter into any reimbursement agreement or to reject any application thereof. All applications for reimbursement agreements shall be made on the basis that the applicant releases and waives any claims for any liability of the city in establishment and enforcement of reimbursement agreements. The city shall not be responsible for locating any beneficiary, survivor, assign or successor in interest entitled to payments by or through a reimbursement agreement. Any collected funds unclaimed after one year from the expiration of the agreement shall be returned to parties making payment to the city. Any remaining undeliverable funds shall inure to the benefit of the appropriate utility and/or fund approved by the city council. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 842 § 7, 1991. Formerly 19.01.330.).


19.01.600 Oversizing credit.

If any public utility such as water mains, sanitary or storm sewers are required for the purpose of benefiting additional or adjacent properties to be sized larger than the minimum sizes set forth in this title, or as required by other regulatory guidelines, then such utility shall be constructed to such size and design as determined by the city engineer. Reimbursement to the landowner/developer for the costs of this oversize construction in order to benefit additional or adjacent properties, and the terms of the oversize reimbursements, will be defined in the developer extension agreement. If the terms are not established in the developer extension agreement and actual amounts not determined prior to the issuance of permits, then the developer/owner will have been deemed to have waived his right to any oversizing credit. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 18, 1987).


19.01.700 Grade sheets – Surveys.

All streets, curbs, sidewalks, sanitary sewers and storm sewers, and other such facilities as determined by the city engineer, shall be constructed to surveyed line and grade and as detailed on the plans. Grade sheets shall be prepared for all sanitary sewers and storm sewers. All construction surveys shall be done under the direction of a licensed land surveyor. (Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 720 § 19, 1987).


19.01.800 Construction drawing formats.

The city requires that all construction drawings for work done under this title conform to the format identified in the public works standards unless exceptions are approved in advance by the city engineer. (Ord. 1666 § 28, 2018: Ord. 1317 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 843 § 4, 1991).21

19.06.010 Application of chapter.

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all new and existing franchise utility systems including, but not limited to, electrical (including street lighting), gas, communications, and all other franchise utilities, except for major utility facilities as defined and regulated under NBMC Title 18. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.020 Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum requirements for the underground installation and relocation of franchise utilities within the city. It is further the policy of the city to require the underground installation of all new franchise utilities, and the relocation of existing franchise utilities underground when affected by new development or redevelopment under the provisions of this chapter. The city finds that the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the community require that all new and relocated facilities specified in this chapter be installed underground. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.030 Public works standards.

This chapter provides minimum requirements for franchise utilities and street lighting. Detailed standards and technical specifications pertaining to construction and installation of these facilities are found in the city’s public works standards. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.040 Definitions.

Unless otherwise specified below, definitions shall be as provided under NBMC Title 18, Zoning.

A. Electrical distribution facilities include those electrical utility lines and equipment operating between 120 and 35,000 volts that provide direct service to customers.

B. Electrical transmission facilities include those electrical utility lines and equipment operating above 35,000 volts transmitting power from generating stations to substations.

C. New development or redevelopment for purposes of this section includes any one of the following conditions:

1. A land use or building permit for a new building or land use where frontage improvements are required; or

2. A building permit for a project where the cost of construction equals or exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the existing structure on site, excluding interior remodel of existing single-family residential structures and auxiliary buildings. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.050 New utilities.

All new franchise utility facilities installed for new development or redevelopment shall be placed underground, with the following exceptions:

A. Electrical transmission facilities.

B. Wireless communication facilities (see applicable code section).

C. Accessory franchise utility facilities less than 36 inches in height such as meters, junction boxes, transformers, and the like, when placed at least five feet from the edge of sidewalk, pavement edge or back of ditch and screened with landscaping compliant with franchise utility standards.

D. Accessory franchise utility facilities greater than 36 inches in height, when located within a building or placed in a nonprominent location on the side or rear of the building or at least 10 feet from the right-of-way or other public areas, and located behind a minimum of five feet of Type 1 landscaping pursuant to Chapter 18.18 NBMC and franchise utility standards. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.060 Undergrounding of existing overhead utilities.

A. Undergrounding with New Development or Redevelopment. Existing aboveground wiring and related equipment for electrical distribution facilities, communication facilities, and other purposes, except for wireless communication facilities, transformers, junction boxes and the like, shall be relocated underground along the property frontage when the development or redevelopment requires a subdivision or short subdivision pursuant to Chapter 17.12 NBMC, a binding site plan pursuant to Chapter 17.20 NBMC, or site plan approval pursuant to Chapter 18.14 NBMC, except when the right-of-way frontage of the new development or redevelopment is less than 150 feet in width along the frontage containing the aboveground wiring; and

1. The new development or redevelopment does not require relocation of the existing aboveground wiring to accommodate the required site or street frontage improvements; or

2. The city engineer determines that the undergrounding of the portion of the existing aboveground wiring along the development or redevelopment’s street frontage would require undergrounding portions of the existing aboveground wiring beyond the development’s street frontage, unless such additional undergrounding is no more than 50 feet beyond the property line on either end of the street frontage to connect to logical points of the existing utility system;

B. Where undergrounding is not required for a new development or redevelopment under one of the exemptions listed in subsection A of this section, and street frontage improvements are required, the applicant shall provide conduit within the street frontage improvements for the future undergrounding of the aboveground wiring. The conduit shall be of sufficient size and dimension to accommodate the projected maximum line size required for all franchise utility facilities to be undergrounded;

C. Undergrounding with Publicly Funded Street Improvements. As major publicly funded street improvements are undertaken within the city and where such programs require electrical, telephone or TV cable distribution facilities relocation, such facilities shall be relocated underground, unless exempted by action of the city council;

D. Relocation Time Limit. As overhead franchise utility facilities are relocated underground, the applicant shall have all overhead connections undergrounded and shall connect to the new underground facilities within 90 days of the date of undergrounding completion. A franchise utility provider’s compliance with this 90-day time limit is excused if unforeseen events or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the franchisee, including acts of God, render timely performance impossible, infeasible, or impracticable, or if, despite the franchisee’s best efforts, performance cannot be timely without posing risks to public safety and service requirements. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.070 Placement of underground cable television conduits.

When an applicant and/or landowner extends basic utilities to serve a building site, cable television conduits shall be laid underground at the same time as those other basic utilities. This will include only the conduits needed for street crossings and for mainline distributions of cable television to each building site throughout any proposed development. All conduit ends shall be brought to each building site property line, elbowed to the final ground elevation and capped. If the proposed development site is for multiple-family occupancy, then the conduit shall be so laid and be of sufficient dimension to ensure that cable television service may be connected to each of the proposed living units. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.080 Overhead electrical transmission facilities.

Franchise utility providers proposing new or replaced overhead electrical transmission facilities shall utilize appropriate measures to mitigate the visual appearance of such facilities on surrounding landscapes and views. Measures shall be determined based on the context of the facility and in consultation with the city, and should address pole height, pole spacing, materials and color as necessary to blend with surroundings, and co-location with other facilities to the extent possible. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.090 Liability for costs.

The applicant and/or landowner shall pay the costs required for the franchise utility provider to install or underground the utilities, including removal of the existing overhead facilities if required, and install conduit to each individual property line, including conduit, trenching and easements; provided, the costs of extending the utilities and conduit across the frontage of the build-site or development to the next property line shall be eligible for latecomer’s agreement. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.100 Installation – City engineer approval.

Design and installation of new and relocated utilities shall be done by the franchise utility company. All work shall be installed in accordance with industry standards for the associated utility and shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer. The applicant and/or landowner shall provide necessary occupancy rights and easements for the pad-mounted transformers and other accessory facilities necessary for the furnishing of such utilities. (Ord. 1588 § 1 (Exh. A (part)), 2016).


19.06.110 Street lighting.

A. When Required. When a development or redevelopment requires a subdivision or short subdivision pursuant to Chapter 17.12 NBMC, a binding site plan pursuant to Chapter 17.20 NBMC, or site plan approval pursuant to Chapter 18.14 NBMC, the applicant shall provide street lighting within existing and new public rights-of-way in accordance with these standards, if existing street lighting is not already provided.

B. Ownership.

1. Public Street Lights. Street lights within public rights-of-way shall be owned by the city or franchise utility provider, or as otherwise determined through utility franchise agreements.

2. Private Street Lights. Street lights on or along private alleys, roads or streets, on private property, or not otherwise within a public right-of-way, shall be privately owned and operated.

C. Billing to franchise utility providers for energy use for all street lights internal to new residential subdivisions shall be paid for by the homeowners association of the subdivision. All street lights along all other public streets shall be paid for by the city.

D. Energy Conservation Lighting Fixtures. All new street lighting shall utilize LED fixtures, or other equivalent best available technology that provides sufficient lumen output while reducing energy consumption, except where necessary to match existing lighting fixtures in an infill situation. To provide warmer lighting tones that reduce glare and night-sky pollution, fixtures shall provide a correlated light color temperature not to exceed 3,000 kelvin.

E. Minimum Lighting Requirements. Street lighting shall be provided at all intersections within and abutting the development, at the end of dead-end streets containing more than three homes, at the apex of sharp curves, and in any additional areas where determined necessary for safety by the public works director, such as crosswalks. Street lighting shall utilize full cut-off fixtures to minimize glare. The street lighting shall be designed to provide a minimum light intensity at intersections as specified in the table below, or greater when determined necessary for safety by the public works director. Detailed construction and facility street lighting specifications, including specified pole and fixture design in certain areas, are provided in the public works standards.

	Street Classification	Average Lighting – Foot-Candles in Areas Where Lighting Is Required

19.10.010 Purpose and intent.

A. This chapter is adopted for the following purposes:

1. To promote, protect, and preserve the public interest by establishing standards for and regulating land alteration, particularly the clearing, grading, filling, and/or drainage of land in the city without preventing the reasonable use of land;

2. To regulate land-disturbing activity for control of erosion, sedimentation, stormwater runoff, water pollution, vegetation removal, and landslide in order to minimize damage to public and private property;

3. To complement Chapter 14.12 NBMC in the management of areas of special flood hazard;

4. To promote building and site planning practices that are consistent with the city’s natural topography, soils, and vegetation features;

5. To minimize hazards to life, health, and property;

6. To require that development of environmentally sensitive lands be accomplished in a manner which protects those areas from damage or degradation and which promotes the health, safety, and welfare of the public;

7. To implement the goals and objectives and policies of the city’s comprehensive plan and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act, the Growth Management Act, and the city ordinances adopted pursuant to these state statutes;

8. To preserve and protect cultural, historical and anthropological artifacts from destruction when discovered on property within North Bend; 

9. To minimize indiscriminate removal or destruction of trees, shrubs and ground cover; and

10. To show that trees and other vegetation are important elements of the physical environment. They are integral to North Bend community character and protect public health, safety and general welfare. Protecting, enhancing, and maintaining healthy trees and vegetation are key community values. The many benefits of healthy non-invasive trees and vegetation contribute to North Bend’s quality of life by: 

a. Encouraging good development practices that minimize the adverse impacts of land-disturbing activities and impervious surfaces such as runoff, soil erosion, land instability, sedimentation and pollution of waterways, thus reducing the public and private costs for stormwater control/treatment and utility maintenance; 

b. Improving the air quality by absorbing air pollutants, assimilating carbon dioxide and generating oxygen; 

c. Reducing the effects of excessive noise pollution; 

d. Providing cost-effective protection from severe weather conditions with cooling effects in the summer months and insulating effects in winter; 

e. Providing visual relief and screening buffers;

f. Providing recreational benefits;

g. Providing habitat, cover, food supply and corridors for a diversity of fish and wildlife; and 

h. Providing economic benefit by enhancing local property values and contributing to the region’s natural beauty, aesthetic character, and livability of the community.

B. Notwithstanding the above-stated purposes, nothing in this chapter is intended to or shall be deemed to create a duty of the city to protect or promote the interests of any particular person or class of persons. Further, the existence of these regulations or any failure, refusal, or omission of the city to enforce any provision in this chapter is not intended to prevent, supplant, or affect the right of any person affected by the clearing, grading, filling, and/or drainage operations of another to invoke such private remedies as may be available against such other persons. (Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 1, 1993).


19.10.020 Definitions.

For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions describe the meaning of the terms used:

1. “Accelerated erosion” means any increase over the rate of natural erosion as a result of land-disturbing activity.

2. “Approval” means approval by the city engineer or CED director.

3. “Brushing” means the practice of removing ground cover to create better visibility on a property for purposes such as marketing or surveying of said property, controlling fires, preserving existing open space, and eliminating noxious weeds and other nuisance vegetation.

4. “Buffer zone” means a parcel or strip of land that is required to permanently remain in an undisturbed and untouched condition and within which no building, clearing, grading, or filling is permitted, except for minor maintenance necessary to protect life and property.

5. “Caliper” means the American Association of Nurserymen standard for trunk measurement of nursery stock. Caliper of the trunk shall be the trunk diameter measured six inches above the ground for up to and including four-inch caliper size and 12 inches above the ground for larger sizes. “Caliper” also refers to landscape planted trees and in the case of North Bend standards is the primary measurement for deciduous trees.

6. “Clearing” means the removal of trees, brush, grass, ground cover, or other vegetative matter from a site which exposes the earth’s surface on the site or results in the loss of trees or forested areas.

7. “Clearing and grading permit” means the written permission of the city to the applicant to proceed with the act of clearing, grading, filling and/or drainage which could disturb the land surface.

8. “Cluster” means a group of three or more trees with overlapping or touching crowns. 

9. Critical Root Zone or CRZ. The critical root zone of a tree is established on the basis of the trunk diameter. The CRZ is a circular area which has a radius of 12 inches to every inch diameter of trunk measured at four and one-half feet above grade. Root systems will vary both in depth and spread depending on size of tree, soils, water table, species and other factors. However, this CRZ description is generally accepted in the tree industry. Protecting this entire area should result in no adverse impact to the tree.

The below CRZ drawing has been further differentiated into the “perimeter” (PCRZ) and ICRZ to help define potential impact and required post care. Generally, the full PCRZ is considered the optimum amount of root protection to a tree. As one encroaches into the PCRZ, but not into the “interior CRZ,” the greater post care the tree would require to remain alive and stable. The “interior CRZ” is half the radius of the full PCRZ. Disturbance into the ICRZ could destabilize or cause the tree to decline.
[IMAGE]


The absolute maximum disturbance allowed should leave the “interior CRZ” undisturbed if the tree is to have any chance of survival. This “interior CRZ” would approximately equal the size of a root ball needed to transplant this tree which in turn would require extensive post care and possibly guying. Post care treatment includes but may not be limited to: regular irrigation, misting, root treatment with special root hormones, mulching, guying and monitoring for several years. 

10. “Crown” means the area of a tree containing leaf- or needle-bearing branches.

11. “Crown clean” or “CC” means the selective removal of dead, dying, damaged and diseased portions of trees.

12. “Crown raise” or “CR” means to selectively remove a lower portion of the crown to allow physical or visual clearance.

13. “Crown thin” or “CT” means the selective removal of limbs with foliage from throughout the crown to allow more sunlight or airflow. Percent of removal depends on tree age and vigor but generally should not exceed 20 percent in one year.

14. “Crown reduction” or “CRD” means the selective cutting back of long or heavy limbs to reduce end weight and the potential for failure. Percent of removal depends on tree age and vigor.

19.10.090 Standards.

No land-disturbing activity subject to the control of this chapter shall be undertaken except in accordance with the following mandatory standards:

A. Protection of Property. Land-disturbing activities shall be conducted in such a way that all reasonable measures are taken to protect all public and private property from damage caused by such activities.

B. Critical Areas Buffer Zone. No land-disturbing activity shall be permitted in an approved critical area or critical area buffer zone, except as otherwise allowed by applicable laws and permits.

C. Graded Slopes and Fills. The angle for graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which can be retained by vegetative cover or other adequate erosion control devices or structures.

D. Ground Cover. No land-disturbing activity shall be undertaken until installation of sufficient erosion and sediment control devices to retain the sediment generated by the activity within the boundaries of the tract during construction upon and development of said tract. Plantings or a permanent ground cover shall be provided immediately after completion of grading to sufficiently restrain erosion; provided, however, the CED director may extend the time for planting the permanent ground cover or planting if weather conditions do not permit immediate planting. Erosion control practices shall conform to the current edition of the King County Surface Water Design Manual specifications, unless other standards set forth in this chapter are more stringent, then the standards of this chapter shall control.

E. Use of Vegetative Measures. Vegetation measures using native plants shall be used for erosion and sediment control wherever feasible, rather than structural measures such as pipes, structures, or other devices.

F. Environmentally Critical Areas. Activity within environmentally critical areas shall be in compliance with Chapters 14.05 through 14.12 NBMC and shall be subject to the review of the CED director.

G. Preservation of Existing Vegetation. The proposal shall contain reasonable provisions for the preservation of natural land and water features, vegetation, including significant individual tree specimens or groups of trees, drainage and other indigenous natural features on the site. Natural vegetation shall not be removed from proposed landscape areas, unless a revegetation plan is first approved by the CED director.

H. Protection of Root Zones. The size of landscape or buffer areas shall be increased to the extent necessary to protect the root zones of all trees that are to be preserved. Land clearing machinery shall be kept outside of the root zone of any trees designated for retention. Damaging of trees designed for retention by scarring, backfilling of trees with heavy soil or compaction of soil over the root zone or any other activities that may cause damage of roots, trunks or surrounding ground cover shall be considered violations of this chapter.

I. Minimizing Clearing. No clearing and grading activity shall take place until necessary to construct the approved improvements, such as streets, roads, utilities and structures, and then only to the extent necessary to provide for the construction of the action approved through the permit and said areas have been surveyed and staked to enable city staff to confirm locations.

J. Protection of Artifacts. The protection of cultural and anthropological or historical artifacts found on the site shall be encouraged by allowing their removal prior to land-disturbing activity, or the protection of the appropriate section of the site by preserving it in a nondisturbed state to the extent consistent with the reasonable use of the property as a whole.

K. Compliance with International Building Code. The provisions of the International Building Code relating to cuts, fills, setbacks, drainage, terracing and erosion control shall be met.

L. Soil Stability. The clearing shall not create or contribute to landslides, accelerated soil creep, settlement and subsidence or hazards associated with strong ground motion and soil liquefaction.

M. Preservation of Significant Features. The proposal shall contain reasonable provisions for the preservation of natural land and water features, vegetation, including significant individual tree specimens or groups of trees, drainage and other indigenous natural features on the site.

N. Erosion and Flooding. Clearing, grading and filling shall not create or contribute to flooding, erosion or increased turbidity, siltation or other forms of pollution in a watercourse.

O. Floodway. No filling within the floodway unless there is compliance with Chapter 14.12 NBMC dealing with floodplain management. (Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 10, 1993).


19.10.091 Tree retention purpose.

The purpose of this section is to prevent the excessive removal of trees and associated vegetation for the multiple benefits provided to North Bend’s urban environment and its citizens. Trees along the perimeter of lots and parcels and along the frontage are of the highest priority to retain and should be considered first. Removal of noninvasive trees and vegetation in urban areas has resulted in the loss to the public of these beneficial functions. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process and standards to provide for the protection, preservation, replacement, proper maintenance, and use of trees in the city of North Bend. In addition to NBMC 19.10.010(A)(9), the intent of tree regulations is to: 

A. Maintain and enhance canopy coverage provided by trees for their functions as identified in NBMC 19.10.010;

B. Preserve and enhance the city of North Bend’s environmental, economic, and community character with mature landscapes; 

C. Promote site planning, building, and development practices that work to avoid removal or destruction of trees and vegetation, that avoid disturbance to the city’s natural vegetation, and that provide landscaping to buffer the effects of built and paved areas; 

D. Mitigate the impacts of tree removal in land development through on- and off-site tree replacement with the goals of significantly minimizing loss and enhancing the quality and quantity of North Bend’s tree canopy; 

E. Require tree retention efforts and consider flexibility with respect to certain other development requirements;

F. Implement the goals and objectives of the city’s comprehensive plan; and

G. Ensure the protection of the many benefits that healthy trees and vegetation contribute to North Bend’s quality of life by:

1. Minimizing the adverse impacts of land disturbing activities and impervious surfaces such as runoff, soil erosion, land instability, sedimentation and pollution of waterways, thus reducing the public and private costs for stormwater control/treatment and utility maintenance; 

2. Improving the air quality by absorbing air pollutants, mitigating the urban heat island effect, assimilating carbon dioxide and generating oxygen, and decreasing the impacts of climate change; 

3. Reducing the effects of excessive noise pollution; 

4. Providing cost-effective protection from severe weather conditions with cooling effects in the summer months and insulating effects in winter; 

5. Providing visual relief and screening buffers;

6. Providing recreational benefits;

7. Providing habitat, cover, food supply and corridors for a diversity of fish and wildlife; 

8. Providing economic benefit by enhancing local property values and contributing to the region’s natural beauty, aesthetic character, and livability of the community; and

9. Providing human health benefits for the citizens of North Bend, including improvements in air quality and mental health. (Ord. 1663 § 3, 2018: Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009). 


19.10.092 Development sites – Tree density requirements.

A. Introduction. A minimum tree density approach based on tree unit credits shall be used to retain a minimum number of viable trees with development activity. Unless otherwise exempted by this chapter, the requirement to meet a minimum tree density applies to all development activities, including: new single-family homes; residential subdivisions and short subdivisions; mixed-use developments; commercial and industrial developments; municipal and institutional developments; and utility developments. 

1. Tree retention or a combination of tree retention and supplemental planting shall be required to meet or exceed the minimum tree density required by this chapter. 

2. A tree density for existing trees to be retained is calculated to determine if supplemental trees are required in order to meet the minimum tree density for the entire site. 

3. Where supplemental trees are required, a minimum size that may be planted to meet the required tree density is established.

4. Location prioritization is established by this chapter for both retained trees and supplemental trees.

5. If a development site falls below the minimum density with existing trees, supplemental planting is required.

B. Tree Density Requirement. The required minimum tree density varies by zoning designation. The minimum tree credits per acre are provided in Table 19.10.092-1. 

1. The tree density may consist of existing trees, supplemental trees, or a combination of existing and supplemental trees pursuant to the standards of this section. 

2. Existing trees transplanted to an area on the same site shall not count toward the required density unless approved by the director based on transplant specifications provided by a qualified professional arborist that will ensure a good probability for survival.

3. Tree density credit requirements shall be based on the full site area, excluding wetlands, streams, and/or landslide hazard areas and associated critical areas buffers.

C. Tree Density Goal. Even if the developer meets the minimum tree density requirements, all other viable trees that can be retained without significant impact to the proposed development shall be retained per the same tree protection standards in NBMC 19.10.095.

 

Table 19.10.092-1 

Required Minimum Tree Credits  

	Land Use Type	Intensity	Required Minimum Tree Credits per 1,000 square feet

	Single-Family

*If lots are less than 7,500 sf and/or the proposal is a short subdivision in the DC or CR zone the required credit may be reduced in half.	Low/Moderate	1

	Multifamily	Moderate	.75

	Industrial	High	.5

	Commercial

	Public Facilities

	Downtown Commercial	 High	 .25

D. Tree Density Calculation. For the purpose of calculating required minimum tree density, public right-of-way, areas to be dedicated as public right-of-way, and vehicular access easements not included as lot area within an improved plat shall be excluded from the area used for calculation of tree density. Critical areas and associated buffers to be maintained by the development proposal shall be excluded from the area used for calculation of tree density, but supplemental plantings may occur in those areas. Trees otherwise required by the code are also excluded from the area used for calculation of tree density. 

E. Tree Density Calculation for Existing Trees.

1. Diameter at breast height (DBH) of the tree shall be measured in inches.

2. The tree credit value that corresponds with DBH values shall be found in Table 19.10.092-2. These credits shall be multiplied by one and one-half for existing native conifers (or other conifer species as approved by the director).

3. Retained red alder and cottonwood trees shall not count toward the tree density requirement.

4. Existing trees located in critical areas and those protected within the native growth protection area tract or easement to be established by the proposal shall not count toward the tree density requirement.

5. In calculating tree density credits, tree credits may be rounded up to the next whole number from a one-half or greater value.

Table 19.10.092-2 

Tree Density Credits for Existing Trees or Planted Trees  

	DBH	Tree Credits

	Planted 8' Conifer*, or 2" cal. Deciduous	1 

	4" – < 8"	1 

	8" – < 12"	2

	12" – < 24"	4

	24" or > 	6

	Exceptional Tree	1.5 x Tree Credit above

	*No arborvitae or similar

Example: An 8,000-square-foot lot would need 8 tree credits (8,000/43,560 = 0.183 x 43 = 7.8 or 8). The tree density on the lot could be retained by two existing 12-inch to 24-inch trees (less if a conifer is present) or by a combination of planting on the lot and within other areas if part of a development.

Example: A two-acre commercial site would need 44 tree credits (87,120 square feet/1,000 = 87.12 x .5 = 43.56 or 44). The tree density on the lot could be retained by a combination of four 24-inch or greater trees to equal 24 credits, plus five 12-inch to 24-inch trees equal 20 for a total of 44.

F. Supplemental Trees Planted to Meet Minimum Density Requirement. 

1. For sites with existing tree canopy, a minimum percentage of tree credits shall be from retained trees; the remainder may be from retained trees or supplemental plantings. In order to ensure that existing tree canopy is appropriately retained as new development activities occur, 50 percent of required tree density credits must be achieved through retention of existing trees.

2. For sites where existing (predevelopment) tree density is not sufficient to meet tree density minimums, retention of existing identified trees consistent with NBMC 19.10.093 shall be required and a top priority of the site design. Additional tree density credits shall be achieved through supplemental planting on site.

3. For sites where existing tree density is 25 percent or less of the required tree credits per 1,000 square feet the required supplemental trees can be reduced at the sole discretion of the director approval on a case by case basis.

4. The CED director may allow for removal of trees beyond these retention standards only when the applicant demonstrates that the proposed activity requiring additional removal of existing trees is the only reasonable alternative that will accomplish the applicant’s objectives, and only when supplemental trees are provided to meet tree density credit requirements. In such instances, the city may require additional on-site supplemental tree planting and/or a fee in lieu of additional supplemental tree planting to achieve higher tree density credit than the minimum required by Table 19.10.092-1.

5. Minimum Size and Tree Density Value for Supplemental Trees. The required minimum size of a supplemental tree worth one-half tree credit shall be eight feet tall for native or other conifers and two-inch caliper for deciduous or broad-leaf evergreen trees. The installation and maintenance shall be pursuant to Chapter 18.18 NBMC, Landscaping Regulations. (Ord. 1663 § 4, 2018).1


19.10.093 Development sites – Submittal requirements and priorities for tree retention.

A. For all development, a tree retention plan is required to be submitted with the initial land use application and/or clearing and grading permit application. The qualified professional arborist and surveyor shall work together to identify, tag, and survey the minimum number of trees to meet the tree unit credit threshold. The city shall be involved in the early planning stages to assist in as much tree preservation as possible. The tree retention report shall include the following: 

1. Site characterization of existing tree conditions. This characterization shall include: 

a. A qualitative description of site forest conditions (stand age, dominant species, condition); 

b. Identification of site areas with groves of trees; 

c. Identification and description of tree and forest conditions adjacent to any on-site critical areas and buffers; and

d. Description and rationale for the retention of trees used to meet the minimum tree unit credits.

2. Initial calculation of trees that meet the minimum tree credits required for the proposed development that must be achieved through tree retention, consistent with tree density requirements of Table 19.10.092-1. 

3. Proposed identification of areas for required tree retention, including rational and documentation of consistency with subsection D of this section, Tree Priority for Retention/Site Design. 

4. Tree survey. Included with the retention proposal that meets the tree unit credit minimum, a survey of existing site tree conditions shall be submitted that sets out the following: 

a. Engineered professional survey location point for the following trees: 

i. Every tree on the site that is used towards meeting the minimum density requirements;

ii. Any additional trees retained and protected on or near lots in relation to clearing and grading requirements;

iii. Trees located within the outer 15 feet of on-site critical area buffers; and

iv. Off-site trees located on adjacent properties that have a critical root zone (CRZ) extending onto the property under application. Off-site trees shall not be counted toward the minimum tree unit credit. 

b. The above surveyed trees shall include tree ID number, size (DBH), species, location, and risk assessment.

c. Site map with tree ID number, species, diameter at four and one-half feet above grade for all trees proposed for retention, including any identified exceptional trees, and a tree assessment matrix with the description of each tree’s health and viability. Evaluation should include identification of trees that are not viable for retention, based on health, high risk of failure due to structure, defects, unavoidable isolation (windfirmness), or suitability of species, that are in areas that are not to be cleared by the proposed development but pose a risk to them. 

d. Location of limits of disturbance relative to the CRZ around all trees proposed for retention and any special instructions for work within that protection area (hand-digging, tunneling, root pruning, maximum grade change). Adjusting fence locations to allow site work within the CRZ must be approved by the applicant’s arborist and the community and economic development director, and must be consistent with all requirements of NBMC 19.10.095, Tree protection – Construction of developments.

5. Supplemental tree planting plan. Proposed location and species of supplemental trees to be planted when required meeting the TUC minimum standards and including planting and maintenance specifications. This may be provided on the site landscape plan, so long as supplemental trees are identified separately from general landscape trees. 

6. List of general tree protection guidelines that covers all potential impacts to retained trees, and methods and procedures for working around retained trees properly. Guidelines shall be consistent with all requirements of NBMC 19.10.095, Tree protection – Construction of developments.

7. Construction plan and schedule to include:

a. Preconstruction meeting with the applicant’s qualified professional arborist and the city to confirm retained trees, approve tree protection fence location, and agree on a monitoring schedule for contract compliance based on work near retained trees;

b. Requirements and methods of reporting to the city when significant work is required within the inner critical root zone (ICRZ) of any retained tree;

c. Confirmation that the tree protection fences remain in place throughout the project; and

d. Postconstruction meeting to confirm all trees have been retained, protected and planted per plan. Confirm postconstruction requirements for tree maintenance if needed. 

B. The applicant shall be responsible for all costs associated with city review pursuant to the current taxes, rates, and fees schedule for tree plans and for the costs related to qualified professional arborist field visits, plan development, and plan review. 

C. Trees proposed for retention shall be tagged and numbered for field verification at time of application submittal.

D. Tree Priority for Retention/Site Design. The site plan shall take into account retained trees and be designed in accordance with the following guidelines: 

1. The incorporation of trees as a site amenity with a strong emphasis on tree protection. Forested sites should retain their forested look, value, and function after development, to the extent possible. 

2. Trees should be protected within vegetated islands and stands rather than as individual, isolated trees scattered throughout the site. The city may refuse to consider individual, isolated trees as candidates for retention. 

3. Trees to be retained must be healthy and windfirm as identified by a qualified professional arborist. In designing a development project, the applicant shall prepare the required tree retention plan with consideration of the following retention priorities. Priorities are not provided in an order of preference; successful tree retention shall meet as many of these priorities as are feasible, based on site conditions: 

a. Tree groves and associated vegetation that are adjacent to areas that are proposed to be set aside as native growth protection areas (critical areas and protected buffers), such that retained trees provide additional habitat, hydrologic, water quality, and land stability functions; 

b. Trees that will be located within a fish and wildlife habitat corridor, as established by the development proposal consistent with the North Bend comprehensive plan and critical area regulations;

c. Trees that are a part of a grove that extends into adjacent property, such as in a public park, open space, critical area buffer or otherwise preserved group of trees on adjacent private property. If trees must be removed in these situations, an adequate buffer of smaller trees may be required to be retained or planted on the edge of the remaining grove to help stabilize, maintain and protect the grove; and

d. Trees located in the site perimeter, especially when they provide a screening function between different land uses. 

4. Building footprints, parking areas, roadways, utility corridors and other structures should be designed and located with consideration of tree protection opportunities. 

5. The grading plan should be developed to accommodate existing trees and avoid alteration to grades around existing trees to be retained as part of a tree retention plan. 

6. Required open space and recreational space are located and designed to protect existing stands of trees. 

7. The CED director must approve any site plan proposal to remove an identified exceptional tree. Removal of an exceptional tree shall only be allowed as a last measure.

E. Protection of Exceptional Trees.

1. The following regulations shall apply to the protection and limited allowances for removal of exceptional trees, whether occurring as part of a development proposal or not. Removal of exceptional trees shall not be allowed, except in the following circumstances:

a. Where consistent with exemptions for hazard, dead, or dying trees and for emergency tree removal consistent with this chapter.

b. Where necessary for public roads and bridges within existing public rights-of-way and other essential public facilities.

c. Where necessary for access to development sites provided there are no feasible alternative alignments. Alternative access shall be pursued to the maximum extent feasible.

d. For all other proposed impacts to exceptional trees: where proposed, it is presumed that an alternative development proposal exists; activities and uses shall be prohibited unless the applicant can demonstrate that all on-site alternative designs that would avoid or result in less impacts to the exceptional trees, such as a reduction in the size, scope, configuration or density of the project, are not feasible. (Ord. 1663 § 5, 2018).2


19.10.094 Priorities for location of supplemental trees.

A. Supplemental Tree Location. In designing a development to meet the required minimum tree density, the site design and landscape plan shall be consistent with Chapter 18.18 NBMC. Supplemental trees shall be planted in the following order of priority: 

1. On Site. The preferred locations for new trees are (in order of priority):

a. Adjacent to critical areas and associated buffers that are being designated as an NGPA tract or easement (required for wetlands, stream, and landslide hazard areas);

b. Within required common open spaces and recreation spaces as established by the approved site plan;

c. Adjacent to stormwater facilities as approved by public works; 

d. Within other site common areas within the approved site plan;

e. Within site perimeter areas where contiguous with off-site existing forests; and 

f. Up to 50 percent of the required minimum tree density as street trees and/or required perimeter landscape trees required in Chapter 18.18 NBMC may count as supplemental trees with sole approval by the CED director as determined on a case by case basis.

2. Off-Site Tree Replacement with Replacement Costs (Material Plus Labor) at the Applicant’s Expense. 

a. Allowable sites for receiving off-site replacement plantings are city-owned properties or private open space which is permanently protected and maintained, such as an NGPA, park properties, street rights-of-way, and other properties as determined appropriate by the CED director. 

b. All trees to be replaced off site shall meet the replacement standards of this chapter. 

3. It is the city’s intent to preserve and replace trees on site, and only in rare cases and as a last resort a fee in lieu of tree replacement may be allowed, subject to approval by the CED director. The amount of fee in lieu required per tree unit credit is adopted in the city’s taxes, rates and fees schedule. 

a. The amount of the fee shall cover the cost of a tree, installation (labor and equipment including staking, mulching), maintenance (including watering, warranty, and monitoring) for five years, and fund administration. Such costs shall be determined by the city as adopted in the taxes, rates and fees schedule. 

b. The fee shall be paid to the city prior to final site plan or final plat approval, or the issuance of a tree removal permit or letter, whichever applies. (Ord. 1663 § 6, 2018).3


19.10.095 Tree protection – Construction of developments.

A. To ensure long-term viability of trees and tree stands identified for protection permit plans and construction activities shall comply with the following tree retention requirements:

1. All minimum required tree protection measures shall be shown on the tree retention plan and the site grading plan. Project site plans shall include a summary of the project-specific tree protection measures;

2. Tree protection barriers shall be installed along the outer edge and completely surround the critical root zone of trees to be protected prior to any land disturbance and shall remain until the CED director authorizes tree protection barrier removal; 

3. Tree protection barriers shall be a minimum of six feet high constructed of chain link or similar material, subject to approval by the CED director. “Tree protection area” signs shall be posted visibly on all sides of the fenced areas no greater than 50 feet apart. On large project sites, the CED director may also require that signs requesting subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards be posted at site entrances. Signs shall be a minimum of three feet by three feet in size with three-inch lettering;

4. Where tree protection areas are remote from areas of land disturbance, and where approved by the CED director, alternative forms of tree protection may be used in lieu of tree protection barriers; provided, that protected trees are completely surrounded with continuous flagging and are accompanied by “tree protection area” signs; and

5. Native understory trees, shrubs and other vegetation shall be protected within the designated tree protection area.

B. Construction Planning and Activities within the Critical Root Zone of Retained Trees.

1. To ensure that structures, utilities, and roadways are located an adequate distance from a protected tree and to allow adequate room for construction activities, the limits of construction clearing and grading shall generally be located no closer than the critical root zone of all protected trees. Work within that area shall be reviewed and approved by a qualified professional arborist and the CED director. The city may require third party review by a qualified professional arborist representing the city.

2. Except for structures proposed as a raised deck, bay window, or cantilevered or otherwise raised above the ground’s surface so as not to disrupt the tree’s roots, no structures shall be allowed within the interior critical root zone (ICRZ) without approval by a professional qualified arborist. 

3. Sidewalks and utilities may be located within the critical root zone of a protected tree; provided, that construction methods and materials used will result in minimal disruption of the tree’s roots, and that additional measures for tree protection are proposed and approved which will ensure the long-term viability of the tree. 

4. Grade within Critical Root Zone. The grade shall not be elevated or reduced within the critical root zone of trees to be preserved without the CED director’s authorization based on recommendations from a qualified professional arborist.

5. In limited instances based on site constraints, the CED director may allow construction limits or an alteration of grades within the critical root zone; provided, that the applicant submits an evaluation by an arborist which demonstrates that the proposed construction will not reduce the long-term viability of the tree. Generally, limited disturbance may be allowed inside the perimeter critical root zone, up to the inner critical root zone (ICRZ). 

6. All construction activities, including, but not limited to, staging any materials, operating or parking equipment, or dumping concrete washout or other chemicals, shall be prohibited within the critical root zone of protected trees. During construction, no person shall attach any object to any tree designated for protection.

7. In addition to this subsection B, the CED director may require the following:

a. An evaluation by an arborist to determine if protective measures should be required beyond the critical root zone. 

b. If equipment is authorized to operate within a tree protection area, the soil and critical root zone of a tree must be covered with mulch to a depth of at least 12 inches or with plywood, steel plates or similar material in order to protect roots and soil from potential damage caused by heavy equipment.

c. To minimize root damage wherever development is proposed and allowed within the critical root zone, hand or pneumatic tool excavation may be required to expose roots and cleanly sever the roots of trees to be retained. Never rip or shred roots with heavy equipment. 

8. Preventative Measures. In addition to the above minimum tree protection measures, the applicant shall support tree protection efforts by employing, as appropriate, the following preventative measures, consistent with best management practices for maintaining the health of the trees: 

a. Pruning of visible deadwood for health and safety on trees to be protected or transplanted; 

b. Application of fertilizer to enhance the vigor of stressed trees; 

c. Use of soil amendments and soil aeration in tree protection and planting areas; 

d. Mulching over tree critical root zone areas; 

e. Ensuring proper water availability during and immediately after construction; and

f. Selective thinning. 

C. Upon completion of construction activities, a qualified professional arborist hired by the applicant shall be required to inspect all trees remaining on a site and provide a written report as to the status of such trees. Any protected tree found to be irreparably damaged, severely stressed or dying shall be replaced at a three tree to one tree ratio. The enforcement standards of NBMC 19.10.140 may also apply at the CED director’s discretion. The CED director will take into account the reasons for the damaged trees in determining if the fine set out in NBMC 19.10.140 applies. 

D. Alternative Methods. The director may approve the use of alternative tree protection techniques if a protected tree will be protected to an equal or greater degree than through the techniques listed above. 

E. Designation of Protected Trees. 

1. The tree plan and any application and permit plans that cover such areas shall show all trees designated for protection/retention. These areas may be shown by labeling them as “protected trees” or “native growth protection areas” or such other designation as may be approved by the CED director. Protected vegetation, including protected trees, shall not be modified, harmed or removed except as provided in this chapter. 

2. The CED director may require that protected trees be permanently preserved within a tract, easement or other permanent protective mechanism. When required, the location, purpose, and limitation of these protected areas shall be shown on the face of the deed, plat, site plan, or similar document and shall be recorded with the King County Department of Records and Elections. The recorded document shall include the requirement that the protected areas shall not be removed, amended or modified without the written approval of the city of North Bend.

F. Modification to Tree Retention Requirements. A modification to retention requirements may be granted at the discretion of the CED director based on the applicant’s ability to demonstrate the following:

1. Application of the requirements of this chapter will deny all reasonable economic use of the property; and

2. There is no other reasonable economic use with less impact; and

3. The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to the public health, safety, or welfare, on or off the proposed site, and is consistent with the general purposes of this chapter; and

4. The alteration proposed is the minimum necessary to allow for reasonable economic use of the property.

The CED director shall grant an exception from the requirements of this chapter only to the minimum necessary extent to allow for reasonable economic use of the property. The CED director shall consider conditioning any exception from the requirements of this chapter upon compliance with any mitigation plan approved by the city or upon other conditions, such as a fee in lieu.

G. Additional Tree Protection. The CED director may approve an administrative adjustment of standards for bulk and dimensional relief per Chapter 18.25 NBMC in order to retain existing viable tree(s). (Ord. 1663 § 7, 2018).4


19.10.100 Conditions.

In granting any clearing and grading permit, the city engineer may attach conditions reasonably necessary to prevent erosion and sedimentation. The CED director may attach such conditions as are reasonably necessary to preserve and protect trees and vegetation pursuant to the standards set forth in this chapter. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to, installing walls, swales, drains, retention facilities, or other structures; planting appropriate vegetation; installing erosion and sediment control measures or devices; furnishing necessary letters of permission and/or easements; and specifying method of performing the work; requiring native vegetation protection areas and buffers, revegetation of disturbed areas, and enhancement of existing vegetated areas. Such items must be identified on the approved grading, erosion, and sediment control or other required plans. In addition, the following shall be conditions of all permits:

A. Notify the city 48 hours before commencing any land-disturbing activity;

B. Notify the city of completion of any control measures within 48 hours after their completion;

C. Obtain permission in writing from the city prior to modifying any of the plans;

D. Install all control measures as identified in the approved plans;

E. Maintain all road drainage systems, stormwater drainage systems, control measures, and other facilities identified in the plans;

F. Repair siltation or erosion damage to adjoining surfaces and drainage ways resulting from land developing or disturbing activities;

G. Inspect the erosion control construction measures at least once each week during construction after each rain of one-half-inch or more (over a 24-hour period), and immediately make any needed repairs;

H. Allow the city to enter the site for the purpose of inspecting compliance with the plans or for performing any work necessary to bring the site into compliance with the plans;

I. Keep an up-to-date, approved copy of the plans on the site; and

J. Ensure that all workmanship and materials are in accordance with city standards and the most recent edition of the Washington State Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction. (Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 12, 1993).


19.10.110 Maintenance responsibilities.

A. A maintenance schedule for constructed private facilities shall be developed and measures implemented pursuant to this chapter, and for landscaping maintenance pursuant to Chapter 18.18 NBMC. The schedule shall set forth the maintenance to be completed, the time period for completion, and who shall perform the maintenance. The schedule shall be included with all required plans and permits and shall be recorded by the property owner or agent with the county auditor so that maintenance responsibilities attach to the property and shall be the duty of the property owner(s). The city engineer or CED director may require a maintenance bond for the same length and under the same conditions as required for landscaping under the landscape code.

B. The responsible party (homeowners’ association or individual property owner) shall contract with a qualified professional for ongoing tree care including trees located in NGPE, open spaces, critical areas and public rights-of-way. All proposed work including but not limited to tree removal, pruning, and planting shall be submitted to the city arborist for approval. The submitted information shall reference the tree plan and confirm the retention and maintenance requirements. Best management practices performed by the qualified professional arborist are required. (Ord. 1663 § 8, 2018: Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 13, 1993).


19.10.120 Permit issuance – Expiration – Extension.

A. Clearing and grading is a development activity subject to the conditions of Chapters 20.01 through 20.06 and 20.09 NBMC. A clearing and grading permit shall be issued only after compliance with the requirements of this chapter and the deposit with the city finance director of permit fees for plan review, inspection, and related expenses as required in NBMC 19.10.130.

B. Any permit granted under this chapter shall expire one year from the date of issuance; provided, however, that the city engineer may set specific limits to the permit if it is advisable to do so. Upon a showing of good cause, a permit may be extended for up to one year upon such conditions as are necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter. (Ord. 1505 § 2 (part), 2013; Ord. 1426 § 4 (part), 2011; Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 1203 § 1 (part), 2003; Ord. 932 § 14, 1993).


19.10.130 Permit fees.

The applicant shall pay costs associated with a clearing and grading permit as set forth in Chapter 20.09 NBMC. For significant tree removal, a fee in lieu may be provided to the city if the applicant chooses not to replace the significant tree(s) on site. The applicant shall pay costs associated with the replacement of said trees and the clearing and grading permit as set forth in Chapter 20.09 NBMC. (Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 1237 § 17 (part), 2005: Ord. 932 § 15, 1993).


19.10.135 Urban growth area.

Areas within the urban growth area established pursuant to the Growth Management Act are anticipated to be developed within the next 10- to 20-year period. Because conversion of current timbered properties within the urban growth area can reasonably be expected, significant land clearing of such area needs to take place at the time of a valid land use application to properly coordinate preservation of trees within open spaces and buffers with actual development plans. To further the purposes of this chapter, timber harvesting and conversion of wooded lands within the urban growth area shall not be permitted until such time as a valid land use application for development is approved. Requests may be made for maintenance and thinning of existing timber stands to promote the overall health and growth of the stand until said stand is converted and harvested pursuant to plans provided within an approved, valid land use permit. Such request shall be reviewed by the city engineer and the CED director. Conditions shall ensure that proposed action shall improve the health and growth of the stand and preserve long-term alternatives for preservation of trees and meeting the goals of this chapter. (Ord. 1365 § 1, 2009: Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 16, 1993).


19.10.140 Construction and development – Development requirements for security and enforcement.

A. The city engineer or CED director may require the applicant to furnish security in the form of a bond, cash escrow account, an irrevocable letter of credit, or other security which may be acceptable to the city at its sole discretion, in an amount determined by the city engineer or CED director to be sufficient to reimburse the city if it should become necessary for the city to enter the property to correct hazardous conditions relating to soil stability, erosion, or environmental damage caused by failure to complete the work or improper action.

B. Trees designated for protection including mitigation plantings shall be mapped and bonded to be protected and retained through construction. Any of these trees that are removed after this designation through the approved development phase, other than being hazardous, shall be bonded. The bond shall be based on the appraised landscape value, applied by the city arborist, using the latest edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” but in no case shall be less than $2,500 per tree. 

C. Enforcement for Retained Trees and Supplemental Trees on New Development Sites.

1. Trees that are shown on a plan as to be retained as part of the minimum tree density requirement shall not be damaged and/or removed during, or as a result of, construction. If such trees are damaged and/or removed, the applicant shall be responsible for paying a fee based on the appraised landscape value, applied by the city arborist, using the latest edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” but in no case shall it be less than $2,500 per tree, and shall meet other mitigation requirements per NBMC 19.10.092.

2. Trees that are shown on a plan as to be retained as part of the minimum tree density requirement shall be retained, unless such trees become hazardous, or as set out in NBMC 19.10.095(F), Modification to Tree Retention Requirements. If such trees are removed during the approved development phase without a permit and/or approval of the city, the property owner and/or the person performing the activity shall be responsible for paying a fee based on the appraised landscape value, applied by the city arborist, using the latest edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” but in no case shall it be less than $2,500 per tree, and shall meet other mitigation requirements per NBMC 19.10.092.

3. Trees that are saved in excess of those required to meet the minimum tree density shall not be subject to this section; however, they shall be protected consistent with NBMC 19.10.095, Tree protection – Construction of developments. 

D. Enforcement for Existing Developed Lots and Existing Developed Public Rights-of-Way.

1. The city shall encourage compliance with requirements for tree removal from existing developed lots and existing public rights-of-way through education and outreach, and by providing clear direction and standard forms for tree removal notifications.

2. Upon determination that there has been a violation of this chapter including, but not limited to: tree removal or tree topping, tree removal on another property not owned by the individual responsible for the removal, and/or removal not associated with development activity or approved permit, the property owner and/or person performing the activity may be responsible for paying a fee based on the appraised landscape value, applied by the city arborist, using the latest edition of the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” but in no case shall it be less than $2,500 per tree, and shall meet other mitigation requirements per NBMC 19.10.092.

E. The city may pursue code enforcement and penalties consistent with Chapter 1.20 NBMC. Liability for violations of this chapter shall be the joint and severable responsibility of both the property owner and any person performing activity.

F. Appeals of Tree Permit, Fine, or Other Decisions under This Chapter.

1. Appeals of initial decisions may be made to the CED director. Any person wishing to appeal an initial decision on a tree permit, fine, or other decision under this chapter shall put such appeal in writing, clearly stating the reasons such appeal should be granted. This appeal must be presented to the CED director within 14 days of the issuance of the tree permit decision, fine, or other decision appealed under this chapter. The CED director shall reduce their decision on such appeal in writing and provide it to the person requesting the appeal.

2. Appeals of director determinations may be made to the city hearing examiner. Any person wishing to appeal the CED director’s determination shall appeal in writing within 14 days of the decision on the permit, issuance of the fine, or other decision under this chapter. The appeal shall be in writing and shall clearly state the reason such appeal should be granted. Such appeal shall be processed by the city’s hearing examiner pursuant to Chapter 2.20 NBMC. (Ord. 1663 § 9, 2018: Ord. 1360 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009; Ord. 932 § 17, 1993).


19.10.150 Insurance.

If, in the opinion of the city engineer or CED director, the nature of the work is such that it may create a hazard to human life or endanger streams, wetlands and/or their buffers, or public or private property, then the city engineer or CED director may, before issuing the permit, require that the applicant file a certificate of insurance. The certificate must provide to the city satisfactory proof of the existence of a comprehensive liability insurance policy, in an amount and form determined necessary by the city engineer or the city attorney, but in no event providing coverage of less than $1,000,000 for personal injury to any one person, $3,000,000 for injury to more than one person arising out of the same incident, and $250,000 for property damage, against claims arising pursuant to permits issued under this chapter, whether the performance be by the applicant, a subcontractor of the applicant, or any person directly or indirectly employed by the applicant. Additional amounts of insurance may be required by the city engineer in accordance with the nature of the risks involved.

2. If the applicant fails to submit necessary information within the 90-calendar-day period, the application shall lapse.

3. In those situations where the application has lapsed because the applicant has failed to submit the necessary information within the 90-day time period, the applicant may request a refund of the application fee(s) not related to the city’s determination of completeness.

4. An applicant may submit a written request to extend the 90-calendar-day period for up to an additional 90 calendar days; provided, that such request is received by the director of community services prior to the expiration of the original 90-calendar-day period. The director may grant such extension upon showing that circumstances beyond the reasonable control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken.

E. City’s Failure to Provide Determination of Completeness. A development permit application shall be deemed complete under this section if the city does not provide a written determination of incompleteness to the applicant as provided in subsection A of this section.

Chapter 20.04 DETERMINATION OF CONSISTENCY

Sections:

20.04.001    Determination of consistency with development regulations and comprehensive plan.

20.04.002    Initial SEPA analysis.


20.04.001 Determination of consistency with development regulations and comprehensive plan.

A. Consistency. Upon receipt of a devel­opment application, the department of com­munity services shall make a determination of consistency. Specifically, the department shall evaluate and document, in a staff report, the consistency of the development project with subsections (A)(1) through (4) of this section, as defined in the development regulations and the comprehensive plan or elements thereof.

1. The type of land uses permitted at the site, including uses that may be allowed under certain circumstances, and if the criteria for their approval have been satisfied;

2. The level of allowed development, such as units per acre; density of residential development in urban growth areas, or other measures of density;

3. Whether available and adequate infrastructure, as identified in the comprehen­sive plan and/or development regulations, is available, or planned to be available, including necessary funding, to serve the development; and

4. The character of the proposed devel­opment, including but not limited to applicable design review standards.

B. Interpretation of Development Regula­tions. Upon written request or as determined necessary, the director of community services shall interpret the meaning or application of land use codes affected by this title, and shall issue a written administrative interpretation within thirty (30) calendar days of such request or need.

C. Effect. During development project review, consistency determinations made in relation to subsections (A)(1) through (4) shall be controlling. The city or any subsequent reviewing body shall seek guidance from the development regulations and comprehensive plan, or elements thereof, in evaluating these consistency factors. Code interpretation mat­ters can and shall be made in reviewing devel­opment projects, however, subsections (A)(1) through (4) are to represent the fundamental basis for a determination of consistency.

D. Procedure. Nothing in this section requires documentation, dictates the city’s procedure for considering consistency, or lim­its the city from asking more specific or related questions with respect to any of the four items listed under subsection (A). (Ord. 989 § 1 (part), 1996).


20.04.002 Initial SEPA analysis.

A. The community services department shall also review nonexempt development per­mit(s) under the requirements of the State Environmental Policy Act (“SEPA”), Chapter 43.21C RCW; the SEPA Rules, Chapter 197-11 WAC; and the city’s environmental policy ordinance as codified in Chapter 14.04 of this code. The city shall provide prompt, integrated, and coordinated review between the compre­hensive plan, development regulations, and SEPA regulations. Specifically, the depart­ment shall:

1. Determine whether its comprehen­sive plan, elements thereof, and/or develop­ment regulations require studies or reports that adequately analyze all of the development’s probable adverse environmental impacts;

2. Determine whether its comprehen­sive plan, elements thereof, and/or develop­ment regulations require measures that ade­quately address such environmental impacts.

B. The city’s comprehensive plan, includ­ing elements thereof, and its development reg­ulations provide adequate analysis of, and mitigation for, adverse environmental impacts of a development when:

1. The impacts have been avoided or otherwise mitigated; or

2. The city has designated as accept­able certain levels of service, land use designa­tions, development standards, or other land use standards, including but not limited to those in Section 20.04.001(A)(1) through (4) that would result from the development proposal.

C. If the city determines that requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures are adequately addressed in its comprehensive plan and/or development regulations, it shall not impose additional mit­igation measures. Project review and SEPA mitigation shall be used to identify specific development design and conditions relating to the character of development, such as the details of site plans, curb cuts, drainage swales, the payment of impact fees, or other measures to mitigate a project’s adverse environmental impacts.

D. If the city determines that requirements for environmental analysis, protection, and mitigation measures are not adequately addressed in its comprehensive plan and/or development regulations, it may condition a project on applicable county, regional, state, or federal plans and/or land use and environmen­tal regulations. In such instance, the city shall consult orally and/or in writing with the respective county, regional, state, or federal agency, and defer to their respective expertise.

E. Nothing in this section limits the authority of the city to condition and/or deny a nonexempt development project based on other applicable city policies, ordinances, res­olutions, rules, or regulations not identified in Section 20.04.002(1) or (2), per authority of RCW 43.21C.060 and Section 14.04.330 of this code.

4. Any building permit issued to development that is vested to receive a building permit.

B. In order to monitor the cumulative effect of exemptions from the concurrency test on the capacity of public facilities, the city shall enter in its records the impacts of exempt development permits on public facilities in the same manner as though a concurrency test had been performed for the exempt development permits. (Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).


20.12.050 Concurrency test.

A. The city shall perform a concurrency test for each application for a certificate of concurrency, except as provided in NBMC 20.12.040. For each applicant requiring concurrency per NBMC 20.12.030, the city will not process applications for a certificate of concurrency until such time as the potential applicant has applied for an underlying development permit (if applicable) and the city is in receipt of all information necessary to perform the relevant concurrency analysis. Should an applicant who has previously applied for concurrency fail to apply for an underlying development permit within 90 days of submittal of the concurrency application, the concurrency application will become void and the applicant will need to submit a new application for concurrency after those 90 days. The public works director, or his/her designee, shall determine which of the following methods shall be used to conduct the concurrency test for each type of public facility:

1. If capacity has been established for the year then the public works director shall use the annual certification to determine that the capacity of public facilities is sufficient to maintain the city’s level of service standard for development that is estimated to occur during the following year; or

2. Case-by-case review of the application compared to the capacity of the public facility. 

B. The city may enter into an agreement with each public or private entity that provides public facilities in the city to establish the responsibilities of the city and the provider of public facilities in providing data for, or conducting, a concurrency test. 

C. If the capacity of available public facilities is equal to or greater than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact of the development, the concurrency test is passed, and the applicant shall receive a certificate of concurrency. If the level of service standard is determined by means other than the capacity of public facilities, the concurrency test is passed if the impact of the development will not cause the level of service to decline below the standard set forth in NBMC 20.12.060.

D. In conducting the concurrency test, the city shall determine that public facilities that are needed to achieve the level of service standards are available if: 

1. The public facilities have already been constructed; or

2. The public facilities are included in the capital facilities plan element of the city’s comprehensive plan (or comparable plan adopted by the governing board of other providers of public facilities) and planned to be constructed on or before the impact of development occurs as determined by NBMC 20.12.060(C); and

3. The public facilities needed to achieve the level of service standard and planned for construction are underwritten by one or more of the following financial commitments specific to the additional public facility: 

a. Grants from federal, state or private sources if the grant has been awarded for specific projects;

b. Appropriations in state biennial budget for specific projects;

c. Revenues that can be imposed or expended at the discretion of the city of North Bend, including, but not limited to, impact fees, general facilities charges, SEPA mitigation payments, property taxes, real estate excise taxes, user fees, charges, intergovernmental entitlements, and bonds;

d. Revenue from special assessment districts created by the city;

e. Irrevocable commitments from developers in a form acceptable to the city: 

i. Performance or surety bonds from Washington financial institutions;

ii. Letters of credit from Washington financial institutions; or

iii. Assignments of assets in Washington (i.e., interests in real property, savings certificates, bank accounts, or negotiable securities); 

f. Payments by special districts, including sewer, water, and schools, if such payments are similar in character and reliability to those listed in subsections (D)(3)(a) through (e) of this section; and 

4. If the financial commitments that underwrite the planned public facilities include impact fees, the applicant has paid all impact fees when due under the applicable provisions of the North Bend Municipal Code and the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance for the proposed development. 

E. If the capacity of available public facilities is less than the capacity required to maintain the level of service standard for the impact of the development, or the impact of the development will cause the level of service to decline below the standard set forth in NBMC 20.12.060, the concurrency test is not passed, and the applicant may select one of the following options: 

1. Accept a 90-day encumbrance of public facilities that are available, and within the same 90-day period amend the application to reduce the need for public facilities to not exceed the capacity that is available, or arrange to provide for public facilities that are not otherwise available; or

2. Reapply for a certificate of concurrency following the denial of an application for a certificate of concurrency; or

3. Appeal the denial of the application for a certificate of concurrency, pursuant to the provisions of NBMC 20.12.090. 

F. The city shall conduct the concurrency test first for the earliest complete concurrency application received. The city will issue concurrency simultaneously for all facilities for which concurrency is required and for which the city issues concurrency. The city will not issue separate concurrency certifications for separate facilities (i.e., water, sewer, transportation, etc.). A complete concurrency application shall consist of the completed concurrency application form and supporting information as submitted for the transportation and utilities elements of the SEPA checklist. If a checklist is not required for the proposal, the supporting information shall consist of relevant transportation and utilities information as would be submitted if a SEPA checklist were required. Subsequent applications will be tested in the same order as the city receives applications and determines them complete. A complete application ready for final disposition may move ahead of another complete application that preceded it if:

1. The later application has been in line at least 180 calendar days; and

2. The earlier applicant has received notice by the city to complete the process within 14 calendar days or lose his/her place in line.

G. The city shall set aside nine percent of the capacity of public facilities that is available as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section, and nine percent of any future increases of system capacity of public facilities. Of those nine percentage points of set-aside capacity, six percentage points shall be reserved for commercial development. Of those six percentage points, two percentage points shall be reserved for commercial development in the downtown commercial zone of the city. Two percentage points of the initial nine percentage points of set-aside capacity shall be reserved for special projects determined to be a public benefit by the city council and may only be utilized pursuant to a development agreement. The final one percentage point of the initial nine percentage points of set-aside capacity shall be reserved for single-family residential (non-subdivision, non-short plat) housing projects of only one residence or projects which meet the definition of a small project. The city shall determine which single-family residential housing projects are eligible for the set-aside program taking into account the following criteria: 

1. The small project is not owned by the same person or organization, or a related individual or organization, as any other small project;

2. The small project is not part of a development permit application for any other small project, or any project that is not a small project;

3. Other criteria that the city determines to be reasonable and equitable in preventing abuse of the small project set-aside program. 

Should any vested residential development fail to proceed to construction prior to the expiration of any vested rights provided for by state statute or the North Bend Municipal Code, the public facilities capacity associated with that development shall be added pro rata to the aforementioned percentages set aside.

H. The city shall condition all development permits requiring one or more public facilities provided by entities other than the city on the availability of the public facilities to be provided by those other entities. The city may enter into an agreement with each public or private entity that provides public facilities in the city to establish the responsibilities of the city and the provider of public facilities in providing data for, or conducting, a concurrency test. 

I. A concurrency test, and any resulting certificate of concurrency, shall be administrative actions of the city that are categorically exempt from the State Environmental Policy Act. (Ord. 1683 § 2, 2019: Ord. 1667 § 2, 2018: Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).


20.12.060 Level of service standards.

A. In conducting the concurrency test, the city shall use the following level of service standards for public facilities:

1. Roads and streets (city of North Bend): level of service “D.”

2. Sewer.

a. Waste Water Treatment Plant. Monthly maximum carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (five-day) of influent in pounds/day; 

b. Pump Station. Criteria for Sewage Works Design, Washington State Department of Ecology, 1992; 

c. Conveyance. Criteria for Sewage Works Design, Washington State Department of Ecology, 1992.

3. Water.

a. Water Supply. Water rights certificates and/or permits issued by Washington State Department of Ecology;

b. Conveyance. Group A Public Water System Waterworks Standards, Washington State Department of Health, 1999, and Recommended Standards for Water Works, 1992 (“Ten State Standards”);

c. Storage. Waterworks Standards, Washington State Department of Health, 1996.

4. Stormwater.

a. Surface Water Design Manual, King County, Washington, except that off-site system capacity shall be analyzed and sized for conveying the 25-year peak flow runoff from contributing areas for the quarter-mile downstream reach from the developing site. 

B. In conducting the concurrency test, the city shall apply the level of service standards for each public facility according to the following geographical areas: 

1. Citywide: 

a. Sewage treatment;

b. Water supply; and

c. Roads and streets.

2. Service areas to be determined by the city on a case-by-case basis based on the characteristics of the proposed development and its impact on the following: 

a. Sewer conveyance;

b. Stormwater basins; and

c. Water conveyance. 

C. In conducting the concurrency test, the city shall find that the impact of development occurs, and therefore the level of service standards for each public facility shall be achieved and maintained, no later than the following time periods: 

1. At the time of occupancy and use of the development: 

a. Sewer;

b. Stormwater; and

c. Water. 

2. Within six years of occupancy and use of the development, or each phase of a development:

a. Roads and streets. 

D. In the event that a water, sewer, or storm public facility provided by the applicant is not completed in accordance with the time limits in subsection C of this section, the development cannot be occupied or used. If other facilities to be provided by the city or other public service provider are not complete, the development can be occupied and used. (Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).


20.12.070 Certificate of concurrency.

A. A certificate of concurrency shall be issued by the public works director or his/her designee, no later than the issuance of the permit for the underlying development action.

B. Upon issuance of a certificate of concurrency, the city shall reserve capacity on behalf of the applicant, and indicate the reservation on the certificate of concurrency. 

C. A certificate of concurrency issued for a project with an underlying development permit shall be valid for the same period of time as the development permit with which it was issued. A certificate of concurrency shall not be issued in the absence of an underlying development permit application. Concurrency certificates shall expire one year in time from the date of issuance unless extended by approval of an active underlying development permit prior to the end of the one-year period of validity. If the underlying development permit expires, the related concurrency certificate shall become void. In the event the underlying development permit is denied, the concurrency certificate shall become null and void.

D. A certificate of concurrency may not be extended according to the same terms and conditions as the underlying development permit. If a development permit is granted an extension, the applicant shall submit a new application for a concurrency test and certificate under this chapter. Certificates of concurrency shall not be extended beyond the expiration of the underlying development permit, or any extensions thereof. 

E. A certificate of concurrency is valid only for the uses and intensities authorized for the development permit with which it is issued. Any change in use or intensity that increases the impact of development on public facilities is subject to an additional concurrency test of the incremental increase in impact on public facilities. 

F. A certificate of concurrency is valid only for the development permit with which it is issued. 

G. A certificate of concurrency runs with the land, and cannot be transferred to a different parcel. A certificate of concurrency transfers automatically with ownership of the parcel for which the certificate was issued. Upon final subdivision of a parcel that has obtained a certificate of concurrency, the city shall replace the certificate of concurrency by issuing a separate certificate of concurrency to each subdivided parcel, assigning to each a pro rata portion of the public facility capacity or other measure that was reserved for the original certificate. 

H. A certificate of concurrency shall expire if the underlying development permit expires or is revoked or denied by the city and the certificate has not been extended to a subsequent development permit for the same parcel. 

I. A certificate of concurrency for water supply or sewage treatment, which has been issued to a property that is eligible to transfer development rights under the city of North Bend transfer of development rights (TDR) program, may transfer valid certificates for water supply or sewage treatment with the transferred property development rights, provided the transferred certificates for water supply or sewage treatment must be applied to a new development on the TDR receiving site within five years or returned to the city for refund or the certificates shall be void. (Ord. 1683 § 3, 2019: Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).


20.12.080 Fees.

A. The city shall charge each applicant a concurrency test fee in an amount to be established by ordinance by the city council. The concurrency test fee shall not be refundable. 

B. The city shall charge a processing fee to any individual that requests an informal analysis of capacity if the requested analysis requires substantially the same research as a concurrency test. The processing fee shall be nonrefundable and nonassignable to concurrency tests. The amount of the processing fee shall be the same as the concurrency test fee authorized by subsection A of this section. 

C. The applicant shall pay any impact fees, general facilities charges, and/or SEPA mitigation payments when required by the then-applicable provisions of the North Bend Municipal Code and the taxes, rates and fees schedule adopted by ordinance. (Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).


20.12.090 Appeals.

A. An applicant may appeal a denial of a certificate of concurrency on the following grounds: 

1. A technical or mathematical error;

2. The applicant provided alternative data that was rejected by the city; or 

3. Unwarranted delay in review of the application that allowed capacity to be given to another applicant. 

B. Appeal of denial of a certificate of concurrency shall be to the hearing examiner in accordance with procedures in Chapter 2.20 NBMC. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be final unless appealed to superior court within 21 days of the written notice of the hearing examiner’s decision in accordance with procedures in Chapter 20.06 NBMC. (Ord. 1352 § 1 Exh. A (part), 2009: Ord. 1331 § 1 (part), 2008: Ord. 1196 § 1 (part), 2003).
