The Board, after investigation, may refuse to hear any case in which it
appears that a juvenile was wrongfully referred in violation of this chapter
and the statute. In addition, the Board may refuse to hear any case in which
the juvenile refuses to supply the Board with requested information, fails
to appear when requested or refuses to cooperate with the proceedings of
the Board. The Board shall immediately notify the Chief of Police from the

reasonable cause to believe that the person so referred has committed
the offense alleged and whether such person shall be disciplined as a
result thereof. A further condition of referral is that the juvenile admits
to his/her involvement in the incident and waives his/her rights
pursuant to said statute. In making such determination, the Juvenile
Hearing Board shall not be bound by the customary rules of evidence,

such evidence would be admissible in a court of competent jurisdiction.

the person so charged and that such person should be disciplined, it
shall recommend sanctions (other than incarceration) and may direct
restitution, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
an attempt to provide, with cooperation of the Town Administrator or
the Superintendent of Schools, suitable service to the Towns of Foster

parents to agree to the sanctions imposed, and the amount of
restitution and manner of making the same. In ordering restitution, the

ability to pay, and the amount of actual damage caused as a result of the
commission of such offense.

exceed six months and may consist of, but not be limited to: community
service, reasonable restitution, direct work service for the victim,

1991 Code)]
§ 139-17. Mandatory altering of dogs and cats adopted from
releasing agency.
A. No releasing agency shall release, sell, trade, give away, exchange,
adopt out, or otherwise transfer, with or without a fee, any dog or cat
that has not been spayed or neutered unless the adopting party
executes a written agreement with the releasing agency to have the dog
or cat spayed or neutered within 30 days of the adoption date or within
30 days from the date that the dog or cat reaches sexual maturity, with
the cost of such spaying or neutering to be the responsibility of the
adopting party. The written agreement must include the dog's or cat's
age, sex, and general description; the date of adoption and the date by
which the dog or cat must be spayed or neutered; the adopting party's
name, address, phone number, and signature; the releasing agency's
name, address, phone number, and the dollar amount of the deposit
remitted. In addition to executing the written agreement the adopting
party must leave with the releasing agency a deposit as set from time to
time by the Town Council. The amount of the deposit shall be
determined by the releasing agency. Said deposit will be refunded by
the releasing agency to the adopting party upon presentation of a
written statement or receipt from a licensed veterinarian of the
adopting party's choice where the dog or cat was spayed or neutered,
provided that the spaying or neutering was performed within the thirtyday
period. Alternatively, the releasing agency shall make appropriate
arrangements for the spaying or neutering of the dog or cat by a
licensed veterinarian and have the surgery completed before releasing
the dog or cat to the adopting party.
B. Exceptions.
(1) The following are exemptions from the provisions of Subsection A:
(a) A releasing agency returns a stray dog or cat to its owner;
(b) A releasing agency receives a written report from a licensed
veterinarian stating that the life of the dog or cat would be
jeopardized by the surgery and that such health condition is
likely to be permanent;
(c) A releasing agency receives a written report from a licensed
veterinarian stating that there is a temporary health condition,
including sexual immaturity, which would make surgery life
threatening to the dog or cat or impracticable, in which
instance the releasing agency shall grant the adopting party an
appropriate extension of time in which to have the dog or cat
spayed or neutered based on the veterinarian's report.
§ 139-17 ANIMALS § 139-17
139:117
§ 139-18. Forfeited deposits.
Deposits required by § 139-17 which are unclaimed after 60 days from
the date of adoption or 60 days from when the dog or cat reaches sexual
maturity, whichever is later, will be forfeited by the adopting party and
retained by the releasing agency and shall be used for the following
purposes:
§ 139-19. Violations and penalties; disposition of fines.
(2) The exemptions provided in Subsection B(1)(b) and (c) above shall
only be applicable if the releasing agency receives said written
report from a licensed veterinarian within the thirty-day period
during which the spaying or neutering would otherwise be
required, or in the case of a report contemplated by Subsection
B(1)(b) above, said report may be provided to the releasing agency
during any temporary extension period provided by Subsection
B(1)(c) above if the health condition of the dog or cat has changed.
C. If requested to do so, a releasing agency shall refund deposited funds to
the adopting party upon reasonable proof being presented to the
releasing agency by the adopting party that the dog or cat died before
the expiration of the period during which the spaying or neutering was
required to be completed.
D. Any and all releasing agencies:
(1) May enter into cooperative agreements with each other and with
veterinarians in carrying out the provisions of this section; and
(2) Shall make a good faith effort to cause an adopting party to comply
with the provisions of this section.
A. A public education program to prevent overpopulation in dogs and cats;
B. A program to spay and neuter dogs and cats that are available for
adoption by the releasing agency;
C. A follow-up program to assure that dogs and cats adopted from the
releasing agency are spayed or neutered; and
D. To defray additional costs incurred by the releasing agency in
complying with § 139-17.
A. Violations by adopting party.
(1) Violations of the provisions of § 139-17 or the written agreement
executed pursuant thereto by an adopting party shall be punishable
as indicated in Chapter 1, General Provisions, Article II, Penalties.
Each and every incidence of noncompliance by an adopting party
which continues unremedied for 30 days after written notice of a
violation hereunder shall constitute a subsequent offense and the
attendant penalties will apply. Second and subsequent offenses
§ 139-17 GLOCESTER CODE § 139-19
139:118
may constitute grounds for seizure and forfeiture of the dog or cat,
which seizure will be conducted by the Animal Control Officer or
a police officer for the town in which the adopting party resides,
and the seized animal will be returned to the releasing agency from
which it was adopted, which releasing agency will be free to adopt
out or euthanize the seized dog or cat. The adopting party shall lose
all ownership rights in the seized dog or cat, shall forfeit all rights
to any fee or deposit paid for the dog or cat, and shall have no claim
against the releasing agency or any other person for any expenses
incurred by the adopting party for the dog's or cat's maintenance.12

Purpose; Applicability
§ 177-1. Purpose.
§ 177-2. Applicability.
This chapter shall be applicable to any situation involving any disturbances
to the terrain, topsoil or vegetative ground cover upon any property within
the Town of Glocester after determination of applicability by the Building
Official or his/her designee based upon criteria outlined in Article II, § 177-3

soil are eroding from certain areas that are undergoing development
for nonagricultural uses, such as housing developments, industrial
areas, recreational facilities and roads. This erosion makes necessary
costly repairs to gullies, washed out fills, roads, and embankments. The
resulting sediment clogs the storm sewers, road ditches, and muddies
streams, leaves deposits of silt in ponds and reservoirs and is
considered a major water pollutant.
B. The purpose of this chapter is to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation
from occurring as a result of nonagricultural development within the
Town of Glocester by requiring proper provisions for water disposal,
and the protection of soil surfaces during and after construction, in
order to promote safety, public health and general welfare of the Town.

Determinations of Applicability
§ 177-3. Determination of applicability required.
It shall be unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation,
grades, and contours of land in a manner which may increase the potential
for soil erosion, without first applying for a determination of applicability
from the Building Official or his/her designee. Upon determination of
applicability, the owner/applicant shall submit a soil erosion and sediment
control plan for approval by the Building Official or his/her designee, as
provided in Article III. The application for determination of applicability
shall describe the location, nature, character, and time schedule of the
proposed land disturbing activity in sufficient detail to allow the Building
Official or his/her designee to determine the potential for soil erosion
and sedimentation resulting from the proposed project. In determining
the applicability of this chapter to a particular land disturbing activity,
the Building Official or his/her designee shall consider site topography,
drainage patterns, soils, proximity to watercourses, and other such
information as deemed appropriate by the Building Official or his/her
designee. A particular land disturbing activity shall not be subject to the
requirements of this chapter if the Building Official or his/her designee finds
that erosion resulting from the land disturbing activity is insignificant and
represents no threat to adjacent properties or to the quality of any coastal
feature or watercourse, as defined herein. The current "Rhode Island Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook," US Department of Agriculture
Soil Conservation Service, RI Department of Environmental Management,
and RI State Conservation Committee shall be consulted in making this
determination.
§ 177-4. Exceptions.
No determination of applicability shall be required for the following:
A. This chapter shall not apply to existing quarrying operations actively
engaged in excavating rock, but shall apply to sand and gravel
extraction operations.
B. Construction, alteration or use of any additions to existing single-family
or duplex homes or related structures, provided the ground coverage of
such addition is less than 1,000 square feet, and such construction,
alteration and use does not occur within 100 feet of any watercourse or
coastal feature, and the slopes at the site of land disturbance do not
exceed 10%.
C. Use of a home garden in association with on-site residential use.
D. Accepted agricultural management practices such as seasonal tilling
and harvest activities associated with property utilized for private and/
or commercial agricultural or silvicultural purposes, notwithstanding
other applicable Town and state regulations.
§ 177-3 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL § 177-4
177:163
E. Excavations for improvements other than those described in Subsection
A above which exhibit all of the following characteristics:
(1) Do not result in a total displacement of more than 50 cubic yards of
material;
(2) Have no slopes steeper than 10 feet vertical and 100 feet horizontal
or approximately 10%; and
(3) Have all disturbed surface areas promptly and effectively protected
to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation.
F. Grading, as a maintenance measure, or for landscaping purposes on
existing developed land and parcels or lots, provided that all bare
surface is immediately seeded, sodded or otherwise protected from
erosive actions and all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The aggregate of the area(s) of such activity does not exceed 2,000
square feet; and
(2) The change of elevation does not exceed two feet at any point; and
(3) The grading does not involve a quantity of fill greater than 18 cubic
yards; except where fill is excavated from another portion of the
same parcel and the quantity does not exceed 50 cubic yards.
(4) Loggers return tracks to their original condition and to original
grade.
G. Grading, filling, removal, or excavation activities and operations
undertaken by the Town under the direction and supervision of the
Director of Public Works for work on streets, roads, and rights-of-way
dedicated to public use; provided, however, that adequate and
acceptable erosion and sediment controls are employed. Appropriate
controls shall apply during construction as well as after the completion
of such activities. All such work shall be undertaken in accordance with
the performance principals provided for in Article IV, § 177-12, and
standards and definitions as may be adopted to implement said
performance principles.

ARTICLE V
Enforcement
§ 177-14. Bond or other security required.
A. Before approving an erosion sediment control plan, the Building Official
or his/her designee may require the applicant/owner to file a surety
company performance bond, deposit of money negotiable securities or
other method of surety, as specified by the Building Official or his/her
designee. When any land disturbing activity is to take place within 100
feet of any watercourse or coastal feature or within an identified flood
hazard district, or on slopes in excess of 10%, the filing of a
performance bond shall be required. The amount of such bond, as
determined by the Public Works Department or, in its absence, the
Building Official or his/her designee, shall be sufficient to cover the cost
of implementing all erosion and sediment control measures as shown on
the plan.
(1) The bond or negotiable security filed by the applicant shall be
subject to approval of the form, content, amount, and manner of
execution by the Public Works Director and the Town Solicitor.
(2) A performance bond for an erosion sediment control plan for a
subdivision may be included in the performance bond of the
subdivision. The posting of such bond as part of the subdivision
performance bond does not, however, relieve the owner of any
requirement(s) of this chapter.
B. Notice of default of performance secured by bond.
(1) Whenever the Building Official or his/her designee shall find that a
default has occurred in the performance of any term(s) or
condition(s) of the bond or in the implementation of measures
secured by the bond, written notice thereof shall be made to the
applicant and to the surety of the bond by the Town Solicitor. Such
notice shall state the nature of default, work to be done, the
estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by the
Building Official or his/her designee to be reasonably necessary for
the completion of such work.
(2) Failure of the applicant to acknowledge and comply with the
provisions and deadlines outlined in such notice of default shall
mean the institution, by the Town Solicitor, without further notice
of proceedings whatsoever, of appropriate measures to utilize the
performance bond to cause the required work to be completed by
the Town, by contract or by other appropriate means as determined
by the Town Solicitor.
C. Notice of default on performance secured by cash or negotiable
securities deposit. If a cash or negotiable securities deposit has been

§ 177-16. Maintenance of erosion and sediment control measures.
Maintenance of all erosion-sediment control devices under this chapter
shall be the responsibility of the owner. Such erosion-sediment control
devices shall be maintained in good condition and working order on a
continuing basis. Watercourses originating and located completely on
private property shall be the responsibility of the owner to their point of
open discharge at the property line or at a communal watercourse within
the property.
§ 177-17. Liability of applicant.
Neither approval of an erosion and sediment control plan nor compliance
with any condition of this chapter shall relieve the owner/applicant from any
responsibility for damage to persons or property, nor impose any liability
upon the Town for damages to persons or property.
posted by the applicant, notice and procedure shall be the same as
provided for Subsection B of this section.
D. Release from performance bond conditions. The performance bonding
requirement shall remain in full force and effect for 12 months
following completion of the project, or longer if deemed necessary by
the Building Official or his/her designee.
A. Every approval granted herein shall expire at the end of the time period
set forth in the conditions. The developer shall fully perform and
complete all of the work required within the specified time period.
B. If the developer is unable to complete the work within the designated
time period, he shall, at least 30 days prior to the expiration date,
submit a written request for an extension of time to the Building Official
or his/her designee, setting forth the reasons underlying the requested
time extension. If the extension is warranted, the Building Official or
his/her designee may grant an extension of time up to a maximum of
one year from the date of the original deadline. Subsequent extensions
under the same conditions may be granted at the discretion of the
Building Official.

shall notify the Building Official or his/her designee that all grading,
drainage, erosion, and sediment control measures and devices, and
vegetation and ground cover planting has been completed in
conformance with the approval, all attached plans, specifications,
conditions, and other applicable provisions of this chapter.
A. Upon such notification of the completion by the owner, the Building
Official or his/her designee shall make a final inspection of the site in
question and prepare a final summary inspection report of its findings
which shall be retained in the Department of Public Works' permanent
inspections file.
B. The applicant/owner may request the release of his/her performance
bond from the Building Official or his/her designee 12 months after the
final site inspection has been completed and approved. In the instance
where the performance bond has been posted with the recording of a
final subdivision, the bond shall be released by the Building Official or
his/her designee 12 months after the final site inspection has been
completed and approved. In the instance where the performance bond
has been posted with the recording of a final subdivision, the bond shall
be released after the Building Official or his/her designee has been
notified by the Town Planning Director of successful completion of all
plat improvements by the applicant/owner.

Violations
§ 177-20. Noncompliance.
If, at any stage, the work in progress and/or completed under the terms
of an approved erosion and sediment control plan does not conform to
such plan, a written notice from the Building Official or his/her designee
to comply shall be transmitted by certified mail to the owner. Such notice
shall set forth the nature of the temporary and permanent corrections
required and the time limit within which corrections shall be completed
as set forth in Article VII, § 177-21B. Failure to comply with the required
corrections within the specified time limits shall be considered a violation
of this chapter, in which case the performance bond or cash or negotiable
securities deposit shall be subject to notice of default, in accordance with
Article V, § 177-14B and C of this chapter.
§ 177-21. Revocation or suspension of approval; violations and
penalties.
A. Revocation or suspension of approval: The approval of an erosion and
sediment control plan under this chapter may be revoked or suspended
by the Building Official and all work on the project halted for an
indefinite time period by the Building Official after written notification
is transmitted by the Building Official to the developer for one or more
of the following reasons:
(1) Violation of any condition of the approval plan, conditions, or
specifications pertaining thereto;
(2) Violation of any provision of this chapter or any other applicable
law, ordinance, rule, or regulation related to the work or site of
work; and
(3) The existence of any condition or the performance of any act
constituting or creating a nuisance, hazard, or endangerment to
human life or the property of others, or contrary to the spirit or
intent of this chapter.
B. Other penalties.
(1) In addition thereto, whenever there is a failure to comply with the
provisions of this chapter, the Town shall have the right to notify
the applicant/owner that he or she has five days from the receipt of
notice to temporarily correct the violations and 30 days from
receipt of notice to permanently correct the violations.
(2) Should the applicant/owner fail to take the temporary corrective
measures within the five-day period and the permanent corrective
measures within the thirty-day period, the Town shall then have the
right to take whatever actions it deems necessary to correct the
violations and to assert a lien on the subject property in an amount
§ 177-20 EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL § 177-21
177:175
equal to the costs of remedial actions. The lien shall be enforced in
the manner provided or authorized by law for the enforcement of
common law liens on personal property. The lien shall be recorded
with the records of land evidence of the municipality, and the lien
shall incur legal interest from the date of recording. The imposition
of any penalty shall not exempt the offender from compliance
with the provisions of this chapter, including revocation of the
performance bond or assessment of a lien on the property by the
Town.

ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  The Zoning and Code Enforcement Officer, or
his or her designee, and any police officer of the Town of Glocester.
FORECLOSED ABANDONED OR VACANT PROPERTY  Any property
which has been foreclosed on and on which there exists a structure, be it
residential or commercial, which is not occupied or used on a routine basis.
PUBLIC NUISANCE  Whatever is injurious to health, indecent, or
unreasonably offensive to the senses, or an obstruction to free use of
property so as essentially to interfere unreasonably with the comfortable
enjoyment of life, any condition or use of premises or of building exteriors
which is detrimental to the property of others or which causes or tends to
cause substantial diminution in value of other property in the neighborhood
in which such premises are located, or a building that is a menace to
the public health, welfare, or safety by reason of inadequate maintenance,
dilapidation, obsolescence or abandonment, as implied in § 232-1 hereof.
RESPONSIBLE PERSON(S)  The individual(s) or entity responsible for
abating nuisances pursuant to this chapter. Any owner is responsible for the
nuisance and is therefore a responsible person pursuant to this chapter.
§ 232-3. Property maintenance.
No owner of foreclosed vacant or abandoned property shall allow the
property to be or become dilapidated by reason of inadequate maintenance,
as further defined herein, which may cause substantial diminution in value

B. Accordingly, the Town Council finds and declares that the purpose of
this chapter is to:
(1) Reduce the threat to health, safety, welfare, appearance and
economic value due to the decline in property condition(s) by
lawfully delineating the circumstances under which such
condition(s) on foreclosed abandoned or vacant properties may be
considered illegal and/or abated; and, further, finds that
(2) Abatement of such condition(s) is in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the Town because maximum
use and enjoyment of property or premises in proximity to one
another depends upon maintenance of those properties or premises
at or above the minimum standard.
A. Maintenance of buildings and structures. Maintenance of buildings,
structures, or others as enumerated herein shall not be allowed to
deteriorate, or be left in a state of disrepair as to be decaying or

then the Zoning and Code Enforcement Officer, or his or her agent or
designee, may proceed to have such conditions remedied either by the

Town. Abatement costs incurred shall become a lien against such property
containing dry rot, have missing doors or windows, or any other
disrepair as to render the structure unsightly and unsafe.
B. Trash, garbage, debris, etc., shall not be allowed to accumulate on site.
A. Pursuant to R.I.G.L. 23-19.2-7 and 45-24.2, as the case may be,

of the Town of Glocester in such form as the Zoning and Code Enforcement
Officer may prescribe.
§ 232-8. Notice of completion.

sections hereof, notice thereof and of the cost assessed therefor shall be
given to the owner in the same manner as prescribed for notice of violations
in § 235-5 of this chapter, and the sum assessed shall be due and payable

cancel, in whole or in part, taxes assessed upon personal, mixed, or real

§ 258-9. Purpose.
It is hereby declared to be in the public welfare, interest and safety that
in order to insure the delivery of food and fuel to enable fire apparatus to
reach all areas of the Town, it is necessary that during and after a snow
storm all Town roads in the Town be made passable. In order to facilitate
the plowing of such roads, it may be necessary for the Police Department
or Highway Department of the Town remove vehicles interfering with the
plowing of such roads.
§ 258-10. Snow routes.
All Town roads shall be considered snow routes for the purposes of this
article during the period from November 30 through April 1, inclusive.
§ 258-11. Towing of vehicles in snow routes.
A. The Chief of Police shall have the authority to appoint such agents as he
deems necessary to tow away parked, disabled or abandoned vehicles
on snow routes during snow storms. Such vehicles shall be towed to the
nearest area cleared by the Town for such purposes, if such area exists
at the time of such towing. In the event that such area does not exist at
the time of such towing, the vehicles shall be towed to any off-street
area for storage until the vehicle is claimed by the owner thereof.
B. A list of such vehicles shall be kept at the police headquarters, by which
the owner of such vehicle so towed may learn the location of his vehicle.
Failure to include any vehicle upon the list shall not, however, create
any liability upon the Town on account of towing. The Town shall not be
liable for damage or loss to the contents thereof.
C. The agents appointed by the Chief of Police shall submit evidence of a
bond in a sum satisfactory to the Town Treasurer, to hold the Town
harmless from any and all claims for damage to personal property
arising out of towing.
D. Charges.
(1) The charges for such towing of vehicles shall be the reasonable
charge of the private party who performs the service of towing the
vehicle in question.
(2) The charges shall be collected by the towing agent as its fee for
towing services, and shall be in lieu of any other fee or payment by
the Town for such service. The payment of such towing and storage
charges shall not release the operator or owner of the vehicle from
any penalty imposed for violation of a traffic regulation.

§ 286-1. Declaration of policy.
The Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act was established
pursuant to Tide 45, Chapter 53, of the General Laws of Rhode Island to
provide opportunities for the establishment of low- and moderate-income
housing within every city and town throughout the state. It is the policy
of the Town of Glocester to facilitate the development of all types of lowand
moderate-income housing in accordance with the Rhode Island Low
and Moderate Income Housing Act and in conformance with the Glocester
Comprehensive Community Plan.
§ 286-2. Findings of fact.
The Town Council finds that the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income
Housing Act requires every city or town throughout the state to provide
low- and moderate-income housing in excess of 10% of the housing units
§ 279-4 GLOCESTER CODE § 286-2
279:304
reported in that city or town in the census. The Town Council further finds
that the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act authorizes
every city or town to provide opportunities for housing that qualifies as
low- and moderate-income housing through the adoption of a municipal
government subsidy program. The Town Council finds that the housing and
affordable housing component of the Comprehensive Community Plan for
the Town of Glocester states that there are no local programs to assist
low- and moderate-income households in accessing affordable housing. The
Town Council further finds that the housing and affordable housing
component of the Comprehensive Community Plan for the Town of
Glocester establishes as one of its goals that the Town should provide
opportunities for new housing that is geared to the needs of all segments
of the population. The Town Council further finds that it is in the interest
of the residents of the Town of Glocester to adopt a municipal government
subsidy program for all residential developments.
§ 286-3. Definitions.
The following words, whenever used in this chapter, unless a different
meaning clearly appears from the context, have the following meanings:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Residential housing that has a sales price or
rental amount that is within the means of a household that is of moderate
income or less. In the case of dwelling units for sale, housing that is
affordable means housing in which principal, interest, taxes, which may be
adjusted by state and local programs for property tax relief, and insurance
constitute no more than 30% of the gross household income for a moderateincome
household. In the case of dwelling units for rent, housing that
is affordable means housing for which the rent, heat, and utilities other
than telephone constitute no more than 30%of the gross annual household
income for household with 80% or less of area median income, adjusted for
family size. Affordable housing shall include all types of year-round housing,
including, but not limited to, manufactured housing, housing originally
constructed for workers and their families, accessory dwelling units,
housing accepting rental vouchers and/or tenant based certificates under
Article 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, and
assisted living housing, where the sale or rental amount of such housing,
adjusted for any federal, state, or municipal government subsidy, is less
than or equal to 30% of the gross household income of the low- and/
or moderate-income occupants of the housing, or as defined by R.I.G.L.
§ 42-128-8.1(d)(1).
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND  An interest-bearing fund that is
subsidized by developments that wish to pay a fee in lieu of constructing
the required affordable housing unit. The fee shall be at least $200,000 per
unit or donation of a buildable lot (i.e., with all necessary permits in place to
receive a building permit) with the number of lots/units being equal to the
required affordable set aside percentage. The custodian of said funds shall
be the Director of Finance for the Town of Glocester.
§ 286-2 YARD SALES § 286-3
279:305
AMI (AREA MEDIAN INCOME)  The midpoint in the income distribution
within a specific geographic area. By definition, 50% of households earn less
than the median income, and 50% earn more. HUD calculates AMI levels
for different communities annually, with adjustments for family size. AMI is
used to determine the eligibility of applicants for both federally and locally
funded housing programs.
LOW- OR MODERATE-INCOME HOUSING  Any housing, whether built
or operated by any public agency or any nonprofit organization or by
any limited equity housing cooperative or any private developer, that is
subsidized by the federal, state, or municipal government under any
program to assist the construction or rehabilitation housing affordable to
low- or moderate-income households, as defined in the applicable federal
or state statute, or local ordinance that will remain affordable through a
land lease and/or deed restriction for 99 years or such other period that is
either agreed to by the applicant and Town or prescribed by the federal or
state or municipal subsidy program but is not less than 30 years from initial
occupancy, or as defined by R.I.G.L. § 45-53-3(5).
MODERATE-INCOME HOUSEHOLD  A single person, family, or unrelated
persons living together whose adjusted gross income is more than 80% but
less than 120% of the area median income, adjusted for family size.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY  Assistance that is made available
through a city or town program sufficient to make housing affordable, as
"affordable" is defined in this chapter; such assistance may include, but is
not limited to, direct financial support, abatement of taxes, waiver of fees
and charges, and approval of density bonuses and/or internal subsidies, and
any combination of forms of assistance.
§ 286-4. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter are applicable to all subdivisions and
residential land developments according to Rhode Island General Laws,
Title 45, Chapter 53, titled "Low and Moderate Income Housing," in the
Town of Glocester.
§ 286-5. Number of units required.
There shall be a minimum of 10% of the total number of units in the land
development project dedicated to affordable housing. This 10% can be a
combination of low- and moderate-income housing.
§ 286-6. Selection of municipal government subsidy.
A. The municipal government subsidy shall be one or more of the
following:
(1) A density bonus, where granted in accordance with the provisions
of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Glocester; and/or
(2) A waiver of the building permit fee; and/or
§ 286-3 GLOCESTER CODE § 286-6
279:306
§ 286-7. Options for development of housing.
§ 286-8. Length of affordability.
Low- and moderate-income housing must be designated as such for a period
of 99 years or such other period that is either agreed to by the applicant
and Town but shall not be for a period of less than 30 years from initial
occupancy through a land lease or deed restriction. The affordability deed
restriction must be renewed with each sale of the property. The right of
first refusal shall lie with the Town of Glocester, and should the monitoring
agent forego this right, it would be offered to Rhode Island Housing as a
secondary right of refusal.
§ 286-9. Low-income housing.
The Planning Board of the Town of Glocester may require the inclusion
of low-income housing units and/or provide a greater municipal subsidy
when a development provides for low-income housing. When considering
(3) A waiver or reduction of any municipal fees, guarantees, and
charges; and/or
(4) A waiver of the impact fee on the affordable units.
B. The Planning Board or applicant may wish to apply a subsidy in order to
allow certain units to qualify as affordable housing. One or more
subsidies may be utilized by the development to qualify as affordable
housing under the state definition. Selection of the subsidy shall be
made by the Planning Board, which may be based on the
recommendation of the Town Planner and/or the Glocester Affordable
Housing Board. When considering the amount and type of subsidy, the
Board may consider, but not be limited to, the project size, site
constraints, location, and other issues.
A. The applicant shall have the following options for construction of
housing. The options are ranked in order of the Town's preference:
(1) To construct market rate housing together with the affordable
housing; or
(2) To construct market rate housing and provide the Town with
buildable lot(s) equivalent to the required affordable set aside; or
(3) To construct market rate housing and pay the fee in lieu of
affordable housing. (The Town would prefer the provision of a
buildable lot for affordable housing which in turn could be given to
a nonprofit affordable housing developer to develop.) All funds will
be placed in an affordable housing fund.
B. It is the preference of the Town to have affordable housing constructed
as part of any development rather than to have land set aside, collecting
a fee in lieu or any other option.
§ 286-6 YARD SALES § 286-9
279:307
the amount and/or type of subsidies granted by the Planning Board, it
may consider, but not be limited to, the following factors: any unique
development constraints, including, but not limited to, project size, project
location, and site size; economic feasibility and the amount of low-income
housing being proposed. The Town Planner may provide a recommendation
regarding the municipal subsidy based upon the above considerations.
§ 286-10. Monitoring and compliance.
Rhode Island Housing or an approved monitoring agent as approved by
Rhode Island Housing, its successors or assigns shall monitor the units
designated as low- and moderate-income housing units to insure compliance
with the affordability requirements of the land lease and/or deed restriction.
§ 286-11. Housing quality.
The units created under the Glocester municipal subsidy program must
be physically consistent with the overall character of housing already
established in the development and the community. Every effort will be
made to integrate affordable units into the surrounding community.
§ 286-12. Applicability to both rental and ownership units.
This chapter shall apply to both rental and ownership units, with rental
units not to exceed eighty-percent AMI (area median income).
§ 286-13. Timing of construction.
Within a project, low- and moderate-income units must be built
simultaneously with or prior to construction of the market-rate units.
§ 286-14. Allowed income limits.
For the purpose of creating ownership units, a tiering of incomes is to be
applied. One-half of the affordable units in a project must be at eightypercent
AMI or lower, and the other half can be negotiated with the
Planning Board up to one-hundred-percent AMI.
§ 286-15. Occupancy of units.
The affordable units created under this chapter must be the owner's/
renter's primary residence.
§ 286-16. Tax assessments.
The Town of Glocester will assess low- and moderate-income units based on
the deed restricted price, not the comparable value of a non-deed-restricted
property for the life of the affordable deed restriction unless some other
arrangement has been made with the Town of Glocester.
§ 286-9 GLOCESTER CODE § 286-17
279:308
§ 286-17. Qualified program.
The municipal government subsidy program adopted by this chapter
qualifies for the establishment of low- and moderate-income housing under
the Rhode Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act established
pursuant to Title 45, Chapter 53, of the General Laws of Rhode Island.

§ 300-10. Certificate of completeness.
A. An application shall be signed by the owner or owners of the property
and by any authorized agent. The administrative officer shall advise the
applicant as to which approvals are required and the appropriate board
for hearing an application for a land development or subdivision
project. A subdivision is as defined as the division or redivision of a lot,
tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, tracts or parcels. Any
adjustment to existing lot lines of a recorded lot by any means shall be
considered a subdivision.
B. The following types of applications may be filed:
(1) Administrative subdivision: a resubdivision of existing lots which
yields no additional lots for development, and involves no creation
or extension of streets. Such resubdivision shall only involve
divisions, mergers, mergers and division, or adjustments of
boundaries of existing lots.
(2) Minor subdivision: a plan for residential development consisting of
five or fewer units or lots, provided that such subdivision does not
require waivers or modifications as specified in this chapter.
(3) Major subdivision: any subdivision not classified as either an
administrative or minor subdivision.
(4) All nonresidential subdivisions shall be considered as major
subdivisions. [Added 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
A. An application shall be complete for purposes of commencing the
applicable time period for action when so certified by the administrative
officer, with input from the Technical Review Committee. In the event
such certification of the application is not made within the time
specified in these regulations for the type of plan, the application shall
be deemed complete for purposes of commencing the review period
unless the application lacks information required for such applications
as specified in these regulations and the administrative officer has
notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the application.
B. The Planning Board may subsequently require correction of any
information found to be in error and submission of additional
information specified in the regulations but not required by the
administrative officer prior to certification, as is necessary to make an
informed decision.

shall also be held to determine if a subdivision may be submitted for
review and approval as a conventional subdivision. Preapplication
meetings may be held for administrative or other minor subdivision
applications, upon request of either the Town of Glocester or the
applicant. Preapplication meetings shall allow the applicant to meet
with appropriate officials, boards and/or commissions, planning staff,
and, where appropriate, state agencies, for advice as to the steps in the
approvals process, the pertinent local plans, ordinances, regulations,
rules and procedures and standards which may bear upon the proposed

and discussion of project concepts among the participants. Discussions
which are held at preapplication meetings are intended for the advice
or guidance of the applicant and shall not be considered approval or
commitment of approval of a project or any of its elements.
E. Provided that at least one preapplication meeting has been held for a
major land development or subdivision application, or 60 days have
elapsed from the filing of the submission and no preapplication meeting
has been scheduled to occur within those 60 days, nothing shall be

the applicant, the applicant shall not be found to be deficient in the
application process, and shall be allowed to proceed with the

propertys existing conditions and special features, to identify
potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity
to discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of
designed open space lands, buildings and street alignments.
Comments made by Town officials or their staff and consultants
shall be interpreted as being only suggestive. It shall be understood

B. Certification of completeness. The application for final approval shall be
certified complete or incomplete by the administrative officer, after
soliciting comments from the Technical Review Committee on the
completeness of the final plan, within 25 days, according to the
provisions of § 300-10. This time period may be extended to 45 days by
written notice from the administrative officer to the applicant where the
final plans contain changes to or elements not included in the
preliminary plan approval. The running of the time period set forth
herein shall be deemed stopped upon the issuance of a certificate of
incompleteness of the application by the administrative officer and shall
recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the
applicant. However, in no event shall the administrative officer be
required to certify a corrected submission as complete or incomplete
less than 14 days after its resubmission. If the administrative officer
certifies the application as complete and does not require submission to
the Planning Board as per Subsection C(1) below, the final plan shall be
considered approved. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
C. Review process.
(1) Referral to the Planning Board. If the administrative officer
determines that an application for final approval does not meet the
requirements set by local regulations or by the Planning Board at
preliminary plan approval, the administrative officer shall refer the
final plans to the Planning Board for review. The Planning Board
shall, within 45 days after the certification of completeness, or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant,
approve or deny the final plan as submitted.
(2) Failure to act. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period
prescribed shall constitute approval of the final plan, and a
certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of the
Planning Board to act within the required time and the resulting
approval shall be issued on request of the applicant.
D. Recording. The final approval of a major subdivision or land
development project shall expire one year from the date of approval
unless, within that period, the plat or plan shall have been submitted
and accepted for signature and recording as specified in § 300-45. The
Planning Board may, for good cause shown, extend the period for
recording for an additional period.
E. Acceptance of public improvements. Signature and recording as
specified in § 300-45 shall constitute the acceptance by the Town of
Glocester of any street or other public improvement or other land
intended for dedication. Final plan approval shall not impose any duty
upon the Town of Glocester to maintain or improve those dedicated
areas until the Town Council accepts the completed public
improvements as constructed in compliance with the final plans.

ARTICLE VI
Special Provisions
§ 300-31. Physical design requirements.
The goal of a good subdivision and site design is to create a functional and
attractive development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that a
project will be an asset to the community. In order to achieve these goals,
land development projects and subdivisions shall conform to the following
standards, which are designed to result in a well-planned community.
A. Physical site design requirements. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective
12-20-2007]
(1) Lot design standards. The lot dimensions, setbacks, and
configuration shall be in accordance with Article III of Chapter 350,
Zoning. In addition, the following standards should be adhered to
wherever possible:
(a) Side lot lines should be at right angles to street lines or radial
curved street lines unless the Planning Board determines that
a variation from this rule will provide a better street or lot plan.
Except for those sides bordering a street, interior angles
should not exceed 200°.
(b) The preferred lot shape is rectangular, and the depth to width
ratio should not exceed 2.5 to 1.
(c) For all minor and major subdivisions, nonbuildable lots are
prohibited unless identified as permanent open space or
permanently reserved for a public purpose on the approved
recorded subdivision or land development plan. For the
purposes of these regulations, and for the purpose of
calculating the total number of buildable lots in a minor or
major subdivision, the provisions of § 350-58 of the Zoning
Ordinance shall apply.
(d) Every lot created within the subdivision shall possess the
minimum required frontage on an accepted public street or an
accepted suitably improved public street. Streets in a
conservation development or a rural residential compound may
be privately owned and maintained, subject to the approval of
the Planning Board.
(e) The minimum lot dimensions established by these regulations
or by any zoning ordinance adopted by the Town of Glocester
may be increased by the Planning Board if the report of the
Chief, Division of Water and Pollution Control, Rhode Island
Department of Health, indicates that larger dimensions are
warranted for the safe and effective operation of individual
sewage disposal systems. Lots in areas where public water is
not available shall be of such area, shape, and dimensions as
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:333
will allow the operation of individual sewage disposal systems
in such a manner that the water supplies of said lots and of all
surrounding lots are adequately safeguarded.
(2) Fill requirements. All material that originates on the site or is
transported onto the site that is to be utilized as fill material for the
construction of public improvements within the proposed
subdivision or land development project shall be approved as
suitable fill material by the Director of Public Works and shall be
identified as to its source and destination prior to final approval.
The Planning Board may require any fill material to be removed if
prior approval is not granted or unsuitable fill material is utilized.
(3) Easements. Easements may be required by the Planning Board
where necessary for the proper location and placement of
improvements on private land as described below. Easements shall
be identified on the plat by metes and bounds description, to be
duly recorded as such in the office of the Town Clerk as part of the
recording process. The Board may, at its discretion, require
dedication of land to the Town of Glocester in lieu of easements if
such dedication would provide greater control over and access to
the intended use and meets a stated public purpose. The
maintenance responsibilities shall be permanently assigned or
delegated to a landowner or other legal organization over time. The
proposed language of assignment shall include provisions which
recognize the Town of Glocester's right to enforce the necessary
maintenance within the easements and to provide access in the
event of an emergency. The Town of Glocester shall also be
recognized as reserving the right to assess the responsible party
for the cost of any maintenance or enforcement the Town of
Glocester completes due to the failure of the entity to carry out its
responsibilities. The assessment shall become a lien on the
property or properties.
(a) Utilities. All utility easements shall have a minimum width of
20 feet and must contain at least one concrete or granite
bound.
(b) Drainage easements. Easements to install and maintain
surface and/or underground drainage facilities on private land
shall be dedicated to and accepted by the Town of Glocester
where required. However, wherever practical, easements will
remain privately owned and maintained. The nominal width for
such a drainage easement shall be 20 feet. Where aboveground
drainage flows are directed over private property which does
not contain natural watercourses or wetlands, or where
publicly owned and maintained drainage systems outflow onto
private land, a drainage easement shall be dedicated to the
Town of Glocester for the intended purpose. Easements into
and upon aboveground drainage facilities, such as stormwater
detention or retention basins, shall be granted to the Town of
§ 300-31 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-31
279:334
Glocester wherever stormwater from the Town of Glocesterowned
streets or other improvements is intended to be
directed to such basins.
(c) Public access easements. Bicycle and pedestrian access shall
be provided where required by the Planning Board on a
separate strip of land dedicated to the Town of Glocester or on
an easement having a minimum width of 10 feet with a fivefoot-
wide pavement.
(d) Other easements. All other easements shall be of sufficient
width and area for the intended purpose as determined by the
Planning Board.
(4) Landscaping standards.
(a) Every effort should be made to retain the natural landscape
and terrain, to avoid unnecessary alteration of natural
features, and to avoid disturbance of the natural ecology of the
area. Except as provided in § 300-32 of these regulations,
clearing and regrading of a natural site prior to final
subdivision approval is prohibited unless otherwise authorized
by the Planning Board.
(b) Reasonable landscaping should be provided at site entrances,
in public areas and adjacent to buildings. The type and amount
of landscaping required shall be allowed to vary with the type
of development, as reasonably determined by the Planning
Board. The plant or other landscaping material that best serves
the intended functions shall be selected. Landscaping
materials shall be appropriate for the local environment, soil
conditions, and availability of water. The use of native grasses
or ground cover that requires minimal watering and
fertilization is encouraged, particularly in areas that are
ecologically sensitive.
(5) Construction procedures.
(a) Preconstruction meeting. A preconstruction meeting shall be
held at least seven days prior to the start of any subdivision
improvements. It shall be called by the applicant and be
arranged at a time and place mutually agreed upon by the
applicant and the Technical Review Committee. It shall be
attended by the Technical Review Committee and the applicant
or duly authorized representative.
(b) Notification. No step in the construction of public
improvements shall commence until the Director of Public
Works has been notified at least 24 hours in advance of the
phases listed in Subsection A(6)(c) below.
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:335
(c) Inspections. Inspection procedures and a schedule shall be
submitted to the Director of Public Works and approved prior
to the commencement of any construction. The applicant shall
be liable for the costs of all inspections, which should include
at least the following:
[1] During and following the installation of all underground
drainage structures, systems, and utilities prior to
backfilling.
[2] During and following the preparations of the subgrade and
road shoulders.
[3] During and following the spreading and compaction of the

[7] At periodic intervals as required to ensure compliance
with the approved erosion and sediment control plan.55
[8] Any other inspections required by the Planning Board or
Technical Review Committee as deemed necessary to
assure proper construction of improvements.
(d) Inspection fees. Inspection fees shall be set at 1% of the total
cost of the original performance bond. In the absence of a
performance bond, the fee shall be 1% of the total estimated
cost of all required improvements.
(e) As-built drawings. Two sets of as-built drawings shall be
submitted upon the certified completion by the Public Works
Director of all the required improvements to the administrative
officer.
(f) Borings and tests. The Town Director of Public Works may
require borings in a proposed roadbed and tests of compaction
with engineering evaluation at the applicant's cost to
determine compliance with street construction standards of
the Town or as may be promulgated by the RI Department of
Transportation for such situations as may be necessary as may
be determined by said Director.

have frontage on and physical access to an existing improved
public street that has been formally accepted by the Town of
Glocester for street or highway purposes, or frontage on a highway
owned and maintained by the State of Rhode Island. The Planning
Board may require the developer to make certain improvements to
the street or roadway abutting the property or leading to the
property being subdivided for drainage, safety, traffic or other
reasons as deemed proper by the Board. See Subsection B(19) of
this section.
(2) Subdivision access. All developments shall have at least two means
of public street access to enter and exit the proposed subdivision
unless the Planning Board determines that two means of public
street access are not possible and/or practical due to site
orientation or physical site conditions.
(3) Street classifications.
(a) Arterial (See cross-section #4 for minimum requirements.): a
major public street that serves as the primary access for the
circulation of traffic in a nonresidential planned development.
(b) Residential collector (See cross-section #3 for minimum
requirements.): a public street whose principal function is to
carry traffic between local streets and between local and
arterial streets but which also provides direct access to
abutting properties. This street design is required for all
residential developments unless the Planning Board
determines that the development plan meets all the
requirements to decrease the street size.
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:337

Notes:
*If an unpaved center is included, the pavement radius
measurement starts at the outer edge of the unpaved center.
(b) The Planning Board may require provision for a temporary
turn-around or a "Tee" until such time as the adjacent tract is
developed and the street is extended. Reservation of strips of
land controlling access to a street or land dedicated for other
public use will not be permitted.
[1] Access to adjoining property.
[a] Where the Planning Board determines that there is a
need to provide public street access for potential or
future development to adjoining property, proposed
streets may be required to be continued and improved
up to the property line. A temporary turnaround may
be required until such time as the adjacent tract is
developed. A bond may be required to insure
completion of the street or construction of a
permanent cul-de-sac within a reasonable amount of
time.
[b] Access to adjoining property for pedestrian and/or
bicycle circulation may be required wherever the
Planning Board determines that such connection will
increase accessibility between adjoining subdivisions,
to existing or proposed sidewalks or bicycle paths,
from subdivisions to major public or private schools,
recreation areas or other facilities or where public
safety will be significantly enhanced by such
pedestrian and/or bicycle connections.
[2] Provision for future resubdivision. Where a tract is
subdivided into lots substantially larger than the minimum
size required in the zoning district in which the subdivision
is located, such lots shall be arranged so as to allow for the
opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:341
in accordance with the requirements contained in these
regulations.
(7) Street names. When selecting names for all new streets, names
that differ significantly and phonetically from the names of all
existing streets within the Town of Glocester shall be selected. The
proposed street name shall be submitted by the applicant and shall
be reviewed by the Safety Commission, which will provide a
recommendation to the Planning Board, which shall provide a
recommendation to the Town Council for acceptance. The Town
Council, at the time of final street acceptance, shall approve the
street name.
(8) Extension of streets. The extension of any existing street shall have
the same name as the existing street.
(9) Curbing requirements.
(a) Curbing may be required, where deemed necessary by the
Director of Public Works or the Planning Board. Curbing shall
be required where sidewalks are being installed. All curbing
shall be one of the following types as determined by the
Planning Board upon recommendation of the Director of Public
Works:

shall be installed prior to any street construction. At least
30 days following filling and compaction of all utility
trenches, the sub-base shall be thoroughly compacted with
a ten-ton roller, true to the lines, grades, and crosssections
shown on the approved drawings. The sub-base
shall be swept or otherwise cleaned of all mud, loose and
foreign material and shall be thoroughly dry before the
base course is spread.
[2] Base course. After the sub-base has been properly
prepared and the curbs or shoulders set, the base course
of bank run gravel shall be spread by approved street
grading equipment and compacted in two four-inch layers
for the full width and in such volume as to provide an
eight-inch cross-section after compaction with a ten-ton
roller. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
[3] Base course surface. Following thorough compaction of
the base course, crushed bank run gravel shall be spread
by approved street grading equipment for the full width to
a depth of two inches after compaction with a ten-ton
roller. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
[4] Binder course. The binder course shall be applied no less
than six months following the backfilling and compaction
of all utility trenches unless a shorter time period is
permitted by the Director of Public Works. The base course
shall be swept clean and all holes, ripples, or unevenness
shall be brought back to true line and cross-section by the
spot application and proper compaction of Class I mix. The
hot mix shall be applied at a temperature of 250° to 350°
Fahrenheit by means of an approved paving spreader with
a compactor. Such material shall be placed in sufficient
quantity to provide a minimum compacted cross-section of
1.5 inches. Immediately after placement the binder course
shall be compacted with a ten-ton roller equipped with a
sprinkler system to wet the wheels. The street shall be
allowed to stand for a minimum of eight hours without
traffic upon the completion of the binder course.
[5] Surface course. The binder course shall be allowed to
stand for at least 30 days before application of the surface
course. The hot mix shall be applied at a temperature of
250° to 350° Fahrenheit by means of an approved paving
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:343
spreader with a compactor. Such material shall be placed
in sufficient quantity to provide a minimum compacted
cross-section of 1.5 inches. Immediately after placement
the surface course shall be compacted with a ten-ton roller
equipped with a sprinkler system to wet the wheels. The
street shall be allowed to stand for a minimum of eight
hours without traffic upon the completion of the surface
course. Unless otherwise authorized by the Director of
Public Works, the surface course shall not be applied until
all heavy construction traffic has ceased within the
subdivision. Where a cape cod berm bituminous concrete
curbing is installed as provided in Subsection B(9) above,
such berm shall be installed as integral with the street
surface. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
[6] Seasonal limits. No bituminous material shall be laid when
the temperature of the air is 50° Fahrenheit and falling or
during other unfavorable weather conditions as may be
determined by the Director of Public Works.
(c) Grade. Grades of residential streets shall not be less than 1%
nor more than 10%. Arterial grades shall not exceed 6% nor be
less than 0.5% in grade.
(d) Curves.
[1] Intersections. Corners at intersections shall be rounded to
provide curb radius of not less than 20 feet.
[2] Deflection angles. Where an angle deflection of 10° or
more occurs along the center line of a street, a curve with
a radius of not less than 150 feet shall be introduced.
(11) Street lighting requirements. Provisions shall be made for street
light connections where required and approved by the Director of
Public Works.
(12) Street trees. Where natural tree growth within the right-of-way or
on abutting lots is determined to be insufficient, the Planning Board
shall require the developer to plant street trees within the right-ofway.
Trees shall be appropriate for the terrain, soil, and climatic
conditions encountered in the subdivision, and in accordance with
the following standards:
(a) Location.
[1] Street trees shall be placed within 10 feet of the street
pavement. No street trees shall be placed in a manner that
will interfere with utility lines. Street trees shall be spaced
approximately 30 to 50 feet on center, depending on
anticipated ultimate size.
§ 300-31 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-31
279:344
[2] Street trees to be located on private property shall be
within 10 feet of the right-of-way and shall be perpetually
maintained and/or replaced by the property owner upon
whose land the trees are situated.
(b) Screening. Where a proposed residential development abuts
an existing or proposed commercial or industrial area, a dense
evergreen buffer at least 10 feet in depth and at least 5 1/2 feet
high shall be placed along the common boundary, but within
the bounds of the commercial property, between the
residential and such commercial or industrial development.
(c) Size. Minimum sizes for trees are three to inches' caliper,
measured diameter at breast height (dbh) in place, and 10 feet
to 12 feet of height in place.
(d) Inspection. The Tree Warden shall determine the suitability of
the street trees being proposed and require proper planting
techniques and maintenance to be followed. Trees suitable
include, but are not limited to:
[1] Deciduous trees such as honeylocust, pin oak, London
plane, gingko, zelkova and Bradford pear.
[2] Small deciduous trees such as crab and cherry varieties.
[3] Conifers such as pine, hemlock, and spruce.
(13) Sidewalks.
(a) Paved sidewalks may be required to be installed on one or both
sides of all new public streets if the Planning Board finds any of
the following:
[1] The subdivision is located within one mile of a public or
private school;
[2] The subdivision is located in proximity to major public or
private facilities such as churches, shopping areas,
playgrounds, parks, etc. where there is a likelihood that
pedestrian traffic to and from the proposed subdivision
would result;
[3] The subdivision is located in an area with high vehicular
traffic volumes and where there would be a likelihood of
significant danger to pedestrians;
[4] There is a reasonable likelihood that there will be conflicts
between pedestrian and vehicular traffic.
(b) Curbing is required wherever sidewalks are installed, and the
sidewalk shall meet the standards established by the American
With Disabilities Act for accessibility.
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31

the street pavement and the abutting lots shall be loamed to a
minimum depth of four inches, seeded, and maintained for
pedestrian access and use.
(14) Monuments. Monuments (granite or concrete boundary markers)
shall be located on plans, shall be the responsibility of the
developer, and shall be installed by a registered land surveyor or
engineer on the street line at the beginning and end of all
horizontal curves on both sides of each subdivision (public) street,
at all lot line intersections with street lines, and shall not be more
than 500 feet apart. Monuments shall be set flush with the finished
grade at the right-of-way. Monuments shall be installed as required
prior to final subdivision approval on all subdivisions.
(15) Manholes. Manholes shall be located on all storm sewer trunk lines
at:
(a) A maximum separation of 300 feet;
(b) All angles in the line;
(c) Street intersections and other points where catch basins,
inlets, or laterals are to be connected;
(d) Points where pipe sizes change;
(e) Points where the grade of the line changes.
(16) Drainage requirements. The drainage system may be comprised of
natural and man-made elements. These may include grass swales,
retention and detention basins, curbs, catchbasins, culverts, and
stormwater pipes. The applicant is encouraged to incorporate
natural elements into the drainage design whenever possible. All
drainage structures shall be in conformance with the accepted
State RIDOT standards, or approved equals.
(a) A drainage plan and drainage calculations for the entire parcel
are required if any of the following conditions are present:
[1] The subdivision or land development project is classified
as a major subdivision or a major land development
project.
[2] The proposed project requires the preparation of an
erosion and sediment control plan under the requirements
set forth in Chapter 177, Erosion and Sediment Control.
(b) The stormwater drainage calculations, runoff rates, and
system design shall be based on the application of the
appropriate method as follows:
§ 300-31 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-31
279:346
[1] Rational method. This method is preferred for small
systems four acres or less in size, where no wetlands,
ponds, or other storage depressions are present, and
where drainage is toward the point of analysis;
[2] TR-55. This method is preferred for calculating runoff
volumes, peak discharge rate, and flood storage
requirements for site development greater than four acres
and up to 2,000 acres;
[3] TR-20. This method is for complex watersheds and systems
beyond the scope of TR-55.
(c) The proposed drainage system shall be designed to
accommodate stormwater flows such that post-construction
conditions result in a zero net increase in run-off from
preconstruction/predevelopment conditions. The Planning
Board may have the proposed drainage system and
accompanying data reviewed by a registered professional
engineer for accuracy and suitability for the parcel. The
applicant shall be responsible for the fair and reasonable cost
of outside professional engineering review of subdivision
drainage plans as may be reasonably determined to be
necessary by the Board. The selection of engineering services
and fees shall be by mutual agreement of the applicant and the
Planning Board.
(d) The drainage plan shall indicate how the following
requirements will be met:
[1] That each lot will be adequately drained;
[2] That natural drainage patterns will be maintained
wherever possible;
[3] That all existing drainage systems will be left open, unless
approval to enclose is granted by the Planning Board and
all applicable state and federal authorities;
[4] That a continuous drainage system will be installed and
connected to a natural or man-made drainage system or to
an existing piped storm drainage system;
[5] That all new open drainage systems will be seeded,
sodded, or paved depending on grades and soil types;
[6] That the ultimate destination of such continuous drainage
shall be a permanent natural water body or wetland.
Where the Planning Board determines that such
destination is impractical, the Planning Board may require
the construction of a retention area capable of
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:347
accommodating stormwater volumes based on a onehundred-
year frequency rainfall;
[7] Where any part of the drainage system is proposed for
location outside the public street right-of-way, provisions
for future maintenance approved by the Planning Board
and Department of Public Works will be provided;
[8] That all necessary easements to off-street drainage
systems will be obtained by the applicant and approved by
the Town Solicitor;
[9] Where the volume of the surface run-off is high, the flow
thereof shall be controlled by rip-rap, sediment basins,
flow spreaders, or other applicable devices and/or
techniques recommended in the Rhode Island Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control Handbook.
[10] That the overall design of the stormwater drainage system
incorporate best management practices (BMP's) for nonpoint
source pollution control and the design guidelines of
the Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation
Manual, where appropriate.
(17) Erosion and sediment control. An erosion and sediment control
plan shall be developed in accordance with the provisions set forth
in Chapter 177, Erosion and Sediment Control. However,
administrative and minor subdivisions and minor land development
projects shall not be required to submit such plans if the landdisturbing
activity involved in construction of subdivision
improvements meets all of the criteria for exceptions set forth in
Chapter 177. However, all major subdivisions and land
development projects shall submit an erosion and sediment control
plan. The cost for engineering review of the Erosion and sediment
control plan shall be the responsibility of the applicant as set forth
in the governing ordinance.
(18) Safety equipment and infrastructure requirements. The Planning
Board, upon the recommendation of the Fire Chief of the applicable
fire district, the Police Chief, or the Safety Commission, may
require the installation of safety equipment within the proposed
project area. Safety equipment may include, but shall not be
limited to:
(a) Fire hydrants.
(b) Holding ponds.
(c) Signage.
(d) Crosswalks.
(e) Fire lanes.
§ 300-31 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-31
279:348
(f) Emergency access facilities.
(g) Emergency signal services.
(19)Off-site improvements. As a condition of preliminary approval, the
Planning Board may require the construction of reasonable and
necessary improvements located off the site of the proposed
project. "Necessary" improvements are those clearly and
substantially related to or made fully or partly necessary by the
subdivision or land development project being proposed. The
Planning Board shall include in its preliminary approval the basis
for requiring such off-site improvements. In its resolution, the
Planning Board must find, and clearly document in the public
record, that a significant negative impact on existing conditions
related to public health, safety, and welfare will result if the off-site
improvements are not made. The mitigation required must be
related to the significance of the identified impact. Off-site
improvements may include, but shall not be limited to:
(a) Street improvements. The minimum street or roadway
standard or standards established for a proposed subdivision
street shall also be applicable to and necessary for the public
street(s) or roadway(s) from which access to the proposed
subdivision is dependent. The Planning Board shall have
authority to require an upgrading of the public street or
roadway serving as public access to the proposed subdivision,
at the expense of the developer, as an off-site improvement
required for the conditional approval of the subdivision. One or
more of the following findings are required:
[1] The existing street is inadequate to serve the proposed
subdivision for reasons of safety, geometric design,
capacity, or drainage purposes.
[2] Street improvements are not scheduled on the Town of
Glocester Capital Improvement Program for completion by
the Town of Glocester within the time period granted for
the completion of the proposed subdivision.
(b) Drainage improvements.
(c) Service improvements, including schools, fire, police, or
rescue.
(20) Private streets. Subject to the approval of the Planning Board,
streets within the parcel to be developed as a conservation
development or residential compound may be privately owned and
maintained in common by the residents of the development. At the
time of final approval, the Planning Board shall approve the form
and content of the following legal documents to be recorded
contemporaneously with the final plat: [Amended 11-15-2007,
effective 12-20-2007]
§ 300-31 YARD SALES § 300-31
279:349
§ 300-32. Construction and improvement guarantees.
The purpose of this section is to provide a guarantee that the required
improvements will be completed. An improvement guarantee is a security
instrument accepted by the Town of Glocester to ensure that all required
improvements, facilities, and work required by the Planning Board,
including but not limited to street, drainage, utility, landscaping, and offsite
improvements, will be completed and maintained in compliance with
the approved plans and specifications. The nature and duration of the
guarantee shall be structured to achieve this goal.
(a) A covenant by the owner of the parcel, binding on his
successors and assigns, that the Town of Glocester shall not be
asked or required to accept or maintain the private streets
within the parcel that do not meet the engineering and design
requirements for Town-accepted streets, for a minimum of 99
years from the date of recording; or, if only a lesser period is
legally enforceable, for that period with as many automatic
renewals as are necessary to total 99 years.
(b) A document or documents establishing the method of
ownership, and providing for maintenance of the streets and
drainage improvements.
A. General procedures. Before any land development or subdivision plan is
endorsed by the Planning Board, and before the recording of any
subdivision plat, the Planning Board shall be required to approve
agreements for the completion of all required improvements. Such
agreements may, at the option of the applicant, take the form of (1)
completion of actual construction of all improvements; (2) improvement
guarantees, or (3) a combination thereof. At the preliminary plat review
stage, the applicant shall submit either of the following: (1) a letter to
the Planning Board indicating his/her intent to complete the required
improvements prior to the Planning Board's approval of the final plat;
or (2) a letter requesting that security sufficient to cover the cost of
required improvements be established by the Board.
(1) If improvements are to be constructed without a financial
guarantee, all work shall be completed prior to final approval and
recording. Inspections shall be made by the Public Works Director
at all required stages of construction as required in § 300-31A(6)
under the direction of the administrative officer. Upon completion
of all required improvements, the Public Works Director shall
certify in writing to the administrative officer of such completion,
and a copy shall be provided to the applicant upon request. The
final plat shall be endorsed by the appropriate Planning Board
member, and the plat shall be recorded as provided in § 300-45, at
which time the lots within the subdivision may be transferred or
sold.
(2) Guarantees.
§ 300-31 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-32
279:350
(a) If financial guarantees are to be provided, they shall be set at
preliminary plan approval and received prior to final plan
approval. The guarantee shall be set at an amount and with all
necessary conditions to secure for the Town of Glocester the
actual construction and complete installation of all of the
required improvements, and the satisfactory completion of all
conditions of final approval within the time periods required
for the completion provided in said approval.
(b) The amount shall be based upon a minimum of two actual cost
estimates which would allow the Town of Glocester to obtain
completion of all improvements required as a condition of
preliminary approval. These estimates shall be prepared by a
contractor qualified in public street and drainage construction
or engineering, submitted by the applicant to the Director of
Public Works, who shall review the estimates with the
administrative officer and, if requested, with the applicant.
Estimates shall be broken down by construction category and
quantities, shall reflect the requirements of construction, and
shall include labor, material, and inspection costs. The Director
of Public Works shall forward a recommendation to the
Planning Board based on review of estimates, which shall
review and approve the final amount. The Board may set the
amount of the guarantee in reasonable excess of the estimated
costs in order to anticipate for increases in economic or
construction costs. However, the amount of such increase shall
not exceed 120% of the estimated cost of improvements as
recommended by the Director of Public Works. [Amended
11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
(c) Construction of improvements, including regrading, clearing,
and removal of earth material, or land fill, shall not commence
without acceptance of a performance guarantee, except with
the expressed conditional prior approval of the Planning
Board. At the expiration of the final approval period, if all
improvements are not complete, the Planning Board shall
review the status of the improvements and may:
[1] Require the applicant to extend the period of the entire
improvement guarantee.
[2] Reduce the amount of the improvement guarantee to cover
the costs of the remaining improvements.
[3] Authorize the administrative officer to take the steps
necessary to ensure the completion of the remaining work
by using improvement guarantee funds.
B. Required form. The security shall be in the form of a financial
instrument acceptable to the Town Finance Director and shall enable
the Town of Glocester to gain timely access to the secured funds, for
§ 300-32 YARD SALES § 300-32
279:351
cause. Performance and maintenance guarantees may be provided by a
variety of means, including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) Security bond from a surety bonding company authorized to do
business in the State of Rhode Island.
(2) Letter of credit that is irrevocable from a bank or other reputable
financial institution.
(3) Escrow account. The applicant may deposit cash, or other
instruments readily convertible into cash at face value, either with
the Town of Glocester or in escrow with a bank.
(4) Bonding for erosion and sediment control purposes may be
combined with subdivision required guarantees, subject to review
and approval by the Town Solicitor and the Planning Board.
C. Release. At the expiration of the final plan approval period or
completion of the development, if all required improvements are
complete, any improvement guarantee shall be returned to the
applicant. Partial releases or reductions in the guarantee amount may
also be authorized at any time prior to the expiration of final approval. A
written request for release or reduction of any improvement guarantee
shall be made to the administrative officer, who shall refer the request
to the Technical Review Committee. After inspection of the
improvements, the Committee shall recommend that the Planning
Board:
(1) Authorize the return of all improvement guarantees to the
applicant;
(2) Authorize a reduction and partial release of the amount of the
guarantee being held by the Town of Glocester to cover the
remaining improvements; or
(3) Hold the improvement guarantee and make no releases or
reductions.
D. Phases. In the case of land development projects or subdivisions which
are approved and constructed in phases, the Planning Board shall
specify improvement guarantees related to each particular phase. If
any off-site improvements or other improvements not directly related to
a particular phase are required as a condition of approval, the Board
shall, in setting the guarantee amount for each phase, clearly specify
when such guarantees are to be provided. In phased developments, the
improvement guarantee for one phase shall not be released until an
improvement guarantee for the next phase has been accepted by the
Planning Board for the subsequent phase.
E. Maintenance guarantees. The Planning Board may require that a
maintenance guarantee be provided by the applicant for all
improvements which are being dedicated to the Town of Glocester for
§ 300-32 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-32
279:352
public acceptance and maintenance. The amount of the maintenance
guarantee shall be 5% of the original performance bond or other
original guarantee amount. In the absence of such a guarantee, 5% of
the total estimated cost of all required improvements shall be required.
The initial period for such maintenance guarantee shall be one year.
At the end of one year, the Public Works Director shall inspect all
improvements subject to the guarantee and shall certify in writing to
the administrative officer as to their condition. If found unacceptable,
the administrative officer shall recommend an extension of the
guarantee period to the Planning Board, and the original funds shall
not be returned to the applicant. If public improvements are found
to be in good condition and have not been damaged due to the fault
of the applicant, or through the faulty workmanship or design, the
maintenance guarantee shall be returned to the applicant.
F. Building permits.
(1) Building permits shall not be issued for any lot within a subdivision
prior to the acceptance of the subdivision streets by the Town
Council for maintenance and ownership as specified in § 300-32F.
[Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
(2) The Planning Board may recommend waiver to this requirement to
the Town Council on an individual lot basis to allow for the issuance
of building permits on individual lots, provided that:
(a) All public improvements to the street fronting the lot to be
issued a building permit are certified complete by the Public
Works Director, with the exception of the final bituminous
layer. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
(b) The lot meets all of the requirements established for the
issuance of building permits in Chapter 145, Building Permits.
G. Acceptance of improvements.
(1) Upon completion of all required improvements, the applicant shall
convey all public improvements to the Town of Glocester for
ownership and maintenance. Private facilities, such as privately
maintained drainage systems, shall not be conveyed to the Town of
Glocester. The applicant shall first request the Department of
Public Works to conduct a final inspection as provided in
§ 300-31A(6). The Director of Public Works shall certify to the
administrative officer in writing that all required improvements
have been satisfactorily completed. [Amended 11-15-2007,
effective 12-20-2007]
(2) The applicant shall also request, in writing to the administrative
officer, that public improvements, streets, land easements, or other
facilities be accepted by the Town of Glocester. This request shall
contain a description of all facilities to be accepted and shall be
accompanied by an accurate description of all streets, easements,

land, a set of as-built plans accepted by the administrative officer,
and other facilities by metes and bounds and by reference to the
final plat drawing(s) and by a warranty deed transferring
ownership to the Town of Glocester and describing any special
conditions or other requirements. Upon certification of completion
of all required improvements, and upon receipt of all required
information from the applicant, the administrative officer shall
place the request for acceptance on the next available agenda
of the Technical Review Committee, which shall make a
recommendation for acceptance, in writing, to the Town Council, if
all the requirements have been met.
(3) The Technical Review Committee shall also recommend an amount
for a maintenance bond and shall recommend that no public
facilities or improvements be accepted for ownership and
maintenance until such maintenance bond has been submitted as
required in § 300-32E. Upon acceptance by the Town Council, all
public improvements shall be permanently owned and maintained
by the Town of Glocester as part of the Town of Glocester system
and the applicant shall no longer be responsible for their care,
repair, or appearance.
A. When a major land development or major subdivision commences the
required preapplication meetings, the Planning Board shall review the
adequacy of existing and projected future public improvements,
services and facilities which may be impacted by the proposed
development in its entirety. If the Planning Board determines that such
improvements, services, and facilities, including but not limited to
water supply, sewerage, streets and associated drainage facilities,
schools, recreational facilities, and fire and police protection, will not
be adequate to serve the residents of the subdivision or development at
the time of recording of the plat, the Planning Board shall have the
authority to establish a rate of development of the entire subdivision by
requiring it to be built in phases, related to the ability of the Town of
Glocester improvements, services, and facilities to serve the residents
of the subdivision or development.
B. When an application is submitted for master plan approval, the
applicant shall submit to the applicable Town of Glocester, state,
agency, or utility as provided in the Master Plan Checklist for Major
Land Developments and Major Subdivisions, a copy of the master plan
narrative report for its review and comment. Each agency so notified by
the applicant shall be requested to provide its comments on the
application by the administrative officer. Comments shall be received
§ 300-32 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-34
279:354
from each agency prior to the date of the informational meeting
(§ 300-28C). If comments are not received by the administrative officer
by that date, it shall be assumed that the agency does not wish to
comment.
C. Comments and supplemental material.
(1) Each department or agency to which such a request for comments
is made shall deliver to the administrative officer, in written format,
and any supplemental material, which shall describe:
(a) An estimate of the impact of the subdivision on the facilities
and/or services provided by the department or agency;
(b) Whether existing facilities and/or services are adequate to
serve the subdivision's residents;
(c) Whether plans for the necessary improvements to existing
facilities and/or services are included in the department or
agency's capital improvement program or are otherwise
planned;
(d) An estimate of how long it would take to provide any necessary
improvements to existing facilities and/or services.
(2) All such written comments and supplementary material shall be
delivered to the administrative officer by the reviewing agency
within the time limits prescribed.
D. Based on the responses received from the various departments and
agencies, the Planning Board shall establish, at the time of preliminary
approval, a rate of development of the entire subdivision or
development that will permit residential construction only when
improvements, services, and facilities will be adequate to serve the
residents of the subdivision or development. As part of such growth rate
plan, the Planning Board may require that improvements be installed,
or lots developed, in two or more phases.
E. If phasing is required, the Planning Board shall approve the master plan
for the entire site first. Thereafter, the applicant shall be required to
submit plans for preliminary and/or final review and/or approval
indicating the development of the entire site in two or more phases as
required by the Planning Board in Subsection D above. In such review
and approval, the Board may, in its discretion, impose conditions for
determining the physical limits of phases, for allowing progression to
additional phases, for allowing two or more phases to proceed in review
or construction simultaneously, for interim public improvements or
construction conditions, for changes to master or preliminary plans,
and may include other provisions as necessitated by special conditions,
including the applicant's actual provision of the necessary improvement
or a payment to a dedicated restricted account in lieu of actual
provision.
§ 300-34 YARD SALES § 300-34
279:355
§ 300-35. Conservation developments. [Amended 11-15-2007,
effective 12-20-2007]
F. The master plan documents shall contain information on the physical
limits of the phases, the schedule and sequence of public improvement
installation, improvement guarantees, and the work and completion
schedules for approvals and construction of the phases.
G. The master plan shall remain vested as long as it can be proved, to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board, that work is proceeding on either the
approval stages or on the construction of the development as shown in
the approved master plan documents. Vesting shall extend to all
information shown on the approved master plan documents.
H. Phasing of a proposed development may be otherwise requested by a
developer for his/her own reasons, but shall be subject to the
requirements for phasing as may be determined applicable by the
Planning Board when phasing is approved by the Planning Board.
A. Purpose. The purposes of this section, entitled "Conservation
developments," are:
(1) To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique
and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes,
streams, floodplains, wetlands, reservoirs and their drainage areas,
and agricultural lands, by setting them aside from development;
(2) To preserve historical, cultural, agricultural and archaeological
resources;
(3) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of
services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce
length of streets, utility runs, and the amount of paving required for
residential development;
(4) To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and layouts;
(5) To provide for a diversity of housing choices to accommodate a
variety of age and income groups and residential preferences, so
that the population diversity of the community may be maintained;
(6) To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of
irreplaceable and environmentally important resources as set forth
in the Comprehensive Plan;
(7) To provide reasonable incentives for the creation of a greenbelt/
trails system within the Town;
(8) To implement adopted land use, environmental and open space
policies as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan;
§ 300-34 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:356
(9) To protect areas of the Town with productive agricultural soils for
continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land
large enough to allow for efficient farm operations;
(10) To create neighborhoods with direct visual and/or physical access
to open land, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open
space, and with a strong neighborhood identity;
(11) To provide for the maintenance of open land set aside for active or
passive recreational use, stormwater drainage or conservation
lands;
(12) To conserve and create scenic views and preserve the rural
character of the Town; and
(13) To provide a buffer between new development and existing
neighborhoods, delicate natural features and habitats.
B. Applicability. The Planning Board may approve a proposed land
development project or subdivision in the form of a conservation
development only in accordance with the provisions of Article XII of the
Zoning Ordinance.
C. Procedures. Applications for conservation development approval shall
be made in accordance with the procedures for approval of a major or
minor subdivision or land development project based on the number of
lots or dwellings in the development as provided in Articles IV through
V of these Regulations.
D. Uses, lot area and dimensional regulations. The permitted uses,
maximum number of units, minimum lot areas and dimensional
regulations applicable to conservation development shall be those
provided in Article XII of the Zoning Ordinance.
E. Design process. The design of a conservation development shall follow
the design process specified in the following steps. As a guide in
designing conservation developments, applicants are encouraged to
review the provisions of the Rhode Island Conservation Development
Manual, RIDEM, June 2003, as amended, in the preparation of plans.
The maps illustrated in this manual will provide graphic examples of
what is required of applicants. When the master plan is submitted for
major land development projects or subdivisions, or preliminary plans
for minor land development projects or subdivisions, applicants shall
demonstrate to the Planning Board that this design process was
considered in determining the layout of proposed streets, building
locations, and open space. Checklists C, E and G56 provide the specific
information that must be provided.
(1) Step 1: Analyze the Site. The first step is to inventory existing site
features, taking care to identify sensitive and noteworthy natural,
56.Editor's Note: Checklists C, E and G are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:357
scenic and cultural resources on the site, and to determine the
connection of these important features to each other and strategies
for protection. For preapplication meetings, the applicant shall
submit the information required by the Preapplication Checklist.
For master plan meetings, this information shall be submitted in
the form of an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map, as
specified in § 300-35L.
(2) Step 2: Evaluate site context. The second step is to evaluate the site
in its larger context of the neighborhood and Town by identifying
physical (e.g., stream corridors, wetlands), transportation (e.g.,
street and bicycle networks), and cultural (e.g., open spaces,
recreational opportunities) connections to surrounding land uses
and activities. This information shall be submitted in the form of a
Site Context Map, as specified in § 300-35G.
(3) Step 3: Designate potential conservation areas. The third step is to
identify the areas on the site to be preserved on the site as open
space. The open space shall at a minimum include portions of the
site that are unsuitable for development and which constitute the
most sensitive and noteworthy natural, cultural and recreational
resources of the site. Where appropriate, areas that serve to extend
neighborhood open space networks to/from surrounding property
shall be identified. The designation of open space shall reflect
consistency with the Town of Glocester Comprehensive Plan.
(4) Step 4: Determine maximum number of units. At the master plan
stage for major subdivisions and major land development projects,
and at the preliminary stage for minor subdivisions and minor land
development projects, the applicant and Planning Board shall
agree upon an initial number of dwelling units that will be
permitted in the conservation development or subdivision, using
the yield plan approach as described in § 300-35H. The number of
units may be changed by the Planning Board during subsequent
stages of review, as more information is provided, until the final
basic maximum number of dwelling units is determined.
(5) Step 5: Locate development areas and explore conceptual
alternatives. As part of the preapplication submission, the
applicant shall show a minimum of two alternative proposed
development layouts in the form of a sketch plan(s), or sketch plan
overlay sheet(s), as described in § 300-35F. These alternative plans
shall be substantially different. The Planning Board shall review
how each alternative impacts the viability of the development plan,
versus the benefits to the Town of one or another approach. This
sketch plan shall be further refined for resubmission and discussion
between the Board and applicant during subsequent stages of
review as an overlay to the Existing Resources and Site Analysis
Map described in § 300-35L.
§ 300-35 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:358
(6) Step 6: Locate the house sites. The sixth step is to locate building
sites, using the proposed open space as a base map as well as other
relevant data on the Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map. The
design shall take into account the potential negative impacts of
residential development on nearby conservation areas as well as
the potential positive benefits of such locations to provide
attractive views and visual settings for residences, with emphasis
on consistency with Glocester's rural character.
(7) Step 7: Lay out streets, trails and other infrastructure. Upon
designation of the building sites, a street plan shall be designed to
provide vehicular access to each building, complying with the
standards herein and bearing a logical relationship to topographic
conditions. Detailed information regarding stormwater drainage,
water supply and sewage disposal, trails, sidewalks and other
infrastructure are also provided during this step.
(8) Step 8: Design and program open space. Details regarding the use,
design, ownership and management of proposed open spaces shall
be developed during the review process. Starting with conceptual
proposals at the early stages of review, the function of open space
areas shall be developed and refined. Based on review by the
Planning Board and other reviewers, these concepts shall be
clarified during the review process to establish as clear an
approach to the use and maintenance of open space as it does for
development areas.
(9) Step 9: Draw in the lot lines. Upon completion of the preceding
eight steps, the next step is simply to draw in the lot lines to
delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots (if
applicable).
(10) Step 10: Establish ownership and management of open space and
other community elements. At the time of preliminary review for
major land development projects or major subdivisions, or at the
time of final review for minor land development projects or minor
subdivisions, a more detailed open space use and management plan
as described in § 300-35I(1) through (5) shall be submitted.
F. Sketch plan overlay sheet.
(1) The design process described above shall be documented by the
applicant and presented to the Planning Board. To expedite this
process, a conceptual sketch plan(s) for development shall be
presented as overlay sheets to be superimposed on top of more
detailed site surveys and environmental data (at the same scale).
(2) At the preapplication stage of review, the initial sketch plan may be
presented as an overlay to survey plans, topographic maps or aerial
photographs of the parcel(s) proposed for development. As an
alternative, a separate diagrammatic sketch plan(s) may be
presented.
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:359
(3) At the preliminary stage of review for minor land development
projects and subdivisions, and at the master plan stage of review
for major land development projects and subdivisions, the sketch
plan of development shall be presented as an overlay to the
Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map.
G. Site Context Map.
(1) A map showing the location of the proposed development within its
neighborhood context shall be submitted. The Site Context Map,
which may be superimposed on an aerial photograph, shall be
drawn to a scale of one inch equals 400 feet or as necessary to
show the area within a one-half-mile radius of the subdivision
parcel. It shall show the locations of major streets and zoning
district boundaries. Major features that surround the site shall also
be indicated on this Map. Topography at ten-foot contour intervals
(from USGS maps) shall be shown.
(2) A separate soils map of the site and surrounding area shall be
prepared, along with a general analysis of soil types and suitability
for the development proposed. If present, agricultural land as
defined in Article X, and any very poorly drained soils shall also be
shown on this map.
H. Basic maximum number of dwelling units.
(1) The basic maximum number of dwelling units allowed on a parcel
of land proposed for development as a conservation development is
defined as the maximum number of single-family building lots or
dwelling units that could reasonably be expected to be developed
as a conventional subdivision upon that parcel under a
conventional yield plan as defined herein. The applicant shall have
the burden of proof with regard to the reasonableness and
feasibility of the design and of the engineering specifications for
such yield plan; provided, however, that the Planning Board's
determination of the basic maximum number shall be conclusive.
(2) Yield plans shall be prepared as conceptual layout plans in
accordance with the Preapplication Checklist (Checklist C57). Yield
plans shall show proposed streets, lots, rights-of-way, land
unsuitable for development and other pertinent features. The yield
plan must be drawn to scale, and it must be a realistic layout
reflecting a development pattern that could reasonably be expected
to be implemented, taking into account the presence of land
unsuitable for development (as defined in § 350-58 of the Zoning
Ordinance), existing easements or encumbrances and the
suitability of soils for subsurface sewage disposal.
(3) The yield plan shall also reflect the dimensional standards for uses
being proposed, as contained in the District Dimensional
57.Editor's Note: Checklist C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 300-35 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:360
Regulations in Article III of the Zoning Ordinance, and as further
provided in § 350-58 of the Zoning Ordinance. The yield plan must
identify how conventional lots or uses could be developed having
the required area, frontage and other dimensional requirements
of the Zoning Ordinance. Although lots shown in the yield plan
may contain land unsuitable for development, this area shall not be
counted towards the minimum lot area as provided in the Zoning
Ordinance.
(4) On sites served by individual sewage disposal systems (ISDS),
density shall be further determined by evaluating the number of
dwellings or other uses that could be supported by ISDS on lots in a
conventional subdivision. Lots or dwelling units shown on a yield
plan shall not include dwellings proposed to be serviced by an ISDS
that requires the granting of a variance by the Rhode Island
Department of Environmental Management. The Planning Board
shall determine the suitability of the parcel to be developed as a
conventional subdivision, based on the soils information provided
by the applicant, upon observations made during a site visit to the
property, and/or upon other evidence available to the Board at any
time during the development review process.
(5) Upon completion of its review, the Planning Board shall determine
the initial basic maximum number of lots/dwelling units permitted
in a development. This initial determination shall be made at the
master plan stage of review for major subdivisions and major land
development projects, and at the preliminary stage of review for
minor subdivisions and minor land development projects. The
applicant shall use this initial determination as the basis for
submission of more detailed information during subsequent stages
of review. Upon further investigation and upon receipt of more
detailed soils and environmental information as may be provided in
subsequent stages of review, the Planning Board may increase or
reduce the number of lots/dwelling units contained in the initial
basic maximum number. For all developments, the final basic
maximum number shall be established by the Planning Board at the
final stage of review.
(6) In developments that require alterations to be made to freshwater
wetlands, the Board may establish an initial basic maximum
number contingent upon confirmation by the Rhode Island
Department of Environmental Management that such alterations
are permitted under the provisions of the Freshwater Wetlands
Act.58
I. Open space. Every conservation development shall provide protected
open space lot or lots in accordance with the standards set forth below,
and in Article XII of the Zoning Ordinance.
58.Editor's Note: See R.I.G.L. § 2-1-18 et seq.
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:361
(1) The Planning Board shall specifically authorize plans for the use,
ownership, management and maintenance of all open space areas
within any conservation development. Areas proposed to fulfill the
minimum open space requirement within a conservation
development shall not be excavated or regraded, except as
permitted by the Planning Board. Disturbance to the natural
contours of the land shall be minimized to the greatest extent
possible. Existing natural vegetation and any significant natural or
man-made features shall be preserved except as permitted by the
Planning Board to create or enhance areas of landscaping, parks,
recreation, conservation, forestry or wildlife habitat. These
disturbances shall be specifically shown on the open space use
plan.
(2) At the time of master plan review by the Planning Board for major
subdivisions or land development projects, or preliminary review
for minor subdivisions or land development projects, the applicant
shall submit a separate open space use plan containing:
(a) The general location and area of all proposed open space;
(b) The general proposed use(s) of the open space;
(c) Existing topography and existing ground cover of open space
areas;
(d) The location and nature of any existing buildings, structures,
stone walls or other unique natural and/or historic features;
(e) Areas of open space from which existing vegetation will be
removed or altered and areas which are proposed to be
disturbed or otherwise graded, excavated or altered from their
existing natural state;
(f) Generalized proposals for the regrading, revegetating and/or
landscaping of proposed disturbed areas;
(g) The location and nature of any proposed buildings, structures,
parking areas, streets or roadways, impervious areas,
recreation areas; and
(h) Areas proposed to be left in their existing natural states
without any disturbance.
(3) At the time of preliminary review by the Planning Board, a more
detailed management plan that specifies the use of the open space
shall be submitted for review and approval, which may be
combined with any required grading plans, landscaping plans, soil
erosion plans or drainage plans required for preliminary approval.
The Planning Board shall require final construction plans to show
proposed open space use(s) and alterations required as a condition
of final approval.
§ 300-35 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:362
(4) Clearing and excavation of open space areas may be permitted only
for the installation of stormwater retention or detention facilities,
other drainage facilities, or for permitted utilities, park, open
space, recreational, agricultural or forest management uses in
accordance with a plan approved by the Planning Board.
(5) In addition, no commercial earth removal, even if permitted by the
Zoning Ordinance in the zoning district in which the development
is proposed, shall be permitted within any open space areas. In
approving an open space use plan, the Board may permit grading
that includes removal of earth materials. The Board shall, however,
clearly indicate, as a condition of preliminary approval, the
approximate quantities of material and the general areas from
which earth removal is authorized, and shall only authorize the
minimal amount of earth removal required to grade the land for the
intended purpose.
J. Open space design review standards.
(1) List of resources to be conserved. The design of open space lands in
any conservation development shall reflect the standards set forth
in this § 300-35 and, to the fullest extent possible, incorporate any
of the resources listed below if they occur on the parcel (not listed
in order of significance). The applicant should be consulting the
greenspace maps for natural, cultural and recreational resources
as identified in the Comprehensive Plan.
(a) Stream channels, floodplains, hydric soils, swales, springs, and
other freshwater wetland areas, including adjacent buffer
areas that may be required to ensure their protection.
(b) Wellhead protection areas.
(c) Special aquatic sites, vernal pools and significant natural areas
of species listed as endangered, threatened, or of special
concern, such as those listed in the Statewide Natural Heritage
Inventory.
(d) Moderate to steep slopes, particularly those adjoining
watercourses and ponds, where disturbance and resulting soil
erosion and sedimentation could be detrimental to water
quality.
(e) Healthy woodlands, particularly those performing important
ecological functions, such as soil stabilization and protection of
streams, wetlands, and wildlife habitats.
(f) Areas where precipitation is most likely to recharge local
groundwater resources because of topographic and soil
conditions affording high rates of infiltration and percolation.
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:363
(g) Areas where open space will mitigate the effects of stormwater
runoff, avoid or reduce non-point sources of watershed
pollution, or buffer surface watersheds or groundwater
resources.
(h) Hedgerows, groups of trees, location and species of large
individual trees of botanic significance, specimen vegetation
and other vegetation features representing the site's rural
past.
(i) Active agricultural uses, pastures, croplands, prime farmland
soils and farmland soils of statewide importance.
(j) Historic structures and archaeological sites.
(k) Visually prominent topographic features, such as knolls,
hilltops and ridges.

(m) Scenic viewsheds as seen from public streets (particularly
those with historic features).
(n) Existing or potential trails connecting the parcel to other
locations in the Town.
(o) Any other natural, cultural or recreational resources
determined by the Planning Board.
(2) Other design considerations. The configuration of proposed open
space lands set aside for common use in a conservation
development shall comply with the following standards:
(a) They shall be free of all structures except historic buildings or
structures, stone walls, and structures related to open space
uses. The Planning Board may grant approval of structures and
improvements required for storm drainage and privately
owned and maintained water supply within the open space,
provided that such facilities would not be detrimental to the
purpose for which the open space is proposed.
(b) Placement of individual sewage disposal systems (ISDS) within
the open space shall be permitted only if the Planning Board
determines that such placement would not cause irreparable
harm to the natural or scenic character of the open space, and
would otherwise be consistent with the purposes of
conservation developments as set forth in § 300-35A herein.
(c) They shall be directly accessible to the largest practicable
number of lots or dwellings within the development.
Nonadjoining lots shall be provided with safe and convenient
pedestrian access to open space land.
§ 300-35 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:364
(d) They shall be suitable for passive recreational uses to the
extent deemed necessary by the Planning Board, without
interfering with adjacent dwelling units, parking, driveways,
streets and roads.
(e) They shall be interconnected wherever possible to provide a
continuous network of greenway lands within and adjoining
the development.
(f) They shall provide buffers to adjoining parks, preserves or
other protected lands.
(g) They shall provide for pedestrian pathways for use by the
residents of the development. Consideration shall be given to
providing for public access on such trails if they are linked to
other publicly accessible pathway systems within the Town or
region. Provisions should be made for access to the open space
lands, as required for land management and emergency
purposes.
(h) Whenever possible, they shall be undivided by public or private
streets, except where necessary for proper traffic circulation.
(i) They shall be suitably landscaped either by retaining existing
natural cover and wooded areas and/or according to a
landscaping plan to protect open space resources.
(j) They shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Community
Plan.
K. Streets. Streets within a conservation development may be publicly or
privately owned as determined by the Planning Board, and maintained
and shall conform to the standards of § 300-31 of these Regulations.
Public and private streets shall be designed to conform to the standards
of the Town where the street is or may be ultimately intended for
dedication and acceptance by the Town. Private streets shall be
maintained by an association of unit owners or such other means or
entity as may be approved by the Planning Board.
L. Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map.
(1) All major subdivisions and land development projects, including all
conservation developments, shall be required to prepare an
Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map. Minor subdivisions and
land development projects which involve the creation or extension
of a street shall also be required to prepare this map.
Administrative subdivisions and subdivisions that create lots which
are not for the purpose of present or future development shall not
be required to provide such map. The purpose of this map is to
provide the Planning Board with a comprehensive analysis of
existing conditions, both on the proposed development site and
within 500 feet of the site. Conditions beyond the parcel boundaries
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:365
may be described on the basis of existing published data available
from governmental agencies and from aerial photographs.
(2) An Existing Resources and Site Analysis Map is required to be
prepared at the following stages of review of subdivisions and land
development projects:
(a) Checklists.59
[1] Checklist C: Checklist for Preapplication Meetings 
Major Land Development Projects/Major Subdivisions and
All Conservation Developments (Minor or Major).
[2] Checklist E: Preliminary Plat Checklist for Minor Land
Development Projects and Minor Subdivisions/(Creation or
Extension of a Public or Private Street).
[3] Checklist G: Master Plan Checklist for Major Land
Development Projects and Major Subdivisions.
(b) The checklists referenced above provide guidance to the
applicant regarding preparation and use of the map and its
components.
(3) The Planning Board shall review the map to assess its accuracy,
conformance with municipal ordinances and likely impact upon the
natural and cultural resources on the property. Unless otherwise
specified by the Planning Board, such plans shall generally be
prepared at the scale of one inch equals 100 feet or one inch equal
200 feet, whichever would fit best on a single standard size sheet
(24 inches by 36 inches). Where necessary for clarity, the map may
be submitted as a series of more than one map. The following
information shall be included in this map(s).
(a) Topography and slopes. Topography, the contour lines of which
shall generally be at ten-foot intervals, interpolated from USGS
published maps. More detailed topographic mapping with
contour intervals of two feet as determined by
photogrammetry or on-site survey shall be required in areas
proposed for development. The determination of appropriate
contour intervals shall be made by the administrative officer,
who may require greater or lesser intervals on exceptionally
steep or flat sites. Slopes between 15% and 25% and exceeding
25% shall be clearly indicated by shading on the map, and the
area thereof in acres shall be indicated. Topography for major
subdivisions shall be prepared by a professional land surveyor
or professional engineer from an actual field survey of the site
or from stereoscopic aerial photography and shall be
coordinated with official USGS benchmarks.
59.Editor's Note: The checklist are included at the end of this chapter.

(b) Natural resources inventory.
[1] The location and delineation of ponds, streams, ditches,
drains, special aquatic sites, vernal pools, natural drainage
swales, one-hundred-year floodplains and freshwater
wetlands, as defined in the Zoning Ordinance. Additional
areas of wetlands on the proposed development parcel
shall also be indicated, as evident from testing, visual
inspection, or from the presence of wetland vegetation.
[2] Vegetative cover conditions on the property according to
general cover type, including cultivated land, agricultural
land, permanent grass land, meadow, pasture, old field,
hedgerow, woodland and wetland. Trees with a caliper in
excess of 18 inches diameter at breast height, if located
within an area proposed for disturbance or alteration shall
also be indicated. Vegetative types shall be described by
plant community, relative age and condition. Specimen
vegetation as defined in Article X shall be identified.
[3] Soil series, types and map units, as mapped by the United
States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service, in the latest published soil survey for the state,
and accompanying data published for each soil relating to
its suitability for construction and for septic suitability.

Article X.
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-35
279:367
(d) Recreational resources inventory.
[1] Location of trails that have been in public use (pedestrian,
equestrian, bicycle, etc.).
[2] Boat launches, stream access locations and water trails.
[3] Existing play fields and recreation areas.
(e) Utilities and infrastructure.
[1] Location of all easements and other encumbrances of
property which are or have been filed of record with the
Land Evidence Records of the Town.
[2] Location of all streets and utilities.
M. Buffer areas. The Planning Board may require a vegetated buffer
between new development and existing streets, neighborhoods, active
farmland, adjacent park or conservation land, reservoir watersheds, or
other surrounding uses or areas in accordance with the standards set
forth herein. If property abutting the proposed conservation
development contains developed residential building lots, or if there are
existing residential structures within 100 feet of the perimeter of the
conservation development, the following conditions shall apply:
(1) Structures in the conservation development must be located to
meet at least the minimum rear yard setback as provided in
§ 350-13 of the Zoning Ordinance; and
(2) A permanent buffer along the perimeter of the conservation
development shall be established, providing for the preservation of
existing trees or other vegetation or for the planting of new
vegetation having adequate density, height and type of vegetation,
in order to provide an all-season visual and audio screen between
the conservation development and adjacent land uses. This buffer
may be provided in either of two alternative forms, to be
determined by the Planning Board:
(a) A separate open space lot or lots as provided in § 300-35I
above, entitled "Open space"; or
(b) A permanent easement along the perimeter of the conservation
development to be located along the rear or side property line
of the proposed lot or lots that abut the perimeter of the
conservation development. Said easement shall run in favor of
the Town and shall be for conservation or open space purposes
only. Where such easements are located on privately owned
lots, they shall not be counted toward the minimum required
open space area.
(3) The width of the required perimeter buffer shall be at least 50 feet;
provided, however, that the Planning Board may reduce this width
§ 300-35 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-35
279:368
§ 300-36. Development plan review.
(Reserved)
§ 300-37. Fee schedule. [Amended 2-17-2005, effective 3-16-2005;
11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
to a minimum of 10 feet. In making this determination, the
Planning Board shall consider the following factors:
(a) The nature of adjacent land uses existing at the time of master
plan review (or preliminary review for a minor subdivision or
land development project).
(b) The nature of proposed or projected future land uses on
adjacent property.
(c) The physical characteristics of adjacent property (e.g.,
wetlands, slopes, stone walls, etc.).
(d) The ownership of adjacent property (e.g., private, public,
nonprofit conservation, etc.).
(e) The zoning of adjacent property.
(f) The land use classification of adjacent property as provided on
the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Plan Map.
(4) If lots on the outer perimeter of the proposed conservation
development are not contiguous to developed residential building
lots outside the conservation development, the Planning Board
shall determine if a buffer is required.
(5) Lots on the outer perimeter of the proposed conservation
development, which are directly adjacent to a public street, must
be separated from said public street by a thickly wooded buffer or
screen of at least 100 feet in depth along the entire street frontage,
except for any necessary access streets.
N. Decision. The Planning Board may approve, approve with conditions, or
deny an application for a conservation development. In making this
decision, the Board shall make findings on the record as to whether the
conservation development better promotes the objectives of the Land
Development and Subdivision Regulations than would a conventional
development, and after consideration of the general requirements set
forth in § 300-8 herein and after consideration of the purposes of
conservation developments set forth in § 350-101A of the Zoning
Ordinance. The Planning Board may deny an application if, in the
opinion of the Board, the criteria set forth above are not met to the
satisfaction of the Board.
A. Administrative fees. Administrative fees as set from time to time by the
Town Council are required to be paid by an applicant for approval of
§ 300-35 YARD SALES § 300-37
279:369
any subdivision and/or land development project, for the adequate
review and hearing of applications. Building permits (See Chapter
368.), notice fees (See § 300-29D.), legal fees (See § 300-45.), and
inspection fees [See § 300-31A(6)(c).], erosion and sediment control
plan fees (See Chapter 177, Erosion and Sediment Control.) and the
recording of plats and plans (See § 300-45.) are separate from the fee
structure established in this section and shall also be the responsibility
of the applicant as applicable.
B. Project review fees.
(1) Applicability.
(a) In addition to an administrative fee, for all subdivisions and
land development projects, including conservation
developments, the Planning Board shall impose a project
review fee on those applications which require, in the
judgment of the Planning Board, review by outside consultants
due to the size, scale or complexity of a proposed project, the
project's potential impacts, or because the Town lacks the
necessary expertise to perform the review work related to the
permit or approval. The fee shall ultimately equal the actual
cost to the Town for such consultant. In hiring outside
consultants, the Town may engage engineers, surveyors,
planners, lawyers, landscape architects, architects, or other
appropriate professionals able to assist the Board and to
ensure compliance with all relevant laws, ordinances, and
regulations. Such assistance may include, but shall not be
limited to, analyzing an application, design review of
applications to determine consistency with the Comprehensive
Plan; determining consistency with the purposes and design
standards for conservation developments; assessing the
economic, archaeological, traffic or environmental impact of a
development proposal, review of unique site features including
trees; or for monitoring a project or site for compliance with
the Board's decisions or regulations.
(b) Project review fees are separate from, and in addition to, fees
imposed by the Town for inspecting a project during
construction or implementation as provided in § 300-31A(5).
(c) Administrative subdivisions and subdivisions that create lots
which are not for the purpose of present or future development
(e.g., open space lots) shall not be required to pay a project
review fee.
(2) Determination of applicability by Planning Board. The Planning
Board shall determine whether or not a project review fee must be
paid by the applicant. This determination may be made at the
preapplication conference, but no later than the master plan stage
of review for a major land development project or major
§ 300-37 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-37
279:370
subdivision; or at the time of informal concept review, if conducted,
for a minor land development project or minor subdivision. If an
informal concept review meeting is not held, no project review fee
shall be required.
(3) Submittal. Initial project review fees shall be submitted at the time
of the submittal of the master plan application (for major
subdivisions or land development projects) and at the time of the
submittal of the preliminary application (for minor subdivisions or
land development projects). These fees shall be held in custody by
the Finance Director (escrow account). Any application filed
without this fee shall be deemed incomplete, and no review work
shall commence until the fee has been paid in full.
(4) Schedule of initial project review fees. Project review fees shall be
as set from time to time by the Town Council.
(5) Replenishment. When the balance in an applicant's escrow account
falls below 25% of the initial project review fee, as imposed above,
the Planning Board may consider whether to require a
supplemental project review fee to cover the cost of the remaining
project review.
(6) Handling of project review fees. The project review fee is to be held
in an escrow account as established by the Finance Director. No
interest shall accrue on any funds held in this escrow account.
(a) Outside consultants retained by the Town to assist in the
review of an application shall be paid from this account.
(b) Project review fees may be used by the Town for the purposes
stated in Subsection B(1)(a) at any time during the review
process.
(c) Project review fees shall be turned over to the Finance
Director by the administrative officer to be held in an escrow
account.
(d) The Finance Director shall prepare a report for the
administrative officer on activity in the escrow account upon
request.
(e) An accounting of an applicant's funds held in the escrow
account may be requested by the applicant at any time. The
Finance Director shall respond to the request in a timely
fashion.
(f) An applicant may request the administrative officer to provide
an estimate of bills pending from consultants for work
completed, or in progress, but not yet invoiced.
(g) Excess fees in the escrow account shall be returned to the
applicant or the applicant's successor in interest. For the

overlap Town of Glocester boundaries.
purpose of this section, any person or entity claiming to be an
applicant's successor in interest shall provide the Board with
documentation establishing such succession in interest. Excess
fees shall be returned at the conclusion of the review process,
to be determined by the administrative officer as either:
[1] With the disapproval of a subdivision or land development
plan; or
[2] With the final approval of a subdivision or land
development plan; or
[3] If fees are proposed to be used to monitor the construction
of a site, with the release of the performance bond or other
financial guarantees at the end of construction; or
[4] If no financial guarantee is used, and if fees are proposed
to be used to monitor the construction of a site, with the
final inspection and approval of construction by the Town.
(7) Disqualification. The choice of a consultant hired by the Town for
the review of an application may be appealed as provided in Article
IX. Three circumstances may disqualify the selected consultant.
These conditions constitute the only grounds for an appeal.
(a) Conflict of interest: A consultant shall not have a financial
interest in the project under review or be in a position to
financially benefit in some way from the outcome of the
pending review process.

Zoning, and Planning Board approval, the applicant shall first
obtain an advisory recommendation from the Planning Board, as
well as conditional Planning Board approval for the first required
approval stage for the proposed project, which may be
simultaneous, then obtain conditional Zoning Board relief, and then
return to the Planning Board for subsequent required approval(s).

Chapter 350, Zoning, and Planning Board approval, the applicant
shall first obtain an advisory recommendation from the Planning
Board, as well as conditional Planning Board approval for the
preliminary approval stage for the proposed project, which may be
simultaneous, then obtain a conditional special use permit from the
Zoning Board, and then return to the Planning Board for

§ 300-41 GLOCESTER CODE § 300-43
279:376
extensive construction of improvements is sought. The waiver may
be granted only by a decision by the Planning Board finding that
the use will not affect existing drainage, circulation, relationship of
buildings to each other, landscaping, buffering, lighting and other
considerations of development plan approval, and that the existing
facilities do not require upgraded or additional site improvements.
(2) The application for a waiver of development plan approval review
shall include documentation, as required by the Planning Board, on

have the power to grant such waivers and/or modifications from the
requirements for subdivision approval as may be reasonable and within
the general purposes and intent of the provisions for local regulations.
The only grounds for such waivers and/or modifications shall be where
the literal enforcement of one or more provisions of the regulations is
impracticable and will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question or where such waiver and/
or modification is in the best interest of good planning practice and/or
design as evidenced by consistency with the Glocester Comprehensive
Plan and Chapter 350, Zoning.
C. Reinstatement of applications.

D. Appeals to the Board. Appeals to the Board may be taken by any party
aggrieved or by any officer, department, board or bureau affected by
the order or decision of the Inspector concerning the provisions of this
chapter or the Historic District Commission, in accordance with the
following provisions:

for appeal to the Board with the Inspector's office. A filing fee shall
be payable, as established, and may be amended, by the Town
Council, in accordance with Title 45, Chapter 24-59 of the Rhode
Island General Laws.
(2) An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Inspector certifies to the Board, after an
appeal shall have been duly filed, that by reason of facts stated in
the certificate a stay would in the Inspector's opinion cause
imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings shall
not be stayed other than by a restraining order, which may be
granted by a court of competent jurisdiction on application thereto
and upon notice to the Inspector from whom the appeal is taken on
due cause shown.
(3) Such application for appeal shall specify the nature of the
grievance and ground(s) therefor. The party from whom the appeal
§ 350-8 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-8

is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action or decision appealed
from was taken. Notice of the appeal shall also be transmitted to
the Planning Board.
(4) The Board shall fix a time for the hearing of the appeal within 45
days after the filing of an application for appeal, give public notice
thereof, as well as due notice to the parties of interest, as specified
elsewhere in this chapter and in accordance with Title 45, Chapter
24 of the Rhode Island General Laws, and decide the matter within
15 days of such public hearing. Upon the hearing, any party may
appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
(5) In exercising its powers regarding appeals, the Board may, in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, reverse or affirm
wholly or partly and may modify the order, requirement, decision,
or determination appealed from and may make such orders,
requirements, decisions, or determinations as ought to be made,
and to that end shall have the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal was taken. All decisions and records of the Board respecting
appeals shall conform to the provisions as specified elsewhere in
this chapter and in Title 45, Chapter 24-61 of the Rhode Island
General Laws.
E. Variances from this chapter. The Board may grant variances in the

(1) An application for relief from the literal requirements of this
chapter because of hardship may be made by any person, group,
agency, or corporation by filing with the Inspector an application
describing the request and supported by such data and evidence as
may be required by the Board, and amended from time to time, or
by the terms of this chapter, along with a fee, as established, and
may be amended, by the Town Council, in accordance with Title 45,
Chapter 24-59 of the Rhode Island General Laws. The Inspector
shall immediately transmit each application received to the Board
and shall transmit a copy of each application to the Planning Office
for distribution to the Planning Board.
(2) Immediately upon receipt of an application for a variance in the
application of the literal terms of this chapter, the Inspector shall
refer said application to the Planning Office and request that the
Planning Board provide findings and recommendations, including a
statement on the general consistency of the application with the
goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan of the Town, in
writing to the Board within 30 days of receipt of the application
from the Board. This report shall be entered into the record of the
proceedings. The Board shall hold a public hearing on any
application for variance in a manner as specified in § 350-8 in this
chapter, after receipt, in proper form, of an application, and shall
give public notice thereof at least 14 days prior to the date of the
§ 350-8 YARD SALES § 350-8
279:423
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town. Notice
of hearing shall be sent by certified or registered mail to the
applicant, and to at least all those who would require notice as
specified in § 350-7E(5) and (8) of this chapter, and in accordance
with Title 45, Chapter 24-53 of the Rhode Island General Laws. The
notice shall also include the street address of the subject property.
(3) In granting a variance, the Board shall require that evidence to the
satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of
the proceedings:
(a) That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due
to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure
and not to the general characteristics of the surrounding area;
and is not due to a physical or economic disability of the
applicant, excepting those physical disabilities addressed in
R.I.G.L. § 45-24-30(16); [Amended 3-15-2007, effective
3-15-2007]
(b) That the hardship is not the result of any prior action of the
applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the
applicant to realize greater financial gain;
(c) That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the
general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent
or purpose of this chapter or the Comprehensive Plan upon
which this chapter is based; and
(d) That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary.
(e) The Board shall, in addition to the preceding standards,
require that evidence be entered into the record of the
proceedings showing that:
[1] In granting a use variance the subject land or structure
cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform
to the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming use of
neighboring land or structures in the same district and
permitted use of lands or structures in an adjacent district
shall not be considered in granting a use variance; and
[2] In granting a dimensional variance, that the hardship that
will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the
dimensional variance is not granted shall amount to more
than a mere inconvenience. The fact that a use may be
more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable
after the relief is granted shall not be grounds for relief.
[Amended 3-15-2007, effective 3-15-2007]
(4) In granting a variance or in making any determination upon which
it is required to pass after a public hearing under this chapter, the
Board may apply such special conditions that may, in the opinion of
§ 350-8 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-8
279:424
the Board, be required to promote the intent and purposes of
the Comprehensive Plan and this chapter of the Town. Failure to
abide by any special conditions attached to a grant shall constitute
a zoning violation. Those special conditions shall be based on
competent credible evidence on the record, be incorporated into
the decision, and may include, but are not limited to, provisions for:
(a) Minimizing adverse impact of the development upon other
land, including the type, intensity, design, and performance of
activities;
(b) Controlling the sequence of development, including when it
must be commenced and completed;
(c) Controlling the duration of use or development and the time
within which any temporary structure must be removed;
(d) Assuring satisfactory installation and maintenance of required
public improvements;
(e) Designating the exact location and nature of development; and
(f) Establishing detailed records by submission of drawings,
maps, plats, or specifications.
F. Special use permits. The Board, upon application, in specific cases, may
authorize special use permits, where the Board is acting as the
permitting authority for special use permits, provided the Board shall
require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be
entered into the record of the proceedings during the public hearing on
such special use permit application and to determine whether the use
should be permitted, whether the use meets special safeguards and/or
conditions, and, whether in granting a special use permit, what
additional conditions and/or limitations may be necessary.
(1) Standards.
(a) The use is listed in the Table of Use Regulations,63 as specified
elsewhere in this chapter, that may be allowed by special use
permit, upon application to and favorable decision by the
Board;
(b) An application, as required by the Board, has been properly
filed with the Inspector and the requisite fee has been paid, as
established, and may be amended, by the Town Council, as
specified elsewhere in this chapter and in accordance with
Title 45, Chapter 24-59 of the Rhode Island General Laws;
(2) Immediately upon the receipt of an application for a special use
permit, the Inspector shall refer and request that the Planning
Board shall report its findings and recommendations, including a
63.Editor's Note: The Table of Use Regulations is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 350-8 YARD SALES § 350-8
279:425
statement on the general consistency of the application with the
goals and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan of the Town, in
writing to the Board within 30 days of receipt of the application
from the Board. This report shall be entered into the record of the
proceedings.
(3) The Board shall hold a public hearing on any application for a
special use permit in a manner as specified elsewhere in this
chapter, after receipt, in proper form, of an application, and shall
give public notice thereof at least 14 days prior to the date of the
hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town. Notice
of the hearing shall be sent by first class mail to the applicant, and
to at least all those who would require notice as specified in
§ 350-7E(5) and (8) of this chapter, and in accordance with Title 45,
Chapter 24-53 of the Rhode Island General Laws. The notice shall
also include the street address of the subject property.
(4) In granting a special use permit, the Board shall affirmatively
determine and enter into the record of the public hearing that:
(a) The proposed use shall be compatible with surrounding land
uses;
(b) The proposed use shall conform with the applicable elements
of the Glocester Comprehensive Community Plan;
(c) The proposed use shall be in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of this chapter;
(d) The public convenience and welfare will be substantially
served; and
(e) The proposed use shall not result in or create conditions that
will be inimical to the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare of the community.
(5) In granting a special use permit, the Board may apply such special
conditions as may, in the opinion of the Board, be required to
promote the intent and purposes of the Comprehensive Plan and

A. From the Zoning Board of Review.
(1) An aggrieved party may appeal a decision of the Board to the
Superior Court for Providence County by filing a complaint setting
forth the reasons of appeal within 20 days after the decision has
been recorded and posted in the office of the Town Clerk. The
decision shall be posted in a location visible to the public in the
Town hall for a period of 20 days following the recording of the
decision. The Board shall file the original documents acted upon by
it and constituting the record of the case appealed from, or
certified copies thereof, together with such other facts as may be
pertinent, with the Clerk of the Court within 30 days after being
served with a copy of the complaint. When the complaint is filed by
someone other than the original applicant or appellant, the original
§ 350-8 YARD SALES § 350-9
279:427
applicant or appellant and the members of the Board shall be made
parties to the proceedings. The appeal shall not stay proceedings
upon the decision appealed from, but the Court may, in its
discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms and make such other
orders as it deems necessary for an equitable disposition of the
appeal.
(2) If, before the date set for hearing in the Superior Court, an
application is made to the Court for leave to present additional
evidence before the Board and it is shown to the satisfaction of the
Court that the additional evidence is material and that there were
good reasons for the failure to present it at the hearing before the
Board, the Court may order that the additional evidence be taken
before the Board upon conditions determined by the Court. The
Board may modify its findings and decision by reason of the
additional evidence and shall file that evidence and any new
findings or decisions with the Superior Court.
(3) The review shall be conducted by the Superior Court without a jury.
The Court shall consider the record of the hearing before the Board
and, if it shall appear to the Court that additional evidence is
necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may allow any
party to the appeal to present the evidence in open court, which
evidence, along with the report, shall constitute the record upon
which the determination of the Court shall be made.
(4) The Court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the Board as
to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The Court may
affirm the decision of the Board or remand the case for further
proceedings, or may reverse or modify the decision if substantial
rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because of findings,
inferences, conclusions, or decisions which are:
(a) In violation of constitutional, statutory, or ordinance
provisions;
(b) In excess of the authority granted to the Board by statute or
ordinance;
(c) Made upon unlawful procedure;
(d) Affected by other error of law;
(e) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence of the whole record; or
(f) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion
or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.
(5) Upon the entry of any case or proceeding brought under the
provisions of this chapter or in accordance with Title 45, Chapter
24 of the Rhode Island General Laws, including pending appeals
§ 350-9 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-9
279:428
and appeals hereinafter taken to the Court, the Court shall, at the
request of either party, advance the case, so that the matter shall
be afforded precedence on the calendar and shall thereupon be
heard and determined with as little delay as possible.
B. From an act to adopt, amend, revise or repeal this chapter.
(1) An appeal of an enactment of or an amendment to this chapter may
be taken to the Superior Court for Providence County by filing a
complaint, as set forth herein, within 30 days after the enactment
or amendment has become effective. The appeal may be taken by
an aggrieved party or by any legal resident or landowner of the
Town or by any association of residents or landowners of the
municipality. The appeal shall not stay the enforcement of this
chapter, as enacted or amended, but the Court may, in its
discretion, grant a stay on appropriate terms, which may include
the filing of a bond, and make such other orders as it deems
necessary for an equitable disposition of the appeal.
(2) The complaint shall set forth with specificity the area or areas in
which the enactment or amendment does not conform with the
Comprehensive Plan and/or the manner in which it constitutes a
taking of private property without just compensation.
(3) The review shall be conducted by the Court without a jury. The
Court shall first consider whether the enactment or amendment of
the chapter is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. If the
enactment or amendment is not in conformance with the
Comprehensive Plan, then the Court shall invalidate the enactment
or the amendment, or those parts of the enactment or amendment
which are not in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. The
Court shall not revise the ordinance to conform with the
Comprehensive Plan, but may suggest appropriate language as
part of the Court decision.
(4) In the case of an aggrieved party, where the Court has found that
the enactment or amendment of the chapter is in conformance with
the Comprehensive Plan, then the Court shall next determine
whether the enactment or amendment works as a taking of
property from the aggrieved party. If the Court determines that
there has been a taking, the Court shall remand the case to the
Town Council, with its findings that a taking has occurred, and
order the municipality to either provide just compensation or
rescind the enactment or amendment within 30 days.
(5) The Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction, in the event that the
aggrieved party and the Town do not agree on the amount of
compensation, in which case the Superior Court shall hold further
hearings to determine and to award compensation. Furthermore,
the Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction to determine the
§ 350-9 YARD SALES § 350-9
279:429
§ 350-10. Judicial aid in enforcement; vested rights.
amount of an award of compensation for any temporary taking, if
that taking shall exist.
(6) The Court may, in its discretion, upon motion of the parties or on its
own motion, award reasonable attorney's fees to any party to an
appeal, as set forth herein, including the Town.
(7) In case there is filed in the office of the Town Clerk on or before the
day of a public hearing held by the Town Council regarding
adoption, amendment, revision or repeal of any section or sections
of this chapter or within three days thereafter, a written protest
against the petition request pending or voted on by the Town
Council, signed by the owners of 20% or more of the street frontage
directly opposite the property proposed to be affected or by the
owners of property abutting on 20% or more at the boundary line
between the property proposed to be affected and the property
immediately in the rear thereof when there is no street between
said properties, no change shall be passed, except by three-fifths
vote of the Town Council.
A. Judicial aid in enforcement. The Supreme Court and the Superior Court,
within their respective jurisdictions, or any justice of either of those
courts in vacation, shall, upon due proceedings in the name of the
Town, instituted by the Town Solicitor, have power to issue any
extraordinary writ or to proceed according to the course of law or
equity or both:
(1) To restrain the erection, alteration, or use of any building,
structure, sign, or land erected, altered, or used in violation of the
provisions of this chapter, enacted under the authority of Title 45,
Chapter 24 of the Rhode Island General Laws, and to order its
removal or abatement as a nuisance;
(2) To compel compliance with the provisions of this chapter enacted
under the authority of said Title 45, Chapter 24;
(3) To order the removal by the property owner of any building,
structure, sign, or improvement existing in violation of this chapter
enacted under the provisions of said Title 45, Chapter 24, and to
authorize the Inspector of the Town, in the default of the removal
by the owner, to remove it at the expense of the owner;
(4) To order the reimbursement for any work or materials which shall
have been done or furnished by or at the cost of the Town;
(5) To order restoration by the owner, where practicable; and/or
(6) To issue fines and other penalties.
B. Vested rights.

279:430
(1) Any application(s) for development(s) that are substantially
complete and have been submitted for approval to the appropriate
review agency in the Town prior to enactment of this chapter shall
be considered by the Town under the protection of this section and
shall be reviewed according to the regulations applicable in the
chapter in force at the time the application was submitted. If an
application for development under the provisions of this section is
approved, failure to initiate and/or complete the improvement of
the property(ies) prior to the time limits that may be established at
the time of approval, shall render the aforementioned approval null
and void. Any subsequent proposal for development of the property,
whether or not the proposal is substantially similar to any
previously approved plan, shall require a resubmission of
development plans by the applicant, subject to the current
regulations in effect at the time of such resubmission.
(2) For the purposes of this section, substantially complete shall
mean that any application shall have been deemed such by the local
official designated to receive such applications, as specified
elsewhere in this chapter, and that all required forms, plans,
signatures, fees, supporting documentation and other required
information has been received and certified by the proper local
official to be in proper order. Failure to submit the required

ARTICLE IV
Planned Districts
§ 350-14. Findings.
It has become readily apparent that residential development dominates
the economic base and land use pattern of the Town of Glocester. It has
become equally apparent that the scattered residential pattern resulting
from houses placed far apart not only has accentuated the great burden and
expense of providing adequate community facilities and services, but has
destroyed the concept of an integrated community.
§ 350-15. Purpose.
§ 350-16. Objectives.
The objectives of planned districts are to:
A. The purposes of this article are to:
(1) Encourage and provide a means for effectuating desirable
residential, industrial and commercial development, and
conservation in the Town of Glocester, which will feature variations
in siting mixed land uses and/or varied dwelling types;
(2) Preserve open space for community facilities and aesthetic
considerations; and
(3) Provide more efficient and economical services and facilities to the
residents of the area.
B. The amenities and compatibility of planned districts, hereinafter "PDistricts,"
are to be insured through adoption and periodic updating of
a Comprehensive Community Plan reflecting the physical development
goals of the community.
A. Provide a more desirable living environment than would be possible
through the strict application of chapter requirements.
B. Encourage developers to use more creative approaches in the
development of land.
C. Encourage a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable use of open areas.
D. Encourage variety in the physical development pattern of the Town.
E. Maximize individual freedom of choice regarding the personal living
environment.
§ 350-14 YARD SALES § 350-17
279:437
§ 350-17. Standards and requirements for P-Districts.
The following provisions shall apply in a P-District, which district shall also
be subject to other provisions of this chapter, except that where conflict in
regulations occurs, the regulations specified in this article shall apply.
A. P-Districts may be established on parcels of land which are suitable for,
and of sufficient size to be planned and developed in a manner
consistent with the purpose of this article and the objectives of this
chapter. No P-District shall include less than 25 acres of contiguous
land unless the Planning Board and the Town Council find that property
of less acreage is suitable as a P-District by virtue of its unique
historical character, topography, or land features.
B. No P-District shall be established or plans reviewed by the Planning
Board unless and until there is on file with the Town written consent of
every property owner within such district at the time of the
establishment of the district agreeing that the applicant shall be bound
by the conditions and regulations proposed and which will be effective
within the district.
C. Standards for area, coverage, density, yard requirements, parking and
screening for P-District uses shall be governed by the standards of the
residential, commercial and industrial zoning district most similar in
nature and function to the proposed P-District use(s), as determined by
the Planning Board. Standards for public improvements shall be
governed by applicable ordinances of the Town. Exceptions to these
standards by the Planning Board and Town Council are possible when
these bodies find that such exceptions encourage a desirable living
environment and are warranted in terms of total proposed development
or unit thereof.
D. The gross population density and building intensity of any area
proposed for development under the planned unit approach may be
increased and therefore do not have to conform to the basic overall
density and building intensity requirements of the zoning district. In
addition, lot dimensions, building setbacks and area do not have to
meet the specific ordinance requirements, provided that a more
functional and desirable use of the property is made.
E. Lot size and layout.
(1) Residential lot sizes related to single-family detached units may be
reduced as follows (provided that public water and sewers are
available):
(a) A-4: 60,000 square feet (with public water and sewers).
(b) A-3: 40,000 square feet (with public water and sewers).
(c) R-2: 20,000 square feet (with public water and sewers).
§ 350-17 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-17
279:438
(2) Drawings must be submitted that show that the relationship of
interior and exterior living or working area is desirable and
adequate and that the living and working environment is just as
desirable as the strict requirements of this chapter. Building
intensities may be increased if, in the opinion of the Planning Board
and the Town Council, the character and configuration of the land
will accommodate the increased density and that such development
will not violate the intent or character of the proposed P-District.
F. For each six square feet of land gained within a residential subdivision,
through the reduction of lot size below minimum chapter requirements,
or other means, one square foot of land shall be dedicated to the Town,
either by rights in fee or through a conservation easement, and retained
as open space for park, recreational and related uses. All lands
dedicated in fee or easement must meet the Town's requirements.
G. All water supply sources and sewage treatment systems must be
consistent with Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management regulations. All such regulations are hereby considered as
part of this chapter together with any new regulations that the Rhode
Island Department of Environmental Management may add from time
to time.
H. Ownership and maintenance of water and sewer facilities must be
arranged to the satisfaction of the Town of Glocester prior to final
approval of a P-District.
I. Townhouses.
(1) In areas where townhouses are uses, there shall be no more than
five townhouse units in any contiguous group. A townhouse is
defined as a single-family dwelling with no side yards between
adjacent townhouses.
(2) A variety of building setbacks, color and building materials for
contiguous townhouse units is encouraged. An average rear yard
depth shall be a minimum of 25 feet where the lot does not abut a
park or open space easement. A minimum side yard between the
two end units, or contiguous townhouse groups, shall be a
minimum of 80 feet plus five feet for each additional story over one
story for the end units.
J. All areas proposed for dedication to the Town under the planned
districts approach must be acceptable as to shape, size and location, as
required by the Glocester Planning Board.
K. In all areas proposed as homeowner parks or similar approaches, if
using the advantages of the planned districts approach, the developer
must convey to the Town the development rights (i.e., conservation,
recreational and open space easement) and must meet the
requirements of the Planning Board as to shape, size and location.
§ 350-17 YARD SALES § 350-17
279:439
§ 350-18. Procedure and applications.
L. Rights-of-way for riding, hiking or other types of trails and scenic ways
may be dedicated in fee to the Town through a space exchange by
reduction in lot sizes on a six-to-one basis, provided that the
requirements as to area and location meet the requirements of the
Planning Board. Rights-of-way for watercourses and other similar
channels are not acceptable for space exchange under planned unit
development. However, the portion of the right-of-way that is usable as
a trail or similar way may be acceptable but must be approved by the
Glocester Planning Board.
M. A possible clustering of dwellings may be accomplished through
reduction of lot area and the provision of usable and desirable open
space easements dedicated to the Town; size and location of such
easements to be subject to approval by the Planning Board.
N. Public utility and other similar easements cannot be used for a space
exchange under the planned district approach.
O. Any subdivision which includes the proposal to dedicate to the Town
land for park and open space use, under the planned district approach,
must include, by dedication or by other reasonable means, the total
park area, at the time of filing of the final map on all, or any portion, of
the tract or tracts.
P. The Town will do the basic working drawings and landscape
architectural design for all areas dedicated to the Town for public
purpose and provide the basic landscape requirements if the developer
will do the grading and reasonable contouring work to an approved
plan; the necessary grading plan of the park to be provided by the Town
upon a minimum of 30 days' notice by the developer at the tentative
map stage.
Q. Planned district development is not limited to the creation of park area.
Application could be made to permit variety in the location of dwelling
units within the subdivision.
R. A diversification of lot sizes may be permitted within a zoning district
without the dedication or creation of park areas, provided the overall
density of the zoning district is not increased.
S. Note: The developer is encouraged to obtain a trained and experienced
land planner, registered architect, and/or landscape architect to
prepare plans for all planned district developments, to enable the most
expedient processing of such developers. The use, by developers, of
qualified professionals to do plans for planned district developments
enables the Planning Board to reduce the time it must spend on said
development.
A. Preliminary development plan review and approval.
§ 350-17 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-18
279:440
(1) The applicant shall submit a preliminary development plan to the
Planning Board for review and approval in principle under the
applicable provisions of Chapter 300, Subdivision of Land, and the
Planning Board shall so approve prior to the submission of a PDistrict
rezoning application (application for amendment of this
chapter). The tentative written consent of all property owners
within the proposed P-District shall be on file with the Town before
Planning Board review of a preliminary development plan shall be
commenced.
(2) Approval in principle of the preliminary development plan shall be
limited to conformance to subdivision regulations and to the
general acceptability of the land uses proposed and their
interrelationship, and shall not be construed to endorse the precise
location of uses, configuration of parcels, or engineering feasibility.
Any preliminary development plan and text shall be prepared and
endorsed by a qualified land planning specialist (planner architect,
landscape architect or engineer) and shall include the following
information presented in a general, schematic fashion:

applicant proposed an exception from standard zoning district or
other ordinance regulations governing development.
(4) Evidence that the applicant has sufficient control over the land to
effectuate the proposed plan.
(5) Engineering feasibility studies as necessary.
(6) Any additional information that the Glocester Planning Board may

provided the change is in accord with the intent expressed in the
general development plan.
(6) Any additional information that the Glocester Planning Board may
require.
A. The proposed P-District, or given unit thereof, can be substantially
completed within four years of the establishment of the P-District.
B. Each individual unit of development, as well as the total development,
can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an environment of
sustained desirability and stability or that adequate assurance will be
provided that such objective will be attained; that the uses proposed
will not be detrimental to present and potential surrounding uses, but
will have a beneficial effect which could not be achieved under other
zoning districts;
C. The streets and thoroughfares proposed are suitable and adequate to
carry anticipated traffic, and increased densities will not generate
traffic in such amounts as to overload the street network outside the PDistrict;
D. Any proposed commercial development can be justified economically at
the location proposed to provide for adequate commercial facilities of
the types proposed;
E. Any exception from standard chapter requirements is warranted by the
design and amenities incorporated in the general development plan;

279:443
§ 350-20. Planning Board and Town Council action.
§ 350-21. Utilities.
Underground utilities, including telephone and electrical systems, are
required within the limits of all P-Districts. Appurtenances to these systems
which can be effectively screened may be excepted from this requirement
if the Planning Board finds that such exception will not violate the intent or
character of the proposed P-District.
§ 350-22. P-Districts created.
Pursuant to this article and R.I.G.L. §§ 45-24-1 and 45-24-4, the Town
Council of the Town of Glocester hereby establishes P-Districts as follows:
G. The P-District is in conformance with the general plan of the Town of
Glocester; and
H. Existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the population
densities proposed.
A. If from the facts presented the Planning Board or the Town Council is
unable to make the necessary findings, the application shall be denied.
In no instance shall a Planning Board decision be binding on any action
by the Town Council relative to granting a zone change for a P-District.
B. In taking action, the Planning Board may deny the general development
plan and general development schedule as submitted, or may
recommend approval of said plan and schedule subject to specified
amendments.
C. Major changes in a general development plan shall be considered the

§ 350-55. Special flood hazard areas and flood-fringe lands.
[Amended 2-24-2009, effective 2-24-2009]
F. Unless plans requiring Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management approvals or permits are accompanied by evidence of
such approvals, any approval of plans by the Zoning Board of Review
shall be conditioned upon such state agency approval.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to ensure public safety;
minimize hazards to persons and property from flooding, to protect
watercourses from encroachment and to maintain the capability of
floodplains to retain and carry off floodwaters.
B. Applicability.
(1) The Town elects to comply with the requirements of the National
Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as amended). The
National Flood Insurance Program, established in the aforesaid act,
provides that areas of the Town having a special flood hazard be
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and that floodplain management measures be applied in such flood
hazard areas. The requirements of this § 350-55 shall apply to any
construction or other development which lies wholly or partly
within an area of special flood hazard, as identified as Zone A, AE,
AH, AO, A1-30, A99, V, V1-30, VE on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
(FIRM) and Flood Hazard Boundary Map prepared by Federal
Emergency Management Agency dated March 2, 2009. Said Flood
Map, including any amendments adopted after the date hereof, is
hereby made part of this section. The exact boundaries of the
District may be defined by the one-hundred-year base flood
elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Flood
Insurance Study booklet revised March 2, 2009.
(2) The degree of flood protection required by the section is considered
reasonable but does not imply total flood protection. If any section,
provision, or portion of this section is adjudged unconstitutional or
invalid by a court, the remainder of the section shall control.
(3) For the purposes of this section, "other development" shall be
defined as any action exclusive of that which requires the issuance
of a building permit under the Rhode Island State Building Code.
Such other development shall include, but not necessarily be
limited to, the following:
(a) Earth, gravel or mineral removal or extraction.
(b) Alteration of the topography by cutting, filling or grading.
(c) Storage of bulk materials outside of a structure.
(d) Construction or placement of facilities or improvements not
normally requiring a building permit.
§ 350-54 YARD SALES § 350-55
279:475
(4) The requirements set forth in this section shall be in addition to any
applicable requirements in this chapter and in any other regulation
which may be applicable.

more than one foot. For the purposes of these regulations, the term
"regulatory floodway" is synonymous in meaning with the term
"floodway."
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE OR FACILITY  A use or facility
that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried
out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking
facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading

structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and
intended to be improved property.
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or MANUFACTURED HOME
SUBDIVISION  A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two
or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
MARKET VALUE  Market value is the price of a structure that a
willing buyer and seller agree upon. This can be determined by an
independent appraisal by a professional appraiser; the property's tax
assessment minus land value; the replacement cost minus depreciation
of the structure; the structure's actual cash value.
MEAN SEA LEVEL (MSL)  Avenge height of the sea for all stages
of the tide, usually determined from hourly height observations over
a nineteen-year period on an open coast or in adjacent waters having

community.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  A vehicle which is:
REGULATORY FLOODWAY  See definition for "floodway."
SHEET FLOW AREA  (For community with AO, AH, or VO Zones only.)
See definition for "area of shallow flooding."
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. SFHAs are determined utilizing the base
flood elevations (BFE) provided on the flood profiles in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for a community. BFEs provided on Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) are only approximate (rounded up or
down) and should be verified with the BFEs published in the FIS for a
specific location. SFHAs include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
land shown as Zones A, A1-30, AE, AO, AH, and the coastal high hazard
areas shown as Zones V, V1-30, and VE on a FIRM. The SFHA is also
called the "area of special flood hazard."
START OF CONSTRUCTION  For other than new construction or
substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L.
97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial
improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration
(1) Built on a single chassis;
Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
(2)
Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a lightduty
truck; and
(3)
Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
a temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
(4)
§ 350-55 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-55
279:480
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building which is principally above
the ground, including a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage
tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value
of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT 
VARIANCE  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the
floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner
otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in
unnecessary hardship.
VIOLATION  Failure of a structure or other development to be fully
complaint with the community's floodplain management ordinance. A
structure or other development without required permits, lowest floor
elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required
floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION  The height, in relation to the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where
specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.
Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
alterations, additions or other improvements to a structure, taking
place during a ten-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure as determined
at the beginning of such ten-year period. This term includes
structures that have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of
the actual repair work performed. For purposes of this definition,
"substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of
the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
(1)
The term does not, however, include either:
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
(a)
Any alteration of an "historic" structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an "historic structure."
(b)
(2)
§ 350-55 YARD SALES § 350-55
279:481
WET FLOODPROOFING  Measures designed to minimize damage to
a structure or its contents by water that is allowed into a building.
D. Permit required.
(1) Except where construction is covered by a building permit or by
approval of a subdivision plat by the Glocester Planning Board, any
other development shall require the issuance of a development
permit by the Building Official or his or her designee. Said permit
shall be in a form authorized by the Town Council.
(2) The application for a flood hazard development permit shall be
submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer and shall include:

the assistance of a professional engineer.
F. Review of flood hazard development permit applications. The Building
Official or his or her designee shall:
(1) Review all applications for flood hazard development permits to
determine that all pertinent requirements as described Subsection
G of this section have been or will be met;
(2) Utilize, in the review of all flood hazard development permit
applications, the base flood data contained in the "Flood Insurance
Study--Town of Glocester, Rhode Island, Providence County," as
described in Subsection B.
(3) Make interpretations of the location of boundaries of special flood
hazard areas shown on maps described in Subsection B;
(4) In A Zones, in absence of FEMA BFE data and floodway data,
obtain, review, and reasonably utilize other BFE and floodway data
as a basis for elevating residential structures to or above the base
flood level, and for floodproofing or elevating nonresidential
structures to or above the base flood level.
(5) In review of flood hazard development permit applications,
determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from
those federal, state and local government agencies from which
prior approval is required;
(6) Notify adjacent municipalities, the State Department of
Environmental Management and the State Bureau of Civil
Emergency Preparedness prior to any alteration or relocation of a
watercourse and submit copies of such notifications to the Federal

altered watercourse; and
(7) Maintain, as a permanent record, copies of all flood hazard
development permits issued and data relevant thereto, including
reports of the zoning board of review on variances.
G. Development standards. The following standards shall apply to any
construction or other development located wholly or partly within an
area of special flood hazard as defined in Subsection B. Please also
refer to the current Rhode Island State Building Code, One and Two
Family Dwelling Code, Plumbing Code, Mechanical Code, and Electrical
for state standards or any other applicable codes.
(1) No watercourse may be altered in a manner which will, in the
opinion of the Building Official or his or her designee, result in any
decrease in the capacity of the watercourse, and no land shall be
graded or altered in such a manner as to increase the base flood
elevation within the Town of Glocester. Where any alteration is
§ 350-55 YARD SALES § 350-55
279:483
permitted, the Building Official or his or her designee will notify
the adjacent communities, the Rhode Island Statewide Planning
Program and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(2) In a regulatory floodway, any encroachment is prohibited which
would cause any increase in the base flood level unless hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses prove that the proposed encroachment
would not increase flood levels during the base flood discharge.
(3) The filling or excavation of land may be permitted only under the
following conditions:
(a) Said action will not encroach upon a watercourse.
(b) Said action will not result in an increase in the potential flood
level. Where it is determined that said action may result in an
increase in the potential flood level, the Building Official or his
or her designee shall require appropriate measures to offset
the potential increase. Adequate drainage shall be provided so
as to reduce the exposure of the site or any other land to flood
hazard.
(4) No outdoor storage of materials or equipment which is likely to
cause damage to property, create a potential obstruction to
floodwaters, create a potential fire hazard or pollute the waters
during flood periods shall be permitted in any special flood hazard
area. Such materials or equipment shall include but not necessarily
be limited to lumber and other buoyant materials, water-soluble
materials, volatile or flammable materials, acids or poisons.
(5) Provision shall be made for anchoring facilities, equipment or yard
features which are capable of movement or flotation in floodwaters.
Such items shall include but shall not necessarily be limited to
fences, sheds, animal shelters, tanks, storage boxes, planters,
vehicles, boats and other items normally positioned or stored on a
site outside of a structure.
(6) The use of flood-resistant materials shall be used for structures
within an area of special flood hazard as defined in Subsection B.
(7) Construction methods and practices shall be used that minimize
flood damage.
(8) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air-conditioning
equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located to prevent water entry to accumulation.
(9) On-site waste disposal systems shall be designed to avoid
impairment or contamination of the floodway.
(10)New and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration.
§ 350-55 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-55
279:484
(11) Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or
other development greater than 50 lots or five acres.
H. Construction Standards in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA), Zones
A, A1-30, AE.
(1) Residential construction. All new construction, substantial
improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained
substantial damage shall have the bottom of the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation
(BFE).
(2) Nonresidential construction. All new construction, substantial
improvements, and repair to structures that have sustained
substantial damage which are commercial, industrial or
nonresidential structures shall:
(a) Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the base flood elevation (BFE); or
(b) In lieu of being elevated, nonresidential structures may be dry
floodproofed to one foot above the BFE, provided that together
with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities the areas of
the structure below the required elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
provided that such structures are composed of structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Rhode
Island-registered professional engineer or architect shall
review and/or develop structural design specifications and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable
standards of practice or meeting the provisions of this section.
Such certification shall be provided to the Building Official or
his or her designee.
(3) Fully enclosed areas below the base flood elevation of elevated
buildings. All new construction, substantial improvements, or
repair of substantial damage to residential or nonresidential
structures that include fully enclosed areas formed by a foundation
and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation (BFE) of an
elevated building shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and be designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters
to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
(wet floodproofing). Designs for complying with this requirement
must either be certified by a Rhode Island-registered professional
engineer or architect, or meet the following minimum criteria listed
in Subsections H(3)(a) through (g) below:
(a) Provide a minimum of two openings (hydraulic flood vents)
having a total net area of not less than one square inch for
every one square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding.
§ 350-55 YARD SALES § 350-55
279:485
These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two
different walls. Only the area (square footage) that lies below
the BFE can be used in the calculation of net area of vents
required;
(b) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade. At least one side of the structure's fully enclosed
area must be at or above grade. Fill placed around the
foundation walls must be graded so that the elevation inside
the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent
outside elevation on at least one side of the building. The
foundation slab of a residential structure, including the slab of
a crawl space, must be set equal to the outside finished grade
on at least one side of the building;
(c) The openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters in both directions without any
external influence or control such as human intervention,
including the use of electrical and other nonautomatic
mechanical means. Other coverings may be designed and
certified by an engineer or approved by the Building Official or
his or her designee.
(d) The area cannot be used as finished living space. Use of the
enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary and shall only
be used for the parking of vehicles, building access or limited
storage. Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for the parking of vehicles (garage door) or
limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection
with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the
living area (stairway or elevator). The enclosed area shall not
be used for human habitation or partitioned into separate
rooms;
(e) All interior walls, floor, and ceiling materials located below the
BFE shall be unfinished and resistant to flood damage.
(f) Electrical, plumbing, machinery or other utility equipment that
services the structure (furnaces, oil or propane tanks, air
conditioners, heat pumps, hot-water heaters, ventilation,
washers, dryers, electrical junction boxes, circuit-breaker
boxes and food freezers) are prohibited in the fully enclosed
area below the BFE. Utilities or service equipment located in
this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the space,
will subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates.
(g) A residential building with a structurally attached garage
having the floor slab below the BFE is considered an enclosed
area below the BFE and must meet the standards of
Subsections H(3). A garage attached to a residential structure,
§ 350-55 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-55
279:486
constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must
be designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters in both directions. Flood openings or vents are
required in the exterior walls of the garage or in the garage
doors. The human intervention necessary to open garage doors
when flooding occurs is not an acceptable means of meeting
the openings requirements. In addition to the automatic entry
of floodwaters, the areas of the garage below BFE must be
constructed with flood-resistant materials. Garages attached to
nonresidential structures must also meet the aforementioned
requirements or be dry floodproofed as per the requirements
of Subsection H(2) of this section.
(4) Manufactured (mobile) homes and recreational vehicles (RVs).
(a) In all special flood hazard areas (SFHA), any manufactured
(mobile) homes to be newly placed, substantially improved or
repaired as a result of substantial damage shall be elevated so
that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood
elevation (BFE). This includes SFHAs outside a manufactured
home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or
subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park in which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a
result of a flood.
(b) All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be
placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely
anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so
that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic
pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the
use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
(c) All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be
installed using methods and practices which minimize flood
damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided.
Elevation construction standards include piling foundations
placed no more than 10 feet apart, and reinforcement is
provided for piers more than six feet above ground level.
(d) Recreational vehicles.
[1] Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall
either:
[a] Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days,
and be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
[b] Be elevated and anchored.
[2] A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its
wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
§ 350-55 YARD SALES § 350-55
279:487
quick-disconnect-type utilities and security devices, and
has no permanently attached additions.
(e) Public utilities and facilities in manufactured (mobile) homes
or subdivisions with a SFHA shall be constructed so as to
minimize flood damage.
(5) Accessory structures. Detached accessory structures in Zones A,
AE, A1-30, AO, and AH (i.e., garages, sheds) do not have to meet
the elevation or dry floodproofing requirement if the following
standards are met:
(a) The structure is no more than 500 square feet and has a value
less than $3,000.
(b) The structure has unfinished interiors and must not be used for
human habitation. An apartment, office or other finished space
over a detached garage is considered human habitation and
would require the structure to be elevated.
(c) The structure is used solely for parking of vehicles and/or
limited storage.
(d) The accessory structure must be wet-floodproofed and
designed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwater.
(e) The accessory structure shall be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
(f) Service facilities such as electrical, mechanical and heating
equipment must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the
base flood elevation.
(g) The structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provision in Subsection G, Development standards, in this
section.
I. Variance.
(1) The Zoning Board of Review may hear and grant a variance in
accordance with the procedure outlined in § 350-8E. In addition to
applying the criteria and requirements of said section, the Board
shall undertake the following in granting a variance from the
provisions of this section:
(a) Describe in its decision the exact extent of the variance
granted.
(b) Indicate in its decision that the granting of such variance may
affect the flood insurance rates as they apply to the subject
property up to amounts as high as $25 per $100 of insurance
coverage, and further, that construction or other development
§ 350-55 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-55
279:488
§ 350-56. Wireless communications facilities.
below the base flood elevation may increase risk to life and
property.
(c) Forward a copy of its written decision and findings to the
applicant, the Building Official or his or her designee, the
Rhode Island Statewide Planning Program and the Federal
Insurance Administration in the annual report of the Town to
the administration.
(2) No variance may be granted which will result in any increase in
flood levels.
J. Enforcement.
(1) It shall be the duty of the Building Official or his or her designee to
enforce the provisions of this section. If the Code Enforcement
Officer finds that any provisions of this section are being violated,
he shall notify, in writing, the person responsible for such violation
indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action
necessary to correct it.
(2) When the above action does not result in the correction or
abatement of the violation, the municipal officers, upon notice from
the Code Enforcement Officer, are hereby authorized and directed
to institute any and all actions, whether legal or equitable,
necessary to the enforcement of this section. Any person who
continues to violate any provision of this section after receiving
notice of such violation shall be guilty of a violation of this chapter
and subject to a fine of $500 per day for each violation. Each day
such a violation is continued is a separate offense.
A. Intent.
(1) The Town Council finds, pursuant to the authority contained in
R.I.G.L. § 45-23-29, as amended, that it is necessary to provide for
innovative land development practices with respect to the siting
and installation of telecommunications towers, antennas and
accessory structures; and
(2) The Town Council further finds that the preparation, enactment
and implementation of a zoning ordinance relating to
telecommunications towers, antennas and accessory structures, is
necessary to address the protection of public health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of Glocester; and
(3) Therefore, it is the intent of the Town Council that this section
provide guidance and direction with respect to matters affecting
the siting and installation of telecommunications towers, antennas
and accessory structures.
§ 350-55 YARD SALES § 350-56
279:489
B. Purpose.
(1) General purposes. The general purpose of this section is to regulate
the placement of wireless communications towers, antennas and
related facilities, and the addition of wireless communications
equipment to existing structures. The regulations serve to establish
a procedure for application, permits, and for special use permits; to
establish development standards and location requirements; and to
encourage the co-location of equipment onto existing structures.
(2) The specific purposes of this section are to:
(a) Address public safety concerns associated with the siting of
wireless communications facilities; including towers, antennas
and related facilities, equipment and structures.
(b) Preserve the character, appearance, property values, natural
resources and historic sites of the Town;
(c) Minimize the number of new tower facilities by encouraging
and requiring co-location wherever possible;
(d) Limit the height of telecommunications tower facilities; and
encourage maximum setbacks from roads, property
boundaries and existing structures;
(e) Encourage the siting of new wireless communications facilities
on properties owned by the Town or its instrumentalities;
(f) Encourage location of towers and antennas in industrial zoned
and other areas where visual and other impacts on the
community are minimized;
(g) Discourage location of towers and antennas in areas zoned and
used for residential purposes to the extent that they
significantly diminish the character or value of real property in
the residential area.
(h) Provide for the design and siting of wireless communications
facilities so as to minimize their visual impact on neighboring
properties and on the character of the Town.
(i) Discourage the construction of towers that would require
airspace obstruction marking and/or lighting.
(j) Encourage small facility options that will reduce unnecessary
tower structures, but will integrate well into the context and
character of the community.
(3) In addition to the aforementioned, this chapter also intends to
minimize the number of tower structures by encouraging large
towers at strategically spaced intervals that provide optimal
coverage for the maximum number of service providers with the
§ 350-56 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-56
279:490
least impact on the community. This section limits the quantity of
large towers by requiring a two-mile separation between towers
and by requiring performance criteria that minimize the impact on
the community.
C. Applicability.
(1) New towers and facilities. The requirements set forth in this
section shall govern the location of all new telecommunications
facilities and related equipment, including television and radio
transmission towers. Except as provided herein, the general height
limitations of this chapter otherwise applicable to buildings and
structures shall not apply to towers and antennas.
(2) Amateur radio antennas. This section shall not govern any tower, or
the installation of any antenna, that is under 70 feet in height and is
owned and operated by a federally licensed amateur radio station
operator or is used exclusively for receive-only antennas.
(3) Preexisting towers and antennas. Any tower or antenna for which a
building permit has been properly issued prior to the effective date
of this section shall not be required to meet the requirements of
this section. However, any proposed extension beyond 20 feet in
the height of an existing facility, replacement of a facility, or
installation of an additional antenna to a facility, other than a
facility on land owned or leased by the Town and serving Town
communications needs, shall be subject to the requirements of this
section.
D. General conditions. This section makes a distinction between new or
existing tower structures and placement of antenna array on existing
structures in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of towers on the
community.
(1) Principal or accessory use. Antennas and towers may be considered
either principal or accessory uses or structures, as appropriate. A
different existing use or existing structure on the same lot shall not
preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For
purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or
antenna complies with district dimensional regulations, including,
but not limited to setback requirements, lot coverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the
entire lot shall control even though the antenna or tower may be
located on leased parcels within such lots. Towers that are
constructed, and antennas that are installed in accordance with the
provisions of this section, shall not be deemed to constitute the
expansion of a legal existing nonconforming use or structure.
Towers and associated equipment that may be located within or
outside of base facilities may not take away required parking
spaces of an existing building or use.
§ 350-56 YARD SALES § 350-56
279:491
(2) Building codes/safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity
of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is constructed
and maintained in compliance with or exceeds the standards
contained in the applicable State Building Codes and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the Electronics
Industries Association as amended from time to time and shall
structurally accommodate reasonable co-location. The owner of the
tower shall also ensure that the tower and related facilities comply
with other applicable safety and environmental standards,
including but not limited to safety limits for human exposure to
radio frequency energy. If, upon inspection, the Building Official
concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and
standards, and/or that it constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then the Building Official shall notify the owner of the
tower in writing, and the owner shall have 30 days to bring such
tower into compliance. Failure of the owner to do so shall
constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense. In addition to other legal remedies available to
the Town, the Building Official may proceed in accordance with
Chapter 27.3 of Title 23 of the Rhode Island General Laws, entitled
State Building Codes.
(3) General requirements. All wireless communications facilities shall
be erected, installed, maintained, and used in compliance with all
applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, including
radio frequency emission standards.
(4) Co-location. All owners and operators of land used in whole or in
part for a wireless communications facility, and all owners and
operators of such facilities, shall, as a continuing condition of
installing, constructing, erecting, and using a wireless
communications tower facility, and subject to necessary approvals
hereunder, permit other public utilities or FCC-licensed
commercial entities seeking to operate a wireless communications
tower facility to install, erect, mount, and use compatible
equipment and fixtures on the mounting structure on reasonable
commercial terms. This is provided that such co-location does not
materially interfere with the transmission and/or reception of
communications signals to or from the existing facility, and
provided that there are no structural or other physical limitations
that make it impractical to accommodate the proposed additional
wireless communications equipment or fixtures. Erection of a
replacement facility to address such concerns shall be considered,
where the Zoning Board determines appropriate. Wireless
communications facilities shall be designed to accommodate colocation
to the extent technologically and physically practical given
the limitations of the site and area.
(5) Number of towers. Only one wireless communications tower
structure per site shall be authorized by this chapter, unless the
§ 350-56 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-56
279:492
placement of more than one tower structure on the site results in a
substantially better design that is integrated into the neighboring
uses and meets community standards. An example of this may be
the erection of two flagpole structures located in a recreational
facility. The erection of more than one lattice tower or monopole in
a residential area would not be an example of a better design.
(6) Removal of facilities. All unused telecommunications facilities and
structures, including nonconforming or preexisting facilities which
have not been used for one year, shall be considered abandoned
and shall be dismantled and removed at the owner's expense. The
owner of such facility shall remove same within 90 days of receipt
of notice from the Building Official. Before a permit is issued, and
as a condition thereof, said owner shall post and thereafter
continuously maintain an appropriate surety bond, approved in
amount and form by the Town Solicitor and the Public Works
Director every two years, to cover the cost of removal of all
facilities and restoration of the site. If such antenna or tower is not
removed within 90 days, the Town may take the necessary action to
remove the facility at the owner's expense. The owners of the
property and the facility shall be jointly and individually
responsible for removal of said facilities, restoration of the site and
for all associated costs, expended or incurred in the course of
removal and restoration.
(7) Carrier utilization. Included in an application for a
telecommunications tower or antenna, an applicant must
demonstrate that it has a commitment from one or more licensed
wireless services providers to occupy the facility for the purposes
of transmitting and/or receiving wireless communications. Wireless
communications towers shall be designed to accommodate the
maximum number of co-locators reasonably practicable, taking into
account the size and appearance of the structure in the context of
its location. Tower locations identified as large facilities must meet
this requirement, where small infill tower facilities may to a lesser
extent. Owners of telecommunications towers shall make space
available to wireless communications services, including, when
appropriate, repositioning tenants on the tower, and reinforcing or
replacing the tower. The cost of making space available shall be the
responsibility of the applicant and may be shared by the tower
owner, if agreeable.
(8) Town requirements. At the time of application for any tower, space
shall be made available on telecommunications towers for Town
police, fire, rescue, and public works communications needs
related to public safety, health and welfare, at no cost to the Town.
The telecommunications tower owner and wireless service carriers
shall assist the Town, when deemed necessary, in the enhancement
of existing police and fire communications systems by providing for
the acquisition and installation of related equipment.
§ 350-56 YARD SALES § 350-56
279:493
(9) Development plan review. Applicants shall be subject to the
provisions of development plan review, as outlined in Chapter 300,
Subdivision of Land, § 300-37, as amended, when applying for a
new facility or the expansion of the footprint of an existing facility.
E. Permitted uses.
(1) General. The uses listed in this subsection are deemed to be
permitted uses and shall not require a special use permit.
Nevertheless, all such permitted uses are subject to the
requirements of Subsections D, F(3)(a), G and H (4, 6-C-1, 7 and 8)
of this section.
(2) Specific permitted uses.
(a) Telecommunications facilities including the placement of
towers and additional buildings or other supporting equipment
used in connection with said facility, in an industrial zoning
district; provided, however, that the height of the proposed
facility is less than 125 feet.
(b) Antennas and additional accessory structures or equipment
used in connection with said antennas on land occupied by
existing electric utility transmission towers, provided the
height of such facility is less than 125 feet.
(c) Installing an antenna on any existing tower of any height, as
long as the addition of said antenna adds no more than 20 feet
in height to said existing tower as originally constructed,
provided the total height does not exceed 200 feet.
F. Special use permits.
(1) General. All wireless communications facilities not covered by
Subsection E, Permitted uses, above, shall require a special use
permit. In granting a special use permit, the Zoning Board of
Review may impose conditions, to the extent the Board concludes
such conditions are necessary, to minimize any adverse effect of the
proposed tower on adjoining properties and to carry out the intent
of these regulations.
(2) Factors considered in granting special use permits. Consistent with
the purposes of this chapter, the Zoning Board shall consider the
following factors in determining whether to issue a special use
permit, although the Board may waive or reduce the burden on the
applicant of one or more of these criteria if it finds that the goals
and purposes of this section are better served thereby. These
factors are in addition to findings required for special use permits
as provided in § 350-8F of this chapter:
§ 350-56 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-56
279:494
(a) Generally, that the stated purposes and goals of this section are
achieved to the maximum extent possible, and the adverse
impacts as may be identified are similarly minimized.
(b) Height of the proposed tower or antenna and setbacks in
relation to lot boundaries, existing structures, public streets
and residences;
(c) Nature of uses on the subject parcel and on the adjacent
nearby properties;
(d) The opportunity for natural screening of telecommunications
facilities through a combination of tower height due to site
elevation, lot depth, natural vegetation, or topography;
(e) Design of the tower, with particular references to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating
visual obtrusiveness, including appearance and color;
(f) Proposed ingress and egress;
(g) Availability of suitable existing towers for co-location and for
location on other structures within the search area;
(h) Proximity of and impact upon historic districts or registered
historic properties;
(i) Availability and feasibility of alternative antenna and/or tower
facility sites and configurations that would result in a
substantially better design that is in keeping with the
community character.
(3) Application requirements.
(a) Submission requirements. The following application and
submission requirements are in addition to the general
requirements for special use permit applications as provided in
this chapter:
[1] A narrative report that shall describe the following
relating to the request for the telecommunications tower,
antenna and/or related facility installation:

(b) Application procedures.
[1] A preapplication review by the Zoning Official and/or Town
Planner is required before submittal of an application. This
conference will serve to familiarize the applicant with the
Town's regulations and procedures, and to assure that all
required documents and information are complete prior to
public notice and referral to the Planning Board, as
required for a special use permit.
[2] Application and notification shall be made as prescribed
for special use permits in § 350-8 of this chapter.
G. Design and development standards.
(1) Setbacks, height and separation.
(a) A wireless communications tower facility shall be set back from
any adjacent property line or street at a maximum feasible
distance, considering the size and physical constraints of the
site, visibility to nearby sites and other visually sensitive
locations, and the proportions and context of the site, in order
to provide opportunity to minimize the adverse visual effects of
telecommunications facilities. At the minimum, any such
facility shall be set back from any property line a distance
equal to 1 1/2 times the height of the facility and set back from
any residential structure on a separate parcel a distance equal
to 1 1/2 times the height of the facility or 250 feet, whichever is
greater. Such facility shall be set back a distance of at least 400
feet from any public or private street or public right-of-way,
and large uncamouflaged facilities must be at least 1,000 feet
from a school facility.
§ 350-56 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-56
279:498
[1] The Zoning Board of Review (ZBR) may waive these
limitations up to a factor of 50% if the facility is
camouflaged or in keeping with the surrounding uses,
such that it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the ZBR
that a substantially better design in keeping with the
community character results. A specific example would be
a small tower facility such as a flagpole, church steeple,
barn or grain silo or a large tower facility that is sited on a
particular lot that is suitable for a tower facility, but may
have such physical constraints or attributes that make a
waiver necessary. Towers and antenna mounts that are
less than 80 feet in height above ground and that are
suitably disguised to the satisfaction of the ZBR are
required only to meet the setbacks for the district in which
they are installed.
[2] When a telecommunications facility is determined by the
Zoning Board to be appropriately sited within an industrial
or B-2 zoned lot, which cannot meet the foregoing
setbacks, and which is within a larger industrially or B-2
zoned area, the Zoning Board may decrease the setbacks
from lot lines and structures within said lot, if the
placement of the facility in said lot is not otherwise
feasible, and the purposes of this section are otherwise
met. However, the Zoning Board may not reduce the
setbacks below the minimum setbacks otherwise provided
for an Industrial or B-2 zoned lot under this chapter.
Telecommunications facilities placed within an Industrial
or B-2 zoned lot shall observe the setbacks set forth in the
preceding subsection from property zoned A-4, A-3, R-2,
residential structures, and public or private streets or
public rights-of-way.
(b) Towers shall not be located within an historic district as
designated by this chapter, unless disguised in a manner that
meets the requirements as recommended by both the Historic
District Commission and the Planning Board.
(c) Excluding towers in the Industrial Zoning District or in
locations where more than one tower has been proposed on a
single site, towers greater than 125 feet in height (large tower
facilities) shall not be located within two miles from each other.
(d) With the exception of the larger tower facility (high-intensity),
the Town encourages smaller facilities that blend into the
existing environment through the use of disguise and
camouflage. In order to minimize the number of tower
facilities, normally, small tower facilities shall be considered to
provide service coverage, as deemed necessary by the ZBR
only after the installation of large tower facilities. These small
tower facilities are not to be construed as an alternative to the
§ 350-56 YARD SALES § 350-56
279:499
large tower facilities, in that it is the design of this section to
allow small tower facilities in places where a gap in coverage
exists between two large tower facilities.
(2) Landscaping and screening. The applicant must demonstrate that
the tower or antennas are located within a given site so as to
minimize the visual impact from nearby properties and roadways.
Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum
extent practicable and may be used as a substitute for the
landscaped screening requirement. Appropriate screening shall be
installed at tower sites to limit views from adjacent properties and
streets. Plantings shall be of such a height and density to ensure
screening. Screening shall consist of plant and/or tree material
appropriate to the habitat. Screening may be waived on those sides
or sections that are adjacent to undeveloped lands. The owner of
the property shall be responsible for ongoing maintenance and
shall replace any dead plantings within 30 days.
(3) Site requirements.
(a) Traffic associated with the tower and accessory facilities shall
not adversely affect abutting ways and access shall be provided
to a site which respects the natural terrain, does not appear as
a scar on the landscape, and is approved by the Director of
Public Works and by the District Fire Chief to assure
emergency access at all times. Consideration shall be given to
design that minimizes erosion, construction on unstable soils,
and steep slopes.
(b) Communications towers shall be enclosed by a fence at least
10 feet in height from finished grade and at least six feet from
the base of the structure. Access shall be through a locked
gate.
(c) Communications towers shall not be artificially lighted except
as may be required for public safety purposes, by the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA), or by the Town of Glocester.

11-2-2004]
(4) Site selection consideration. When considering a site for a
telecommunications facility, the following steps may assist
evaluating the site's suitability:
(a) Evaluate coverage by reviewing existing telecommunications
coverage to determine gaps in coverage, overlay proposed
coverage from the considered tower/facility to establish how
the proposed may improve service in that area.
(b) Consider alternatives that would provide the necessary service
using less intrusive means.
(c) Evaluate the context of the site under consideration,
underlying zoning, uses of property, neighboring uses,
activities, maximization of co-location on the proposed facility
and compatibility of the proposed tower/facility with
neighboring uses.
(d) Consider visibility of the proposed tower/facility in community.
(e) Evaluate methods of camouflaging the structure to fit in with
area.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish a project review and
approval procedure for any proposed development which may impact
land use and the environment. Certain development projects as
specified below may be required to submit additional plans and
information to allow the review of a project in greater detail than
currently required pursuant to this chapter. Project approvals may be
conditioned based upon the reviewing body's assessment of the
information submitted under development plan review. It is not the
intent of this section to alter basic development standards as set forth
elsewhere in this chapter.
B. Requirement for development plan review (applicability). The following
activities shall be subject to development plan review under this
section:
(1) Construction of any residential project that exceeds six dwelling
units and does not require subdivision approval;
(2) Construction or expansion of any commercial or industrial project/
development;
(3) Change in use;
(4) Construction or expansion of any recreational development in
excess of one acre in size;
§ 350-56 YARD SALES § 350-57
279:501
(5) Applications for uses requiring a special use permit, variance (use
and dimensional), Zoning Ordinance amendment, or Zoning Map
change.
C. Reviewing body. Development plan review is conducted by the Planning
Board, or by the Technical Review Committee (TRC). The TRC is made
up of the Town Planner, Building/Zoning Official and the Public Works
Director. The administrative officer for this section is the Town Planner.
D. Review classification.
(1) By-right uses. Uses permitted by right that require development
plan approval shall be reviewed by the TRC. The TRC shall have the
authority to waive the requirements of this section where it
conducts a development plan review for uses permitted by right.
The TRC may consult the Planning Board or any other local board
or agency in conducting its review.
(2) Variance, special use permit, zoning amendment. All projects
requiring a variance, special use permit, Zoning Ordinance
amendment, or zone change shall be reviewed by the Planning
Board as advisor to the permitting authority in accordance with the
process set forth in this section. The Planning Board may request
comments on the application from the local boards and agencies
receiving the application pursuant to this section. Such boards and
agencies may review the application and provide comments and
recommendations to the Planning Board within 35 days of the
request. A failure to respond to the Planning Board's request shall
signify a lack of opposition to the application. See Subsection K for
additional requirements regarding commercial development.
E. Review process.
(1) Preapplication. A preapplication conference (informal review) with
the administrative officer is required prior to submission of a
formal application. The intention of this meeting is to: acquaint the
applicant with the Comprehensive Plan, this chapter and other
ordinances that affect the proposed development; suggest any
improvements to the proposed design on the basis of a review of
the sketch plan; advise the applicant to consult appropriate
authorities on the character and placement of public utility
services; and help the applicant understand the steps to be taken to
receive approval. Discussions are not to be considered approval or
commitment of approval of the project or its elements. There may
be more than one preapplication meeting based upon the outcome
the initial meeting. If no further meetings are required, the

279:504
F. Objectives/Criteria for evaluation. In its evaluation of a development
plan application and in rendering its decision, the Planning Board and/
or Technical Review Committee shall apply the criteria listed below and
shall ensure that other local boards and agencies apply the same
criteria in their comments and recommendations. Any decision that is
made shall be made so as to be consistent with a reasonable use of the
site for the purposes permitted or permissible by the regulations of the
district in which it is located. The Planning Board may request that the
proposed project be modified to conform with these criteria:
(1) If the proposal requires a special use permit, it must conform to the
special use permit requirements as listed in Article I of this
chapter;
(2) The development shall be integrated into the existing terrain and
surrounding landscape, and shall be designed to protect abutting
properties and community amenities. Building sites shall, to the
extent feasible:
(a) Minimize the use of wetlands, steep slopes, floodplains, and
hilltops;
(b) Minimize the obstruction of scenic view from publicly
accessible locations;
(c) Preserve any unique natural or historical features;
(d) Minimize tree, vegetation and soil removal, grade changes and
subsequent erosion;
(e) Maximize open space retention;
(f) Landscape and screen objectionable features from neighboring
properties and roadways pursuant to this chapter; and
(g) Prevent depletion, degradation, or pollution of public drinking
water supplies and of surface or groundwater by employing
best management practices for erosion control, stormwater
management, wastewater disposal and landscaping.
(3) Architectural style shall be in keeping with the prevailing character
and scale of buildings in the neighborhood and the Town through
use of appropriate building materials, screening, breaks in roof and
wall lines and other architectural techniques. Variation in detail,
form and siting shall be used to provide visual interest and to avoid
monotony. Proposed buildings shall relate harmoniously to each
other with adequate light, air, circulation, and separation between
buildings.
(4) The development shall be served with adequate water supply and
waste disposal systems. The applicant shall submit a individual
septic disposal system (ISDS) design prepared by an RIDEMlicensed
ISDS designer, as applicable.
§ 350-57 YARD SALES § 350-57
279:505
(5) The development plan shall maximize the convenience and safety of
vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site and in relation
to adjacent ways (see Article VI and § 350-48 of this chapter). The
plan shall include estimates of average daily and peak-hour vehicle
trips to be generated by the site and traffic flow patterns for
vehicles and pedestrians showing adequate access to and from the
site and adequate circulation within the site.
(6) The development plan shall show adequate measures to prevent
pollution of surface or groundwater, and to minimize erosion and
sedimentation in conformance with Chapter 177, Erosion and
Sediment Control, and to prevent changes in groundwater levels,
increased runoff and potential for flooding. Drainage shall be
designed so that runoff shall not be increased to neighboring
properties, groundwater recharge shall be maximized, and
neighboring properties shall not be adversely affected.
(7) The development shall not place excessive demands on Town
services and infrastructure.
(8) Electric, telephone, cable TV, and other such utilities shall be
underground where physically and environmentally feasible.
(9) Exposed storage areas, machinery, service areas, truck loading
areas, utility buildings and structures and other service uses shall

provisions of local and state laws.
G. Decision.
(1) Action by the TRC shall consist of either:
(a) A decision or an advisory recommendation to the Planning
Board that the proposed project will constitute a suitable
development and is in compliance with the criteria set forth in
this chapter;
(b) A decision or an advisory recommendation to the Planning
Board that the proposed project should be approved subject to
any conditions, modifications, and restrictions as it may deem
necessary; or
(c) A decision or advisory recommendation to the Planning Board
that the proposed project be disapproved.
(2) Action by the Planning Board shall consist of either:
§ 350-57 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-57
279:506
(a) A decision or an advisory recommendation to the permitting
authority that the proposed project will constitute a suitable
development and is in compliance with the criteria set forth in
this section;
(b) A decision or an advisory recommendation to the permitting

H. Bond. The Planning Board or permitting authority may require the
posting of a bond to assure compliance with the plan and conditions and
may suspend any permit or license when work is not performed as
required.
I. Term of development plan approval. Any development plan approval
issued under this section shall lapse within six months if a substantial
use thereof has not commenced sooner except for good cause as
determined by the Planning Board or permitting authority.
J. Additional standards for commercial development.
(1) Purpose. This subsection is intended to encourage, guide and
direct commercial development, as well as reuse and conversion of
existing structures in order to ensure that the desirable
characteristics of the area are maintained, that new development is
compatible with the existing scale and building fabric, that the
historic integrity is preserved, and that architectural quality is
maintained. These guidelines will serve to assist the applicant by
providing development criteria consistent with the Glocester
Comprehensive Community Plan.
(2) Applicability.
(a) In addition to the review requirements stated above, the
following types of development shall adhere to the guidelines
and regulations of this section:
[1] New construction;
[2] Additions of 200 square feet or greater;
[3] Change of use (i.e., from residential to commercial use,
which may include an increase in number of dwelling
units).
(b) The following incidental improvements shall be reviewed
administratively by the administrative officer, who may refer
the matter to the Planning Board for further review:
§ 350-57 YARD SALES § 350-57
279:507
[1] Proposed new or increase in parking;
[2] Proposed signage, lighting, new curb cuts, landscaping;
[3] Change in commercial or industrial occupancy resulting in
insignificant exterior improvements.
(3) Commercial development objectives/criteria.
(a) Due to the potential impact on the character of the Town,
additional consideration is to be given to commercial
development and will be evaluated according to the following
criteria:
[1] It will not detract from the character of the village or area;
[2] It will not adversely impact adjacent property;
[3] The proposed development or reuse of structure will be in
conformance with the purpose and intent of this section
and the applicable articles of the Comprehensive
Community Plan.
(b) If the Planning Board finds the project to be unusually large, or
if it is likely to become a landmark, or if it is in a visually
prominent area, or if it is located so as to become part of a
gateway, the design must acknowledge the special impact the
project would have on the entire community by addressing the
design solution in an exemplary manner.
(4) Commercial development guidelines. The intent of this section is
not to restrict development to a predetermined style. However, for
approval, new developments must meet the range of criteria within
this section and demonstrate how building design maintains or
enhances the village or character of the area in which it is to be
located.
(a) Architecture.
[1] The height and scale of a new building or structure and
any addition to an existing building shall be compatible
and harmonious with its site and existing surrounding
buildings.
[2] New building development, adaptation, rehabilitation,
reuse, and building conversion must avoid:
[a] The look of franchise architecture, or "big box" design
with excessive bulk and lack of detail;
[b] Buildings which demand visual attention through the
use of bold colors and materials which are not found to
be consistent with maintaining the village or rural
character;
§ 350-57 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-57
279:508
[c] Commercial or industrial structures consisting of
large metal buildings which lack design details or
otherwise do not complement the traditional village or
rural character;
[3] Storefronts. Existing structures which have been designed
for retail use on the first floor shall retain this design to the
greatest extent possible.
[4] Architecture shall be compatible with the character and
scale of buildings in the specific neighborhood in which
the development proposal is located, through the use of
appropriate buildings, screenings, breaks in the roof and
wall lines and other architectural techniques as
demonstrated by existing village and rural architecture in
the area.
[5] Building materials used for principal structures shall be in
character with surrounding buildings.
[6] Concrete block, steel or metal is less desirable than wood,
brick and stone and shall be discouraged as the principal
exterior surface. It shall not be used as the principal
exterior surface on the front of the building surface except
for architectural treatments. Principal exterior surface
shall mean 50% or more of the exterior wall surface.
(b) Landscaping.
[1] Distinguishing original features of a site, such as trees
greater than six inches in diameter, existing plantings,
stone walls, historical structures or markers and
topography, shall be preserved where possible. Plantings
on the street facing the side of buildings, window boxes
and approved planters are encouraged. Benches or other
seating arrangements and walkways within a
redevelopment or new development are encouraged and
should be provided where appropriate.
[2] Roadside trees help define the rural and village character
of Glocester's villages. Their removal must be absolutely
minimized and supported by clear justification during the
development plan review process. The administrative
officer, TRC or Planning Board may request a review of the
existing plantings by the Town Tree Warden.
[3] The installation of other streetscape improvements,
including, but not limited to, benches, bollards, and trash
receptacles, is encouraged and will be reviewed for
applicability by the administrative officer.
(c) Parking.
§ 350-57 YARD SALES § 350-57
279:509
[1] Parking lots shall be designed to accommodate average
usage rather than peak day usage if the parking
requirements set forth in this chapter are not reflective of
the actual parking needed.
[2] Parking will be encouraged along the side or rear of a
building unless such location would have an adverse or
detrimental impact on environmental or visual features of
the site, or is completely infeasible.
[3] Parking with three or more spaces will require a
landscaping plan to visually reduce the adverse impacts
due to the creation of the designated parking area.
[4] When side or rear yard parking is infeasible, front yard
parking, between the building and the public road, will
require an effective landscape setback. This setback shall
be outlined on a plan which clearly identifies the location,
type and maintenance requirements of all plant material.
[5] To the extent feasible, access to businesses shall be
provided via one of the following:
[a] Access via a common driveway serving adjacent lots
or premises;
[b] Access via an existing side street where deemed
appropriate;
[c] Access via a cul-de-sac or loop road shared by
adjacent premises.
[6] One driveway per street frontage shall be permitted by
right. A second curb cut shall be approved by the Planning
Board or any other jurisdictional agency as part of the plan
approval.
[7] Curb cuts shall be limited to the minimum width for safe
entrancing and exiting and shall not exceed 24 feet in
width, except in special circumstances relating to traffic
safety and approved by the Public Works Director.
(d) Storage areas and ancillary amenities.
[1] Open storage areas, exposed machinery, refuse and waste
removal areas, service yards and exterior work areas and
parking lots shall be screened from roads and adjacent
residential areas through fencing and landscaping and
shall be made part of the landscape review.
[2] Commercial vehicles shall be screened from public view to
the greatest extent possible.
§ 350-57 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-57
279:510
(e) Service connections. It is highly desirable to place
underground all new utility services and service revisions
necessitated by exterior alterations and new developments.
(f) Lighting. The intent of the exterior lighting design standards
for the commercial zones is to provide the necessary lighting
for the property while minimizing the intrusiveness to adjacent
properties or the street right-of-way.
[1] No lighting standard shall be taller than 15 feet.
[2] Any newly installed or replaced outdoor lighting fixture
shall be shielded so that it does not direct light beyond
property boundaries.
[3] Light illumination shall be of low intensity with a maximum
wattage of 200 watts.
[4] Lighting fixtures must be compatible with the
architectural design of the new or rehabilitated structure
and the surrounding lighting fixtures.
[5] All exterior lighting shall be designed to minimize impact
on neighboring properties. Night sky light pollution shall
be minimized by down-shaded lighting or shielded
lighting, All lighting shall be based upon a pedestrian scale
appropriate for a setting.
(g) Fences and walls.
[1] Chain-link fencing shall not be permitted between the
street right-of-way and the front facade of any structure.
[2] All proposed fencing for screening or ornamental purposes
shall be approved by the TRC.
[3] Existing stone walls shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Stone walls shall not be replaced with poured
concrete or concrete block walls.
[4] Freestanding stone walls (dry laid) shall be repaired and
retained or reconstructed in kind as close to their original
location as possible.
(h) Signs (See Article V of this chapter for complete regulations.):
[1] All signs which do not conform to this section shall be
brought into conformance no later than five years from the
date of passage of this section.
[2] No interior-lit signs shall be permitted.
(5) Notice to abutters. Notice shall be sent out to all residential
abutters for Planning Board review of a commercial property.

§ 350-62. Destruction.
If a legal nonconforming use is destroyed by accident or by an act of
God, such structure may be restored, provided the total floor space, cubic
content and location on lot are not altered or increased, and provided that
reconstruction of damaged buildings shall commence within eight months
of the date of damage and to be completed within two years from that date.
If such a structure is demolished at the direction of the owner, it may not
be reestablished, and any future use of the site or lot must conform to the
provisions of this chapter. Nothing shall prevent the performance of normal
maintenance work, or work necessary to comply with safety codes, on a
legal nonconforming use.
§ 350-63. Change of use.
§ 350-64. Enlargement of nonconforming use. [Amended
12-15-2011, effective 12-15-2011]
A. A legal nonconforming use may be changed to a use which conforms to
the requirements of the zoning district in which it is located.
B. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure shall not be changed to
another nonconforming use that is substantially different in nature and
purpose unless the Zoning Board of Review makes the finding that the
proposed use will have a lesser undesirable impact upon the
surrounding area than the preceding nonconforming use and grants a
variance in accordance with the statutory standard and procedure.
§ 350-59 YARD SALES § 350-64
279:515
§ 350-65. Exemption.
Any use which is nonconforming in dimension but conforms in use shall be
exempt from the provisions of §§ 350-61 and 350-62 of this article, provided
the dimensional use nonconforming is not increased in any way.
§ 350-66. Substandard lots of record.
A. The area of a legal nonconforming land use shall not be enlarged by
acquisition.
B. Expansion of a legal nonconforming use is allowed for up to 50%
expansion of the area dedicated to a legal nonconforming use in either
the primary or secondary structure(s).
A. No lot area shall be so reduced that yards, total area or lot frontage
shall be less than prescribed for the district in which the lot is located.
No required yard or other area of one lot shall be considered as
providing the minimum area or frontage required for any other lot
without a replatting of both lots in such a way that both lots so replatted
conform to the dimensional regulations of the district involved and
approved by the Inspector prior to recording. Such lots must be in
separate ownership and not be contiguous with other lots in the same
ownership unless otherwise provided herein.
B. Substandard lots of record are exempt from the minimum lot sizes of
the district involved as established by this chapter as amended. All
other district dimensions applicable at the time immediately prior to the
lot becoming substandard shall apply, but in no case will less than 30
feet front yard depth, 10 feet side yard, and 10 feet rear yard depth be
allowed.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if two or more
contiguous lots of record are under the same ownership as of or after
November 9, 1989, and one or more of such lots has an area less than
30,000 square feet, then all such lots that are less than 30,000 square
feet shall be deemed merged into adjacent lots under the same
ownership and the merged lots shall be considered one lot for the
purpose of this chapter. This provision shall not apply to any lots that
are located within a B-1 or B-2 Zoning District or to any recorded lots
which were approved and accepted by the Planning Board before
November 9, 1989, pursuant to Chapter 300, Subdivision of Land. This
Subsection C shall be deemed to have been adopted and effective on
November 9, 1989, in place and instead of the zoning amendment
adopted on that day.

appearance of a contributing structure or its appurtenances within
any designated Historic District, the owner must apply for and
receive a certificate of appropriateness from the Commission
approving such construction, alteration, repair, removal or
demolition.
(2) A certificate of appropriateness is necessary only if a building
permit is required for such construction, alteration, repair, removal
or demolition of a contributing structure. The Building Official may
not issue a permit until the Commission has granted a certificate of
appropriateness.
B. Recommendation of compatibility required.
(1) Before a property owner may authorize or commence construction,
alteration, repair, removal or replacement affecting the exterior
§ 350-71 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-72
279:520
appearance of a structure within any designated Historic District
other than a contributing structure, including appurtenances of
such structure, the owner must apply for and receive a
recommendation of compatibility from the Commission with
respect to the plans for such work.
(2) A recommendation of compatibility is necessary only if a building
permit is required for such construction, alteration, repair, removal
or replacement of such structure. The Building Official may not
issue a permit until the Commission has issued a recommendation
of compatibility; however, compliance with the recommendation of
compatibility shall not be a requirement for issuance of a building
permit.
C. Application for certificate of appropriateness and recommendation of
compatibility.
(1) Applications for certificate of appropriateness or recommendation
of compatibility shall be filed with the Commission at the office of
the Building Official, who shall determine if such application is
complete and who shall forward complete applications, together
with all maps, plans, and other data, to the Commission.
Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant within
seven working days of receipt by the Building Official.
(2) The Commission shall require the owner to submit information
which is reasonably necessary to evaluate the proposed
construction, alteration, repair, removal or demolition, including
but not limited to site plans, elevation drawings, photographs or
other information deemed appropriate by the Commission and set
forth in the Commission's rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to this article.
(3) In reviewing the applications and plans, the Commission shall give
consideration to:
(a) The historic and architectural significance of the contributing
structure and its appurtenances;
(b) The way in which the structure and its appurtenances, as
existing or planned, contribute to the historical and
architectural significance of the district;
(c) The appropriateness of the general design, arrangement,
texture, material and sitting proposed in the plans; and
(d) The Commission shall pass only on exterior features of a
structure and its appurtenances and shall not consider interior
arrangements.
(4) All decisions and recommendations of the Commission shall be in
writing. The Commission shall articulate and explain the reasons
§ 350-72 YARD SALES § 350-72
279:521
and bases of each decision and recommendation on a record, and in

the Commission shall include the basis for its conclusion that the
proposed activity would be incongruous with those aspects of the
structure, appurtenances, or the district which the Commission
has determined to be historically or architecturally significant. The
Commission shall send a copy of the decision or recommendation
to the applicant.
(5) The following are special considerations regarding valuable
historic resources and demolition:
(a) In the case of an application for construction, repair, or
alteration, removal, or demolition affecting the exterior
appearance of a contributing structure or its appurtenances,
which the Commission deems so valuable to the Town of
Glocester, state or nation, that the loss thereof will be a great
loss to the Town, state or nation, the Commission shall
endeavor to work with the owner an economically feasible plan
for the preservation of such structure.
(b) Unless the Commission is satisfied that the retention of such
contributing structure constitutes a hazard to public safety,
which hazard cannot be eliminated by economic means
available to the owner, including the sale of the contributing
structure to any purchaser willing to preserve such structure,
the Commission shall file with the Building Official its rejection
of such application.
(c) Unless the Commission votes to issue a certificate of
appropriateness for such construction, alteration, and repair,
removal and demolition, the Commission shall file with the
Building Official its rejection of such application.
(d) In the absence of change in such contributing structure arising
from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work
shall be filed within one year after such rejection.
(e) Contributing structures of architectural or historic value.
[1] In the case of any contributing structure deemed to be
valuable for the period of architecture it represents and
important to the neighborhood within which it exists, the
Commission may file with the Building Official its
certificate of appropriateness for such application if any of
the circumstances under which a certificate of
appropriateness might have been given under the
proceeding subsection are in existence, or if:
[a] Preservation of such structure is a deterrent to a
major improvement program which will be of
substantial benefit to the community;
§ 350-72 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-72
279:522
§ 350-73. Failure of Commission to act.
The failure of the Commission to act within 45 days from the date of a
completed application filed with it shall be deemed to constitute approval,
unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the
Commission. In the event, however, that the Commission shall make a
finding of fact that the circumstances of a particular application require
further time for additional study and information can be obtained within the
aforesaid period of 45 days, then and in said event the Commission shall
have a period of up to 90 days within which to act upon such application.
§ 350-74. Advisory role of Commission.
In order to assist the Town of Glocester, its agencies, boards, commissions,
staff and Council on matters of historic preservation, the Commission may
provide its expertise and advice as appropriate.
§ 350-75. Exceptions.
Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent painting, routine
maintenance or repair of any structure within the Historic District, provided
that such maintenance or repair does not result in any change of design,
type of material, or appearance of the structure or appurtenances; nor shall
anything in this article be construed to prevent the construction, alteration,
repair, moving or demolition of any structure under permit issued by the
Building Official prior to the passage of this article.
[b] Preservation of such structure would cause undue or
unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking
into account the financial resources available to the
owner, including sale of the structure to any purchaser
willing to preserve such structure; or
[c] The preservation of such structure would not be in the
best interest of the majority of the community.
[2] When considering an application to demolish or remove a
contributing structure of historic or architectural value,
the Commission shall assist the owner in identifying and
evaluating alternatives to demolition, including sale of the
structure on its present site. In addition to any other
criteria, the Commission shall also consider whether there
is reasonable likelihood that some person or group other
than the current owner is willing to purchase, move and
preserve such structure and whether the owner has made
continuing bona fide and reasonable efforts to sell the
structure to any such purchaser willing to move and
preserve such structure.
§ 350-72 YARD SALES § 350-76
279:523
§ 350-76. Violations and penalties.
Where there is a violation of any of the provisions of this article or of any
action taken thereunder, the Building Official, through the Town Solicitor,
shall institute an appropriate action to prevent, enjoin, abate, or remove
such violation.
§ 350-77. Appeals.
Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Historic District Commission shall
have the right to appeal such decision to the Zoning Board of Review. When
hearing appeals from Commission decisions the Zoning Board of Review
shall not substitute its own judgment for that of the Commission, but must
consider the issue upon the findings and the record of the Commission. The
Zoning Board of Review shall not reverse a Commission decision except on
a finding of prejudicial procedural error, clear error or lack of support by
the weight of the evidence in the record. The Zoning Board of Review shall
put all decisions on appeal in writing. The Zoning Board of Review shall
articulate and explain the reasons and bases of each decision on the record,
and the Zoning Board of Review shall send a copy of the decision to the
applicant and to the Historic District Commission. Any person aggrieved by
a decision of the Zoning Board of Review on a matter appealed under this
article may apply to the Superior Court of Rhode Island.
§ 350-78. Enforcement.
The Building Official, through the Town Solicitor, may bring an action
against any property owner who fails to comply with the requirements of
this article. Such actions shall be brought in the Superior Court having
jurisdiction where the violation occurred or is likely to occur. Plaintiffs may
seek restraining orders and injunctive relief to restrain and enjoin violations
or threatened violations of this article.
§ 350-79. Amendments.
Amendment or additions to the article or to the Historical District shall be
by the same process and procedure as amendments to this chapter.
§ 350-80. Periodic review.
The Town Council or its successor ordinance-creating authority shall be
required at twenty-five-year intervals commencing in the year 2025 to
review the regulations issued by the capital Secretary of the Interior or
other appropriate federal agency for the purpose of changing the date or
dates defining contributory structure and advancing the dates of historic
preservation.

ARTICLE X
Rural Residential Compounds
§ 350-81. Findings.
§ 350-82. Purpose.
This article is designed to provide qualified subdividers an option to develop
a parcel of land under less stringent requirements, where, and only where,
the Planning Board (the Board) determines that such alternative procedures
will promote development of the parcel in the best interests of the Town,
considering the design standards specified in § 350-83 below. The approval
of a rural residential compound is entirely within the informed discretion
of the Board. Denial by the Board of a request for a rural residential
compound, or the denial of a rural residential compound, shall not be
construed as denial of the right to subdivide the property, and the applicant
shall retain all rights to submit a plan under customary procedures set forth
in Chapter 300, Subdivision of Land.
§ 350-83. Conditions for consideration.
Applicants may request that their proposal be considered as a rural
residential compound at the preapplication stage. To qualify for
A. The Town of Glocester has many residents who own large tracts of land
(in excess of the minimum zoning requirement) and wish to subdivide
that land for use as single-family residences. Under the conventional
zoning requirements, this would be allowed only if the land has
sufficient acreage and frontage along a suitably improved Town or state
road.
B. In addition, there are many tree-lined roads that are enjoyed by
residents and visitors alike. When development occurs along these
roads, all too often the visual buffer of trees and shrubs is removed to
make way for the development of roads and housing.
C. The rural residential compound model addresses these issues. It allows
greater design flexibility for landowners with large tracts of land and
creates more opportunities for preservation of open space than the
conventional zoning regulations by allowing a reduction of frontage and
access to lots along a private way. It promotes development in harmony
with Glocester's rural character by reducing density and requiring a
visual buffer between home sites and the existing Town or state roads
Because the development occurs along a private way, the Town benefits
from the reduced road maintenance costs while allowing reasonable
development to occur.
D. Waivers in the rural residential compound are prepackaged to
accomplish these objectives of allowing development of large lots,
protection of open space and maintaining low-density development
throughout the Town.
§ 350-81 YARD SALES § 350-83
279:525
consideration as a rural residential compound, the subdivision must satisfy
all of the following conditions; however, satisfaction of all of the conditions
shall only result in rendering the plan eligible for further consideration as a
rural residential compound and shall not be construed as approval.
A. Lots with existing deeded rights-of-way or easements for access to any
property shall not qualify for a rural residential compound.
B. Lots created after this article is adopted, May 16, 2003, shall not qualify
for consideration as a rural residential compound.
C. No more than one rural residential compound shall be created from a
property or a set of contiguous properties in common ownership as of
May 16, 2003. The subdivision shall result in no more than four lots and
be located entirely in an A-4 and/or A-3 agricultural use district.
D. The original lot shall be at least 20 acres in area and have at least 50
feet of frontage.
E. Each lot so created under these provisions shall have an area of at least
10 acres, of which at least 1.5 acres shall be land suitable for
development. [Amended 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
F. The subdivision shall result in no more than four lots and be located
entirely in an A-4 and/or A-3 agricultural use district.
G. All lots so created under these provisions shall have ingress and egress
to the common private way. Lots with existing deeded rights-of-way or
easements for access to any property shall not qualify for a rural
residential compound.
H. The common private way shall extend from a suitably improved Town or
state road, and shall end in a cul-de-sac, as described in § 350-86 below.
The common private way shall not extend from any other type of road,
such as private or suitably improved non-Town road.
I. Rural residential compounds cannot be combined with any other
subdivision or development.
J. The development rights of land in excess of the minimum underlying
zoning of each lot (example A-4) shall be deeded in perpetuity to a land
conservation organization, such as the Glocester Land Trust. For the
purpose of this section, development rights, as used herein, shall
mean the right to further subdivide or otherwise residentially develop
the land beyond the original approval from the Planning Board.
K. At the discretion of the Planning Board, a provision may be imposed to
require a conservation easement for the preservation/protection of
significant or important features of the subject property.
§ 350-83 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-84
279:526
§ 350-84. Design standards.
In order to be approved as a rural residential compound, the proposed
subdivision must be determined by the Planning Board to promote one or
more of the following design standards in a manner that is superior to a
conventional subdivision of the subject property:
§ 350-85. Application process.
A. Reduce the number of lots having egress onto existing streets;
B. Reduce the number of curb cuts on existing Town or state roads;
C. Be constructed in a manner which will provide a visual buffer between
the new home(s) as well as the public street which will minimize the
visual impact;
D. Produce less irregularly shaped or contorted lot configurations; or
E. Be constructed in a manner that preserves primary and secondary
resource areas on the tract or adjacent to the tract, such as visual
buffer (topography, trees and shrubs) along streets and between
properties, wetlands, watercourses or bodies, open fields, meadows,
wildlife habitat, steep slope, or other significant areas.
A. Preapplication conference. Prior to submittal of a rural residential
compound application, it is required that at least one preapplication
meeting be conducted with the Planning Board. The preapplication
submittal can be a sketch based on existing plat maps, but must
accurately depict the site layout primary and secondary resource areas
on the tract or adjacent to the tract, such as visual buffer (topography,
trees and shrubs) along streets and between properties, wetlands,
watercourses or bodies, open fields, meadows, wildlife habitat, steep
slope, or other significant areas and other features of the property to be
subdivided.
B. Preliminary plan.
(1) Applicants for a rural residential compound shall present a
preliminary plan that complies with the requirements of the
Chapter 300, Subdivision of Land, for a minor subdivision, and
which also accurately depicts the following information:
(a) Center-line profile of proposed common private way;
(b) Location of any rivers, streams or wetlands;
(c) Proposed drainage;
(d) Proposed utilities and road construction design;
(e) Proposed lot lines and building sites;
§ 350-84 YARD SALES § 350-85
279:527
§ 350-86. Conditions for approval.
To be approved as a rural residential compound, the plan shall contain or
refer to recorded covenants and notices regarding each of the following:
(f) Scale and area of vegetative screening separating the common
private way and rural residential compound lots from adjacent
residentially zoned property;
(g) Location, width and other evidence of any recorded easements
or rights-of-way on or adjacent to the subject property.
(2) A registered professional engineer, land surveyor, architect, or
landscape architect must prepare the preliminary plan, unless
specifically waived by the Planning Board.
C. Final plan. The final plan shall comply with the requirements of Chapter
300, Subdivision of Land, for a final plan for a minor subdivision and
must be prepared by a registered professional engineer and/or land
surveyor.
D. Application fee. A filing fee consistent with the schedule in Chapter
300, Subdivision of Land, § 300-38,73 will be submitted by the applicant
with the application, to cover costs of processing and review. In the
event that the Board determines that unusual or exceptional
circumstances necessitate expert technical review that exceeds the
cost of the filing fee, the applicant shall pay the cost of that expertise.
A. Protection of open space, maintenance of a visual buffer of at least 20
feet along property lines restricting tree cutting, land clearing, and
land grading. At the discretion of the Planning Board, deed restrictions
may be imposed to preserve open fields, or forest areas within the rural
residential compound.
B. Development rights for any additional land outside the three- or fouracre
minimum lot area for each lot in the rural residential compound
shall be given "in perpetuity" by deed to the Glocester Land Trust or
other private nonprofit agency engaged in land preservation.
C. The common private way shall remain permanently (in perpetuity) a
private way, and shall not be extended and shall only be used
exclusively for access to properties in the rural residential compound.
D. The common private way shall not be connected to any other way
except where it originates on a Town or state road.
E. The lots shall obtain access from the common private way as created in

concerns that have been affected by the relief granted do not
outweigh the state and local need for low- and moderate-income

adequate and permanent physical access to a public street. Lot
frontage on a public street without physical access shall not be
considered in compliance with this requirement.

building on those lots according to pertinent regulations and
building standards would be impracticable, unless created only as
permanent open space or permanently reserved for a public
purpose on the approved, recorded plans.

Conservation Developments
[Added 11-15-2007, effective 12-20-2007]
§ 350-100. Purpose.
A. The purposes of this article, entitled "Conservation Developments," are:
(1) To conserve open land, including those areas containing unique
and sensitive natural features such as woodlands, steep slopes,
streams, floodplains, wetlands, reservoirs and their drainage areas,
and agricultural lands, by setting them aside from development;
(2) To preserve historical, cultural, agricultural and archaeological
resources;
(3) To provide greater design flexibility and efficiency in the siting of
services and infrastructure, including the opportunity to reduce
length of streets, utility runs, and the amount of paving required for
residential development;
(4) To provide for a diversity of lot sizes and layouts;
(5) To provide for a diversity of housing choices to accommodate a
variety of age and income groups and residential preferences, so
that the population diversity of the community may be maintained;
(6) To implement adopted municipal policies to conserve a variety of
irreplaceable and environmentally important resources as set forth
in the Comprehensive Plan;
(7) To provide reasonable incentives for the creation of a greenbelt/
trails system within the Town;
(8) To implement adopted land use, environmental and open space
policies as set forth in the Comprehensive Plan;
(9) To protect areas of the Town with productive agricultural soils for
continued or future agricultural use by conserving blocks of land
large enough to allow for efficient farm operations;
(10) To create neighborhoods with direct visual and/or physical access
to open land, with amenities in the form of neighborhood open
space, and with a strong neighborhood identity;
(11) To provide for the maintenance of open land set aside for active or
passive recreational use, stormwater drainage or conservation
lands;
(12) To conserve and create scenic views and preserve the rural
character of the Town; and
§ 350-100 YARD SALES § 350-100
279:535
§ 350-101. Applicability.
(13) To provide a buffer between new development and existing
neighborhoods, delicate natural features and habitats.
A. The Planning Board may require a proposed land development project
or subdivision to be developed in the form of a conservation
development only in the following zoning districts: A-4 Agricultural-
Residential; A-3 Agricultural-Residential and R-2 Residential.
B. In accordance with the standards set forth in this article, the Planning
Board shall have the authority to determine whether a major or minor
subdivision or land development project, whether a subdivision or not,
shall be developed as a conservation development or a conventional
subdivision, as further provided in Subsections C, D, E and F, below.
C. If an applicant requests approval of a major or minor conventional
subdivision, the Planning Board shall first require the applicant to
submit a plan(s) of a conservation development for the property
proposed for development, following the requirements and procedures
for conservation developments provided in this section. As a
comparison, the applicant shall also submit plan(s) for the conventional
type of development requested. If the Board finds that the conventional
subdivision meets the general purposes of the Land Development and
Subdivision Regulations, and after consideration of the purposes of
conservation developments set forth in § 350-100 herein, the Board
may permit the application to be reviewed in a form other than
conservation development. For major subdivisions or land development
projects, the Board may make this determination at the preapplication
meeting, but no later than the master plan stage of review. For minor
subdivisions or land development projects, the Board shall make this
determination at the informal concept review meeting.
D. If an applicant requests approval of a major or minor conservation
development, and the Planning Board determines that a conventional
subdivision may be preferable, the Board may require the applicant to
submit a plan(s) of both a conservation development and a conventional
development. If the Board finds that the conventional subdivision meets
the general purposes of the Land Development and Subdivision
Regulations, and after consideration of the purposes of conservation
developments set forth in § 350-100 herein, the Board may require the
application to be reviewed in a form other than conservation
development. For major subdivisions or land development projects, the
Board may make this determination at the preapplication meeting, but
no later than the master plan stage of review. For minor subdivisions or
land development projects, the Board shall make this determination at
the informal concept review meeting.
E. Administrative subdivisions and subdivisions that create lots which are
not for the purpose of present or future development (e.g., open space
§ 350-100 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-101
279:536
§ 350-102. Permitted uses.
lots) shall not be required to be developed as a conservation
development.
F. The Planning Board may not require an application for a rural
residential compound to be submitted as a conservation development or
conventional subdivision. Applications for approval of a rural
residential compound shall be at the discretion of the applicant, subject
to the provisions of Article X of this chapter, and in accordance with the
procedures and standards set forth in the Land Development and
Subdivision Regulations for minor land development projects.
A. Permitted residential uses in a conservation development are the
following:
(1) Single-family dwelling.
(2) Two-family dwellings or duplexes are permitted by the granting of a
special use permit by the Zoning Board of Review.
(3) Accessory family dwelling units are permitted by the granting of a
special use permit by the Zoning Board of Review. These units do
not count towards the maximum number of dwellings allowed in a
conservation development.
B. Open space uses. The open space in a conservation development shall
be devoted only to conservation purposes; for park and recreation uses;
or for the preservation and management of agricultural, habitat or
forestry resources. The following provisions shall apply:
(1) In the A-4 Agricultural-Residential and A-3 Agricultural-Residential
Zoning Districts only, the following uses shall be permitted within
the open space areas:
(a) Any use listed in Article II, § 350-11, Table of Use Regulations,
in Section 1, Agricultural Uses. Uses marked with a "YES" are
permitted by right; uses marked with an "S.P." are permitted by
special use permit.
(2) In all zoning districts where conservation developments are
permitted, including A-4, A-3 and R-2, the uses listed below shall be
permitted within the open space areas.
(a) Reservations for the production or protection of wildlife,
including conservation lands, wildlife preserves, forest
management activities and woodlots.
(b) Passive recreation, hiking trails and walking trails.
C. In all zoning districts where conservation developments are permitted,
the following uses may also be allowed in open space areas subject to
§ 350-101 YARD SALES § 350-102
279:537
§ 350-103. Maximum number of units.
The maximum number of dwelling units permitted in a conservation
development shall not exceed the number of single-family lots (or dwellings)
which could reasonably be expected to be developed upon the conservation
development site under a conventional yield plan as defined in § 350-5
herein, and as further described in § 300-35H (Basic maximum number of
dwelling units) of the Land Development and Subdivision Regulations.
§ 350-104. Lot dimensional requirements.

(2) Placement of privately owned and maintained wells for individual
uses within the conservation development.
(3) Placement of privately owned and maintained community wells for
uses within the conservation development.
(4) Placement of privately owned and maintained individual or
common sewage disposal systems for uses within the conservation
development.
D. Buildings, structures, parking areas or other impervious improvements
which are accessory to and subordinate to a permitted open space use
may be located on any open space lot, provided that, in all cases, they
occupy no more than 2% of the total open space area of the
conservation development for any permitted open space uses.
E. The required amount of open space in a conservation development shall
be as provided in § 350-105 of this article, below.
A. The dimensional regulations provided in Table 1 below shall apply to all
lots in a conservation development proposed as building lots for single
or two-family dwellings.

*NOTE: See § 350-104.
B. The Planning Board may allow a building lot for a single-family dwelling
to be a minimum of 43,560 square feet in a conservation development
only. In such cases, the building lot must be directly abutting open
space area(s) which shall be suitable for the placement of a future ISDS
and/or a drinking water well if needed to serve the dwelling on the lot.
In making this determination, the Board shall consider the physical
characteristics of the open space with regard to its suitability for future
ISDS/wells, including but not limited to soil characteristics, topography,
presence of land unsuitable for development, vegetation, or other
natural or man-made features. If the Board finds that the abutting
common open space area is not suitable for these purposes, the lot area
for the single-family dwelling shall be not less than 1.5 acres (65,340
square feet).
A. Every conservation development shall provide protected open space in
accordance with the following requirements and standards:
(1) The open space shall be established as a lot or lots separate and
distinct from the lots intended for residential and accessory uses,
and from land dedicated as street rights-of-way.
(2) The minimum amount of required open space area shall be based
on a percentage of the land suitable for development in the entire
conservation development as provided in the table below. None of
the minimum required open space area shall be devoted to land
unsuitable for development as defined in § 350-58 of this chapter.

(3) Open space provided by a conservation development for public or
common use, shall either be conveyed to and accepted by the Town
for park, open space, agricultural, or other permitted use or uses;
or be conveyed to and accepted by a nonprofit organization, the
principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space or
resource protection; or be conveyed to and accepted by a
corporation or trust owned or to be owned by the owners of lots or
units within the development or owners of shares within a
cooperative development. If such a corporation or trust is used,
ownership shall pass with conveyances of the lots or units; or
remain in private (noncommon) ownership if the use is limited to
agriculture, habitat or forestry. In accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan and this Zoning Ordinance, it is determined
that private ownership may be necessary for the preservation and
management of the agriculture, habitat or forest resources. In such
cases, the Planning Board, as part of its review of a conservation
development, shall make positive findings as part of the record,
setting forth the basis for such ownership.
(4) The Planning Board may limit or restrict the amount of open space
that may remain in private ownership where necessary to
contribute to a connecting greenway system or to provide public
access to open space, as provided in the Comprehensive Plan.
(5) In any case where the land is not conveyed to the Town, a
restriction, in perpetuity, enforceable by the Town and by any
owner of property in the land development project in which the
land is located shall be recorded providing that the land shall be
kept in the authorized condition(s) and not be built upon or
developed.
(6) All open space land provided by a conservation development or
other land development project shall be subject to a communityapproved
management plan that will specify the permitted uses for
the open space.
(7) All open space, regardless of whether it is conveyed to the Town,
shall be protected against further development and unauthorized
alteration in perpetuity by appropriate deed restrictions, and by
the grant of a conservation or preservation restriction pursuant to
Title 34, Chapter 39, of the Rhode Island General Laws, as
§ 350-105 GLOCESTER CODE § 350-105
279:540
amended, to at least three separate entities, one of which entities
shall be the Town, one of which shall be a nonprofit organization,
the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open space
or resource protection, and one of which shall be an association of
owners of lots or units within the development. If no such owners'
association is created, then at least two entities shall be nonprofit
conservation organizations.
(8) The perpetual maintenance of all open space shall be guaranteed
by appropriate deed restrictions and by the grant of a conservation
or preservation restriction to the Town, pursuant to Title 34,
Chapter 39, of the Rhode Island General Laws, as amended. The
Planning Board or administrative officer shall approve the form and
content of all deed restrictions at the time of final approval of the
subdivision. Every deed restriction providing a maintenance
guarantee shall contain the following provision:
"If the owners, or their successors or assigns fail to maintain the
open space or any improvements thereon, the Town may perform
any necessary maintenance and enforce the payment for such
costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, by an action at law or
in equity against the owners or their successors or assigns."

ARTICLE XIII
Village Overlay District
[Added 3-15-2012, effective 4-11-2012]
§ 350-106. Findings.
§ 350-107. Purpose.
A. The Town of Glocester finds that the revitalization of our village centers
will promote the general health and welfare of the Town by working to
fulfill the existing economic, housing, and transportation needs of the
Town.
B. Current zoning in Chepachet Village falls within the B-1 Neighborhood
Commercial, A-4 Four-Acre Agricultural Zone, and R-2, Two-Acre
Residential Zones. These zoning designations have limited uses that in
most cases allow a use in one zone, but it is prohibited in the other. This
does not provide the village an opportunity for expansion and new
businesses, new housing and the greatest flexibility for redevelopment.
The Town endeavors to create a new overlay district that encourages
compact development which will establish new housing and economic
opportunities in Chepachet Village.
C. As part of this redevelopment, the Town aspires to maintain the
traditional development pattern and village character by employing
design elements that mimic and complement existing historic
architecture, reuse existing buildings and develop unused and
underused parcels.
A. The proposed Village Overlay District is to provide flexibility for
housing, new business and business expansion with the need for
minimal variances or special use permits. The creation of a Village
Overlay District unifies under one district the current zoning in the
existing commercial, agricultural and residential districts and will
provide for revitalization of the village center. The Village Overlay
District amendment is also intended to promote pedestrian travel
within the village and the development of vacant land as mixed uses
with a pedestrian scale and walkablity that would complement the
existing village fabric. Lots within the Village Overlay District shall be
developed to be a walkable connection to the existing village.
B. The Village Overlay District is intended to:
(1) Build upon and complement the historic development patterns in
the Village of Chepachet to enhance and create attractive walkable
neighborhoods;
(2) Encourage the adaptive reuse of abandoned, vacant or
underutilized properties and structures, where appropriate;
§ 350-106 YARD SALES § 350-107
279:543
§ 350-108. Applicability.
All parcels within the Village Overlay District are allowed to utilize the
overlay zoning. Existing underlying zoning is still applicable to all existing
and future parcels within the district, except as identified as prohibited
herein.

§ 350-110. Subdistricts.
The Village Overlay District is broken down into two subdistricts, based on
the scale of development and types of uses that are generally promoted in
these areas. The first subdistrict, "Center District," is characterized by a
dense development pattern that is focused on walkability and is generally
identified as the Chepachet Main Street area associated with denser mixeduse
development. The second subdistrict, "Village District" area, is outside
the Center District and is also designed to be walkable but allows
automobile-oriented businesses and businesses which may include a drive
through window. The Village District is an area where larger planned
developments may occur that enhance the character of the surrounding
parcels while providing housing and commercial opportunities.
§ 350-111. Land uses.
(3) Allow for a mix of land uses that are appropriate to the needs of the
community and the uses and scale of surrounding properties in the
village;
(4) Provide incentives to develop larger parcels in a coordinated,
planned approach that is in keeping with the village scale and
enhances the walkability;
(5) Maintain a high level of design quality throughout the district.
(6) Encourage the strategic placement of usable green space in the
village to augment existing open space and parks and to improve
walkability.
A. The Village District.
(1) The following uses are allowed as a matter of right within the
Village District: professional office; bank, credit union or office;
lunchroom/restaurant; tavern or nightclub; theater or concert hall;
personal convenience services; veterinary office or animal hospital;
pet shop; general retail; package store; antique sales and used
furniture; multifamily housing and apartments located above or
behind a nonresidential use; bed-and-breakfasts; child day-care

§ 350-112. Dimensional regulations.
§ 350-113. Mix of commercial-residential.
The district strives to create a 50/50 mix of commercial and residential
within the district and each structure. It is a goal to have a mix of uses
within each building in the village.
centers; indoor/outdoor cafes; outdoor seating associated with
restaurants or cafes; art galleries; legal office; medical office and
small-scale medical laboratories; and artists' live/work space.
(2) The following uses are allowed only by special use permit within
the Village District: off-street parking lots as a primary use; outdoor
markets; apartment complexes, two-family and multifamily
residential, without retail; and gasoline service stations, auto
repair services and garages.
(3) The following uses are prohibited in the Village District: nurseries
and raising of crops; game rooms and arcades; self-serve laundries;
trailer courts; salesrooms for the display of motor vehicles, trailers
and machinery; adult book- and/or video store or amusement
operation; and nursing homes.
(4) Nonconforming uses shall be allowed to continue and are in no way
being singled out for removal from the village. The Town intends to
allow these uses to remain and expand as necessary to keep up
with demand. This article is intended to encourage businesses that
are in keeping with the goal of creating mixed-use, small-scale
pedestrian-oriented development in the village.
B. Center District.
(1) Due to small lot sizes, encouraging mixed uses, improving
walkability and helping preserve the compact development pattern
of this area, the Center District also prohibits: drive-through
windows; gasoline service stations; auto repair services and
garages; one-story buildings; single-family residential (but allowed
in A-4); and retail establishments over 10,000 square feet in floor
area.
A. Frontage and area required. Frontage may be reduced to 50 feet in
order to encourage mixed uses. Lot size may be reduced to an area of
one acre for mixed uses and commercial in situations where both water
and septic disposals can be accommodated on site or off site nearby.
B. Setbacks. The front setback may be reduced to zero to match the
setback of neighboring buildings only for mixed-use buildings where
neighboring existing buildings have a similar setback.

§ 350-116. Service roads and service areas.
§ 350-117. Other considerations.
§ 350-118. Design standards.
A. Drive-up and drive-through windows shall be limited to banks and
pharmacies as an allowed use. Food and drink establishments are
allowed only with a special use permit granted by the Zoning Board of
Review.
B. Drive-through windows shall be placed in the rear of the building. In
places where they cannot be in the rear of the building, placement can
be on the side of the building. Vehicle stacking shall not be in the front
of the building and is desired to be to the rear of the building. The
stacking driveway is encouraged to wrap around the building, utilizing
on-site driveway(s).
A. Service roads. The creation of shared service roads and entrances is
encouraged in order to reduce on-street traffic.
B. Service areas. All service areas shall be designed, relocated or
redesigned to consider negative impact on surrounding properties.
Pickup and delivery times, dumpster emptying times, and other
services which can generate noise and other nuisances shall be
coordinated to avoid negative neighbor impacts.
A. Any uses not specifically identified in the Village Overlay Zoning
District which are allowed in 350 Attachment 1, Table of Use
Regulations, are allowed.
B. Structures and other developments that are larger than 10,000 square
feet of floor area are allowed only by special use permit or land
development project. Developments of this size are encouraged to be
designed to fit in with the existing village character and add to the
walkability and desirable physical and economic attributes of the
village.
A. Special considerations shall be implemented for building design that is
in keeping with and enhances the historic look and feel of the village.
Design standards shall be considered in terms of scale, massing, roof
shape, spacing and exterior building materials. The design standards
shall promote quality buildings and renovations that are similar to and
compatible with the traditional historic architecture of the Village of
Chepachet. These design standards will ensure development that is

§ 350-119. Outdoor displays.
Approval of outdoor displays of products for sale by the merchant can
be obtained by application to the Building Official. Granting of outdoor
displays shall be made based on demonstrating appropriate space, without
obstructing pedestrian or automobile traffic. Displays are temporary and
are allowed only when the business is open. Displays can only be placed
within the subject property boundaries. (See the zoning amendment that
is incorporated into the Code under Chapter 350, Article VII, Special
Regulations.)
consistent with the Town's sense of history and promote a human scale
and pedestrian-oriented village character.
B. A mix of uses which complement each other and the character of the
village are encouraged in the Village Zone. By placing emphasis on
compatibility with neighboring architecture and current uses, a balance
can be maintained that is sustainable and economically viable for the
village. Additionally, the strategic installation of outdoor seating and
small park areas, which may include benches, green spaces and
connecting pathways, are encouraged to help facilitate pedestrian
access to and from businesses and residential properties.
C. The size and scale of buildings shall resemble surrounding buildings,
businesses, houses or barns. The look of shopping centers and big box
retail centers shall be avoided. Appropriate architectural details that
add visual interest at the street level are required to reduce building
scale. Blank and flat walls shall be addressed to either be screened or
dressed up with windows, covered walkways, columns, or raised
surfaces to break up the wall and add visual interest.
D. Buildings shall be placed in a manner that is complementary to the
existing development pattern and architecture of the village. Massing,
height and setbacks from the street and other buildings should be
consistent or complementary with surrounding buildings.
E. New construction or substantial reconstruction should consider
alterations that incorporate traditional pitched roof forms, gables and
other attributes that contribute to the historic character of the village.
The use of flat roofs, concrete block and large panels of glass as part of
the facade or street-facing portions of the building is discouraged and
represents architectural design not in keeping with the village.
F. All service areas, inclusive of mechanical, loading utilities and
equipment storage shall be as unobtrusive or sufficiently screened so
that they may not be seen from the street, public common areas and
neighboring residential uses. These areas shall also be designed and/or
incorporate techniques to buffer noise to adjacent uses.

CAPITAL PROJECTS POLICY
§ 355-1. Formation of Building/Project Committee for major capital
construction projects.
Whenever a major capital construction project shall be planned, a Building/
Project Committee shall be formed consisting of five qualified electors
appointed by the Town Council to be responsible for the planning and
supervision of all such construction. The Building/Project Committee shall
be formed for no other purpose and shall assume its duties immediately
after the appropriation or acquisition of funds for the preliminary planning
of a project, and shall continue in office during its construction and until
formal acceptance by the Town, or until discharged by the vote of the
Council.
§ 355-2. Solicitation of members; rules of conduct.
The Board, by consensus, suggests to the Council that members of any
such committee be sought through advertising in local papers; that the
committee be required to follow Town Procurement Policy; that the Council
be kept informed of progress; and that the Finance Director be kept up-todate
on project scheduling.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY
§ 361-1. Findings and purpose.
A. Equal employment opportunity (EEO) is a well-known household phrase
throughout our community and the nation. The Town Council totally
supports the concept of EEO. In addition, we are constantly reminded
by the media of the importance and the urgency of our responsibilities
in this vital matter. To change the many words spoken and printed on
the subject to an active and effective EEO program requires
imagination, a true sense of fair play and the will of a dynamic
management team to make the program work. The EEO program goal
in Glocester is a total dedication by all concerned to equitably consider
qualified personnel for employment, promotion, training and any other
personnel action which offers immediate or future opportunity to any
individual for a better job or improvement in his or her well-being. The
Council, without reservation, encourages all levels of management to
be constantly aware of their responsibilities and opportunities to
become personally involved in an equal employment opportunity
program which will show measurable results. It is not enough to
§ 350-119 GLOCESTER CODE § 361-1
355:548
§ 361-2. Policy statement.
The Town of Glocester declares and reaffirms a policy of equal employment
opportunity, and of nondiscrimination in the provision of all services to the
public.
demonstrate a willingness "to go along" with the program; it is
imperative that we, as a team, achieve tangible results. People are
our most important resource, regardless of race, color, creed, age, sex
or national origin. We must think and act positively to support this
important program; the full and effective utilization of the potential of
our community's manpower resources depends on it.
B. It is the firm and forthright policy of the Town of Glocester to promote
the full realization of equal employment opportunity through a
continuing affirmative program. This policy does not simply involve the
consideration of women and minority group persons (primarily
American Indians, Negroes, Orientals and Spanish Americans) who
apply to the Town for employment, but it requires that the Town
conduct special recruitment efforts to seek out and hire minority group
members and women with career potential. It also encompasses
training and development programs to eliminate underutilization of
employees presently in the Town. Discrimination against any employee
or qualified applicant for employment because of race, creed, age,
color, sex or national origin is prohibited.
C. Also prohibited is discrimination because of politics, marital status and
physical handicap. All discrimination complaints will be promptly, fairly
and impartially considered, and no reprisals will be allowed against a
complainant or any representative testifying in the complainant's
behalf. Complainants, in turn, must accept their obligation to support
their allegation of discrimination in a temperate and factual manner.
A. Equal employment opportunity. The Town of Glocester will make all
decisions regarding recruitment, hiring, promotions, and other terms
and conditions of employment without discrimination on grounds of
race, color, creed or religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or
mental handicap, or other factors which cannot be lawfully used as the
basis of employment decisions.
B. Affirmative action in employment. The Town of Glocester undertakes a
program of affirmative action, to which good faith efforts will be
directed to:
(1) Determine the extent to which minorities and women are
underutilized in major categories;
(2) Identify and eliminate the specific causes of such underutilization;
(3) Identify and eliminate all employment practices which have an
adverse impact on minorities, women and others protected by
applicable law;
§ 361-1 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY POLICY § 361-2
361:549
§ 361-3. Compliance with other laws.
(4) Replace such practices by others which are based on merit and
valid job qualifications;
(5) Develop substantial applicant pools of validly qualified minorities
and women, by recruitment efforts and other means to ensure that
sufficient numbers of these groups are included to help reduce
their underutilization;
(6) Develop, through recruitment efforts and other measures,
applicant pools in which handicapped persons and Vietnam-era
veterans are represented equitably;
(7) Project goals and timetables to include estimates of the
representation of minorities and women likely to result from the
operation of this affirmative action plan; and
(8) Establish organizational structures and monitoring systems which
will assure effective operation of the affirmative action program,
achievement of its goals, and means for modification of the plan as
needed.
C. Nondiscrimination in public service.
(1) The Town of Glocester reaffirms its policy on nondiscrimination, on
the basis of minority status, sex or other impermissible grounds, in
the provision of all services provided to members of the public by
all agencies and facilities of the Town.
(2) The Town commits itself to a continuing program to assure that
unlawful discrimination does not occur in the service it renders to
the public and that those sectors of the public most affected by this
policy be kept informed of its contents.
A. Through the policies and programs set forth in this plan, the Town
undertakes to comply fully with all applicable federal and state laws
relating to equal employment opportunity, affirmative action and
nondiscrimination in public services.
B. This plan specifically addresses the obligations of the Town under the
following laws and regulations:
(1) Title VI and VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;
(2) Executive Order 11246, as amended;
(3) Revised Order #4;
(4) The Equal Pay Act of 1963;
(5) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973;
(6) The Vietnam Era Veterans Rehabilitation Act of 1974;

FAIR HOUSING POLICY
§ 364-1. Policy statement.
Discrimination in the sale, rental, leasing, financing of housing or land to be
used for construction of housing or in the provision of brokerage services
because of race, color, religion, sex or national origin is prohibited by Title
VIII of the 1968 Civil Rights Act (Federal Housing Law). It is the policy of
the Town of Glocester to implement programs to ensure equal opportunity
in housing for all persons regardless of race color, religion, sex or national
origin. Therefore, the Town of Glocester does hereby pass the following
resolution.
§ 364-2. Assistance in filing complaints of discrimination.
Within available resources, the Town of Glocester will assist all persons who
feel they have been discriminated against because of race, color, religion,
sex or national origin to seek equity under federal and state laws by filing
a complaint with the Rhode Island Civil Rights Commission or the US
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
§ 364-3. Publication of policy.
The Town of Glocester shall publish this resolution and through this
publicity shall cause owners of real estate, developers and builders to
become aware of their respective responsibilities and rights under the
Federal Fair Housing Law and any applicable state or local laws or
ordinances.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE POLICY
§ 373-1. Purpose.
§ 373-2. Situation and assumptions.
A. This Hazardous Material Response Annex for the Town of Glocester has
been prepared to meet statutory planning requirements of the federal
Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA Title
III), and to provide for a higher degree of preparedness to deal with
incidents involving hazardous materials.
B. The plan has been specifically designed to serve as an annex to the
Town's Emergency Operation Plan (EOP) and supplements that
document. Every effort has been made to integrate the Hazardous
Materials Annex with the EOP. In that regard, the plan is consistent
with existing authorities, planning assumptions, systems, and
procedures.
A. Situation. Extremely hazardous substances are being transported
through the Town of Glocester and have the potential for hazardous
material incidents. The transportation routes for these chemicals are:
Route 44, Route 102, Snake Hill Road, and Chestnut Hill Road.
B. Assumptions.
(1) Potentially dangerous materials are transported through the Town
of Glocester. These materials do not present a threat in their
88.Editor's Note: See Ch. 350, Zoning.
§ 368-1 GLOCESTER CODE § 373-2

§ 373-3. Concept of operations.
controlled environment; however, an accidental release could
result in hazardous situations.
(2) Town government along with the three Fire Districts (Harmony/
Chepachet/West Glocester) is responsible for safety measures or
precautions that may be required for public protection until a
hazardous situation has been corrected and the material is again in
its controlled environment.
(3) State and federal government is responsible for providing needed
services and resources which are unavailable to, or not within, the
capabilities of local government.
A. Notification of procedures.
(1) This procedure reflects the belief that state response personnel
must be immediately notified of a release.
(2) When a hazardous materials incident occurs, notification of the
incident can be received in several ways. Most incidents will be
reported through the E-911 System to the Glocester Police
Department.
(3) Upon notification of a hazardous material emergency, the Dispatch
Center shall record all emergency notification information on the
Rhode Island SERC Release Report Form (Attachment 3).89
(4) The Dispatch Center shall immediately alert and inform the local
area Fire Department of the emergency notification information.
(5) At the request of the Incident Commander, the Dispatch Center
shall immediately alert and inform the State Emergency Response
Commission (SERC) of the emergency notification information via
the State Spill Hotline, (401) 274-7745. (The State Spill Hotline is
operated by the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency. Its
purpose is to provide a statewide reporting system for hazardous
materials spills and to initiate the appropriate state response.)
B. On-scene response operations.
(1) The first arriving units must assess the situation for its potential
danger to the safety and health of the population in the immediate
area. The area will be restricted immediately by law enforcement
agencies until the danger or potential danger can be assessed. If
evacuation of surrounding areas is warranted, this limited
evacuation procedure should be initiated. A command post will be
established. All agency representatives called to the scene should
report to this point. The Incident Commander on scene shall
89.Editor's Note: Attachment 3 is on file in the Town offices.
§ 373-2 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE POLICY § 373-3
373:557
declare a response level, which may be increased or decreased as
more senior officers arrive. A description of response levels follows:
(a) Response Level 1- Controlled Emergency Condition:
[1] Incident can be controlled by the primary first responders;
[2] Single jurisdiction and limited agency involvement;
[3] Does not require evacuation, except for structure or
facility;
[4] Confined geographic area;
[5] No immediate threat to life, health, or property.
(b) Response Level 2 - Limited Emergency Condition:
[1] Potential threat to life, health, and property;
[2] Expanded geographic scope;
[3] Limited evacuation of nearby residents or facilities;
involvement of more than one jurisdiction;
[4] Specialist or technical team called to the scene;
[5] Combined emergency operations such as fire fighting and
evacuation, or containment and emergency medical care;
[6] Requires the establishment of a command post.
(c) Response Level 3 - Full Emergency Condition:
[1] Serious hazard or severe threat to life, health and
property;
[2] Large geographic impact;
[3] Major community evacuation;
[4] Multi-jurisdictional involvement;
[5] State and federal involvement;
[6] Specialists and technical teams deployed;
[7] Extensive resource management and allocation;
[8] Multiple emergency operations;
[9] Requires on-scene command post and activation of the
community Emergency Operations Center (EOC).
(2) Incident Command System:
§ 373-3 GLOCESTER CODE § 373-3
373:558
(a) The Senior Officer of the Fire District having jurisdiction or his
designate on scene will act as the Incident Commander (IC)
and direct the on-scene operations and coordinate the efforts
of all agencies involved in on-site emergency operations
related to the incident. The IC will act through the respective
agency representatives, who will maintain control over their
respective forces.
(b) Because of the nature of most hazardous material incidents, a
unified command structure will be used. Under a unified
command structure in the Incident Command System (ICS),
the implementation of the action plan will be done under the
direction of a single individual, the operations chief. The
operations chief will normally be from the agency that has the
greatest jurisdictional involvement and will be assigned by the
Incident Commander.
(c) The concept of unified command simply means that all
agencies who have a jurisdictional responsibility at a
multijurisdictional incident contribute to the process of:
[1] Determining overall incident objectives;
[2] Selection of strategies;
[3] Insuring that joint planning for tactical activities will be
accomplished;
[4] Insuring that integrated tactical operations are conducted.
(d) The proper selection of participants to work within a unified
command structure will depend upon:
[1] The location of the incident; which political jurisdictions
are involved;
[2] The kind of incident; which functional agencies of the
involved jurisdictions are involved.
(e) In Glocester, the unified command structure table of
organization will consist of:
[1] The Fire Department;
[2] The Police Department;
[3] The principal responsible party (PRP) facility
representative;
[4] Civil Defense.
(f) Under this plan, the person in charge of plant personnel and
resources will be part of the unified command structure, in an
advisory capacity.
§ 373-3 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE POLICY § 373-3
373:559
(g) Additional agencies may be included in the decision-making
process as their involvement in the mitigation effort increases.
At that time they will become part of the unified command staff
and be co-located at the command post (CP).
(h) The Fire Department (Incident Commander), the Police
Department, and ranking officer of requested/required
responding agencies will be co-located at the CP with direct
access to the Incident Commander.
(i) The IC will coordinate the mitigation of the hazardous
materials incident, and the RI Department of Environmental
Management shall oversee the clean-up process.
(j) When activities are judged by the safety officer to be unsafe
and/or to involve an imminent danger condition, the safety
officer shall immediately inform the IC of the existing condition
and by mutual agreement take appropriate action.
(k) There will be one command post located at the incident scene.
This will be the command post (CP) in close proximity to the
incident where the initial control will be exercised by the IC.
An access control point located a safe distance from the
incident at the best access point to the scene will be controlled
by the Police Department.
(l) A staging area, if implemented, will be located a safe distance
away with good access to the incident and where equipment
and personnel can be assembled for deployment by the IC. All
responding agencies will report to the staging area where the
Liaison Officer (LO) will monitor the responding organizations
and advise the Incident Commander of the availability of
apparatus, equipment, and personnel.
C. Public warning and emergency information.
(1) General.
(a) The purpose of this subsection is to provide for timely, reliable
and effective warning to the public in the event of a hazardous
material emergency and to provide emergency information
pertaining to the need for protective actions and provide
information on the emergency situation to the media.
(b) A release of a hazardous material into the environment could
quickly bring harm to the public. The public, however, can be
protected through the implementation of protective actions. In
order for protective actions to be effective, the public must be
first warned, or alerted, that an emergency exists and,
secondly, instructed on what to do.
(2) Emergency information procedures.
§ 373-3 GLOCESTER CODE § 373-3
373:560
(a) Door-to-door route alerting.
[1] Altering and notifying the population by going door to door
is usually the first procedure initiated immediately after an
incident. Sometimes, especially in transportation
emergencies, this procedure may be the only means
available for notifying segments of the public. However,
door-to-door route alerting can be very time consuming, a
problem in rapidly developing hazardous material
incidents.
[2] Responders who do not have the proper protective
equipment must not place themselves at risk by entering a
toxic atmosphere in an attempt to alert the population.
(b) Area route alerting. In this method, motor vehicles equipped
with public address systems travel routes identified by the
Incident Commander to notify people of the emergency
situation. The Incident Commander shall determine the
appropriate protective action (sheltering in-place evacuation)
and, in the event an evacuation is necessary, the general
direction toward which evacuees should proceed.
(c) Emergency Broadcast System (EBS).
[1] Normally, EBS activation will occur for Level 3
emergencies (actual or potential) and in the event the
entire Town or adjacent communities may be affected.
[2] In most cases, it would not be necessary to activate the
statewide EBS to notify the entire state of a hazardous
material emergency. However, the statewide EBS may be
utilized to inform listeners to tune to a particular radio
station for further information. Community officials are
encouraged to and may develop an agreement with a local
radio station to broadcast local emergency information.
[3] Activation of the EBS.
[a] The Incident Commander shall request that the Civil
Defense Director or his alternate communicate with
the RI Emergency Management Agency (during
normal office hours) or the RI State Police to contact
radio station WLKW-AM to stand by for a statewide
EBS announcement.
[b] The Incident Commander shall select the appropriate
protective action, and EBS message, and
communicate this to the radio station, through an
appointed communications officer. All
communications to the radio station shall be approved
by the IC.
§ 373-3 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE POLICY § 373-3
373:561
[c] Communications should be kept open between the
radio station and the Incident Commander at all times
for further updates. During a serious emergency that
would require the use of EBS, updates might be
required frequently (at least every 10 minutes).
[d] Sample EBS messages have been prepared to assist
Incident Commanders. The pertinent details are to be
filled in to deal with the actual situation. See
Attachment 2 to this annex.90
D. Protective actions.
(1) General: to implement actions that would reduce or eliminate
public and emergency worker exposure to hazardous materials
release into the environment. A release of a hazardous material
into the environment could quickly bring harm to public health and
can immediately pose life-threatening dangers to emergency
workers. In-place sheltering and evacuation are protective actions
that the public could take to reduce or eliminate its exposure to a
hazardous material.
(2) Implementing public protective action. The Incident Commander
shall be responsible for ordering initial protective actions. In a
large-scale protective action, representatives of the Town Council
shall be notified. To be effective, protective actions must be started
as soon as the hazard is recognized by the Incident Commander.
Windborne chemical plumes travel the speed of the wind. For
example, if a light breeze of five miles per hour is blowing, the
plume will travel approximately five miles in one hour or one mile
in 12 minutes.
(a) In-place sheltering. Evacuation during incidents involving
chemicals is sometimes, but by no means always, necessary.
Airborne toxicants can be released and move downwind so
rapidly that there would be no time to evacuate residents. For
short-term releases, often the most prudent course of action
for the protection of the nearby residents would be to remain
inside with the doors and windows and the heating and air
conditioning systems shut off. An airborne release will
frequently move past quickly. Additionally, vulnerable
populations, such as the sick and elderly, may sustain more
injury during evacuation than they would by staying inside and
putting simple countermeasures into effect.
(b) Evacuation. Accidental releases of hazardous materials may
require the evacuation of the population. These areas can
include those directly affected by toxic fumes and those that
may be potentially affected during the course of the incident.
90.Editor's Note: Attachment 2 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 373-3 GLOCESTER CODE § 373-3
373:562
§ 373-4. Organization and responsibilities.
Evacuation is a complex undertaking. The considerations to
the evacuation plan include:
[1] The specific area to evacuate;
[2] Protective gear to be worn to conduct evacuation/alert;
[3] Instructions to be given to evacuees;

transportation;
[5] Assistance to special populations;
[6] Shelter locations;
[7] Security for evacuated areas;
[8] Traffic and pedestrian control;
[9] Communication procedures.
(3) Terminating protective actions. The Incident Commander shall
authorize persons to reenter affected or threatened areas when the
RI Department of Health and/or RI Department of Environmental
Management advises that reentry is safe.

terms what they see, what information they have been given, and
what action they are taking. The situation report should be updated
every 15 minutes or if the situation changes dramatically. The
amount of product involved or the department's ability to handle
the situation does not alter the fact that a hazardous material
incident exits. When there is any doubt about the identity of a
product it shall be considered hazardous until it has been identified
and proven to be otherwise.
§ 373-4 GLOCESTER CODE § 373-4

Chapter 399
SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY
§ 399-1. Policy statement; administration.
§ 399-2. Scope.
This policy applies to all employees, elected officials, and appointees of the
Town of Glocester.
§ 399-3. Responsibility for administration and enforcement.
(2) The applicant shall be given a clear understanding of the board's
consideration of the appropriateness of the proposal, whether or
not the proposal meets the board's standards of review that will be
employed and any suggestions or modifications that the board feels
appropriate.
A. It is the policy of the Town of Glocester to maintain a working
environment that is entirely free of sexual harassment in any form.
Supervisors, managers and all other employees, elected officials and
appointees are absolutely prohibited from engaging in sexual
harassment of Town of Glocester employees, elected officials,
appointees, visitors, and members of the general public. Sexual
harassment is unlawful. Because sexual harassment can be destructive
to morale as well as to the Town of Glocester's reputation and because
it can be extremely costly to the Town of Glocester in terms of lost
productivity, lost employees, and out-of-pocket expense, no act of sexual
harassment can serve the Town of Glocester or be incidental to any
service on account of which any employee has been employed. Thus,
any act or pattern of sexual harassment by any employee, elected
official or appointee of the Town of Glocester is beyond the scope of his
or her authority as an employee, agent, supervisor or servant of the
Town of Glocester, which may include the termination of employment or
appointment. Such conduct will subject the employee or appointee to
discipline up to termination of employment or appointment.
B. The Town of Glocester will administer all provisions of this policy
without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age,
national origin, handicap, Vietnam-era veteran status, or disabled
veteran status.
A. The Glocester Town Council has overall responsibility for this policy.
§ 392-3 SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY § 399-3
399:577
§ 399-4. Definition and examples of sexual harassment.
B. The Finance/Personnel Director is responsible for the implementation
and daily administration of this policy.
C. Supervisory employees at all levels are responsible for implementing
and enforcing this policy, and for assisting in investigating and
processing complaints with the utmost priority and consideration for
the rights of all concerned.
D. Every employee, elected official, and appointee is responsible for
reporting to his/her supervisor or the Finance/Personnel Director or, if
appropriate, the Town Council, any incident of sexual harassment that
he/she witnesses or learns of. The Town of Glocester will maintain the
highest degree of confidentiality possible with respect to such reports,
consistent with its obligation to investigate thoroughly all such reports.
A. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual
harassment when:
(1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a
term or condition of an individual's employment or appointment;
(2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used
as the basis for employment or appointment decisions affecting
such individual;
(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering
with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,
hostile, or offensive working environment.
B. Some examples of conduct towards employees, elected officials, or
appointees prohibited by this policy include:
(1) Physical assaults of a sexual nature, such as:
(a) Assault, rape, sexual battery, molestation or threats or
attempts to commit these acts; or
(b) Unwelcome intentional physical conduct, or threats of such
conduct, which is sexual in nature, such as touching, pinching,
patting, grabbing, brushing against another person's body, or
poking another person's body.
(2) Unwanted sexual advances, propositions or other sexual
comments, such as:
(a) Sexually oriented gestures, noises, remarks, jokes or
comments about a person's sexuality or sexual experience;

399:578
§ 399-5. Issuance and circulation of policy statement.
§ 399-6. Employee report and investigation procedure.
(b) Giving rewards or promises of rewards for submitting to sexual
conduct, or reprisals or threats of reprisal for refusal to submit
to sexual conduct;
(3) Sexual or discriminating displays in the workplace such as:
(a) Displaying or otherwise publicizing in the work environment
materials that are sexually revealing, suggestive, demeaning
or pornographic; or
(b) Displaying signs or other materials purporting to segregate an
employee, elected official, or appointee by sex in any area of
the workplace (other than restrooms and similar semi-private
lockers/changing rooms).
(4) Retaliation against an employee, elected official, or appointee for
making a complaint under this policy or for assisting or cooperating
in an investigation of a complaint under this policy;
(5) Failure to cooperate fully with investigation of harassment
complaints.
A. The Finance/Personnel Director is responsible for publicizing this policy
to all employees, elected officials, and appointees by inclusion in the
Town of Glocester's Employee Handbook.
B. The Finance/Personnel Director or his/her designee is responsible for
developing a bulletin board notice to all employees, elected officials,
and appointees for posting at the time that this policy is adopted by the
Town of Glocester. The notice will emphasize the importance of the
policy to the Town of Glocester, the obligation of every employee,
elected official, or appointee to report any incident of sexual
harassment, the availability of supervisors and administrative staff to
receive such reports and the confidentiality with which these reports
will be treated.
C. A copy of the policy will be given to all current employees, elected
officials, and appointees, and new employees, elected officials, and
appointees will be given a copy upon hire or commencement of duties.
Employees, elected officials, and appointees will provide written
acknowledgment that they have received the policy and understand its
terms.
A. Employees, elected officials, and appointees may report sexual
harassment to any supervisor or manager, or directly to the Finance/
Personnel Director, 1145 Putnam Pike, Chepachet, RI 02814,
401-568-3342, or, if the Finance/Personnel Director is involved in the

allegation of sexual harassment, to the Glocester Town Council, 1145
Putnam Pike, Chepachet, RI 02814, 401-568-1102.
B. The supervisor or manager will promptly inform either the Finance/
Personnel Director or, if the Finance/Personnel Director is involved in
the allegation of sexual harassment, the Glocester Town Council of any
report of sexual harassment.
C. The Finance/Personnel Director or the Glocester Town Council or his/
her/their designee will thoroughly investigate the report of sexual
harassment as promptly as possible, keeping the matter as confidential
as is practicable. After investigation, he/she/they will take appropriate
action in response to a proven instance of sexual harassment and the
complaining employee, elected official, or appointee will be notified of
the action taken. If, after investigation, the Finance/Personnel Director
or the Glocester Town Council is unable to conclude that any act of
sexual harassment has occurred, he/she/they will meet with the
complaining employee(s), elected official(s), appointee(s) and with the
complained-against employee(s), elected official(s), or appointee(s)
individually to explain both the results of the investigation and the Town
of Glocester's policy on sexual harassment.
D. It is the responsibility of every employee, elected official or appointee to
cooperate fully with any investigation under this policy.
A. Sexual harassment.
(1) Employees and appointees are subject to discipline, up to and
including discharge, for any act of sexual harassment which is
proven to the satisfaction of the Town of Glocester.
(2) The appropriate measure of discipline will be determined on the
basis of the Town of Glocester's assessment of the nature and
severity of the misconduct, along with any other relevant factors.
(3) For any act of sexual harassment or retaliation by an elected official
the Council may take such remedial and other action as it considers
appropriate, and within the scope of its authority. Such action may
include referral of charges of sexual harassment to other agencies.
B. Retaliation. It is unlawful to retaliate in any way against an individual
who has complained of sexual harassment or cooperated in an
investigation of a complaint of sexual harassment. An employee or
appointee may be disciplined, up to and including discharge, for any
such act of retaliation. The appropriate measure of discipline will be
determined on the basis of the Town of Glocester's assessment of the
nature and extent of the retaliation and any other relevant factors
brought to the attention of the Town of Glocester.

§ A423-26. Failure to act.
§ A423-27. Modifications to application.
A pending application for a certificate of appropriateness may be modified
by a written request from the applicant to the HDC. Such request shall
include a description of the proposed change and additional and/or revised
documentation. If an application is modified, it shall be considered a new
application for a certificate of appropriateness.
§ A423-28. Modifications to certificate of appropriateness.

shall require a new application for a certificate of appropriateness. The new
application shall be submitted before construction of the changes begins,
recommendations specifically stating ways in which the plans may be

of appropriateness or a recommendation of compatibility shall be in
writing. The HDC shall state the reasons and basis for each decision in
the form of a resolution.
D. Issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. Upon granting a certificate
of appropriateness, the HDC shall:

application form and all plans and other data. The stamped
documents shall indicate the issue date and be signed by the HDC
Chairman.
(2) Return two sets of stamped, dated and signed documents to the
applicant with a copy of the resolution. It is the responsibility of the
applicant to file one set of these documents and a copy of the
resolution with the Building Official.

at the office of the Building Official.

the date of acceptance of a completed application for a certificate of
appropriateness shall be deemed to constitute approval.
B. Extensions. Within this forty-five-day period the HDC may make written
findings of fact stating that the application for a certificate of
appropriateness requires further time for study and/or to obtain
additional information. In such case the HDC shall have a period of up
to 90 days from the date of acceptance of a completed application
within which to act on such application.
§ A423-25 GLOCESTER CODE § A423-28

months after the date of approval, unless the applicant shall have obtained
a building permit and proceeded with the approved construction. Prior to
the expiration of the initial six-month period upon written request by the
applicant, the HDC may extend the certificate of appropriateness for an
additional six-month period. An applicant's failure to proceed with approved
construction with the six-month extension shall cause the certificate of
appropriateness to become null and void.
§ A423-30. Resubmittal of denied application.
An application for a certificate of appropriateness which has been denied by
the HDC shall not be heard again for a period of one year from the date the
application was denied, unless a majority of the HDC present at a meeting
