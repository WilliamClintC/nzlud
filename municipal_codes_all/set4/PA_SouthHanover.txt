the Code Enforcement Officer finds that the proposed design is
satisfactory and complies with the provisions of the technical codes
and that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose
intended, at least the equivalent of that prescribed in the technical
codes in suitability, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance,
durability, safety and sanitation.
C. The Code Enforcement Officer shall require that sufficient evidence
or proof be submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made

1. General. The Code Enforcement Officer shall make periodic inspection
of any structure vacated as unfit for human habitation or any other
vacant structure. The Code Enforcement Officer shall order the owner

which in the Code Enforcement Officer's judgment is so old, dilapidated
or has become so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or
otherwise unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use, and so that
such structure would be unreasonable to repair the same, to raze and
remove such structure or part thereof; or if such structure can be made
safe by repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to raze and
remove at the owner's option; or where there has been a cessation of
normal construction of any structure for a period of more than two
years, to raze and remove such structure or part thereof.
2. Option by owner. If a structure is so old, deteriorated or has become so
out of repair as to be unsanitary or unfit for human habitation, but can
§ 5-115 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 5-116
1:67
be made safe by repairs, the Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a
notice requiring the owner to make the necessary repairs to bring the
structure into compliance with the Township's codes and/or ordinances
or to demolish and remove the structure at the owner's option. Such
notice shall require the person thus notified to immediately disclose to
the Code Enforcement Officer his acceptance or rejection of the terms
of the order.
3. Unreasonable repairs. Whenever an inspection of a structure reveals
that the structure is so old, dilapidated, damaged by fire, explosion,
windstorm or other natural or criminal acts or has become so out of
repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use and so that it would be
unreasonable to repair, in that the cost of such repairs would exceed
100% of the current value of such structure, the structure shall be
declared a public nuisance. The Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a
notice to the responsible owner, ordering that the structure be removed
or demolished without option on the part of the owner to repair. All the
rubbish and refuse shall be removed from the premises and the cellar/
basement shall be filled in with clean fill graded to adjacent ground
level.
4. Service connections. Before a structure is demolished or removed, the
owner or agent shall notify all utilities having service connections

connections. A permit to demolish or remove a structure shall not be
issued until a release is obtained from the utilities, stating that their
respective service connections and appurtenant equipment, such as
meters and regulators, have been removed or sealed and plugged in a
safe manner.
5. Notice to adjoining owners. Only when written notice has been given by
the applicant to the owners of adjoining lots and to the owners of wired
or other facilities, of which the temporary removal is necessitated by
the proposed work, shall a permit be granted for removal of a building
or structure.
6. Lot regulations. Whenever a structure is demolished or removed, the
premises shall be maintained free from all unsafe or hazardous
conditions by the proper regulation of the lot, restoration of established
grades and the erection of the necessary retaining walls and fences in
accordance with the provisions of the Township's building code [Article
II].
7. Determination by Code Enforcement Officer. In the event that the
owner or agent is unable to obtain the releases, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall inspect the premises for which application has been made,
to determine that the utility service connections and appurtenant
equipment have been removed or sealed and plugged in a safe manner.

§ 5-117. Violations and penalties. [Ord. No. 2-1999, § XVII, 1/26/
1999]
1. Unlawful acts. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to
erect, construct, change the use and occupancy, alter, extend, repair,
remove, demolish, maintain, fail to maintain, provide, fail to provide,
use or occupy, let to another for use or occupy or permit another person
to use or occupy any structure or equipment regulated by this article or
the technical codes or cause same to be done, contrary to or in conflict
with or in violation of any of the provisions of this article and the
technical codes, or to fail to obey a lawful order of the Code
Enforcement Officer, or to remove or deface a placard or notice posted
under the provisions of this article.
2. Occupancy violations. Whenever any building or structure or building
service equipment therein regulated by this article and the technical
codes is being used contrary to the provisions of such codes, the Code
Enforcement Officer shall order such use discontinued by written notice
served on any person causing such use to be continued. Such person
shall discontinue the use within the time prescribed by the Code
Enforcement Officer after receipt of such notice to make the structure,
or portion thereof, comply with the requirement of such codes.
3. Occupancy without use and occupancy certificate. Any change in use or
occupancy of an existing building or structure and/or any new building
hereafter erected for which a building permit was issued, shall not be
used or occupied in whole or in part until a certificate of use and
occupancy shall have been issued by the Code Enforcement Officer.
Failure to secure a use and occupancy certificate before use or
occupancy of a building is subject to immediate fine and costs as
prescribed in this article. No further notification as required under
§ 1-512 et seq. of this article shall be required. The building owner by
signing the building permit and acknowledgment agrees not to violate
any provision of the Township's codes and/or ordinances and is so
notified. The use and occupancy certificate is a "license" to occupy and
use the building.
4. Failure to comply. Whenever an order to vacate, secure, repair, and/or
demolish a structure which is a public nuisance because it is unsafe,
dangerous or unfit for human habitation has not been complied with,
the Code Enforcement Officer may, in accordance with the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, proceed to cause the structure to be
vacated, closed-up and secured, repaired and/or demolished or take
such other action as is necessary to abate the nuisance. Abatement
under this subsection shall not commence until at least 10 days after
the service of the order, except that the Code Enforcement Officer may
determine that more immediate action is required because of the
special emergency or dangerous conditions which exist.
5. Recover of expenses. The expenses incurred pursuant to Subsection 4
of this section and other applicable codes and ordinances shall be paid
§ 5-117 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 5-117
1:69
by the responsible owner, operator, or occupant or by the persons who
caused or maintained such a public nuisance. The Code Enforcement
Officer shall file on his records an affidavit stating with fairness and
accuracy the items and date of the expenses incurred. The Board of
Supervisors of South Hanover Township may institute a suit to recover
such expenses to be charged against the property as a lien.
6. Transfer of ownership. It shall be unlawful for the owner of any
dwelling unit or structure who has received a compliance order upon
whom a notice of violation has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage,
lease or otherwise dispose of to another until the provisions of the
compliance order or notice of violation have been complied with, or
until such owner shall first furnish the grantee, transferee, mortgagee
or lessee a true copy of any compliance order or notice of violation
issued by the Code Enforcement Officer and shall furnish to the Code
Enforcement Officer a signed and notarized statement for the grantee,
transferee, mortgagee or lessee, acknowledging the receipt of such
compliance order or notice of violation and fully accepting the
responsibility without condition for making the corrections or repairs
required by such compliance order or notice of violation.
7. Penalties. Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any
provisions of this article or the technical codes or fails to correct a
violation or institute a remedial action as ordered by the Code
Enforcement Officer, or who shall erect, construct, change the use or
occupancy, install, alter or repair a building/structure or any plumbing,
electrical and mechanical equipment or systems in violation of an
approved plan or directive of the Code Enforcement Officer or of a
permit or certificate issued under the provisions of the Township's
codes shall upon conviction in a summary proceeding, before any
district justice, be sentenced for each such violation to pay a fine of not
less than $50 plus costs and not more than $1,000 plus costs and, in
default thereof, to undergo imprisonment in the county jail for a period
not to exceed 30 days. Each day that a violation continues, after a
service of notice as provided for in this article, shall be deemed a
separate offense. Payment of a fine does not relieve any person, firm or
corporation of their responsibility to comply with this article and the
technical codes.
8. Prosecution. The imposition of the penalties herein prescribed shall not
preclude the solicitor representing the Township from initiating, and he
is hereby ordered to initiate, appropriate actions or proceedings at law
or in equity against the person responsible for the violation for the
purpose of ordering that person:
A. To restrain, correct or remove the violation or refrain from any

A. In cases where a builder or developer desires or is required to
install collection sewers, service laterals and building sewers to
every housing unit within a housing development prior to their
individual sale, he may do so upon meeting all conditions as set
forth in this section and in other sections of this article. Plot plans
for such a development must be submitted to the authority for
approval prior to any construction. Sewer plans conforming to all
original specifications established by the authority, as to type of
pipe, location of mains, size of pipe, grades, all necessary
appurtenances, will be reviewed by the authority's engineer prior
to approval from the necessary state agencies. The engineering
fees and charges for this review shall be paid by the builder or
developer to the authority. In no case will lesser standards than
exist in the presently constructed sewer system and as outlined in
these provisions be permitted for any future extensions.
B. Upon approval of such plans by the authority, the extensions may
be constructed by and at the expense of the builder or developer,
but only under the inspection of an inspector designated by the
authority and/or its engineer. The cost of such inspections,
including salaries and expenses, shall be borne by the builder or
developer making the extensions.
2. When a person who develops and/or subdivides land within the
Township is required by any ordinance of the Township to provide for
the installation of public sanitary sewer facilities within a land
development area and/or subdivision and to provide for connection
lines or when a person not so required desires to provide for such
installation and connection to existing Township collection lines, he
shall install such public sanitary sewer facilities at his own expense
§ 18-206 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-207
1:237
with his own forces, or under separate contract provided that he first
applies for and obtains written authorization from the authority to
proceed with such construction in conformity with approved plans and
specifications.
3. Plan requirements and processing procedures. The following
procedures shall govern the submission of plans for approval to the
authority:
A. Preliminary meeting. Prior to his submission of plans for the
construction of public sanitary sewer facilities, the developer shall
consult with the authority and engineer as well as the South
Hanover Township Board of Supervisors for the purpose of
preliminarily discussing the preparation of sewer design plans. The
developer should, at the preliminary meeting, present any available
data or preliminary drawings he has concerning the nature of the
development proposal and the approximate number of units to be
connected to the sanitary sewer system.
B. Preparation of plans and specifications. Sewer design plans for the
proposed sanitary sewer shall be prepared at the expense of the
developer and may be prepared by the developer's engineer. The
sewer design plans shall meet all requirements of the Department
of Environmental Resources of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and shall further be prepared in accordance with the design
standards and specifications as set forth in this chapter and in
accordance with such additional specifications and requirements
as the authority engineer shall deem appropriate or necessary.
C. Land development planning module. Prior to completion and
submission of sewer design plans to the authority, the developer
shall submit approved copies of the land development planning
module and the soil erosion and sedimentation control plan to the
authority and the Township. Upon receipt of the above items in
form satisfactory to the authority, written notification shall be given
to the developer that he is authorized to proceed with completion of
the sewer design plans and applicable water quality modules.
D. Final sewer design plan and applicable module. Upon completion of
the final sewer design plan and the modules required under the
rules and regulations of the Department of Environmental
Resources of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the same shall be
submitted to the authority with such permit application fees as may
be required by the department of environmental resources prior to
its issuance of a permit to the authority for construction of the
proposed public sanitary sewage collection system. The authority
shall, after review and approval of the final sewer design plan and
applicable module, submit its application for issuance of required
water quality management permit, to the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources.

4. Written authorization to proceed with construction.
A. No construction work shall be commenced until written
authorization is received by the developer from the authority. Upon
receipt by the authority of the requisite permits from the
department of environmental resources authorizing construction of
the proposed public sanitary sewerage system, the authority shall
advise the developer in writing that the developer is authorized to
proceed to construct the proposed public sanitary sewerage
system, provided that the developer has complied with all other
requirements imposed by the authority pursuant to these rules and
regulations. Construction shall commence and proceed in strict
accordance with the final sewer design plan, all applicable
specifications or regulations of the authority and of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Any deviation from the final sewer
design plan; applicable specifications or regulations during any
phase of construction shall be justification for the revocation by the
authority of the developer's authorization to proceed with
construction and upon written notification of such revocation all
construction shall immediately cease.
B. In the event that construction of the proposed public sanitary
sewerage system or any section thereof is not completed within one
year after the date of the issuance of written authorization to
proceed by the authority as provided for in this section, such
written authorization to proceed may be revoked by the authority
or the Township Board of Supervisors, giving notice of such
revocation in writing to the developer. Thereafter, the developer
must secure renewed written authorization from the authority and
Board of Supervisors to proceed to complete the project. No
construction or work of any nature may be performed on the
project subsequent to the supervisors and authority giving written
notice of revocation or authorization to proceed or prior to issuance
of a renewed written authorization.
5. Performance bond or escrow deposit. Prior to issuing written
authorization to the developer to commence construction and as a
prerequisite to such authorization, the developer shall provide a
performance bond or shall deposit an escrow with the authority in an
amount equal to the cost of construction as estimated by the authority's
engineer.
6. Construction schedule. Immediately prior to commencement of
construction, the developer shall provide the authority with an
estimated construction schedule so that the progress and performance
inspections required to be made by the authority under the provisions
of these rules and regulations may be performed.
7. Tests and final inspection. Upon completion of construction and prior to
the discharge of any sewage into the lines, the authority shall conduct a
final inspection, which inspection shall include such tests as the
§ 18-207 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-207
1:239
authority deems necessary to insure that the construction conforms in
all respects to the sewer design plans, specifications and regulations.
Any deficiencies noted at the time of final inspection by the authority
shall be reported in writing to the developer who shall correct such
deficiencies at his expense. Therefore, the developer may request that
a reinspection be made by the authority.
8. Approval and acceptance of system. After completion of the final
inspection and any re-inspections that are necessary, and upon receipt
of a maintenance bond if required pursuant to Subsection 11 of this
section, the authority shall, upon the recommendation and acceptance
of its engineer made in the form of an engineer's certificate of
completion, certifying that the improvements have been constructed in
accordance with the Township specifications, notify the developer in
writing that the constructions is approved, and that the public sanitary
sewage system will be accepted by the authority upon proper
dedication to it by the developer. The developer shall then take such
steps as are necessary to dedicate the system to the authority free of all
liens and encumbrances.
9. No sewage to be discharged into lines prior to approval. No sewage
shall be permitted to be discharged into the newly constructed public
sanitary sewerage system until the developer has been notified in
writing of the authority's approval and intent to accept the system
pursuant to Subsection 7 of this section.
10. Applications for house connections and service lateral connections. All
house connections and service lateral connections to any newly
constructed public sanitary sewer shall be made in accordance with the
rules and regulations applicable to such connections including, but not
limited to, those rules and regulations prescribing permit applications.
Such application shall be required for each connection to be made to a
collecting sewer even though such connection is to be made by a unit
within a planned development, the main collection lines for which are

wastes for industrial establishments. [Ord. No. 67-1977, § 7, 5/10/
1977; Ord. No. 3-1995, 9/12/1995]
1. Method of measuring volume.
A. Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property or, if
applicable, a billing unit or billing units located therein,
constituting an industrial establishment, which shall be
discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the
sewer system, is supplied by the water system, the volume of water
furnished, as determined from meter readings of the water system,
shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/
or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges, subject
to adjustments, if appropriate, as provided in this article.
B. Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or
billing units located therein, constituting an industrial
establishment which shall be discharging sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes into the sewer system, shall have a source or
sources of water supply in addition to or other than the water
system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter
or meters on such additional or other source or sources of water
supply. The total volume consumed, as determined from the meter
readings of the water system and the meter readings of the meter
or meters on such other source or sources of water supply, as
appropriate, shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary
sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing the sewer rentals or
charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this
article.
C. Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or
billing units located therein, constituting an industrial
establishment shall use water from the water system and/or water
from a source or sources of supply in addition to or other than a
water system for cooling or unpolluted commercial or industrial
process purposes and all or part of the water so used shall not be
discharged into the sewer system, the volume used as the measure
of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in
computing sewer rentals or charges may be adjusted by one of the
following methods:
§ 18-306 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 18-307
1:251
(1) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing
sewer rentals or charges.
(2) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume not being discharged into the sewer system. The
readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder shall be used as the measure of discharge of
sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer
rentals or charges.
(3) If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Township, to install a
meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the
volume not discharged into the sewer system, this Township
shall determine, in such manner and by such method as it may
prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is being
discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used
as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges shall
be the percentage so determined of the quantity measured by
the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such estimated
percentage shall be submitted to this Township, after notice of
such estimate. The decision of this Township with respect to
the matter shall be final for the then current calendar year.
D. Whenever an industrial establishment shall discharge only
industrial wastes into the sewer system, the volume of water used,
measured as herein provided, shall be used as a measure of the
quantity of industrial wastes so discharged.
2. Measuring devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall not
be available in connection with the water system, but which shall be
required or permitted under provisions of this article, shall be furnished
and installed in accordance with specifications of this Township by the
owner of the improved property at his expense, shall be under the
control of this Township and may be tested, inspected or repaired by
this Township whenever necessary. The owner of the improved property
upon which such meter or other measuring device shall be installed

1. Subdivisions meeting the criteria of § 22-301, Subsection 1A, with
written authority from the Board of Supervisors, may eliminate the
sketch plan and preliminary plan and prepare the final plat for
submission and review. Subdivisions meeting the requirements of
§ 22-303 may prepare a final plat for submission and review.
2. The applicant shall, not later than five years after the date of approval
of the preliminary plat, (but in no event prior to approval of the
preliminary plat by the supervisors) for that portion he intends to
develop, file with the supervisors a final plat. Such filing shall include as
part of the formal submission all the material and other data required
as listed in this chapter. Failure to comply with the time limitations as
herein provided shall make the approval of the preliminary plat null and
void unless an extension of time is requested by the applicant and for
good cause granted by supervisors.
3. The final plan shall incorporate all the changes and modifications
required by the supervisors; otherwise, it shall conform to the approved
preliminary plat and it may constitute only that portion of the approved
preliminary plat which the applicant proposes to record and develop at
the time; provided, that such position conforms with all of the
requirements of this chapter.
4. Prints, reproducible Mylar and electronic data requirements.
A. Eight prints and a reproducible Mylar of the final plat shall be filed
by the applicant at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning
Commission at which consideration is desired. Any submission of
the final plat to the Township at any time other than a regularly
scheduled meeting of the Commission shall not be considered an
official submission except that the Commission shall, at its first
meeting immediately following any submission which is not made
in accordance with this section, accept said submission as having
been officially made at said meeting.
B. In addition to the prints and reproducible Mylar, a certified copy of
the associated electronic data file (disk) shall be filed with the
Township in order to expedite entering the land development into
the Township's records. The disk shall be in a compatible format to
the current version of AutoCAD.
The electronic data file (disk) shall contain all cross reference items
listed in the Table of Layers shown below, which table may be
revised from time to time by the Township Engineer.

The electronic data file must meet the following requirements:
(1) Electronic data shall be in a format compatible with the
current version of AutoCAD.
(2) All text shall appear only on a separate "TEXT" layer and shall
not be attached to the "ITEM" layers.
(3) A drawing layer name shall be provided for all cross-reference
items (see Table above).
(4) Horizontal (x and y coordinates) and vertical (z coordinates)
data must be provided for all items, as appropriate. Invert
elevations of structures and utilities must also be provided. All
layers must be separate and distinct.
5. Before acting on any subdivision plat, the supervisors may hold a public
hearing thereon pursuant to notice.
6. The supervisors shall act on the final subdivision or land development
plan within 90 days of the date of acceptance and as described in this
article.
7. No change, erasure, modification or revision shall be made on any final
plat of a subdivision or land development plan after approval has been
given by the supervisors and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless the
plat is first resubmitted to the supervisors.
8. Whenever plat approval by the supervisors is required, the Recorder of
Deeds of the county shall not accept any plat for recording unless such
plat officially notes the review of the County Planning Commission.
9. Within 90 days after the date of approval of a final plat by the
supervisors, a Township official shall record an approved duplicate copy
thereof in the office of the recorder or deeds of Dauphin County.
10. Completion of improvements or guarantee thereof prerequisite to final
plat approval.
A. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
passable condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by
this chapter and any walkways, curbs, gutters, streetlights, fire
hydrants, shade trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers
and other improvements as may be required by this chapter have
been installed in accordance with this chapter. In lieu of the
completion of any improvements required as a condition for the
final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees otherwise
required by this chapter, the developer may deposit with the
Township financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the
costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open
§ 22-305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-305
1:321
space improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be
required.
B. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Board of Supervisors, shall furnish the developer with a signed
copy of a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent
upon the developer obtaining satisfactory financial security. The
final plat or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
financial improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or
letter of contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be
revoked if the financial security agreement is not executed within
90 days unless a written extension is granted by the Board of
Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld
and shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
C. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in
such lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial
security for the purposes of this section.
D. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by
the party posting the financial security, provided said bonding
company or lending institution is authorized to conduct such
business within the commonwealth.
E. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public, the completion of any improvements which may be required
on or before the date fixed in the formal action of approval or
accompanying agreement for completion of the improvements.
F. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual cost of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost
for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the ninetieth-day after either the original date
scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of completion.
Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the
developer to post additional security in order to assure that the
financial security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be
posted by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
G. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements,
submitted by the applicant or developer and prepared by a
professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and
§ 22-305 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-305
1:322
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate
of such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good
cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the Township are
unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township and the applicant or developer. The estimate certified
by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and
shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally
by the Township and the applicant or developer.
H. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.
I. In the case where development is projected over a period of years
the Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plats by
sections or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of
development as it finds essential for the protection of any finally
approved section of the development.
J. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time,
of such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors,
and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of
such request within which to allow the Township Engineer to
certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of
the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification the
Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the bonding
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be
deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested. The
Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of
completion and certification by its engineer, require retention of
10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
§ 22-305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-305
1:323
K. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements following completion, the Board of
Supervisors may require the posting of financial security to secure
structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning
of said improvements in accordance with the design and
specifications as depicted on the final plat for a term not to exceed
18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. Said financial
security shall be of the same type as otherwise required in this
section with regard to installation of such improvements, and the
amount of the financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual
cost of installation of said improvements.
L. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public
utility or municipal authority separate and distinct from the
Township, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the
regulations of the controlling public utility or municipal authority
and shall not be included within the financial security as otherwise
required by this section.
M. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of
improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a
plat as set forth in this section, the Township shall not condition the
issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon
the lots or land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual
completion of the improvements depicted upon the approved final
plat. Moreover, if said financial security has been provided,
occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected shall
not be withheld following the improvement of the streets providing
access to and from existing public roads to such building or
buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as
depicted upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or
beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are
necessary for the reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or
buildings.
11. Release from improvement bond.
A. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall,
within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements.
The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report in writing,
with the Board of Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a copy of the
§ 22-305 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-305
1:324
same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report
shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board
of Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not
be approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineer, said
report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection.
B. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within 15 days
of receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or
registered mail of the action of said Board of Supervisors with
relation thereto.
C. If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond or other security agreement.
D. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall
proceed to complete the same and, upon completion, the same
procedure of notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
E. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the
Township Engineer.
F. Where herein reference is made to the Township Engineer, he shall
be as a consultant thereto.
G. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township for the
reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the inspection of
improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors as may be from time to time
amended. Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance
with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the Township
Engineer or consultant for work performed for similar services in
the community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost
charged by the engineer or consultant to the Township when fees
are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants.
(1) In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements the
applicant shall, within 30 days of the date of billing, notify the
Township that such expenses are disputed as unreasonable or
unnecessary, in which case the Township shall not delay or
disapprove a subdivision or land development application or
§ 22-305 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-305
1:325
any approval or permit related to development due to the
applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses.
(2) If, within 45 days from the date of billing, the Township and the
applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Township
shall jointly, by mutual agreement, appoint another
professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable
and necessary.
(3) The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such
evidence and review such documentation as the professional
engineer in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and render
a decision within 50 days of the billing date. The applicant shall
be required to pay the entire amount determined in the
decision immediately.
(4) In the event that the Township and applicant cannot agree
upon the professional engineer to be appointed within 20 days
of the request for an appointment of an arbitrator, then, upon
application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of
Common Pleas of the judicial district in which the Township is
located (or if at the time there be no President judge, then the
senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such engineer,
who, in that case, shall be neither the Township Engineer nor
any professional engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Township or the applicant within
the preceding five years.
(5) The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining
the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the
applicant if the amount of payment required in the decision is
equal to or greater than the original bill. If the amount of
payment required in the decision is less than the original bill by
$1,000, or more, the Township shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township and the
applicant shall each pay one-half of the fee of the appointed
professional engineer.
12. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event that any
improvements which may be required have not been installed as
provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final plat the
Board of Supervisors is hereby granted the power to enforce any
corporate bond, or other security by appropriate legal and equitable
remedies. If the proceeds of such bond, or other security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections
to all the improvements covered by said security, the Board of
Supervisors may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all
or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute
§ 22-305 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-305
1:326
appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable
action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for
the installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not
for any other Township purpose.
13. Final plat supporting documents. The final plat shall be accompanied by
the following data and plans as prescribed by the Commission or as
required by the laws of the commonwealth:

7/12/1997; Ord. No. 2-2000, § 3, 9/26/2000]
All residential developments or subdivisions containing 20 or more dwelling
units or residential lots and all nonresidential developments (with the
exception of agricultural development) that generate 50 or more new peak
hour trips shall provide studies and reports in accordance with the
requirements of this section. All applicants with developments that do not
meet the above stated criteria shall submit the information required in
Subsection 2D.
1. The applicant is responsible for assessing the traffic impacts associated
with a proposed development that meets any condition set forth above.
The Township will review the applicant's assessment and supply
available data upon request to aid the applicant in preparing the study.
The applicant shall be responsible for all data collection efforts required
in preparing a traffic impact study including peak period turning
movement counts. In addition, the applicant is responsible for ensuring
that any submitted development plans meet the minimum state and
local standards for geometric design. The study shall be conducted by a
professional engineer licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and having specific training in traffic and transportation engineering.

revisions prior to submitting a final study.
2. Traffic impact study contents. A traffic impact study prepared for a
specific site development proposal shall follow the basic format shown
below. Additions or modifications should be made for a specific site,
when appropriate. This basic format allows for a comprehensive
understanding of the existing site, future conditions without the
proposed use and the impacts associated with the proposed
development plan. Following is a brief narrative for each section of a
traffic impact study:
A. Introduction. This section identifies the land use and transportation
setting for the site and its surrounding area.
(1) Site and study area boundaries. A brief description of the size
of the land parcel, general terrain features, legal right-of-way
lines of the highway, and the location within the jurisdiction
and the region should be included in this section. In addition,
the roadways that afford access to the site and are included in
the study area should be identified. The exact limits of the
§ 22-3A01 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-3A01
1:333
study area should be based on engineering judgement and an
understanding of existing traffic conditions at the site. In all
instances, however, the study limits must be mutually agreed
upon by the developer, its engineer and the Township.
(2) Site description. This section should contain a brief narrative
that describes the proposed development in terms of its
function, size and near and long term growth potential. This
description should be supplemented by a sketch which clearly
shows the proposed development within the site boundaries,
its internal traffic circulation pattern and the location and
orientation of its proposed access points.
(3) Existing and proposed site uses. The existing and proposed
uses of the site should be identified with reference to the
applicable zoning classification or classifications of the site. In
addition, identify the specific use upon which the study is
premised, since a number of uses may be permitted under the
existing ordinances.
(4) Existing and proposed nearby uses. Include a complete
description of the existing land uses in the vicinity of the site as
well as their current zoning. The applicant should also state
the proposed uses for adjacent land, if known. This latter item
is especially important where large tracts of underdeveloped
land are in the vicinity of the site and within the prescribed
study area. The Township will provide information to the
applicant regarding proposed subdivisions and land
developments of which the Township has knowledge and which
shall be included in the study by the applicant.
(5) Existing and proposed roadways and intersections. Within the
study area, describe existing roadways and intersections
(geometries and traffic signal control) as well as improvements
contemplated by government agencies.
B. Analysis of existing conditions. This section describes the results of
the volume/capacity analysis to be completed for the roadways and
intersections in the study area under existing conditions as well as
any data collection efforts that are required:
(1) Daily and peak hour(s) traffic volumes. Provide schematic
diagrams depicting daily and peak hour(s) traffic volumes for
roadways within the study area. Turning movement and
mainline volumes are to be presented for the three peak hour
conditions (a.m., p.m. and site generated). Mainline volumes
are only required to reflect daily traffic volumes. Include the
source and/or method of computation for all traffic volumes.
Non-site traffic counts shall be based on actual counts not
more than two years old. Traffic may be required to be counted
seven days per week during, or adjusted to reflect the months
§ 22-3A01 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-3A01
1:334
of June through September in areas that are seasonably
affected by the local tourist industry.
(2) Volume/capacity analysis at critical points. Utilizing techniques
described in the most current version of the Transportation
Research Board Highway Capacity Manual, highway capacity
software, or derivative nomographs, include an assessment of
the relative balance between roadway volumes and capacity.
Perform the analysis for existing conditions (roadway and
geometry and traffic signal control) for the appropriate peak
hours.
(3) Level of service at critical points. Based on the results obtained
in the previous section, levels of service (A through F) are to be
computed and presented. This section should also include a
description of typical operating conditions at each level of
service. The recommended level of service analysis procedures
detailed in the most recent edition of the Transportation
Research Board Highway Capacity Manual must be followed.
This source must be referenced in the study.
C. Analysis of future conditions without development. This section
describes the anticipated traffic volumes without the proposed
development or subdivision request. The future year(s) for which
projections are made will be specified by the Township and will be
dependent on the timing of the proposed development.
(1) Daily and peak hour(s) traffic volume. Clearly indicate the
method and assumptions used to forecast future traffic
volumes in order that the Township can duplicate these
calculations. The schematic diagrams depicting future traffic
volumes will be similar to those described in Subsection 2B(1)
in terms of location and times (daily and peak hours).
(2) Volume/capacity analysis at critical locations. Describe the
ability of the existing roadway system to accommodate future
traffic (without site development). If roadway improvements or
modifications are committed for implementation, present the
volume/capacity analysis for these conditions.
(3) Levels of service at critical points. Based on the results
obtained in the previous subsection, determine levels of
service (A through F).
D. Trip generation. Identify the amount of traffic generated by the site
for daily and the three peak hour conditions (a.m., p.m. and site
generated). The trip generation rates used in this phase of the
analysis shall be justified and documented to the satisfaction of the
Township. The trip generation rates used for the proposed
development activity must be from the latest edition of the Trip
Generation Manual by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE). This
source must be referenced in the study.
§ 22-3A01 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-3A01
1:335
E. Trip distribution. Identify the direction of travel for site generated
traffic for the appropriate time periods. As with all technical
analysis steps, the basic method and assumptions used in this work
must be clearly stated in order that the Township can replicate
these results.
F. Traffic assignment. Describe the utilization of study area roadways
by site generated traffic. The proposed traffic volumes should then
be combined with anticipated traffic volumes from Subsection 3 to
describe mainline and turning movement volumes for future
conditions with the site developed as the applicant proposes.
G. Analysis of future conditions with development. This section
describes the adequacy of the roadway system to accommodate
future traffic with development of the site.
(1) Daily and peak hour(s) traffic volumes. Provide mainline and
turning movement volumes for the highway network in the
study area as well as driveway and internal circulation
roadways for the appropriate time periods.
(2) Volume/capacity analysis at critical points. Perform a volume/
capacity analysis for the appropriate peak hours for future
conditions with the site developed as proposed, similar to
Subsections 2B(2) and C(2).
(3) Levels of service at critical points. As a result of the volume/
capacity analysis, compute and describe the level of service on
the study area roadway system.
H. Highway capacity evaluation. All highway capacity evaluations
shall consider the overall intersection level of service and delay,
and evaluate each approach and movement to identify any
substantial values which need to be improved.
I. Recommended improvements.
(1) In the event that the analysis indicates unsatisfactory levels of
service will occur on study area roadways, a description of
proposed improvements to remedy deficiencies should be
included in this section. These proposals would not include
committed projects by the state and local jurisdictions that
were described in Subsection 1 and reflected in the analysis
contained in Subsections 2B and C.
(2) The proposed development access or driveway shall be
designated to provide level of service C or better in the design
year. Off-site intersections affected by the proposed
development should also provide a minimum level of service C
for the future design year with the development.
Improvements shall be proposed to provide future off-site
intersections level of service of at least C for the design year. In
§ 22-3A01 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-3A01
1:336
the event that the intersection/driveway accesses which are
the subject of the study do not meet warrants for a traffic
control device in accordance with the standards of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation or cannot be
improved to achieve a level of service C due to existing
physical limitations, the proposed future intersection with
development shall provide no deterioration of level of service
beyond what is projected for the future no-build condition.
(a) Proposed recommended improvements. Describe the
location, nature and extent of proposed improvements to
assure sufficient roadway capacity. Provide preliminary
cost estimates, sources of funding, timing and likelihood of
implementation for the proposed improvement.
(b) Volume/capacity analysis at critical points. Another
iteration of the volume/capacity analysis will be described
which demonstrates the anticipated results of making
these improvements.
(c) Levels of service at critical points. As a result of the
revised volume/capacity analysis presented in the previous
section, present levels of service for the highway system
with improvements.
J. Conclusion. The last section of the report should be a clear concise
description of the study findings. This concluding section should
serve as an executive summary.

§ 1, 12/9/1997]
1. The purpose of this article is to promote the general health, welfare and
safety of the community by regulating the modification of the natural
terrain and alteration of existing drainage from new subdivision and
development in order to control erosion and sedimentation of soils and
to preserve stream channels through the design, construction and
maintenance criteria of permanent on-site stormwater management
facilities. This section does not imply that areas within or outside any
identified flood-prone area will be free from flooding or flood damage.
2. Act 167 of October 4, 1978, the Stormwater Management Act,
authorizes the regulation of land and water use for flood control and
stormwater management purposes, imposing duties and conferring
powers on the Department of Environmental Resources, municipalities
and counties and providing for enforcement. In addition, the
Department of Environmental Resources Rules and Regulations, Title
25, Chapter 102, Erosion Control, imposes requirements on
earthmoving activities which create accelerated erosion and which
require planning and implementation of effective soil conservation
measures. Refer to Chapter 26, Stormwater Management, § 26-610, et
seq.
3. Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business
or corporation to undertake any of the following activities without
written approval from the Township.
A. Earth disturbing activity affecting five acres or more (except
agricultural activity when operated in accordance with a
conservation plan approved by the Dauphin County Conservation
District).
B. Diversion of piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
C. Installation of a stormwater collection system or appurtenances
thereto.
D. Placement of fill, structure or pipes in the floodplain as designated
on the official floodplain map and as may be documented by other
pertinent sources of floodplain information used by the Township.
E. Land development.
F. Land subdivision.
G. Installation of impervious cover as follows:
§ 22-601 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-601
1:361
(1) Any earth disturbance activity on a property where 60% of the
property is already covered with impervious surfacing and the
area disturbed is 1,000 square feet or more.
(2) Any earth disturbance activity where less than 60% of the
property is covered with impervious surfacing and the area to
be disturbed will be 10% or more of the property's total area or
7,500 square feet, whichever is less.
4. Municipal liability. The degree of stormwater management sought by
the provisions of this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes. This section shall not create liability on the part of the
Township, any appointed or elected official of the Township, the
Dauphin County Conservation District or any officer, engineer or
employee thereof for any erosion, sedimentation or flood damages that
result from reliance on this section or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
5. Plan content. The erosion and sedimentation control/stormwater
management plan (hereafter referred to as "ESC/SWM") shall consist of
maps and a narrative prepared in accordance with Pennsylvania
Regulations, Title 25, Chapter 102, Erosion Control, Department of
Environmental Resources Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Program Manual and shall further include the requirements of this

6. Runoff calculations for control facilities. Design storm frequencies for
stormwater management measures/facilities shall be as follows:
A. Unless otherwise directed by the Township Engineer, the design
storm for stormwater management facilities shall be the ten-year,
twenty-four-hour storm event. The stormwater management
facilities shall be designed to reduce the peak rate of stormwater
runoff discharging from the site, during a ten-year postdevelopment
storm event, to less than or equal to the peak rate of
stormwater runoff discharging from the site during a two year
predevelopment storm event.
B. The stormwater calculations shall include the entire drainage area
contributing to or draining through the site.
C. The primary control structure in a stormwater management facility
shall be designed to pass the design storm without any discharge
over the emergency spillway. The emergency spillway shall be
designed to pass the one-hundred-year post-development storm,
while maintaining a minimum of one foot freeboard.

construction permit shall use the design criteria established by
Title 25, Chapter 102, Erosion Control.
7. Methods of analysis.
A. Watersheds having five acres or more shall calculate the design
storm peak runoff using the Soil Cover Complex Method of the Soil
Conservation Service, "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds,"
Technical Release No. 55 (TR-55), dated June 1986 or later.
§ 22-601 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-601
1:363
B. Watersheds having less than five acres may calculate the design
storm peak runoff using the rational method to determine peak
runoff rate only if this method provides results that compare
reasonably to the TR-55 method and will be utilized to design
isolated, small area stormwater inlets, pipes, culverts or drainage
channels within the site. The rational method shall not be used in
the analysis of stormwater runoff from the subdivision or
development in its entirety or in conjunction with the design of any
stormwater management facility except as approved by the
Township Engineer.
(1) The runoff coefficient (C) shall be determined from the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual,
Part 2, Highway Design, Chapter 10.
(2) The rainfall intensity (I) shall be determined from Intensity-
Duration-Frequency (I-D-F) Curve data presented by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Design Manual,
Part 2, Highway Design, Chapter 10.
C. Open channel hydraulic designs shall be calculated using
Manning's equation.
D. Retention ponds/detention ponds shall be designed using standard
engineering hydraulic procedures established to determine flood
routing.
E. Time of concentration shall be computed by the segmental
approach where the time of concentration is the sum of the
segments for sheet flow, shallow flow and channel flow. Sheet flow
will be that segment in the upper reaches of the watershed where
flow paths are poorly defined and less than 300 feet in length.
Shallow flow will be that segment when flow is assumed to be onetenths
foot deep and continues to the point that an established
channel begins.
F. Design storms shall be events having a period of 24 hours of
rainfall and a Type II distribution and described in the U.S.
Department of Commerce Technical Paper No. 40 or as follows:
Frequency
Rainfall
(inches)
2 year 2.95
5 year 3.90
10 year 4.75
25 year 5.10
50 year 5.90
100 year 6.50

with the submitted plans, drawings and specifications as they have
been approved by the Board of Supervisors. Construction standards as
outlined by the most recent revision of the Pennsylvania Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Program Manual shall be the minimum acceptable
standard.
A. Grassed waterways may be utilized in place of conduit piping in
those areas where soil conditions allow recharge of ground water.
The usage of grassed waterways is not permitted in year round or
seasonably high ground water table areas unless provision is made
to handle long-duration flows. Subsurface drainage or stone
centered waterways are permissible alternates in high water table
regions.
B. In areas underlain with limestone geology, ponds shall be limited to
the detention (self-draining) type unless the developer can show a
special need for retention. Retention ponds, if permitted, shall have
a geomembrane liner approved by the Township Engineer.
(1) Detention ponds shall be prohibited in areas of known
sinkholes unless the pond design includes an approved
geomembrane liner.
(2) In the event a sinkhole appears in any pond or channel prior to
acceptance by the Township, the subsidence shall be cleaned
and repaired and geomembrane liner installed. Geomembrane
designs shall be submitted to the Township Engineer for
approval prior to its installation.
C. All erosion control devices shall be in place prior to beginning
construction of any pond.
D. Ponds having slopes steeper than 3:1 side slopes shall be enclosed
by a minimum six feet high chain-link fence.
E. The Board of Supervisors may waive, when petitioned in writing,
requirements for ponds in areas within close proximity of a
floodplain if the pond will pose an obstruction to stream flooding.
F. Ponds shall have the following features, at a minimum:
(1) Principal spillway outlet structure designed, at a minimum, to
release the predevelopment storm.

sufficiently in the direction of the principal spillway to insure
positive flow.
9. Maintenance of all ESC/SWM facilities during development of a project
shall be the responsibility of the developer and/or landowner and shall
include but not be limited to:
A. Removal of silt from all sediment basins, traps or other structures
or measures when the level reaches the identified clean-out or
when 30% of the design capacity is filled with silt and sediment.
B. Periodic maintenance of temporary control facilities as cleaning,
mowing, repairing or replacement as the condition of the device
dictates.
C. Establishment or re-establishment of permanent vegetation using
lime, fertilizer, seeding or sodding and mulch to restore bare or
scoured areas.
D. Installation of necessary controls to correct unforeseen problems
caused by storm events within the established design frequencies.
E. Removal of all temporary measures and installation of permanent
measures upon completion of the project.
10. Except where the Board of Supervisors has specifically exempted a
project from maintenance of erosion controls and prior to the
acceptance of a completed project by the Township that project shall be
properly maintained to include:
A. Liming and fertilizing vegetated channels and other areas
according to the current Department of Environmental Resources
"Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Manual."
B. Re-establishment of vegetation by seeding and mulching or sodding
of scoured areas or areas where vegetation has not been
successfully established.
C. Mowing to maintain adequate stands of grass and to control weeds.

Special Provisions Applying in Flood-Prone Areas
§ 22-801. General provisions. [Ord. No. 74-1977, § 801, 7/12/1977]
§ 22-802. Application procedures and plat requirements. [Ord. No.
74-1977, § 802, 7/12/1977]
1. Purpose. The specific purpose of these special provisions is:
A. To regulate the subdivision and/or development of flood-prone land
areas in order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of
the community.
B. To require that each subdivision lot in flood-prone areas be
provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and that
public facilities which serve such uses be designed and installed to
preclude flood damage at the time of initial construction.
C. To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
use because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision and/or
development of unprotected flood-prone lands.
2. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any
ordinance currently in effect in flood areas. However, any underlying
ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. Refer to Chapter 5, Division 2, Flood
Control Provisions, § 5-211, et seq.
3. Township liability. The grant of a permit or approval of a subdivision
and/or land development plan in the identified flood-prone and/or
mudslide-prone area(s) shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the Township of South Hanover
or by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of
the proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the Township, its
officials or employees.
1. Pre-application procedures.
A. Prior to the preparation of any plans, it is suggested that
prospective developers consult with the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources concerning soil suitability when onsite
sewage disposal facilities are proposed.
B. Prospective developers shall consult the county conservation
district representative concerning erosion and sediment control
and the effect of geologic conditions on the proposed development.
At the same time a determination should be made as to whether or
not any flood hazards either exist or will be created as result of the
subdivision or development.

1:381
§ 22-803. Design standards and improvements. [Ord. No. 74-1977,
§ 803, 7/12/1977]
2. Preliminary plan requirements. The following information shall be
required as part of the preliminary plan and shall be prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor:
A. Name of engineer, surveyor, or other qualified person responsible
for providing the information required in this section.
B. A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or land
development with respect to the Township's flood-prone areas
including information on, but not limited to, the regulatory flood
elevations, boundaries of flood-prone areas, proposed lots and
sites, fills, flood or erosion protective facilities, and areas subject to
special deed restrictions.
C. Where the subdivision and/or land development lies partially or
completely in the flood-prone areas, or where the subdivision and/
or land development borders on the flood-prone areas, the
preliminary plan map shall include detailed information giving the
location and elevation of proposed roads, public utilities, and
building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at intervals of
two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the flood-prone areas.
3. Final plan requirements. The following information shall be required as
part of the final plan and shall be prepared by a registered engineer or
surveyor:

buildings, structures, roads and public utilities to be constructed in
flood-prone areas. All such maps shall show contours at intervals of
two feet and identify accurately the boundaries of the flood-prone
areas.
C. Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a watercourse
within the floodplain district, as defined in the Township Zoning
Ordinance [Chapter 27], the developer shall notify in writing by
certified mail all adjacent communities and the Pennsylvania
Department of Community Affairs of all such intended activities
prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and shall
submit copies of such notifications to the federal insurance
administrator. The developer shall also assure the Township, in
writing, that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the watercourse in question will be
maintained.
1. General.
§ 22-802 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-803
1:382
A. Where not prohibited by this chapter or any other laws or
ordinances, land located in flood-prone areas may be platted for
development with the provision that the developer construct all
buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in accordance
with this or any other laws or ordinances regulating such
development.
B. Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area. Sites
for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway area if the
sites or dwelling units are elevated to a height at least 1 1/2 feet
above the elevation of the regulatory flood. If fill is used to raise the
elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend laterally for a distance
of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of the proposed structures.
C. Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential
uses shall also not be permitted in any floodway area. Also such
sites for structures or buildings outside the floodway shall be
protected as provided for in Subsection 1B above. However, the
Board of Supervisors may allow the subdivision and/or
development of areas or sites for commercial or industrial uses at
an elevation less than 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood if the
developer otherwise protects the area to that height or assures that
the buildings or structures will be floodproofed and watertight at
least up to that height.
D. If the Board of Supervisors determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit development to
that part and shall require that development proceed consistent
with this determination.
E. When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself and
the Board of Supervisors determines that additional controls are
required to insure safe development, it may require the developer
to impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed
restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and noted on every
recorded plat.
2. Excavation and grading. Where any excavation or grading is proposed
or where any existing trees, shrubs or other vegetative cover will be
removed, the developer shall consult the county conservation district
representative concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and
to also obtain a report on the soil characteristics of the site so that a
determination can be made as to the type and degree of development
the site may accommodate. Before undertaking any excavation or
grading, the developer shall obtain a grading and excavation permit if
such is required by the Township.
3. Drainage facilities.
A. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of
surface waters without damage to persons or property. The system
§ 22-803 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-803
1:383
shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and provide
positive drainage away from buildings and on-site waste disposal
sites.
B. Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Supervisors.
C. The Board of Supervisors may require a primarily underground
system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary surface
system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage plans
shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The
facilities shall be designed to prevent the drainage of excess runoff
onto adjacent properties.
4. Streets. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be no more
than two feet below the regulatory flood elevation. The Board of
Supervisors may require, where necessary, profiles and elevations of
streets to determine compliance with this requirement. Drainage
openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly
increasing flood heights.
5. Sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in flood-prone
areas, whether public or private, shall be floodproofed up to a point 1 1/
2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation.
A. The Board of Supervisors may prohibit installation of sewage
disposal facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such
systems will not function due to high ground water, flooding, or soil
characteristics. The Board of Supervisors may require that the
developer note on the face of the plat and in any deed of
conveyance that soil absorption fields are prohibited in designated
areas.
B. The Board of Supervisors may prescribe adequate methods for
waste disposal. If a sanitary sewer system is located on or near the
proposed subdivision and/or land development, the Board of
Supervisors shall require the developer to provide sewage facilities
to connect to this system where practical, and shall prescribe the
procedures to be followed by the developer in connecting to the
system.
6. Water facilities. All water systems located in flood-prone areas whether
public or private, shall be floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet above the
regulatory flood elevation. If there is an existing public water supply
system on or near the subdivision, the Board of Supervisors shall
require the developer to connect to this system where practical, and
shall prescribe the procedures to be followed by the developer in
connecting to the system.
7. Other public utilities and facilities. All other public and/or private
utilities and facilities shall be elevated or floodproofed to a point 1 1/2
feet above the regulatory flood elevation.

§ 22-901 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-901
1:388
B. Such land set aside shall be suitable to serve the purpose of active
and/or passive recreation by reason of its size, shape, location and
topography and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Commission, the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Board
of Supervisors, after having conferred with the Zoning Officer.
C. All or part of recreation areas may be offered for dedication to the
Township, but the Township shall not be obligated to accept the
same. All such recreation areas not accepted by the Township shall
be irrevocably conveyed to a duly incorporated property owner's
association, which shall be responsible to properly maintain
perpetually all of such recreation areas, pay all taxes assessed with
regard to the land and any improvements thereon and supervise all
activities conducted thereon. The Township shall have no
obligation whatsoever in connection with such recreation areas

general.
D. The deed of conveyance of such recreation areas to a property
owner's association shall contain a restrictive covenant limiting the
use of such land and improvements to the common use of the
property owners within the development for the purposes initially
approved by the Township. Said deed shall also contain a
restriction that said lands and improvements may not be sold or

offering to dedicate the land and improvements to the Township.
5. Criteria for proposed recreation areas. The Planning Commission and
the Board of Supervisors in exercising their duties regarding the
approval of subdivision and land development plans, shall consider the
following criteria in determining whether to approve the proposed
location of recreation areas in the developer's subdivision or land
development plan:
A. The site or sites should be easily and safely accessible from all
areas of the development to be served, have good ingress and
egress and have access to a public road; however, no public road
shall traverse the site or sites.
B. The site or sites should have suitable topography and soil
conditions for use and development as a recreation area.
C. The size and shape of the site or sites should be suitable for
development as a particular type of park. Sites will be categorized
by the Township using the guidelines established by the National
Recreation and Park Association, Recreation, Park and Open Space
Standards and Guidelines, 1983 edition.
D. The design and development of these recreation areas shall be
done according to the guidelines established by the National
Recreation and Park Association, Recreation, Park and Open Space
§ 22-901 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 22-901
1:389
Standards and Guidelines, 1983, copies of which may be obtained
from the Township office.
E. The site or sites should, to the greatest extent practical, be easily
accessible to essential utilities, including water, sewer and power.
F. The site or sites should meet minimum size in respect to usable
acreage with respect to National Recreation and Park Association
standards with 75% of such area having a maximum slope of 75%.
G. A maximum of 25% of the total required land area to be provided
for recreation may consist of floodplain areas.
H. The site or sites should be compatible with the objectives,
guidelines and recommendations set forth in the South Hanover
Township Comprehensive Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan.
6. Dedication to the Township.
A. When the Township requires that recreation areas be dedicated
and neither the developer wishes to maintain ownership nor is a
property owner's association a viable alternative, then the required
recreation area may be dedicated to the Township for public use.
B. When the Board deems it to be in the public interest to accept
dedicated land, such acceptance shall be by means of a signed
resolution to which the property description of the dedicated
recreation area shall be attached, and a deed shall be recorded for
the dedicated land which deed shall contain the following
restrictive clause:
"This land was acquired for perpetual recreation, public park, and
open space purposes through the implementation of the South
Hanover Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance."
C. Recreation areas of less than three acres proposed to be dedicated
to the Township shall not normally be accepted, unless,
opportunities exist to combine them with those of another
subdivision.
D. Areas dedicated to the Township for public use shall be suitable for
recreational purposes by reasons of size, shape, location,
topography and access.
E. The Board of Supervisors, after having conferred with the Planning
Commission and the parks and recreation board may find
dedication of land for recreation to be impractical because of the
size, shape; location, access, topography, drainage or other
physical features of the land, or that such dedication would
adversely affect the subdivision or land development and its future
residents or occupants, or that there is no other land area within
the proposed subdivision which is practical for dedication to the
public because of size, access, topography, or other physical
§ 22-901 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-901
1:390
characteristics. In such cases the Board of Supervisors shall
require payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication.

8. Fee-in-lieu of dedication.
A. When the Board of Supervisors decides that because of size, shape,
location, access, topography or other physical features it is

D. Disposition of fee in lieu funds.
(1) Fee-in-lieu money authorized by this section shall, upon its
receipt by the Township, be deposited in an interest bearing
account, clearly identifying the specific recreation facilities for
§ 22-901 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 22-901
1:392
which the fee was received. Interest earned on such accounts
shall be expended only for the purpose of providing park or
recreation facilities accessible to the development from which
the funds were generated.
(2) Upon request of any person who paid any fee-in-lieu under this
section, the Township shall refund such fee, plus interest
accumulated thereon from the date of payment, if the
Township has failed to utilize the fee paid for the purposes set
forth in this section within three years from the date such fee
was paid.

of the Board of Supervisors provided, however, that the Township and

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 26-101. Short title. [Ord. No. 6-2018, 10/23/20187]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "South Hanover
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 26-102. Statement of findings. [Ord. No. 6-2018, 10/23/2018]
1. The governing body of South Hanover Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams
and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain
management and flood-reduction efforts in upstream and
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point-source
pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
welfare, and the protection of the people of South Hanover
Township and all the people of the commonwealth, their resources,
and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff
resulting from land development and redevelopment throughout a
watershed can also harm surface water resources by changing the
natural hydrologic patterns; accelerating stream flows (which
increase scour and erosion of streambeds and stream banks,
thereby elevating sedimentation); destroying aquatic habitat; and
elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens. Groundwater
resources are also impacted through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
7. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the repeal of former Ch. 26, Stormwater
Management, adopted 7/25/2006 by Ord. No. 1-2006 and 12/14/2010 by Ord. No. 3-2010.

are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer
systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
1. The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare
within South Hanover Township, Dauphin County, by minimizing the
harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 26-102 of this chapter
through provisions intended to:
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 93, to protect, maintain,
reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters
of the commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation
problems close to their source, by regulating activities that cause
these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent
practicable.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and
prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a
minimum of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best
management practices (BMPs) that are constructed and
implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.
K. Implement an "illegal discharge detection and elimination
program" within MS4-permitted urbanized areas to address
nonstormwater discharges into South Hanover Township's
separate storm sewer system.

whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special-protection streams.
B.
Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After earth disturbance
activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants such as sediment, and changes in habitat
through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes
in land surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent
discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect the
stream bank, streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway,
to prevent these impacts.

chapter, provided the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102.
9. High tunnels are exempt from the requirements of this chapter,
provided that the high tunnel or its flooring does not result in an
impervious area exceeding 25% of all structures located on the owner's
total contiguous land area and the high tunnel meets one of the
following:
A. The high tunnel is located at least 100 feet from any perennial
stream or watercourse, public road or neighboring property line.
B. The high tunnel is located at least 35 feet from any perennial
stream or watercourse, public road or neighboring property line
and located on land with a slope not greater than 7%.
C. The high tunnel is supported with a buffer or diversion system that
does not directly drain into a stream or other watercourse by
managing stormwater runoff in a manner consistent with
requirements of this chapter.
10. Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional
impervious area are not exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
However, alternative stormwater management strategies may be
applied at the joint approval of South Hanover Township and the
Dauphin County Conservation District (if an NPDES permit is required)
when site limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and constraints (as
shown and provided by the applicant) preclude the ability of the
applicant to meet the enforcement of the stormwater management
standards in this chapter. All strategies must be consistent with
PADEP's regulations, including NPDES requirements.
11. South Hanover Township may, after an applicant has demonstrated
compliance with § 26-302, Subsections 1, 2 and 3, grant a modification

§ 26-303. Volume controls. [Ord. No. 6-2018, 10/23/2018]
of the requirements of one or more provisions of this chapter if the
literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of the chapter is observed.
A. All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in
full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of the
ordinance involved, and the minimum modification necessary.
1. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B of this chapter13 shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.
2. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method. For regulated activities
equal to or less than one acre, this chapter establishes no preference
for either method; therefore, the applicant may select either method on
the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on
applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each
methodology, and other factors.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the predevelopment total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(2) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
(a) Existing nonforested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations.
(b) 20% of existing impervious area, when present on the
proposed project site, and contained within the new
proposed limit of disturbance, shall be considered meadow
(good condition) for predevelopment hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre. For new impervious surfaces:

§ 26-304. Rate controls. [Ord. No. 6-2018, 10/23/2018]
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
3. All applicable worksheets from Chapter 8 of the BMP Manual must be
used when establishing volume controls.
4. Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation of
the stormwater BMPs are required for all proposed infiltration
facilities. Infiltration tests shall be conducted in accordance with the
BMP Manual. Acceptable soil will have an infiltration rate of at least 0.1
inch per hour and not more than 10 inches per hour (after application of
the appropriate safety factor from the BMP Manual). The stabilized
infiltration rate is to be determined in the same location and within the
same soil horizon as the bottom of the infiltration facility. South
Hanover Township shall be notified 24 hours prior to infiltration tests
being conducted so as to provide an opportunity for South Hanover
Township to witness the tests.
1. For all lands contained within South Hanover Township, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
peak discharge rates for the one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and
100-year storms.
2. Lands contained within Dauphin County that have had release rates
established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management plan:
A. Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, fifty-, and 100-year
storms.
B. For the two-, ten-, and twenty-five-year storms, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates shall be in accordance with the
approved release rate map for the individual watershed.

Design Criteria
§ 26-501. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities. [Ord. No. 6-2018, 10/23/2018]
1. General design guidelines.
A. Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(1) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(2) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(3) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
B. Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
predevelopment flow type condition.
C. Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, drywells, cisterns, recreation area ponding,
diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration
systems, stream channel storage, in-line storage in storm sewers,
and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and
constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance
published by PADEP, provided they are accompanied by detailed
engineering plans and performance capabilities and supporting
site-specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and infiltration
rate data to verify proposed designs. Additional guidance from
other sources may be accepted at the discretion of the Township
Engineer (a preapplication meeting is suggested).
D. All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
E. No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a Township or state roadway.
F. The invert of all stormwater management facilities and
underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table or
other soil limiting zone. The invert of stormwater facilities may be
lowered if adequate subsurface drainage, which does not alter the
existing water table level, is provided.
§ 26-501 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-501
1:453
G. Any stormwater management facility may be required to be fenced
with a minimum four-foot-high fence of material acceptable to
South Hanover Township. Gates with a minimum opening of 10 feet
shall be provided for access. Ponds having slopes steeper than 3:1
side slopes shall be enclosed by a minimum six-foot-high chain-link
fence.
H. Stormwater management facilities excavated to carbonate rock
must either be fitted with an impervious clay liner, geosynthetic
clay liner (GGL), an HDPE liner or similar liner material as may be
approved by the Township Engineer, or overexcavated four feet and
refilled with a suitable material mix. Suitable backfill material is
subject to the approval of the Township Engineer. The developer
must provide supporting engineering calculations for the proposed
lining system.
I. The type, location, and number of landscaping and planting
specification shall be provided for all stormwater management
facilities and be specific for each type of facility.
2. Stormwater management facilities (with a depth of water equal to or
greater than three feet measured from the lowest point inside a facility
to the crest of the emergency spillway).
A. Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment shall be designed to
provide an emergency spillway to handle a peak rate of stormwater
runoff up to and including the 100-year post-development flow, with
a blocked primary outlet structure. The height of embankment
must be set as to provide a minimum one foot of freeboard through
the spillway, above the maximum water surface elevation,
computed when the spillway functions for the 100-year postdevelopment
inflow, with a blocked outlet structure. The primary
outflow structure must be designed to pass all design storms (up to
and including the 100-year event) without discharging through the
emergency spillway. The maximum water depth within any
stormwater management facility shall be no greater than eight feet
when functioning through the primary outlet structure.
B. Emergency spillways shall be armored to prevent erosion during
the 100-year post-development flow, with blocked primary outlet
structure. Synthetic liners or rip-rap may be used, and calculations
sufficient to support proposed armor must be provided. An earthen
plug must be used to accurately control the spillway invert if riprap
is the proposed armoring material. Emergency spillway armor must
extend up the sides of the spillway and continue at full width to a
minimum of 10 feet past the toe of slope.
C. Stormwater management facility berm cross sections must be at
least five feet wide at the top and eight feet wide through the
emergency spillway. For fill embankments, the side slopes shall be
§ 26-501 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 26-501
1:454
no steeper than 3:1 on the inside of the facility and 2:1 on the
outside of the facility. For cut slopes, the side slopes shall be no
steeper than 2:1.
D. A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be provided
under all embankments four feet or greater in height.

facilities shall have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) (refer to
E&S Manual) and be identified on the SWM site plan.
F. Trash racks must be provided to prevent clogging of primary
outflow structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or
smaller in diameter.
G. Sewage control measures such as filter blankets or filter collars
must be provided on all outflow culverts in accordance with the
methodology contained in the latest edition of the E&S Manual.
H. Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities must
empty over a period of time not less than 24 hours and not more
than 72 hours from the end of the facility's inflow hydrograph.
Infiltration tests performed at the facility locations and proposed
basin bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must
support time-to-empty calculations if infiltration is a factor in the
sizing of the stormwater management facility.
I. Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities to promote water quality and groundwater
recharge for frequent storm events. Facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs may have a bottom slope of zero. Minimalmaintenance,
saturation-tolerant vegetation must be provided in
basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs. Conventional,
non-BMP stormwater management facilities must have a minimum
slope of 1% extending radially out from the primary outlet
structure. Water storage below the lowest outlet structure stage
(i.e., dead storage) is permitted in stormwater management
facilities designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs.
J. Stormwater management facilities' bottom elevations must be
greater than adjacent floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS
analysis). If no floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be
higher than existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream
bank in the facilities' vicinity.
K. Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the 100-year floodplain
elevation may be used for all design storms, or the applicant may
elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent watercourse for
each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be 50 feet from top
of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not designated, or
where no other evidence is provided.
§ 26-501 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-501
1:455
L. Exceptions to these requirements may be made at the discretion of
South Hanover Township for BMPs that retain or detain water but
are of a much smaller scale than traditional stormwater
management facilities.
3. Storm sewer facilities:
A. Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from
a ten-year design storm without surcharging inlets where
appropriate. When connecting to an existing storm sewer system,
the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed system will not
exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that adequate
downstream capacity exists.
B. A minimum pipe size of 15 inches in diameter shall be used in all
roadway systems (public or private) proposed for construction.
Pipes shall be designed to provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet
per second when flowing full, but in all cases the slope shall be no
less than 0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be
substituted in lieu of circular pipe where cover or utility conflict
conditions exist.
C. In proposed curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment
of water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during
the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration. Gutter depth
shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity calculations that account
for road slope and opening area. The maximum distance between
inlets in curbed roadway sections shall be no more than 600 feet;
however, access to underground pipes shall be provided every 300
feet.
D. Standard Type "C" inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used along
vertical concrete curb roadway networks. Type "C" inlets with teninch
hoods that provide a two-inch sump condition may be used
with approval of the Township Engineer when roadway longitudinal
slopes are 1.0% or less.
E. For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same or the smaller pipe's crown
shall be at a higher elevation.
F. All inlets shall provide a minimum two-inch drop between the
lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert
elevation.
G. On curbed sections, a double inlet shall be placed at the low point
of sag vertical curves, or an inlet shall be placed at the low point
and on each side of the low point at a distance not to exceed 100
feet, or at an elevation not to exceed 0.2 foot above the low point.
§ 26-501 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 26-501
1:456
H. At all roadway low points, swales and easements shall be provided

at appropriate elevations to completely drain the subgrade prior to
placing the base and surface course on roadways.
M. Inlets, junction boxes, or manholes greater than five feet in depth
shall be equipped with ladder rungs and shall be detailed on the
SWM site plan.
N. Inlets shall not have a sump condition in the bottom (unless
designed as a water quality BMP). Pipes shall be flush with the
bottom of the box, or concrete channels shall be poured.
O. Inlets, manholes, pipes, and culverts shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications set forth in PennDOT's
Publication 408, latest edition, and as detailed in PennDOT's
Publication 72M, Standards for Roadway Construction (RC), latest
edition, or as approved by the Township Engineer. All material and
construction details (inlets, manholes, pipe trenches, etc.), must be
shown on the SWM site plan, and a note added that all construction
must be in accordance with PennDOT's Publication 408 and
PennDOT's Publication 72M, latest edition. A note shall be added to
the plan stating that all frames, concrete top units, and grade
adjustment rings shall be set in a bed of full mortar according to
Publication 408.
P. Accessible drainage structures shall be located on continuous
storm sewer systems at all vertical dislocations, at all locations
where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all
vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding 5°, and at all points

10 4.36
25 5.43
50 6.38
100 7.48
4. Peak flow rates:
A. Rational Method: may be used for drainage areas up to 20 acres.
Extreme caution should be used by the qualified professional if the
watershed has more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are significantly
different in one verses the other, if the time of concentration
exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff volume is an important
factor. The combination of Rational Method hydrographs based on
timing shall be prohibited.
(1) The use of the Modified Rational Method to design stormwater
management facilities must be approved by the Township
Engineer.
(2) If the Rational Method is used, the ascending leg of the
hydrograph shall have a time of three times the time of
concentration (3 Tc) and the descending leg of the hydrograph
shall have a time of seven times the time of concentration (7
Tc).
B. Soil Cover Complex Method: may be used for drainage areas
greater than 20 acres. This method is recommended for design of
stormwater management facilities and where stormwater runoff
volume must be taken into consideration.
§ 26-502 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 26-502
1:459
C. For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
5. Runoff coefficients:
A. Rational Method: Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).14
B. Soil Cover Complex Method: Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).15
C. For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious area conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition).
D. For the purposes of predevelopment volume determination, 20% of
existing impervious area, when present on the project site, and
contained within the new proposed limit of disturbance, shall be
considered meadow (good condition) for predevelopment
hydrologic calculations for redevelopment.
6. Design storm:
A. All drainage facilities (inlets, pipes, and swales) shall be designed
to safely convey the ten-year storm.
B. All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year
hydrographs through the facility using the Storage Indication
(Modified Puls) Method. The design storm hydrograph shall be
computed using a calculation method that produces a full
hydrograph.
C. The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development100-year storm
event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of meeting
peak rate control.
D. All structures (culverts or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under

the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to meeting the minimum
requirements of this chapter.
7. Time of concentration:
A. Time of concentration shall be computed using the NRCS
Segmental Method as described in TR-55 (SCS 1986, or most-
14.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.
15.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included as an attachment to this chapter.

current update). The length of sheet flow shall be limited to 100
feet. Manning's "n" Roughness Coefficient for TR-55 sheet flow
can be found in Table C-4 (Appendix C).16 Time of concentration
for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's
Equation.
B. For sites with insignificant channelized flow and less than 20%
imperviousness coverage, the time of concentration may be
computed using the NRCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/.6)* 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours).
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet).
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent).
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by: S =
[(1,000/CN) - 10].
CN = NRCS Curve Number for watershed as defined by the
NRCS Loss Method.
C. Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
(1) The post-development time of concentration shall never be
greater than the predevelopment time of concentration for any
watershed or subwatershed.
(2) The minimum time of concentration for any watershed shall be
five minutes.
(3) The designer must provide computations for all
predevelopment time-of-concentration paths. A five-minute
time of concentration cannot be assumed for predevelopment.
(4) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
predevelopment conditions for purpose of time-ofconcentration
calculations.

stormwater basins, and slopes greater than 15% may be
included in the calculation for open space but shall not
constitute more than 50% of the total open space area.
(2) The open space area shall be so located and designed that it is

§ 27-1010 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 27-1010
1:554
and easy access to common open space areas shall be provided
either by adjoining road frontage, easements or paths.
(3) Common open space areas shall be designed as a continuous
system of usable areas which are interspersed among
groupings of residential buildings; provided, however, in those
instances in which the total minimum open space is less than
two acres in size, such acres shall be located in one parcel and
shall only be broken up if the development site or its physical
constraints dictate otherwise, with the concurrence of the
Board of Supervisors.
(4) Such areas specifically designed for open space shall be fully
usable and suitable for that purpose and shall be set aside by
deed restriction.
(5) Accessways to the site shall be sufficiently wide so that

shall be maintained in a careful and prudent manner.
(6) Common open space may be dedicated partially or entirely to
public use. The Township Parks and Recreation Commission
may recommend and the Board of Supervisors may approve
the dedication of any common open space land for public use.
However, the Board of Supervisors shall also have the right to
not accept any dedication of open space if it finds that the size,
location, type of development or cost of development or
maintenance of such common open space or the availability of
other public open space nearby would make public use
undesirable or unnecessary. Any land to be used for recreation
areas instead of using the fee in lieu of land dedication
provision as set forth in § 22-901 shall not be a part of the
calculated open space required by this chapter or the land to
establish density set forth in § 27-1010, Subsection 1D, above.
(7) Private ownership. When common open space is not dedicated
and accepted to public use it shall be protected by legal
arrangements, satisfactory to the Township, sufficient to
assure its maintenance and preservation for whatever purpose
it is intended. Covenants or other legal arrangements shall:
(a) Obligate purchasers to participate in a homeowners'
association and to support maintenance of the open space
areas by paying to the association assessments sufficient
for such maintenance and subjecting their properties to a
lien for enforcement of payment of the respective
assessments.
(b) Obligate such an association to maintain the open areas
and private streets and utilities.
§ 27-1010 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1010
1:555
(c) Empower the Township, as well as other purchasers in the
development, to enforce the covenants in the event of
failure of compliance.
(d) Provide for agreement that, if the Township is required to
perform any maintenance work pursuant to the subsection
above, such purchasers would pay the cost thereof and
that the same shall be a lien upon their properties until
such cost has been paid; provided, that the developer shall
be responsible for the formation of the homeowners'
association of which the developer, or if the developer is
not the owner of the development, then such owner shall
be a member until all of the lots of record are sold. Other
equivalent provisions to assure adequate perpetual
maintenance may be permitted if approved by the Board of
Supervisors. Assurance that such covenants or equivalent
provisions will be evidenced by the recordation in the
office of Recorder of Deeds of a perpetual maintenance of
facilities as prescribed hereinabove and identifying the
tract and each lot therein. The declaration shall be
included in the deed or other instrument of conveyance of
each lot of record and shall be made binding on all
purchasers; provided, that such declaration may, as to
subsequent conveyance other than the initial conveyance
of each lot of record, be incorporated by reference in the
instrument of conveyance.
(e) Guarantee that any association formed to own and
maintain common open space will not be dissolved without
the consent of the Board of Supervisors.
Such covenants or equivalent legal arrangements shall be
submitted for preliminary review with the preliminary plan
and conditional use application and shall be reviewed and
approved by the Board of Supervisors prior to the granting
of a conditional use and final plan approval.

§ 27-1408.2. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas. [Ord. No. 2-2012, § 2, 4/25/2012]
1. The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific
areas:
A. Floodway area.
(1) Description. The area identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point.
This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. Special floodplain area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in the
FIS which are subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event determined by detailed methods and have base
flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse.
§ 27-1408.1 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-1408.2
1:581
(b) In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway,
no new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more
than one foot.
C. Approximate floodplain area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which
are subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood event
determined using approximate methodologies. Because
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs
or flood depths are shown.
(2) Special requirements:
(a) No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse.
(b) When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the
BFE, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by
using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
In lieu of the above, the Township may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the Township of South Hanover.
D. Shallow flooding area.
(1) Description. The areas identified as Zones AO and AH in the
FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1% annual
chance shallow flooding where average depths are between
one and three feet.
(2) Special requirements. Establish drainage paths to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.

Ord. No. 3-2005, 8/16/2005; and by Ord. No. 1-2016, 7/12/2016]
removal, relocation, change or alteration is reasonably necessary
under the following circumstances:
(1) The construction, repair, maintenance or installation of any
Township or other public improvement in the right-of-way;
(2) The operations of the Township or other governmental entity in
the right-of-way;
(3) Vacation of a street or road or the release of a utility easement;
or
(4) An emergency as determined by the Township.
1. The following regulations shall apply to all tower-based wireless
communications facilities, excluding any tower-based WCF that is less
than 70 feet in height and owned and operated by a federally licensed
amateur radio status operator:
A. Standard of care. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed,
constructed, operated, maintained, repaired, modified and
removed in strict compliance with all current applicable technical,
safety and safety-related codes, including, but not limited to, the
most-recent editions of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) Standard, National Electrical Safety Code, National
Electrical Code, ASCE-7, latest edition, as well as the accepted and
responsible workmanlike industry practices of the National
Association of Tower Erectors. Any tower-based WCF shall at all
times be kept and maintained in good condition, order and repair
by qualified maintenance and construction personnel, so that the
same shall not endanger the life of any person or any property in
the Township.
B. Notice. Upon submission of an application for a tower-based WCF
and the scheduling of the public hearing upon the application, the
WCF applicant shall mail notice to all owners of every property
within 1,500 feet of the proposed facility. The WCF applicant shall
provide proof of the notification to the Township.
C. In certain zoning districts conditional use authorization required.
Tower-based WCFs are permitted in the R-A Residential
Agriculture District, R-M Residential Multifamily District, R-U
Residential Urban District, V Residential Village District, and ESC
Eleemosynary School Campus District, by conditional use and at a
height necessary to satisfy their function in the WCF applicant's
wireless communications system. No WCF applicant shall have the
right under these regulations to erect a tower to the maximum
§ 27-14A03 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 27-14A04
1:610
height specified in this section unless it proves the necessity for
such height. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that the
antenna/tower/pole for the tower-based WCF is the minimum
height necessary for the service area.
(1) Prior to the Board's approval of a conditional use authorizing
the construction and installation of tower-based WCF, it shall
be incumbent upon the WCF applicant for such conditional use
approval to prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board
that the WCF applicant cannot adequately extend or infill its
communications system by the use of equipment such as
redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other similar equipment
installed on existing structures, such as utility poles or their
appurtenances and other available tall structures. The WCF
applicant shall further demonstrate that the proposed towerbased
WCF must be located where it is proposed in order to
serve the WCF applicant's service area and that no other viable
alternative location exists.
(2) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower
or other communication facilities and equipment, a description
of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/
radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band)
assigned to the WCF applicant, the power in watts at which the
WCF applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests
conducted by the WCF applicant in determining the need for
the proposed site and installation.
(3) The conditional use application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and regulations
concerning aviation safety.
(4) Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the WCF applicant shall present
documentation to the Board of Supervisors that the owner of
the property has granted an easement for the proposed WCF
and that vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
(5) The conditional use application shall also be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all applicable provisions in this section.
D. Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township's issuance of a permit
authorizing construction and erection of a tower-based WCF, a
structural engineer registered in Pennsylvania shall issue to the
Township a written certification of the proposed WCF's ability to
meet the structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication Industry
Association and certify the proper construction of the foundation
§ 27-14A04 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-14A04
1:611
and the erection of the structure. This certification shall be
provided during the conditional hearings or, at a minimum, be
made as a condition attached to any approval given such that the
certification shall be provided prior to issuance of any building
permits.
E. Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based WCFs
shall employ stealth technology which may include the tower
portion to be painted silver or another color approved by the Board
of Supervisors, or shall have a galvanized finish. All tower-based
WCFs and related equipment shall be aesthetically and
architecturally compatible with the surrounding environment and
shall maximize the use of a like facade to blend with the existing
surroundings and neighboring buildings to the greatest extent
possible. The Board of Supervisors shall consider whether its
decision upon the subject application will promote the harmonious
and orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development existing
in the area; benefit neighboring properties by preventing a
negative impact on the aesthetic character of the community;
preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site to the greatest
possible extent; and encourage sound engineering and land
development design and construction principles, practices and
techniques.
F. Co-location and siting. An application for a new tower-based WCF
shall demonstrate that the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be
accommodated on an existing or approved structure or building, or
sited on land owned and maintained by South Hanover Township.
The Board of Supervisors may deny an application to construct a
new tower-based WCF if the WCF applicant has not made a goodfaith
effort to mount the commercial communications antenna(s) on
an existing structure. The WCF applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers
within a one-half-mile radius of the site proposed, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures, buildings, and
towers and was denied for one of the following reasons:
(1) The proposed antenna and related equipment would exceed
the structural capacity of the existing building, structure or
tower, and its reinforcement cannot be accomplished at a
reasonable cost.
(2) The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing equipment for
that existing building, structure, or tower and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(3) Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to accommodate
§ 27-14A04 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 27-14A04
1:612
the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended
function.
(4) A commercially reasonable agreement could not be reached
with the owner of such building, structure, or tower.
G. Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible under
applicable state and federal law, any WCF applicant proposing the
modification of an existing tower-based WCF, which increases the
overall height of such WCF, shall first obtain a building permit from
the Township. Nonroutine modifications shall be prohibited without
such permit.
H. Gap in coverage. A WCF applicant for a tower-based WCF must
demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage or capacity
exists in the applicable area and that the type of WCF being
proposed is the least-intrusive means by which to fill that gap in
wireless coverage. The existence or nonexistence of a gap in
wireless coverage shall be a factor in the Township's decision on an
application for approval of tower-based WCFs.
I. Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all tower-based
WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide the Township with a written
commitment that it will allow other service providers to co-locate
antennas on tower-based WCFs where technically and
economically feasible. The owner of a tower-based WCF shall not
install any additional antennas without obtaining the prior written
approval of the Township.
J. Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be designed to
withstand the effects of wind gusts of at least 100 miles per hour in
addition to the standard designed by the American National
Standards Institute as prepared by the engineering departments of
the Electronics Industry Association and Telecommunications
Industry Association (ANSI/EIA/TIA-222), as amended, and
ASCE-7, latest edition.
K. Height. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed at the minimum
functional height. In all zoning districts, the maximum height of any
new tower-based WCF shall be 200 feet. An existing tower may be
modified or extended to a height not to exceed a total height of 215
feet, to accommodate the co-location of additional communications
antennas.
L. Related equipment. Either one single-story wireless
communications equipment building not exceeding 500 square feet
in area or up to five metal boxes placed on a concrete pad not
exceeding 10 feet by 20 feet in area housing the receiving and
transmitting equipment may be located on the site for each
unrelated company sharing commercial communications
antenna(s) space on the tower-based wireless communications
facility.
§ 27-14A04 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-14A04
1:613
M. Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF shall interfere
with public safety communications or the reception of broadband,
television, radio or other communication services enjoyed by
occupants of nearby properties.

or in conjunction with other WCFs, generate radio frequency
emissions in excess of the standards and regulations of the FCC,
including, but not limited to, the FCC Office of Engineering
Technology Bulletin 65, entitled "Evaluating Compliance with FCC
Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio Frequency
Electromagnetic Fields," as amended.
P. Historic buildings or districts. A tower-based WCF shall not be
located upon a property, and/or on a building or structure, that is
listed on either the National or Pennsylvania Register of Historic
Places, or eligible to be so listed, or is included in the official
historic structures and/or historic districts list maintained by the
Township.
Q. Signs. All tower-based WCFs shall post a sign in a readily visible
location identifying the name and phone number of a party to
contact in the event of an emergency. The only other signage
permitted on the WCF shall be that required by the FCC or any
other federal or state agency.
R. Lighting. No tower-based WCF shall be artificially lighted, except
as required by law. If lighting is required, the WCF applicant shall
provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting, demonstrating as
unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state
and federal regulations. The WCF applicant shall promptly report
any outage or malfunction of FAA-mandated lighting to the
appropriate governmental authorities and to the Township
Secretary.
S. Noise. Tower-based WCFs shall be operated and maintained so as
not to produce noise in excess of applicable noise standards under
state law and the Township Code, except in emergency situations
requiring the use of a backup generator, where such noise
standards may be exceeded on a temporary basis only.

1. Failure to comply with any provision of this chapter, failure to secure a
permit, Zoning Hearing Board or Township supervisor's certification,
when required, previous to the erection, construction, extension or
addition to a building or failure to secure a certificate of use shall be
violations of this chapter.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When written notice of a violation of any of the provisions of
this chapter has been served by the Zoning Officer on the
owner, agent or occupant or contractor, such violation shall be
discontinued immediately.
(2) All appeals from determinations by the Zoning Officer under
this section shall be to the Zoning Hearing Board within 30
days of the date of the determination.
B. Causes of action. In case any building, structure or land is or is
proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered,
converted, maintained or used in violation of this chapter, the
proper officer of the Township or any aggrieved owner or tenant of
real property who shows that his property or person will be
substantially affected by the alleged violation, in addition to other
remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure,
landscaping of land or to prevent, in or about such premises, any
act, conduct, business or use constituting a violation. When any
such action is instituted by a landowner or tenant, notice of that
action shall be served upon the Township at least 30 days prior to
the time the action is begun by serving a copy of the complaint on
the Township Supervisors. No such action may be maintained until
such notice has been given.

§ 27-2112. Zoning Hearing Board. [Ord. No. 2-1995, § 2112, 4/11/
1995]
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has
violated or permitted the violation of the provisions of this
chapter shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil
enforcement proceeding commenced by the Township, pay a
judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs including
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the
district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely
appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment
pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day
that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation
unless the district justice determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis
for the person, partnership or corporation violating this
chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the
determination of a violation by the district justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation. All judgments, costs and reasonable
attorney fees collected for the violation shall be paid over to
the Township of South Hanover.
(2) The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order
of stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a
final adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(3) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or
interpreted to grant to any person or entity other than the
Township the right to commence an action for enforcement
pursuant to this section.
1. The Township Supervisors shall appoint a Zoning Hearing Board which
shall be composed of three members, organized, empowered and
conducted in accordance with Article IX of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10901) existing or hereafter as
amended and supplemented (the "code"). The duly established Zoning
Hearing Board shall have the following functions:
A. Hearings. The Zoning Hearing Board shall conduct hearings and
make decisions in accordance with Section 908 of the code. Notice
shall be given to the public, the applicant, the county Planning
Commission, the Zoning Officer, such other persons as the Zoning
Hearing Board shall designate and any person who has made
timely request for the same. Notice shall be given at such time and
in such manner prescribed by adopted rules of the Zoning Hearing
Board. The Township Supervisors may establish reasonable fees,
§ 27-2111 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 27-2112
1:706
based on cost, to be paid by the applicant and persons requesting
any notice or materials not required by ordinance.
B. Jurisdiction. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and render final adjudications in the following
matters as set forth in the code.
(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use
ordinance except those brought before the Board of
Supervisors pursuant to Sections 609(1) and 916.1(a)(2) of the
code.
(2) Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising
procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of
enactment or adoption, which challenges shall be raised by an
appeal taken within 30 days after the effective date of said
ordinance.
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer
including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any
permit or failure to act on the application therefor, the issuance
of any cease and desist order or the registration or refusal to
register any nonconforming use, structure or lot.
(4) Appeals from a determination by the Township Engineer or the
Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within
a land use ordinance.
(5) Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter and
the Flood Hazard Ordinance [Article XIV of this chapter] or
such provisions within a land use ordinance pursuant to
Section 910.2 of the code.
(6) Applications for special exceptions under this chapter or the
Flood Hazard Ordinance or such provisions within a land use
ordinance pursuant to Section 912.1 of the code.
(7) Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency
charged with the administration of any transfer of
development rights or performance density provisions of this
chapter.
(8) Appeals from the Zoning Officer or Township Engineer in the
administration of any land use ordinance or provisions thereof
with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same relate to
development not involving applications under Article V or VII
of the code.
C. Variances. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear requests for
variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter
§ 27-2112 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-2112
1:707
inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall prescribe the form of application and require
application to the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Hearing Board may
grant a variance provided the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in
which the property is located.
(2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
D. Special exceptions. Special exceptions may be granted or denied by
the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to expressed standards and
criteria contained in this chapter. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance
with such standards and criteria and prescribe the application form
to be used. In granting a special exception the Zoning Hearing
Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in
addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. The Zoning
Hearing Board shall pursue the following procedure:
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board's decision to grant a permit for use
by special exception shall be made only after application,
public notice and a public hearing. Such permit shall apply
specifically to the application and plans submitted and
presented at this public hearing. Any subsequent amendments
or additions shall be subject to review and public hearing by
the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception.
§ 27-2112 SOUTH HANOVER CODE § 27-2112
1:708
(2) No application for a permit shall be granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board for any special exception use until said board
has first received and considered an advisory report on the
application from the Planning Commission with respect to the
location of such use in relation to the needs and growth pattern
of the Township of South Hanover and, where appropriate,
with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the
arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street
loading and unloading spaces and other pertinent features of
the proposal.
(3) The Planning Commission shall have 30 days from the date of
its receipt of the application within which to file its report
thereon. In the event that the Planning Commission shall fail to
file its report within 30 days such application shall be deemed
to have been approved by the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission may have representation at the public
hearing held by the Zoning Hearing Board on such application.
After receipt of the report the Zoning Hearing Board shall hear
the application in the same manner and under the same
procedure as it is empowered by law and ordinance to hear
cases and make exceptions to the provisions of this chapter.
The Zoning Hearing Board may thereafter direct the Zoning
Officer to issue a permit if, in its judgment, the request will not
be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the
Township.
(4) A special exception use for which a permit is granted by the
Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to the provisions of this
section shall be construed to be a conforming use.
E. Parties appellant before the Zoning Hearing Board. Appeals raising
the substantive validity of any land use ordinance (except those to
be brought before the Township Supervisors) pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Code, procedural questions or alleged
defects in the process of enactment or adoption of a land use
ordinance or from the determination of the Zoning Officer
including, but not limited to, the granting or denial of any permit or
failure to act on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease
and desist order or the registration or refusal to register any
nonconforming use, structure or lot, from a determination of the
Zoning Officer or Township Engineer in the reference to
sedimentation and erosion control and stormwater management
insofar as the same relate to development not involving subdivision
and development or planned residential development may be filed
with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, any officer or
agency of the Township or any person aggrieved. Requests for a
variance and for special exception may be filed with the Board by
any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner.
§ 27-2112 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENT § 27-2112
1:709
F. Time limitation.
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the
Zoning Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application
for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by
the Township if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal
or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person
alleges and proves that he failed to receive adequate notice of
such approval. If such person has succeeded to his interest
after such approval, adequate notice to his predecessor in
interest shall be deemed adequate notice to him. The failure of
anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse
decision on a tentative plan or from an adverse decision by the
Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of this chapter or
an amendment hereto or map or an amendment thereto shall
preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case
where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval.
(2) No issue of alleged defect in the process of enactment of any
ordinance or map or any amendment thereto shall be raised in
any proceeding filed with the Board later than 30 days from the
time such ordinance, map or amendment takes effect unless
the person raising such issues alleges and proves that he failed
to receive adequate notice of the enactment or amendment. If
such person has succeeded to his interest after the enactment
of the ordinances, adequate notice to his predecessor in
interest shall be deemed adequate notice to him.
(3) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall
be filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
G. Stay of proceedings.
(1) Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning
Hearing Board and during its pendency before the Zoning
Hearing Board, all land development pursuant to any
challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer
or of any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall
be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate
agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that such
stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which
case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by
the Zoning Hearing Board or by the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer
or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and
proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed
with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the

safety, morals and general welfare. It is not intended to interfere with or
abrogate or annul other rules, regulations or ordinances; provided, that
where this chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings
or premises or upon the height of a building or requires larger spaces
than are imposed by such other rules, easements, covenants, restrictions,
regulations or ordinances, the provisions of this chapter shall control.

(2) The question whether or not such petition should be granted
and the amount of the bond shall be within the sound
discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond
shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding party
to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
