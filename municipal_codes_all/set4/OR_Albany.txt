1.04.020    Procedure for the prosecution of certain misdemeanors as violations.

1.04.010 Penalty for violation.
(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section:

(a) Whenever in this code or in any ordinance of the City of Albany, an act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or the doing of an act is required or the failure to do an act is declared to be unlawful or an offense, the violation of any such provision of the Albany Municipal Code or any other ordinance of the City of Albany shall be either a misdemeanor or violation, and shall be punished as provided in this section.

(b) Maximum penalties for offenses shall be as follows:

(i) Violation – a civil penalty of not more than $1,000, or such sum as may be provided in the ordinance defining the offense.

(ii) Misdemeanor – a fine of not more than $2,500 or imprisonment not to exceed one year, or both such fine or imprisonment.

(iii) Violations of AMC Title 18 shall have the penalties prescribed therein.

(c) Where an offense is defined in the Albany Municipal Code or any other ordinance of the City of Albany, and no penalty is provided, the offense shall be deemed a misdemeanor.

(d) Every day, or portion thereof, during which any violation of any provision of the Albany Municipal Code or any ordinance of the City of Albany is committed, continued or permitted, shall be a separate offense.

(e) A violation, as classified in the Albany Municipal Code, is declared to be an offense, but not a crime. It is intended to be an offense which can be disposed of in all respects as a civil proceeding and not governed by procedural, evidentiary, substantive and constitutional rules applicable to criminal charges and proceedings. A person adjudged responsible for a violation shall not be deemed “guilty” of the violation and a judgment of responsibility shall not be deemed a “conviction” for any purpose.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this section or any other ordinance to the contrary, no greater penalty shall be imposed for any violation of the Albany Municipal Code or any ordinance of the City of Albany than the maximum penalty prescribed under Oregon Statute for the same act or omission.

(g) For the purpose of facilitating disposition of violations, the Municipal Judge may promulgate a schedule of forfeitures for particular violations, and the person charged with such a violation may deposit with the court the amount so scheduled, waive further appearance, and have the sum so deposited forfeited as a plea of “no contest.” The court shall not, however, be bound by the schedule on appearance and admission by the person charged, or on trial and judgment against the person charged; the court in such a case may impose any forfeiture allowed by subsection (1)(a) of this section.

(2)  Violation of Chapter 10.06 AMC shall be adjudicated and punished as provided in AMC 10.06.090, Enforcement, and 10.06.100, Penalties. (Ord. 5713 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. D), 2006; Ord. 4901 § 1, 1990; Ord. 4812 § 1, 1988; Ord. 4579 § 1, 1983; Ord. 3462 § 1, 1970).

1.04.020 Procedure for the prosecution of certain misdemeanors as violations.
(1) Upon or before the appearance of the defendant upon any Albany Municipal Code charge before the court receives the defendant’s plea, the City Attorney, or his/her designee, shall declare, in open court or in writing, the intention whether or not to treat the offense in the case as a violation subject to the violations penalty and procedures set forth in this code. The case shall proceed as a violation, subject to the violation penalty and procedures, unless the City Attorney affirmatively states, in open court or in writing, that the case shall proceed as a misdemeanor. If the case proceeds as a violation, the accusatory instrument shall be deemed amended to denominate the offense as a violation and the offense, for purposes of the case, shall thereafter be treated as a violation, subject to the penalty provided in AMC 1.04.010. If the City Attorney, or his/her designee, declares an intention to treat the offense as a misdemeanor, the offense in the case shall thereafter continue to be treated as a crime. If the offense is denominated a violation pursuant to this subsection, the court shall, when it enters judgment in the case, clearly denominate the offense as a violation in the judgment order.

(2) Conviction of a violation does not give rise to any disability or legal disadvantage based upon conviction of a crime. (Ord. 5713 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5141 § 7, 1994; Ord. 4907 § 1, 1990).

(3) “Electrical power and light business” means the business of selling, at wholesale or retail, electrical energy.

(4) “Gross operating revenue” means revenue accruing from the electrical power business transacted within the corporate limits of the City. In case the taxpayer is a public utility, subject to regulation under the statutes of Oregon, “gross operating revenue” means that amount required to be credited by the taxpayer to the taxpayer’s operation within the City under the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the regulatory body of the State having jurisdiction. There shall be no deduction for the cost of commodity, cost of materials used, labor, interest, discount, delivery costs and other expenses, unless otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord. 5858 § 2, 2015).

3.03.020 Amount of tax.
The occupational tax upon the electric light and power business for the privilege of engaging in business within the City is hereby continued. The tax shall be in an amount equal to five percent of the gross revenue of the business during the calendar month next preceding the date of payment of tax, less the deductions and exclusions herein provided.

So long as Consumers Power, or its successor or assignee, operates an electrical power and light business pursuant to the terms of the negotiated franchise agreement set forth at AMC 3.03.090 through 3.03.310 as hereafter set forth or as may subsequently be amended, it shall not be subject to the privilege tax obligations of AMC 3.04.020 through 3.04.080. (Ord. 5858 § 3, 2015).

3.03.090 Grant of franchise and general utility easement.
The City hereby grants to Consumers Power the right, privilege and authority to construct, maintain, operate, upgrade, and relocate its electrical distribution and transmission lines and related appurtenances, including underground conduits and structures, poles, towers, wires, guy anchors, vaults, transformers, transmission lines, and communication lines (collectively referred to herein as “electric facilities”) in, under, along, over and across the present and future streets, alleys, public ways and public places (collectively referred to herein as “public ways”) within the City, for the purpose of supplying and transmitting electric power and energy to the inhabitants of the City and persons and corporations beyond the limits of the City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of electric facilities within the public ways as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. The provisions of AMC 3.03.090 to 3.03.300 shall set forth this franchise. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.100 Term.
The term of this franchise and general utility easement is for 10 years commencing on the date of acceptance by the company as set forth in AMC 3.03.110. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

Consumers Power has filed an unqualified written acceptance of all terms of the ordinance codified in this chapter with the City Recorder. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.120 Nonexclusive franchise.
The right to use and occupy the public ways of the City are nonexclusive and the City reserves the right to use the public ways for itself or any other entity that provides service to City residences; provided, however, that such use will not unreasonably interfere with Consumers Power’s electric facilities or Consumers Power’s rights granted herein. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.130 City regulatory authority.
In addition to this franchise, the City reserves the right to adopt such additional ordinances and regulations as may be deemed necessary in the exercise of its police power for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and their properties or exercise any other rights, powers, or duties required or authorized, under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, the laws of Oregon or City ordinances. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.140 Indemnification.
The City will in no way be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to property or any injury to, or death of, any person that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by Consumers Power of its electric facilities. Consumers Power will indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against claims, demands, liens and all liability or damage of whatsoever kind arising out of or in connection with Consumers Power’s use of the public ways within the City, and will pay the costs of defense plus reasonable attorneys’ fees for any such claim, demand or lien. The City will: (a) give prompt written notice to Consumers Power of any claim, demand or lien with respect to which the City seeks indemnification hereunder; and (b) unless in the City’s judgment a conflict of interest exists between the City and Consumers Power with respect to such claim, demand or lien, allow Consumers Power to assume the defense of such claim, demand, or lien. Consumers Power will notify City of its intent to assume defense of any claim, demand or lien within 10 business days upon receipt of same. If such defense is not assumed by Consumers Power due to any action or inaction by City, Consumers Power will not be subject to liability for any settlement made without its consent. If Consumers Power elects not to assume defense of the demand, claim or lien, Consumers Power will be subject to liability for any settlement made. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, Consumers Power will not indemnify, defend or hold the City harmless to the extent any claim, demand or lien arises out of or in connection with any negligent or willful act or failure to act of the City or any of its officers or employees. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

(Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.160 Construction, maintenance, and relocation.
All electric facilities will be located so as to cause minimum interference with the public ways and be constructed, installed, maintained, cleared of vegetation, renovated or replaced in accordance with applicable rules, ordinances, and regulations.

(1) Permits.

(a) Subject to applicable regulations of the City, grantee may perform all necessary construction to construct, operate and maintain its electric facilities. All construction and maintenance of any and all electric facilities within or on the public ways shall, regardless of who performs installation and/or construction, be and remain the responsibility of grantee. Grantee shall apply for and obtain all permits necessary for installation, maintenance, and/or construction of any such facilities, and for excavation and installation of any electric facilities within the public ways, which permits shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Grantee shall pay all applicable fees due for City construction permits.

(b) Grantee may make excavations in the public ways needed for the construction, maintenance, and operation of grantee’s electric facilities, subject to obtaining permits from the City. Prior to doing such work, grantee must apply for, and obtain, appropriate permits from the City.

(c) In the event that emergency repairs are necessary for its electric facilities in the public ways, grantee shall immediately notify the City of the need for such repairs. Grantee may immediately initiate such emergency repairs, and shall apply for appropriate permits as soon as possible, not to exceed five business days following discovery of the emergency. Grantee must comply with all ordinance provisions relating to such excavations or construction, including the payment of permits or license fees and compliance with permit conditions.

(d) The City shall have the right to observe and inspect all construction or installation of grantee’s electric facilities subject to the provisions of this chapter and to make such inspections as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with governing laws, rules, and regulations. Grantee is responsible for all work performed, by or for grantee or its agents.

(2) Locates. Grantee shall comply with the most current requirements of ORS 757.542 through 757.562 and ORS 757.993, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in OAR Chapter 952. On any City project, if the grantee fails to properly identify the location of its electric facilities which results in time delays or additional costs on the project, the City reserves the right to remedy the situation and the grantee shall pay the full costs of such remedy.

(3) Relocation.

(a) Pursuant to a reasonable relocation schedule, mutually agreed to by grantee and City or as otherwise established by the City as described in subsection (3)(b) of this section, the City shall have the right to require grantee to relocate its electric facilities within the public ways when the public convenience requires such change and the expense thereof shall be paid by grantee. (However, payment by grantee shall in no way limit grantee’s right, if any, to seek reimbursement for such costs from any third party; provided, that should any third party use such reimbursement as a basis for a claim of any kind against the City, grantee must defend and fully indemnify the City for all direct and/or indirect costs related to such a claim except to the extent the claim is based on the negligent or willful misconduct of the City or a contractual obligation between the City and such third party that specifically states that the City is responsible for electric facility relocation costs.) If in requiring relocation, the City imposes additional specifications regarding materials or design for grantee’s electric facilities, the additional marginal increase shall not be considered relocation costs that are the grantee’s responsibility. Should grantee fail to relocate any such electric facilities by the date established by the relocation schedule, the City may cause and/or effect such relocation by qualified workers and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by grantee, including all direct, indirect and/or consequential costs and expenses incurred by the City due to grantee’s delay (however, payment by grantee shall in no way limit grantee’s right, if any, to seek reimbursement for such costs from any third party; provided, that should any third party use such reimbursement as a basis for a claim of any kind against the City, grantee must defend and fully indemnify the City for all direct and/or indirect costs related to such a claim except to the extent the claim is based on the negligent or willful misconduct of the City or a contractual obligation between the City and such third party that specifically states that the City is responsible for electric facility relocation costs). Improvements for the public convenience may eliminate space available for grantee’s existing electric facilities within the public ways. If space is eliminated, the City will work with the grantee to identify an alternate location.

(b) During the planning and design phase of a City project, the grantor will coordinate with the grantee to review project scope and schedule. The grantor and the grantee agree to work together in an attempt to establish a mutually acceptable relocation schedule for electric facilities. Failure of the grantee to respond to, or participate in, the coordination effort does not affect the ability of the grantor to proceed with design and construction of the project. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement regarding a relocation schedule for electric facilities, the grantor will establish the schedule. Emergency relocations (including isolation of a work area), temporary or permanent, will require an immediate response or relocation by grantee. As used in this section, emergency relocations include circumstances where electric facilities are encountered within the work zone while responding to an emergency involving other public utilities including, but not limited to, water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure.

(4) Maintenance of System.

(a) Grantee’s electric facilities shall be constructed, maintained and repaired in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, storm drains, water pipes, or any other property of the City, or with other facilities that may have been laid in the public ways by or under the City’s authority. The electric facilities constructed, owned or controlled by grantee shall be of good quality and workmanship and shall be maintained in good repair and efficiency.

(b) The grantee shall maintain emergency repair service locally on a 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-a-week basis. Such emergency service shall be easily reached by phone during normal business hours and through answering service at all other times.

(5) Underground Conversion. As permitted by State statute, administrative rule, or regulation, the City may require grantee to remove any overhead electric facilities and replace those facilities with underground facilities at the same or different locations subject to grantee’s engineering and safety standards. The expense of such a conversion shall be paid by grantee, but grantee may recover its costs from its customers in accordance with State statute, administrative rule or regulation, including but not limited to OAR 860-022-0046 (as may change from time to time). Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the City and grantee from agreeing on a case-by-case basis to a different form of cost recovery or another mechanism for funding an underground project that is consistent with State statutes, administrative rules or regulations.

(6) Underground Extension.

(a) In addition to the installation of underground electric distribution lines as provided by applicable State law and regulations, grantee’s electrical facilities will be placed underground in accordance with the Albany Development Code, or other applicable City ordinance.

(b) Electrical facilities shall be located in dedicated utility easements, and installed in conjunction with other utilities, as required by City code, standard, or regulation.

(c) In cases of new construction or property development where electric facilities are to be placed underground, grantee will coordinate with developers or property owners to perform joint trenching where applicable and install electric facilities in a timely manner.

Costs of trenching, rights-of-way, and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner.

(7) Pole Vacation or Abandonment Coordination. In the event grantee vacates or abandons a pole, grantee shall provide written notification at least 30 business days prior to vacation or abandonment of the pole to the City, and all other utilities sharing the pole through a joint use agreement. Grantee agrees to promptly notify other utilities when grantee’s attachments have been removed or relocated and other utilities shall remove or relocate their attachments. The grantee also agrees to require through its joint use agreements that other utilities remove or relocate their attachments within 30 business days following notice by the grantee that said attachments shall be moved.

(8) Rearrangement of Facilities to Permit Moving of Buildings and Other Objects.

(a) Upon notice in writing from any person desiring to move a building or other object, grantee shall respond within five business days to establish a mutually agreed upon schedule to temporarily raise, lower or remove its electric facilities upon any street, bridge, or public ways within the City, when necessary to permit the person to move the building or other object across or along such street, bridge or public way. The raising, lowering, or removal of the electric facilities of the grantee shall be in accordance with all applicable ordinances and regulations of the City.

(b) The notice required by subsection (8)(a) of this section shall bear the approval of the City of Albany, shall detail the route of movement of the building or other object and shall provide that the actual expense incurred by the grantee in making the temporary rearrangement of its facilities, including the cost to the grantee of any interruption of service to its customers caused thereby, will be borne by the person giving the notice. It shall further provide that the person giving said notice will indemnify and save said grantee harmless from any and all damages or claims of whatsoever kind or nature caused directly or indirectly from such temporary rearrangement of grantee’s facilities.

(c) Grantee, before making the temporary rearrangement of its facilities, may require the person desiring the temporary rearrangement to deposit cash or adequate security, at the option of the person, to secure payment of the costs of rearrangement as estimated by the grantee.

(9) Maps. Grantee shall provide the City, upon written request of the City, copies of maps showing the general location of grantee’s electric facilities within the public ways in the service area not more than 20 days after a request for the same. The level of detail in maps provided by grantee shall be limited to that which is needed for the City’s administration of the public ways and to protect grantee’s confidential business information and the security of grantee’s electric energy system.

(10) Annual Report. Grantee will provide an annual report to the City upon request regarding all new services created within the City boundaries during the term of this franchise. The City will be given the opportunity to provide written confirmation of the accuracy of the report and/or any corrections thereto to grantee within a reasonable time following receipt of the report. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.170 Restoration of public ways.
(1) Public Rights-of-Way Repairs. Work within public ways requires permits as outlined in AMC 3.03.160. Whenever grantee disturbs the surface of any public ways for any purpose, grantee shall promptly restore the public ways to a condition consistent with the most recent version of the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. Where no standard exists, it shall be restored to at least a condition comparable to that which existed before the work commenced, to the satisfaction of the City. Where pedestrian facilities are within the disturbed area, the facilities shall be restored consistent with the current Americans with Disabilities Act standards. When any opening is made by grantee in a hard surface pavement in any public ways, grantee shall promptly refill the opening and restore the surface to a condition satisfactory to the City.

If, during the course of work on its electric facilities, grantee causes damage to or alters the public ways or public property, grantee shall (at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City) promptly replace and restore it to a condition consistent with the most recent version of the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. Where no standard exists, it shall be restored to at least a condition comparable to that which existed before the work commenced, to the satisfaction of the City. Where pedestrian facilities are within the disturbed area, the facilities shall be restored consistent with the current Americans with Disabilities Act standards.

(2) Excavation Repairs. If grantee excavates the surface of any public ways, grantee shall be responsible for prompt restoration of the public way and its surface within the area affected by the excavation. If grantee fails to do so, the City may, after providing notice and reasonable opportunity to cure to grantee, refill and/or repave any opening made by grantee in the public ways, and the expense thereof shall be paid by grantee. The City reserves the right, after providing notice and reasonable opportunity to cure to grantee, to remove and/or repair any work done by grantee which does not conform to the requirements of this section. The City also reserves the right, if the restoration is not made promptly, to restore the area affected by the excavation. The cost thereof, including the cost of inspection and supervision, shall be paid by the grantee. All excavations made by grantee in the public ways shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention of accidents. All of grantee’s work shall be done in strict compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and ordinances of the City. Grantee’s responsibility for maintaining repairs to any surface areas disturbed by grantee’s work shall end upon completion of standard warranty periods as defined in the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.180 Reservation of City public ways.
(1) Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing, grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any public ways; laying down, repairing or removing water, storm drain, or sewer pipes; or constructing or establishing any other public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, so as not to injure or prevent the unrestricted use and operation of the grantee’s electric facilities under this franchise. In the event any works performed by the City cause damage to grantee’s electric facilities, City shall reimburse grantee the reasonable costs to perform necessary repairs, except to the extent such damage is the result of Consumers Power, or its designee or assigns, improperly locating such facilities. If the construction or repair of any public ways or public improvement, including construction, repair or removal of a sewer, storm drain, or water main, is expected to interfere with any portion of the grantee’s electric facilities, the City may direct grantee to relocate as provided in AMC 3.03.160(3).

(2) Whenever the City shall excavate or perform any work in any of the present and future public ways, or shall contract or issue permits for such excavation or work where such excavation or work may disturb grantee’s underground electric facilities, the City will notify grantee in writing sufficiently in advance of such contemplated excavation or work to enable grantee to take such measures as may be deemed necessary to protect such underground electric facilities from damage and possible inconvenience to the public.

(3) City will construct and authorize the construction of any structures, buildings or signs in public ways for erection below and near Consumers Power’s facilities only in a manner that is consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing and for City’s convenience only, at each anniversary of this franchise, grantee will notify City of the clearance requirements grantee deems applicable to construction below or near grantee’s facilities located in public ways. The City may direct grantee to relocate as provided in AMC 3.03.160(3) in order to gain compliance with said laws and regulations. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.190 Use of grantee’s facilities by City.
The City may without cost use grantee poles within public ways for City-owned attachments used in connection with its fire alarms, police signal systems, or other communication lines used for governmental purposes; provided, however, any such uses must be for activities owned, operated or used by the City for a public purpose and must not include the provision of CATV, Internet, or similar services to the public. Consumers Power assumes no liability nor will it incur, directly or indirectly, any additional expense in connection therewith, and the use of said poles by the City will be in such a manner as to prevent safety hazards or interferences with Consumers Power’s use of same. Nothing in this franchise will be construed to require Consumers Power to increase pole size, or alter the manner in which Consumers Power attaches its equipment to poles, or alter the manner in which it operates and maintains its electric facilities. City attachments must be installed and maintained in accordance with the reasonable requirements of Consumers Power and the current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code pertaining to such construction. Further, City attachments may only be attached or installed after written approval by Consumers Power. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.200 Vacation of public ways.
Upon receipt of any request for vacation of any public ways or portion thereof used by grantee, the City shall provide the grantee with the standard notice provided for public ways vacations. If any public ways or portion thereof used by grantee is vacated by the City during the term of this franchise, unless the City Council specifically reserves to grantee the right to continue its installation in the vacated public ways area or grantee secures such right from the third party that will have title to the area in which grantee has its electric facilities, grantee shall, without expense to the City, remove its facilities from such public ways, restore, repair or reconstruct the public ways area where such removal has occurred, and place the public ways area in such a condition which shall be no worse than the condition of such public ways immediately prior to removal. In the event of failure, neglect or refusal of grantee, after 30 days’ notice by City, to repair, improve or maintain such public ways portions, the City may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the grantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for facilities that require relocation, the terms of AMC 3.03.160(3) apply. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.210 Subdivision/partition plat application notification.
The City will notify Consumers Power of new subdivision and partition applications received by the City. Notification of such application will be mailed to Consumers Power:

Consumers Power, Inc.

Attn: Director of Member Services

6990 West Hills Road

P.O. Box 1180

Philomath, Oregon 97370

Mutually agreed upon alternative methods of notification, such as via email, are acceptable. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.220 Vegetation management.
(1) When Permits Needed. Upon obtaining a written permit from the City Urban Forester, grantee may prune or cause to be pruned, using proper utility arboricultural practices and in accordance with such permit, any tree in or overhanging the public ways which interferes with grantee’s facilities. Such pruning shall comply with the American National Standard for Tree Care Operation (ANSI A300) and be conducted under the direction of an arborist certified with the International Society of Arboriculture. A growth inhibitor treatment may be used for publicly owned trees and vegetation species that are fast-growing and problematic. Nothing contained in this section will prevent Consumers Power, when necessary and with the approval of the owner of the property on which they may be located and in compliance with the Albany Municipal Code and Albany Development Code, from cutting down and removing any trees which overhang streets.

Except in emergencies or by special written permission of the City Urban Forester, grantee may not prune trees until 10 days after written notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the public rights-of-way in or over which the tree is growing. The owner or occupant shall have one week from receipt of notice to have such trees pruned by a qualified line clearance arborist at his or her own expense in accordance with grantee’s standards for reliable utility service; provided, that the owner or occupant agrees to use tree pruning personnel that are qualified to work in close proximity to power lines. If the owner or occupant fails to do so in compliance with the notice, grantee may prune such tree at its expense.

(2) Blanket Permits. The City Urban Forester may, at the City Urban Forester’s discretion, waive the notification and single tree permit process and issue a blanket tree pruning permit if grantee adequately demonstrates to the City Urban Forester’s satisfaction the ability to consistently apply proper utility arboricultural practices to the pruning of trees. Before any blanket permit may be issued, any contractor of grantee shall be subject to the approval of the City Urban Forester. The City Urban Forester shall have discretion to cancel the blanket permit, notification and single tree permit process if, at any time, the grantee or its agents fail to either use proper utility arboricultural practices or to properly notify the public as specified in subsection (1) of this section.

(3) Emergencies. Notwithstanding the permit and notice requirements of this section, in the event of an emergency, grantee may prune a tree or trees as necessary to abate the emergency. For purposes of this section, emergencies exist when it is necessary to prune a tree or trees in order to restore electrical services, or to protect the public from imminent danger, or to prevent the imminent destruction of property. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.230 Compensation.
(1) In consideration of the rights, privileges, and franchise hereby granted, Consumers Power will pay to the City from and after the effective date of the acceptance of this franchise, seven percent of its gross revenues derived from within the corporate limits of City. “Gross revenue” means any revenue of Consumers Power derived from the retail sale and use of electric power and energy within the municipal boundaries of the City after adjustment for the net write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of rendered bills. All amounts paid under this section will be subject to review by the City; provided, that only payments that occurred during a period of 36 months before the date the City notifies Consumers Power of its intent to conduct a review may be subject to such review. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, at any time during the term of this franchise, the City may opt to increase the franchise fee amount as may then be allowed by State law. The City will provide Consumers Power with prior written notice of such increase following adoption of the change in percentage by the City. The increase may be effective no earlier than 60 days after City has provided such written notice to Consumers Power.

(2) The franchise fee is not in addition to any other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or charges that might otherwise be levied or collected by the City from Consumers Power with respect to Consumers Power’s electric business or the exercise of this franchise within the corporate limits of the City and the amount due to the City under any such other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or other charges for corresponding periods will be reduced by deducting therefrom the amount of said franchise fee paid hereunder. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.240 Renewal.
At least 120 days before the expiration of this franchise, Consumers Power and the City will agree to either extend the term of this franchise for a mutually acceptable period of time or use best faith efforts to renegotiate a replacement franchise. Consumers Power may continue to use the public ways of the City under the same terms and conditions in the event an extension or replacement franchise is not entered into upon expiration of this franchise as long as Consumers Power and City are continuing to negotiate an extension or new franchise. Either party may declare that negotiations have ended by giving written notice (“negotiation termination notice”) to the other party. The parties will operate under the most recent franchise for a period of 24 months from the date of the negotiation termination notice. The franchise will then terminate upon the expiration of the 24-month period. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.250 No waiver.
Neither the City nor Consumers Power will be excused from complying with any of the terms and conditions of this franchise by any failure of the other, or any of its officers, employees, or agents, upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms and conditions. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.260 Transfer of franchise.
Consumers Power will not transfer or assign any rights under this franchise to another entity, except transfers and assignments by operation of law, unless the City first gives its approval in writing, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, inclusion of this franchise as property subject to the lien of Consumers Power’s mortgage(s) does not constitute a transfer or assignment. (Ord. 5858 § 4, 2015).

3.03.270 Amendment.
At any time during the term of this franchise, the City, through its City Council, or Consumers Power may propose amendments to this franchise by giving 30 days’ written notice to the other of the proposed amendment(s), and both parties, through their designated representatives, within a reasonable time, negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon mutually satisfactory amendment(s).

In construing the provisions of this chapter, the following definitions shall be applied, unless otherwise stated:

(1) “Person” means any company, corporation, association, partnership or individual.

(2) “Taxpayer” means any person subject to the payment of the tax herein provided.

(3) “Electrical power and light business” means the business of selling, at wholesale or retail, electrical energy.

(4) “Gross operating revenue” means revenue accruing from the electrical power business transacted within the corporate limits of the City. In case the taxpayer is a public utility, subject to regulation under the statutes of Oregon, gross operating revenue means that amount required to be credited by the taxpayer to the taxpayer’s operation within the City under the uniform system of accounts prescribed by the regulatory body of the State having jurisdiction. There shall be no deduction for the cost of commodity, cost of materials used, labor, interest, discount, delivery costs and other expenses, unless otherwise provided in this chapter. (Ord. 3404 § 1, 1969).

3.04.020 Amount of tax.
The occupational tax upon the electric light and power business for the privilege of engaging in business within the City is hereby continued. The tax shall be in an amount equal to five percent of the gross revenue of the business during the calendar month next preceding the date of payment of tax, less the deductions and exclusions herein provided. So long as PacifiCorp, or its successor or assignee, operates an electrical power and light business pursuant to the terms of the negotiated franchise agreement set forth at AMC 3.04.090 through 3.04.310 as hereafter set forth or as may subsequently be amended, it shall not be subject to the privilege tax obligations of AMC 3.04.020 through 3.04.080. (Ord. 5859 § 2, 2015; Ord. 4961 § 1, 1991; Ord. 4884 § 1, 1989; Ord. 3404 § 2, 1969).

3.04.030 Payment.
The tax shall be payable on or before January 31, 1990 for calendar year 1989. On February 20, 1990 the tax for the month of January 1990 shall be paid and shall be paid monthly thereafter on the 20th of each month for the preceding month. The taxpayer shall furnish to the City with each payment a written statement showing the amount of gross revenue of the taxpayer within the City for the period covered by the payment. (Ord. 4884 § 1, 1989; Ord. 3404 § 3, 1969).

3.04.040 Exceptions and deductions.
There shall be excepted and deducted from the total gross operating revenues, revenues derived from the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce or from business done with the government of the United States, or any agency thereof, and after deducting therefrom all uncollectible revenues within the City and any amounts paid to the United States or the State of Oregon as excise, occupation or business taxes upon the sale or distribution of electric service in the City. (Ord. 3404 § 4, 1969).

3.04.050 Books of account.
Each taxpayer shall keep books of account which properly reflect the amount of gross operating revenue. The books of account shall be open to the inspection of the City Manager for the purpose of verifying the required amount of tax to be paid. (Ord. 3404 § 5, 1969).

3.04.060 Failure to make return.
If the taxpayer fails to make a return or the City Manager is dissatisfied as to the correctness of the return, the City Manager may fix a time and place for the investigation of the incorrectness of the return, and may, by subpoena, require the taxpayer to produce for investigation such books of account as may be necessary to properly ascertain the amount of tax due. After ascertaining the proper amount of taxes due, the City Manager shall notify the taxpayer of his/her findings. If additional tax is due and is not paid within 10 days after receipt of the notice, the City Manager shall notify the City Attorney to enforce collection of the same. It is unlawful for any person liable to tax hereunder to fail to make a return or to fail to pay the tax when due, or for any person to make any false or fraudulent return or false statement or representations in connection with any such return or to allow or to abet another in any attempt to evade payment of tax or failure to appear and testify in response to a subpoena issued in pursuance hereto, or to testify falsely upon any investigation of the correctness of a return, or in any manner to hinder or delay the City or any of its officers in carrying out the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 5013 § 1, 1992; Ord. 3404 § 6, 1969).

3.04.070 Liens.
The tax herein assessed shall be a lien against all taxable property of the person located in the City and shall be subject to collection in like manner as liens for special assessments for improvements on property located within the City. (Ord. 3404 § 7, 1969).

3.04.080 Waiver of free service.
The City, by imposing this occupational tax, hereby waives, relinquishes and releases any and all rights it may have under the terms of any existing franchise for free service from any utility engaged in the electrical power and light business within the corporate limits of the City.

3.04.090 Grant of franchise and general utility easement.
The City hereby grants to PacifiCorp the right, privilege and authority to construct, maintain, operate, upgrade, and relocate its electrical distribution and transmission lines and related appurtenances, including underground conduits and structures, poles, towers, wires, guy anchors, vaults, transformers, transmission lines, and communication lines (collectively referred to herein as “electric facilities”) in, under, along, over and across the present and future streets, alleys, public ways and public places (collectively referred to herein as “public ways”) within the City, for the purpose of supplying and transmitting electric power and energy to the inhabitants of the City and persons and corporations beyond the limits of the City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of electric facilities within the public ways as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. The provisions of AMC 3.04.090 to 3.04.300 shall set forth this franchise. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 1, 2015).

3.04.100 Term.
The term of this franchise and general utility easement is for 10 years commencing on the date of acceptance by the company as set forth in AMC 3.04.110. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 2, 2015).

3.04.110 Acceptance by PacifiCorp.
PacifiCorp has filed an unqualified written acceptance of all terms of the ordinance codified in this chapter with the City Recorder. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 3, 2015).

3.04.120 Nonexclusive franchise.
The right to use and occupy the public ways of the City are nonexclusive and the City reserves the right to use the public ways for itself or any other entity that provides service to City residences; provided, however, that such use will not unreasonably interfere with PacifiCorp’s electric facilities or PacifiCorp’s rights granted herein. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 4, 2015).

3.04.130 City regulatory authority.
In addition to this franchise, the City reserves the right to adopt such additional ordinances and regulations as may be deemed necessary in the exercise of its police power for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and their properties or exercise any other rights, powers, or duties required or authorized, under the Constitution of the State of Oregon, the laws of Oregon or City ordinances. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 5, 2015).

3.04.140 Indemnification.
The City will in no way be liable or responsible for any loss or damage to property or any injury to, or death of, any person that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by PacifiCorp of its electric facilities. PacifiCorp will indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless from and against claims, demands, liens and all liability or damage of whatsoever kind arising out of or in connection with PacifiCorp’s use of the public ways within the City, and will pay the costs of defense plus reasonable attorneys’ fees for any such claim, demand or lien. The City will: (a) give prompt written notice to PacifiCorp of any claim, demand or lien with respect to which the City seeks indemnification hereunder; and (b) unless in the City’s judgment a conflict of interest exists between the City and PacifiCorp with respect to such claim, demand or lien, allow PacifiCorp to assume the defense of such claim, demand, or lien. PacifiCorp will notify City of its intent to assume defense of any claim, demand or lien within 10 business days upon receipt of same. If such defense is not assumed by PacifiCorp due to any action or inaction by City, PacifiCorp will not be subject to liability for any settlement made without its consent. If PacifiCorp elects not to assume defense of the demand, claim or lien, PacifiCorp will be subject to liability for any settlement made. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, PacifiCorp will not indemnify, defend or hold the City harmless to the extent any claim, demand or lien arises out of or in connection with any negligent or willful act or failure to act of the City or any of its officers or employees. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 6, 2015).

3.04.150 Annexation.
(1) Extension of City Limits. Upon the annexation of any territory to the City, the rights granted under this franchise will extend to the annexed territory to the extent the City has such authority. All electrical facilities owned, maintained, or operated by PacifiCorp located within any public ways of the annexed territory will then be subject to this franchise.

(2) Annexation. When any territory is approved for annexation to the City, the City will, not later than 10 working days after passage of an ordinance approving the proposed annexation, provide by certified mail to PacifiCorp: (a) each site address to be annexed as recorded on county assessment and tax rolls; (b) a legal description of the proposed boundary change; and (c) a copy of the City’s ordinance approving the proposed annexation.

Additional or increased fees or taxes, other than ad valorem taxes, imposed on PacifiCorp as a result of an annexation of territory to the City will become effective on the effective date of the annexation provided notice is given to PacifiCorp in accordance with ORS 222.005, as amended from time to time. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 7, 2015).

3.04.160 Construction, maintenance, and relocation.
All electric facilities will be located so as to cause minimum interference with the public ways and be constructed, installed, maintained, cleared of vegetation, renovated or replaced in accordance with applicable rules, ordinances, and regulations.

(1) Permits.

(a) Subject to applicable regulations of the City, grantee may perform all necessary construction to construct, operate and maintain its electric facilities. All construction and maintenance of any and all electric facilities within or on the public ways shall, regardless of who performs installation and/or construction, be and remain the responsibility of grantee. Grantee shall apply for and obtain all permits necessary for installation, maintenance, and/or construction of any such facilities, and for excavation and installation of any electric facilities within the public ways, which permits shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Grantee shall pay all applicable fees due for City construction permits.

(b) Grantee may make excavations in the public ways needed for the construction, maintenance, and operation of grantee’s electric facilities, subject to obtaining permits from the City. Prior to doing such work, grantee must apply for, and obtain, appropriate permits from the City.

(c) In the event that emergency repairs are necessary for its electric facilities in the public ways, grantee shall immediately notify the City of the need for such repairs. Grantee may immediately initiate such emergency repairs, and shall apply for appropriate permits as soon as possible, not to exceed five business days following discovery of the emergency. Grantee must comply with all ordinance provisions relating to such excavations or construction, including the payment of permits or license fees and compliance with permit conditions.

(d) The City shall have the right to observe and inspect all construction or installation of grantee’s electric facilities subject to the provisions of this chapter and to make such inspections as it shall find necessary to ensure compliance with governing laws, rules, and regulations. Grantee is responsible for all work performed, by or for grantee or its agents.

(2) Locates. Grantee shall comply with the most current requirements of ORS 757.542 through 757.562 and ORS 757.993, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder in OAR Chapter 952. On any City project, if the grantee fails to properly identify the location of its electric facilities which results in time delays or additional costs on the project, the City reserves the right to remedy the situation and the grantee shall pay the full costs of such remedy.

(3) Relocation.

(a) Pursuant to a reasonable relocation schedule, mutually agreed to by grantee and City or as otherwise established by the City as described in subsection (3)(b) of this section, the City shall have the right to require grantee to relocate its electric facilities within the public ways when the public convenience requires such change and the expense thereof shall be paid by grantee. (However, payment by grantee shall in no way limit grantee’s right, if any, to seek reimbursement for such costs from any third party; provided, that should any third party use such reimbursement as a basis for a claim of any kind against the City, grantee must defend and fully indemnify the City for all direct and/or indirect costs related to such a claim except to the extent the claim is based on the negligent or willful misconduct of the City or a contractual obligation between the City and such third party that specifically states that the City is responsible for electric facility relocation costs.) If in requiring relocation, the City imposes additional specifications regarding materials or design for grantee’s electric facilities, the additional marginal increase shall not be considered relocation costs that are the grantee’s responsibility. Should grantee fail to relocate any such electric facilities by the date established by the relocation schedule, the City may cause and/or effect such relocation by qualified workers and the reasonable expense thereof shall be paid by grantee, including all direct, indirect and/or consequential costs and expenses incurred by the City due to grantee’s delay (however, payment by grantee shall in no way limit grantee’s right, if any, to seek reimbursement for such costs from any third party; provided, that should any third party use such reimbursement as a basis for a claim of any kind against the City, grantee must defend and fully indemnify the City for all direct and/or indirect costs related to such a claim except to the extent the claim is based on the negligent or willful misconduct of the City or a contractual obligation between the City and such third party that specifically states that the City is responsible for electric facility relocation costs). Improvements for the public convenience may eliminate space available for grantee’s existing electric facilities within the public ways. If space is eliminated, the City will work with the grantee to identify an alternate location.

(b) During the planning and design phase of a City project, the grantor will coordinate with the grantee to review project scope and schedule. The grantor and the grantee agree to work together in an attempt to establish a mutually acceptable relocation schedule for electric facilities. Failure of the grantee to respond to, or participate in, the coordination effort does not affect the ability of the grantor to proceed with design and construction of the project. In the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement regarding a relocation schedule for electric facilities, the grantor will establish the schedule. Emergency relocations (including isolation of a work area), temporary or permanent, will require an immediate response or relocation by grantee. As used in this section, emergency relocations include circumstances where electric facilities are encountered within the work zone while responding to an emergency involving other public utilities including, but not limited to, water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure.

(4) Maintenance of System.

(a) Grantee’s electric facilities shall be constructed, maintained and repaired in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, storm drains, water pipes, or any other property of the City, or with other facilities that may have been laid in the public ways by or under the City’s authority. The electric facilities constructed, owned or controlled by grantee shall be of good quality and workmanship and shall be maintained in good repair and efficiency.

(b) The grantee shall maintain emergency repair service locally on a 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-a-week basis. Such emergency service shall be easily reached by phone during normal business hours and through answering service at all other times.

(5) Underground Conversion. As permitted by State statute, administrative rule, or regulation, the City may require grantee to remove any overhead electric facilities and replace those facilities with underground facilities at the same or different locations subject to grantee’s engineering and safety standards. The expense of such a conversion shall be paid by grantee, but grantee may recover its costs from its customers in accordance with State statute, administrative rule or regulation, including but not limited to OAR 860-022-0046 (as may change from time to time). Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the City and grantee from agreeing on a case-by-case basis to a different form of cost recovery or another mechanism for funding an underground project that is consistent with State statutes, administrative rules or regulations.

(6) Underground Extension.

(a) In addition to the installation of underground electric distribution lines as provided by applicable State law and regulations, grantee’s electrical facilities will be placed underground in accordance with the Albany Development Code, or other applicable City ordinance.

(b) Electrical facilities shall be located in dedicated utility easements, and installed in conjunction with other utilities, as required by City code, standard, or regulation.

(c) In cases of new construction or property development where electric facilities are to be placed underground, grantee will coordinate with developers or property owners to perform joint trenching where applicable and install electric facilities in a timely manner.

Costs of trenching, rights-of-way, and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner.

(7) Pole Vacation or Abandonment Coordination. In the event grantee vacates or abandons a pole, grantee shall provide written notification at least 30 business days prior to vacation or abandonment of the pole to the City, and all other utilities sharing the pole through a joint use agreement. Grantee agrees to promptly notify other utilities when grantee’s attachments have been removed or relocated and other utilities shall remove or relocate their attachments. The grantee also agrees to require through its joint use agreements that other utilities remove or relocate their attachments within 30 business days following notice by the grantee that said attachments shall be moved.

(8) Rearrangement of Facilities to Permit Moving of Buildings and Other Objects.

(a) Upon notice in writing from any person desiring to move a building or other object, grantee shall respond within five business days to establish a mutually agreed upon schedule to temporarily raise, lower or remove its electric facilities upon any street, bridge, or public ways within the City, when necessary to permit the person to move the building or other object across or along such street, bridge or public way. The raising, lowering, or removal of the electric facilities of the grantee shall be in accordance with all applicable ordinances and regulations of the City.

(b) The notice required by subsection (8)(a) of this section shall bear the approval of the City of Albany, shall detail the route of movement of the building or other object and shall provide that the actual expense incurred by the grantee in making the temporary rearrangement of its facilities, including the cost to the grantee of any interruption of service to its customers caused thereby, will be borne by the person giving the notice. It shall further provide that the person giving said notice will indemnify and save said grantee harmless from any and all damages or claims of whatsoever kind or nature caused directly or indirectly from such temporary rearrangement of grantee’s facilities.

(c) Grantee, before making the temporary rearrangement of its facilities, may require the person desiring the temporary rearrangement to deposit cash or adequate security, at the option of the person, to secure payment of the costs of rearrangement as estimated by the grantee.

(9) Maps. Grantee shall provide the City, upon written request of the City, copies of maps showing the general location of grantee’s electric facilities within the public ways in the service area not more than 20 days after a request for the same. The level of detail in maps provided by grantee shall be limited to that which is needed for the City’s administration of the public ways and to protect grantee’s confidential business information and the security of grantee’s electric energy system.

(10) Annual Report. Grantee will provide an annual report to the City regarding all new services created within the City boundaries during the term of this franchise. The City will be given the opportunity to provide written confirmation of the accuracy of the report and/or any corrections thereto to grantee within a reasonable time following receipt of the report. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 8, 2015).

3.04.170 Restoration of public ways.
(1) Public Rights-of-Way Repairs. Work within public ways requires permits as outlined in AMC 3.04.160. Whenever grantee disturbs the surface of any public ways for any purpose, grantee shall promptly restore the public ways to a condition consistent with the most recent version of the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. Where no standard exists, it shall be restored to at least a condition comparable to that which existed before the work commenced, to the satisfaction of the City. Where pedestrian facilities are within the disturbed area, the facilities shall be restored consistent with the current Americans with Disabilities Act standards. When any opening is made by grantee in a hard surface pavement in any public ways, grantee shall promptly refill the opening and restore the surface to a condition satisfactory to the City.

If, during the course of work on its electric facilities, grantee causes damage to or alters the public ways or public property, grantee shall (at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City) promptly replace and restore it to a condition consistent with the most recent version of the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. Where no standard exists, it shall be restored to at least a condition comparable to that which existed before the work commenced, to the satisfaction of the City. Where pedestrian facilities are within the disturbed area, the facilities shall be restored consistent with the current Americans with Disabilities Act standards.

(2) Excavation Repairs. If grantee excavates the surface of any public ways, grantee shall be responsible for prompt restoration of the public way and its surface within the area affected by the excavation. If grantee fails to do so, the City may, after providing notice and reasonable opportunity to cure to grantee, refill and/or repave any opening made by grantee in the public ways, and the expense thereof shall be paid by grantee. The City reserves the right, after providing notice and reasonable opportunity to cure to grantee, to remove and/or repair any work done by grantee which does not conform to the requirements of this section. The City also reserves the right, if the restoration is not made promptly, to restore the area affected by the excavation. The cost thereof, including the cost of inspection and supervision, shall be paid by the grantee. All excavations made by grantee in the public ways shall be properly safeguarded for the prevention of accidents. All of grantee’s work shall be done in strict compliance with all applicable rules, regulations and ordinances of the City. Grantee’s responsibility for maintaining repairs to any surface areas disturbed by grantee’s work shall end upon completion of standard warranty periods as defined in the City’s Standard Construction Specifications. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 9, 2015).

3.04.180 Reservation of City public ways.
(1) Nothing in this franchise shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing, grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any public ways; laying down, repairing or removing water, storm drain, or sewer pipes; or constructing or establishing any other public work or improvement. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, so as not to injure or prevent the unrestricted use and operation of the grantee’s electric facilities under this franchise. In the event any works performed by the City cause damage to grantee’s electric facilities, City shall reimburse grantee the reasonable costs to perform necessary repairs, except to the extent such damage is the result of PacifiCorp, or its designee or assigns, improperly locating such facilities. If the construction or repair of any public ways or public improvement, including construction, repair or removal of a sewer, storm drain, or water main, is expected to interfere with any portion of the grantee’s electric facilities, the City may direct grantee to relocate as provided in AMC 3.04.160(3).

(2) Whenever the City shall excavate or perform any work in any of the present and future public ways, or shall contract or issue permits for such excavation or work where such excavation or work may disturb grantee’s underground electric facilities, the City will notify grantee in writing sufficiently in advance of such contemplated excavation or work to enable grantee to take such measures as may be deemed necessary to protect such underground electric facilities from damage and possible inconvenience to the public.

(3) City will construct and authorize the construction of any structures, buildings or signs in public ways for erection below and near PacifiCorp’s facilities only in a manner that is consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing and for City’s convenience only, at each anniversary of this franchise, grantee will notify City of the clearance requirements grantee deems applicable to construction below or near grantee’s facilities located in public ways. The City may direct grantee to relocate as provided in AMC 3.04.160(3) in order to gain compliance with said laws and regulations. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 10, 2015).

3.04.190 Use of grantee’s facilities by City.
The City may without cost use grantee poles within public ways for City-owned attachments used in connection with its fire alarms, police signal systems, or other communication lines used for governmental purposes; provided, however, any such uses must be for activities owned, operated or used by the City for a public purpose and must not include the provision of CATV, Internet, or similar services to the public. PacifiCorp assumes no liability nor will it incur, directly or indirectly, any additional expense in connection therewith, and the use of said poles by the City will be in such a manner as to prevent safety hazards or interferences with PacifiCorp’s use of same. Nothing in this franchise will be construed to require PacifiCorp to increase pole size, or alter the manner in which PacifiCorp attaches its equipment to poles, or alter the manner in which it operates and maintains its electric facilities. City attachments must be installed and maintained in accordance with the reasonable requirements of PacifiCorp and the current edition of the National Electrical Safety Code pertaining to such construction. Further, City attachments may only be attached or installed after written approval by PacifiCorp. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 11, 2015).

3.04.200 Vacation of public ways.
Upon receipt of any request for vacation of any public ways or portion thereof used by grantee, the City shall provide the grantee with the standard notice provided for public ways vacations. If any public ways or portion thereof used by grantee is vacated by the City during the term of this franchise, unless the City Council specifically reserves to grantee the right to continue its installation in the vacated public ways area or grantee secures such right from the third party that will have title to the area in which grantee has its electric facilities, grantee shall, without expense to the City, remove its facilities from such public ways, restore, repair or reconstruct the public ways area where such removal has occurred, and place the public ways area in such a condition which shall be no worse than the condition of such public ways immediately prior to removal. In the event of failure, neglect or refusal of grantee, after 30 days’ notice by City, to repair, improve or maintain such public ways portions, the City may do such work or cause it to be done, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the grantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for facilities that require relocation, the terms of AMC 3.04.160(3) apply. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 12, 2015).

3.04.210 Subdivision/partition plat application notification.
The City will notify PacifiCorp of new subdivision and partition applications received by the City. Notification of such application will be mailed to PacifiCorp:

Pacific Power

Attn: Estimating Department

P.O. Box 248

Albany, OR 97321

Mutually agreed upon alternative methods of notification, such as via email, are acceptable. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 13, 2015).

3.04.220 Vegetation management.
(1) When Permits Needed. Upon obtaining a written permit from the City Urban Forester, grantee may prune or cause to be pruned, using proper utility arboricultural practices and in accordance with such permit, any tree in or overhanging the public ways which interferes with grantee’s facilities. Such pruning shall comply with the American National Standard for Tree Care Operation (ANSI A300) and be conducted under the direction of an arborist certified with the International Society of Arboriculture. A growth inhibitor treatment may be used for publicly owned trees and vegetation species that are fast-growing and problematic. Nothing contained in this section will prevent PacifiCorp, when necessary and with the approval of the owner of the property on which they may be located and in compliance with the Albany Municipal Code and Albany Development Code, from cutting down and removing any trees which overhang streets.

Except in emergencies or by special written permission of the City Urban Forester, grantee may not prune trees until 10 days after written notice has been given to the owner or occupant of the premises abutting the public rights-of-way in or over which the tree is growing. The owner or occupant shall have one week from receipt of notice to have such trees pruned by a qualified line clearance arborist at his or her own expense in accordance with grantee’s standards for reliable utility service; provided, that the owner or occupant agrees to use tree pruning personnel that are qualified to work in close proximity to power lines. If the owner or occupant fails to do so in compliance with the notice, grantee may prune such tree at its expense.

(2) Blanket Permits. The City Urban Forester may, at the City Urban Forester’s discretion, waive the notification and single tree permit process and issue a blanket tree pruning permit if grantee adequately demonstrates to the City Urban Forester’s satisfaction the ability to consistently apply proper utility arboricultural practices to the pruning of trees. Before any blanket permit may be issued, any contractor of grantee shall be subject to the approval of the City Urban Forester. The City Urban Forester shall have discretion to cancel the blanket permit, notification and single tree permit process if, at any time, the grantee or its agents fail to either use proper utility arboricultural practices or to properly notify the public as specified in subsection (1) of this section.

(3) Emergencies. Notwithstanding the permit and notice requirements of this section, in the event of an emergency, grantee may prune a tree or trees as necessary to abate the emergency. For purposes of this section, emergencies exist when it is necessary to prune a tree or trees in order to restore electrical services, or to protect the public from imminent danger, or to prevent the imminent destruction of property. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 14, 2015).

3.04.230 Compensation.
(1) In consideration of the rights, privileges, and franchise hereby granted, PacifiCorp will pay to the City from and after the effective date of the acceptance of this franchise, seven percent of its gross revenues derived from within the corporate limits of City. “Gross revenue” means any revenue of PacifiCorp derived from the retail sale and use of electric power and energy within the municipal boundaries of the City after adjustment for the net write-off of uncollectible accounts and corrections of rendered bills. All amounts paid under this section will be subject to review by the City; provided, that only payments that occurred during a period of 36 months before the date the City notifies PacifiCorp of its intent to conduct a review may be subject to such review. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, at any time during the term of this franchise, the City may opt to increase the franchise fee amount as may then be allowed by State law. The City will provide PacifiCorp with prior written notice of such increase following adoption of the change in percentage by the City. The increase may be effective no earlier than 60 days after City has provided such written notice to PacifiCorp.

(2) The franchise fee is not in addition to any other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or charges that might otherwise be levied or collected by the City from PacifiCorp with respect to PacifiCorp’s electric business or the exercise of this franchise within the corporate limits of the City and the amount due to the City under any such other license, occupation, franchise or excise taxes or other charges for corresponding periods will be reduced by deducting therefrom the amount of said franchise fee paid hereunder. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 15, 2015).

3.04.240 Renewal.
At least 120 days before the expiration of this franchise, PacifiCorp and the City will agree to either extend the term of this franchise for a mutually acceptable period of time or use best faith efforts to renegotiate a replacement franchise. PacifiCorp may continue to use the public ways of the City under the same terms and conditions in the event an extension or replacement franchise is not entered into upon expiration of this franchise as long as PacifiCorp and City are continuing to negotiate an extension or new franchise. Either party may declare that negotiations have ended by giving written notice (“negotiation termination notice”) to the other party. The parties will operate under the most recent franchise for a period of 24 months from the date of the negotiation termination notice. The franchise will then terminate upon the expiration of the 24-month period. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 16, 2015).

3.04.250 No waiver.
Neither the City nor PacifiCorp will be excused from complying with any of the terms and conditions of this franchise by any failure of the other, or any of its officers, employees, or agents, upon any one or more occasions to insist upon or to seek compliance with any such terms and conditions. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 17, 2015).

3.04.260 Transfer of franchise.
PacifiCorp will not transfer or assign any rights under this franchise to another entity, except transfers and assignments by operation of law, unless the City first gives its approval in writing, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, inclusion of this franchise as property subject to the lien of PacifiCorp’s mortgage(s) does not constitute a transfer or assignment. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 18, 2015).

3.04.270 Amendment.
At any time during the term of this franchise, the City, through its City Council, or PacifiCorp may propose amendments to this franchise by giving 30 days’ written notice to the other of the proposed amendment(s), and both parties, through their designated representatives, within a reasonable time, negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon mutually satisfactory amendment(s). No amendment(s) to this franchise will be effective until mutually agreed upon by the City and PacifiCorp and formally adopted as an ordinance amendment. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 19, 2015).

3.04.280 Noncontestability – Breach of contract.
(1) Neither the City nor PacifiCorp will take any action for the purpose of securing modification of this franchise before either the Oregon Public Utility Commission or any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that neither will be precluded from taking any action it deems necessary to resolve difference in interpretation of the franchise nor will PacifiCorp be precluded from seeking relief from the courts in the event the Oregon Public Utility Commission orders, rules or regulations conflict with or make performance under the franchise illegal.

(2) In the event PacifiCorp or the City fails to fulfill any of their respective obligations under this franchise, the City or PacifiCorp will have a breach of contract claim and remedy against the other in addition to any other remedy provided by law; provided, that no remedy that would have the effect of amending the specific provisions of this franchise will become effective without such action that would be necessary to formally amend the franchise. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 20, 2015).

3.04.290 Notices.
Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices from PacifiCorp to the City under or concerning this franchise will be delivered to the City Recorder’s Office. Unless otherwise specified herein, all notices from the City to PacifiCorp under or concerning this franchise will be delivered to the Customer and Community Affairs Vice President, Pacific Power, 825 NE Multnomah, Lloyd Center Tower Suite 2000, Portland, Oregon 97232, and such other office as PacifiCorp may advise the City of by written notice. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 21, 2015).

3.04.300 Severability.
If any section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision of this franchise is for any reason determined to be illegal, invalid, or superseded by other lawful authority including any State or Federal regulatory authority having jurisdiction or unconstitutional, illegal or invalid by any court of common jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct, and independent provision and such determination will have no effect on the validity of any other section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision, all of which will remain in full force and effect for the term of the franchise or any renewal or renewals thereof. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 22, 2015).

3.04.310 Waiver of jury trial.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties hereto waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this agreement. Each party further waives any right to consolidate any action in which a jury trial has been waived with any other action in which a jury trial cannot be or has not been waived. (Ord. 5859 § 3, 2015; Ord. 5855 § 23, 2015).

3.14.010 Title.
The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the “Transient Room Tax Ordinance” of the City. (Ord. 4080 § 1, 1977).

3.14.020 Definitions.
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of the chapter:

(1) “Accrual accounting” means the operator enters the rent due from a transient on his/her records when the rent is earned whether or not it is paid.

(2) “Cash accounting” means the operator does not enter the rent due from a transient on his/her records until rent is paid.

(3) “City Council” means the City Council of the City of Albany, Oregon.

(4) “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for transient occupancy for 30 days or less for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, bed and breakfast, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, vacation rental, public or private club, space in mobile home or trailer parks, or similar structure or portions thereof so occupied, provided such occupancy is for less than a 30-day period.

(5) “Occupancy” means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession for lodging or sleeping purposes of any room or rooms in a hotel or space in a mobile home or trailer park or portion thereof.

(6) “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel in any capacity. Where the operator performs his/her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his/her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall be considered to be compliance by both.

(7) “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, fraternity, sorority, public or private dormitory, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

(8) “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received by the operator, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, goods, labor, credits, property or other consideration valued in money less discounts for seniors, AAA, Good Sam Club, etc.

(9) “Rent package plan” means the consideration charged for both food and rent where a single rate is made for the total of both. The amount applicable to rent for determination of transient room tax under this chapter shall be the same charge made for rent when consideration is not a part of a package plan.

(10) “Tax” means either the tax payable by the transient or the aggregate amount of taxes due from an operator during the period for which he/she is required to report his/her collections.

(11) “Tax Administrator” means the Finance Director of the City.

(12) “Transient” means any individual who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy in a hotel for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. The day a transient checks out of the hotel shall not be included in determining the 30-day period if the transient is not charged rent for that day by the operator. Any such individual so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. Any individual so occupying space in a hotel for consecutive days beyond the 30-day period shall no longer be deemed to be a transient. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered. A person who pays for lodging on a monthly basis, irrespective of the number of days in such month, shall not be deemed a transient. (Ord. 5942 §§ 1, 2 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5692 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5013 § 1, 1992; Ord. 4851 § 1, 1989; Ord. 4080 § 2, 1977).

3.14.030 Administration of funds.
Repealed by Ord. 5275. (Ord. 5121 § 1, 1994; Ord. 4080 § 16(a), 1977).

3.14.040 Imposition.
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, on and after July 1, 1999, each transient shall pay a tax in the amount of nine percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. The operator shall enter the tax on his/her records when rent is collected, if the operator keeps his/her records on the cash accounting basis, and when earned if the operator keeps his/her records on the accrual accounting basis. If rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid by the transient or the operator with each installment. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the City. In all cases, the rent paid or charged for occupancy shall exclude the sale of any goods, services and commodities, other than the furnishing of rooms, accommodations, and parking space in mobile home parks or trailer parks. (Ord. 5942 §§ 1, 2 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5400 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5121 § 2, 1994; Ord. 5013 § 1, 1992; Ord. 4693 § 1, 1985; Ord. 4080 § 3, 1977).

3.14.050 Exemptions.

(2) Repealed by Ord. 5942;

(3) Repealed by Ord. 5942;

(4) Any occupant whose rent is paid for a hospital room or to a medical clinic, convalescent home or home for aged people;

(5) Any occupant who is a federal employee traveling on federal business;

(6) Any occupant whose rent is being paid by the Red Cross or other relief organization for temporary emergency housing. (Ord. 5942 §§ 1, 2 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5692 § 1, 2008; Ord. 4080 § 6, 1977).

3.14.060 Operator – Registration.
Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a hotel in the City shall register with the Tax Administrator on a form provided by him/her. Operators engaged in business at the time the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted must register not later than 30 calendar days after passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Operators starting business after the ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted must register within 15 calendar days after commencing business. The privilege of registration after the date of imposition of such tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or collection of tax regardless of registration. Registration shall set forth the name under which an operator transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his/her place or places of business and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the Tax Administrator may require. The registration shall be signed by the operator. (Ord. 4080 § 7, 1977).

3.14.070 Operator – Certificate of authority.
(1) The Tax Administrator shall, within 10 days after registration, issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business of each registrant. Certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the Tax Administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer. Each certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable and shall be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy.

(2) Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

(a) The name of the operator;

(b) The address of the hotel;

(c) The date upon which the certificate was issued;

(d) “This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Transient Room Tax Ordinance of the City of Albany by registration with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the room tax imposed by said City and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any unlawful business in any unlawful manner, or to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of the City of Albany. This certificate does not constitute a permit.” (Ord. 5178 § 1, 1995; Ord. 4080 § 7, 1977).

3.14.080 Operator – Duties.
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated upon the operator’s records, and any receipt rendered by the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise that the tax or any part of the tax will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, when added, any part will be refunded, except in the manner provided by this chapter. (Ord. 4080 § 5, 1977).

3.14.090 Operator – Recordkeeping.
Every operator shall keep guest records of room sales and accounting books and records of the room sales. All records shall be retained by the operator for a period of three years and six months after they come into being. (Ord. 4080 § 16(b), 1977).

3.14.100 Operator – Collection.
(1) Every operator renting rooms in the City, the occupancy of which is not exempted under the terms of this chapter, shall collect a tax from the occupant. The tax collected or accrued by the operator constitutes a debt owing by the operator to the City.

(2) In all cases of credit or deferred payment of rent, the payment of tax to the operator may be deferred until the rent is paid, and the operator shall not be liable for the tax until credits are paid or deferred payments are made. (Ord. 5178 § 2, 1995; Ord. 5121 § 3, 1994; Ord. 4693 § 2, 1985; Ord. 4080 § 4(a), (b), (d), 1977).

3.14.110 Due date – Returns and payments.
(1) The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the transient to the operator at the time that rent is paid. All amounts of such taxes collected by any operator are due and payable to the Tax Administrator on a monthly basis on the fifteenth day of the month for the preceding month, and are delinquent on the last day of the month in which they are due.

(2) On or before the fifteenth day of the month following each month of collection, a return for the preceding month’s tax collections shall be filed with the Tax Administrator. The return shall be filed in such form as the Tax Administrator may prescribe by every operator liable for payment of tax.

(3) Returns shall show the amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related period. The Tax Administrator may require returns to show the total rentals upon which tax was collected or otherwise due, gross receipts of the operator for such period and an explanation in detail of any discrepancy between such amounts and the amount of rents exempt, if any.

(4) After the gross tax has been calculated by the operator, the operator shall retain five percent of the gross tax as compensation for the recordkeeping services provided.

(5) The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the remittance of the amount of the tax due, to the Tax Administrator at his/her office either by personal delivery or by mail. If the return is mailed, the postmark shall be considered the date of delivery for determining delinquencies.

(6) For good cause, the Tax Administrator may extend for not to exceed one month the time for making any return or payment of tax. No further extension shall be granted, except by the City Council. Any operator to whom an extension is granted shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month on the amount of tax due without proration for a fraction of a month. If a return is not filed and the tax and interest due is not paid by the end of extension granted, then the interest shall become a part of the tax for computation of penalties described elsewhere in this chapter.

(7) The Tax Administrator, if he/she deems it necessary in order to ensure payment or facilitate collection by the City of the amount of taxes in any individual case, may require returns and payment of the amount of taxes for other than monthly periods. (Ord. 5013 § 1, 1992; Ord. 4851 § 1, 1989; Ord. 4727, 1986; Ord. 4080 § 8, 1977).

3.14.120 Penalties and interest.
(1) Original Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time for remittance of tax due and who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter prior to delinquency shall pay a penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax due in addition to the amount of the tax.

(2) Continued Delinquency. Any operator who has not been granted an extension of time for remittance of tax due and who failed to pay any delinquent remittance on or before a period of 30 days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of 15 percent of the amount of the tax due plus the amount of the tax and the 10 percent penalty first imposed.

As soon as the Tax Administrator has determined the tax due that is imposed by this chapter from any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to report and remit said tax, he/she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice in the manner described in this chapter of the amount so assessed.

The amount so determined as provided in this chapter shall be immediately due and payable, and the operator shall immediately pay the same determination to the Tax Administrator after service of notice thereof; provided, however, the operator may petition after payment has been made for redemption and refund of such determination, if the petition is filed within 10 days from the date of service of notice by the Tax Administrator. (Ord. 5013 § 1, 1992; Ord. 4080 § 10, 1977).

3.14.140 Redetermination.
(1) Any person against whom a determination is made under AMC 3.14.130 or any person directly interested may petition for a redetermination of redemption and refund within the time required in AMC 3.14.130.

The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the Tax Administrator subject to the limitations provided in this chapter.

Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the proper county official shall, upon the payment of all taxes, penalties and interest thereon, be released by the Tax Administrator when the full amount determined to be due has been paid to the City and the operator or person making such payment has received a receipt therefor stating that the full amount of taxes, penalties and interest thereon have been paid and that the lien is thereby released and the record of lien is satisfied. (Ord. 5121 § 4, 1994; Ord. 4080 § 13, 1977).

(a) If during the course of the grantee’s construction, operation, or maintenance of the rail facilities there occurs damage to infrastructure outside the rail facilities, where such damage is proximately caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of the grantee or grantee’s failure to comply with the construction and maintenance obligations set forth in subsection (1)(b) of this section, grantee shall repair such damage and restore to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition existing immediately prior to such damage. In the event grantee fails to restore the damaged infrastructure to a condition reasonably comparable to the condition existing immediately prior to such damage, the City may repair and restore or cause to repair and restore such damage at the expense of grantee; provided, that the City provides grantee with reasonable notice to restore, and grantee fails to restore such damage within the time period given by the City.

If during the course of construction, operation, or maintenance by the City of the area outside of the rail facilities there occurs damage to the rail facilities, where such damage is proximately caused by the willful misconduct or negligence of the City, the grantee may repair and restore or cause to repair and restore such damage at the expense of the City.

(b) Grantee shall construct and maintain the rail facilities such that railroad use does not damage the adjacent street and such that said facilities are laid even with the current grade of streets and immediately adjacent thereto to the extent it is reasonably practicable and in such manner as to not materially interfere with the public use thereof. (Ord. 5813 § 3, 2013).

3.24.040 Crossings and speed limit.
(1) Crossing Protective Devices. Should the Oregon Department of Transportation – Rail Division (hereinafter “ODOT Rail”) issue an order requiring upgrading to gates and related flashing devices at any of four identified crossings (Madison, Washington, Broadalbin and Thurston) by reason of development on or near those particular street crossings (“required upgrading”), the parties hereto agree as follows:

(a) The parties will cooperate to seek State and/or Federal funds to cover the entire cost of any required upgrading.

(b) If State and/or Federal funds are available for a required upgrading at any of the four identified crossings, but the funds are insufficient to cover the entire cost of that required upgrading, then the operating railroad shall pay up to $250,000 of the cost for that required upgrading. The City shall bear any and all unfunded cost of the required upgrading that exceeds $250,000 and in no event shall the operating railroad be obligated to pay more than $250,000 at any of the four identified crossings.

(c) If City elects not to accept the conditions imposed in exchange for the use of State and/or Federal funds, or if there are no State and/or Federal funds available for a required upgrading of any of the four identified crossings, then the operating railroad shall pay 50 percent of the cost for that required upgrading, not to exceed $125,000. The City shall pay any remaining cost of required upgrading and in no event shall the operating railroad be obligated to pay more than $125,000 at any of the four identified crossings.

(d) Grantee’s obligations under this section shall be limited to the four identified crossings and those obligations will terminate upon termination of the franchise for any reason.

(2) Speed Limit. The rate of speed on all cars shall not exceed the maximum speed established by the Federal Railway Administration for the class of the track in the right-of-way. (Ord. 5813 § 4, 2013).

3.24.050 Enforcement and termination of franchise.
(1) Violation Creating an Imminent Hazard. Should the grantee violate any term of this franchise which violation creates an immediate risk of personal injury or substantial property damage, City may take such steps as are reasonably necessary to remedy the emergency condition so as to minimize the risk of personal injury or property damage. Such emergency action shall be accompanied by reasonable notice to grantee and corrective action shall be undertaken in a manner reasonably intended to minimize adverse impact to the grantee, and in accordance with applicable safety laws related to work done in or around railroad tracks. The reasonable cost of emergency corrective action necessary as a result of a breach of this franchise shall be reimbursed to City by grantee.

(2) Notice of Nonemergency Violation. In the event City believes that grantee has not complied with the terms of the franchise, and an emergency circumstance as described above does not exist, the City shall informally discuss the matter with grantee. If these discussions do not lead to resolution of the problem, the City shall notify the grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged noncompliance.

(3) The Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond in a Nonemergency Circumstance. The grantee shall have 30 days from the receipt of the notice described in subsection (2) of this section:

(a) To respond to the City contesting the assertion of noncompliance; or

(b) To cure such default; or

(c) In the event that, by the nature of the default, such default cannot be cured within the 30-day period, initiate reasonable steps to remedy such default as soon as reasonably possible and notify the City of the steps being taken and the date by which they will be completed.

(4) Enforcement. In the event that grantee fails to cure the default as set forth above, the City may seek judicial enforcement of the terms of this franchise by specific performance or damages. Jurisdiction and venue shall rest with the Circuit Court in the State of Oregon for Linn County.

(5) Force Majeure. The grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default, where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by circumstances reasonably beyond the ability of the grantee to anticipate and control. (Ord. 5813 § 5, 2013).

3.24.060 Miscellaneous provisions.
(1) Actions of Parties. In any action by the City or the grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any instances where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(2) In the event the City determines that public necessity requires it install or maintain any sewer pipe, water pipe, or other public utility service (“utilities”) along or across the rail facilities, the City agrees to provide reasonable notice to the grantee in advance of such planned work and to cooperate with the grantee in completing any such work. City is authorized to undertake any action reasonably necessary to abate an emergency without providing advance notice to grantee; provided, that City shall provide notice and cooperate with grantee as soon as practicable. Grantee shall be permitted to oversee any installations and maintenance of utilities, and all installations and maintenance shall comply with applicable law and grantee’s engineering specifications, if any, so long as such specifications are provided to the City in a timely fashion so as not to unreasonably delay construction. Grantee shall reimburse the City for the actual, reasonable incremental costs paid to third parties, if any, or incurred by the City for such work, but only to the extent such actual, reasonable incremental costs were directly caused by the need to avoid interference with the rail facilities or to comply with requirements applicable only because of the presence of the rail facilities. The City shall provide invoices and other documentation reasonably acceptable to grantee supporting such actual, reasonable incremental costs, which documentation must clearly show that such costs were a direct result of the need to avoid interference with the rail facilities. Any expense incurred by grantee in the maintenance and operation of its rail facility during City’s installation or maintenance of utilities shall be at the expense of the grantee.

(3) Entire Agreement. This franchise constitutes the entire agreement between the grantee and the City. Amendments to this franchise will not be effective unless mutually agreed to in writing by the parties.

(4) Notice. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every notice or response required by this franchise to be served upon the City or the grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party when placed in a properly sealed correctly addressed envelope:

(a) Upon receipt when hand delivered with receipt/acknowledgment;

(b) Upon receipt when sent certified mail; or

(c) Within five business days after having been posted in the regular mail.

(1) The City reserves the right to adopt rules and regulations controlling the procedures as set forth below and subjects for review sessions. In the absence of any action taken by the City to exercise these rights, franchisee shall be subject to at least the procedures and subjects described in this section.

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter is for any reason held illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof. The Council hereby declares that it would have passed the ordinance codified in this chapter and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, and phrase hereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses, or phrases be declared illegal, invalid, or unconstitutional. The invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not abate, reduce, or otherwise affect any other consideration or obligation required by the franchisee of any franchise granted hereafter. If any court or governmental agency shall increase the maximum amount that may be required by the franchisee, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith what the new fee shall be. During the period of negotiations, franchisee shall continue to pay the City the compensation specified in AMC 3.26.410(1). (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.070 Commercial impracticability.

3.26.080 Competitive equity.
(1) The grantee acknowledges and agrees that the City reserves the right to grant one or more additional franchises or other similar lawful authorization to provide cable services within the service area; provided, the City agrees that, within 90 days of the grantee’s request, it shall amend this franchise to include any material terms or conditions that it makes available to the new entrant, or provide relief from existing material terms or conditions, so as to ensure that the regulatory and financial burdens on each entity are materially equivalent. “Material terms and conditions” include, but are not limited to: franchise fees; insurance; system build-out requirements; security instruments; customer service standards; required reports and related record keeping; and notice and opportunity to cure breaches. The parties agree that this provision shall not require a word-for-word identical franchise or authorization for a competitive entry, so long as the regulatory and financial burdens on each entity are materially equivalent. Video programming services delivered over wireless broadband networks are specifically exempted from the requirements of this section.

(2) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, at any time that another cable-based provider, legally authorized by State or Federal law, makes available for purchase by subscribers or customers cable services or multiple channels of video programming within the service area without a franchise or other similar lawful authorization granted by the City, and the City fails to require said cable provider to obtain a franchise, then grantee may seek modifications as per subsection (1) of this section, or the term of grantee’s franchise shall, upon 90 days’ written notice from grantee, be shortened so that the franchise shall be deemed to expire on a date six months from the first day of the month following the date of grantee’s notice. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

Article II. Service

3.26.090 Continuous service.
The franchisee shall maintain and operate an adequate cable system in the City. The franchisee shall use due diligence to maintain continuous and uninterrupted service which shall conform at least to the standards common in the business and the standards adopted by the State and Federal authorities, and to standards of the City contained herein which are not in conflict with those adopted by State and Federal authorities. Under no circumstances is the franchisee liable to the City for an interruption or failure of service caused by acts of God, unavoidable accident, or other circumstance beyond the control of the franchisee through no fault of its own. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.100 Emergency repair service.
The franchisee shall maintain emergency repair service locally on a 24-hours-per-day, seven-days-a-week basis. Such emergency service shall be easily reached by phone during normal business hours and through answering service at all other times. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.110 Justified service.
(1) Activation of Service. Franchisee shall promptly provide service upon request at standard installation rates where the potential subscriber can be served by extension of distribution cable past occupied dwelling units, equivalent to a density of 10 dwelling units per quarter mile of cable contiguous to the already activated system. Such density shall be computed on the basis of dwelling units that can be served on either side of the cable.

(2) The franchisee shall furnish service under this franchise within City limits whenever there is demand reasonably great enough to justify cost of installing cables and equipment. The City shall have the right to make the determination of the demand, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, but shall give franchisee 15 days’ notice prior to making the determination; and if the franchisee fails to comply with the City’s determination, then this franchise may be terminated pursuant to the procedures of AMC 3.26.310. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.120 Extension of service.
(1) Service to Individual Subscribers from Existing System. Where a subscriber can be served from the franchisee’s existing system without extension of trunk or distribution cable, the franchisee shall serve the potential subscriber upon request on the following terms and conditions:

(a) The building unit shall be connected to cable at the standard installation charge if the connection can be made with an aerial drop and does not exceed 150 feet.

(b) If the aerial connection drop exceeds 150 feet, the potential subscriber may be charged the actual cost for the distance exceeding 150 feet plus standard installation charge; and franchisee may request advance payment for each installation.

(c) If the requested installation is to be placed underground, the potential subscriber must pay for furnishing open trench, as specified by the franchisee, backfilling, and restoring the property to its original condition. Franchisee may request advance payment for such work.

(d) The franchisee shall arrange for all necessary easements over or under private property. Any easement for such use which has already been granted to a telephone or other utility company shall, to the extent possible, be interpreted so as to grant the franchisee the same rights and privileges as have been granted to the telephone or other utility company. In such easements, the words “telephone” or “telephone company,” “public utility” and the like shall be interpreted to include the franchisee, to the extent possible. Easements granted to the City for City utilities shall not be used for installation of Franchise facilities or improvements.

(e) Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been placed on an average 90 percent of the time throughout the year.

(2) Additional Extension of System. In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, franchisee shall provide, upon request of five or more potential subscribers desiring service, an estimate of costs required to extend service to said subscribers and the amount by which said costs exceed what would be the cost of mandatory extension under this section. Franchisee shall extend service to any such dwelling units upon advance payment (or assurance of payment satisfactory to the franchisee) of the additional cost. Such payment shall be nonrefundable, and in the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be treated in full or in part as consideration for early extension of service.

(3) Underground Extension of System.

(a) Installation of System. In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property owner shall give franchisee reasonable notice of such construction or development, including a copy of any final plat and of the particular date on which open trenching will be available for franchisee’s installation of conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at franchisee’s expense. Franchisee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching.

(b) Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; except that if franchisee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals within five working days of the date the trenches become available, then should the trenches be closed after the two-day period, the cost of new trenching is to be borne by franchisee.

(c) In those areas and portions of the City where the transmission or distribution facilities of both the public utility providing telephone service and those of the utility providing electric service are underground or hereafter may be placed underground, then the franchisee shall likewise construct, operate, and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground.

(d) It shall be the policy of the City to encourage all utilities, including franchisee, to place all existing and future transmission and distribution facilities underground. The franchisee agrees with this policy and will work with the City and other utilities to implement this policy.

(4) Access to Open Trenches. The City agrees to include the grantee in the platting process for any new subdivision within the franchise area. A utility or developer shall give the grantee at least 20 days’ advance written notice of the availability of an open trench, and a utility or developer shall provide grantee with reasonable access to the open trench. Grantee shall make a good faith effort to utilize such open trenches in its provision of cable service to affected properties so long as such properties are passed by grantee’s cable system, but grantee is not required to utilize any trench. Neither City nor grantee shall be liable or financially responsible for any failure to give franchisee notice of or require notice of a subdivision plat application, or failure to utilize open trenches created by a utility or developer. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.130 Levels of service.
(1) Basic Service. Basic service is the lowest tier of service regularly provided to all subscribers that includes the retransmission of local broadcast signals. In no event shall subscribers be required to subscribe to any other service as a condition for obtaining basic service.

(2) Service to Institutions. The franchisee, upon request, shall provide without charge a standard installation and one outlet of basic cable to each fire and police station, public school, Linn Benton Community College, County Courthouse, City offices, public museum and all public libraries within the franchise territory; provided, however, those buildings or portions of buildings housing or occupied by prison/jail populations shall be excluded. Cable service to the City described herein is a voluntary offer of franchisee. The cable service provided shall not be distributed beyond the originally installed outlet without authorization from franchisee. The cable service provided shall not be used for commercial purposes, and such outlets shall not be located in areas open to the public.

The restoration shall be done in compliance with City specification, requirements, and regulations in effect at the time of such restoration. If the franchisee fails to restore promptly the affected portion of the street, bridge, or public place to the same condition in which it was prior to the excavation, the City may make the restoration, and the reasonable costs of making the restoration, including the cost of inspection, supervision, and administration, shall be paid by the franchisee.

(2) The cost of such removal or relocation of its facilities shall be paid by the franchisee, but when such removal or relocation is required for the exclusive convenience or benefit of any third person or instrumentality other than the City or another unit of government, franchisee may be entitled to reimbursement for the reasonable costs thereof from such person or instrumentality.

(2) Neither the grantee nor any other person may transfer the franchise without the prior consent by ordinance of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

Within 30 days of receiving a request for consent, the City shall, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the franchisee in writing of the additional information, if any, it requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee or new controlling party. If the City has not taken final action on the franchisee’s request for consent within 120 days after receiving such request, consent shall be deemed granted.

(4) The consent or approval of the City Council to any transfer of the franchise shall not constitute a waiver of release of the rights of the City in and to the streets and rights-of-way, and any transfer shall by its terms be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of this franchise.

(5) In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control of the franchise be approved without successor in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

(a) Compensation insurance in compliance with all worker’s compensation insurance and safety laws of the State of Oregon and amendments thereto; and

3.26.350 Bonds and other surety.
Except as expressly provided herein, franchisee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence at the time this franchise is granted. The City acknowledges that the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of franchisee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the City agrees to give the franchisee at least 90 days’ prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement and the amount. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the franchisee’s legal, financial, or technical qualifications that would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford compliance therewith. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.360 Remedies not exclusive – When requirement waived.
All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition, or obligation imposed upon the franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition, or obligation imposed upon the franchisee by, or pursuant to, this ordinance or acceptance of any payment due shall not be a waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition, or obligation itself. (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

3.26.370 Liquidated damages.
Subject to requirement of prior notice as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, for violations of this chapter occurring without just cause, City may, at its discretion and in addition to any other remedies provided herein, assess penalties against franchisee as follows:

(1) For failure to adhere to material provisions of this franchise, as defined in AMC 3.26.310(2), up to $200.00 per day for each provision not fulfilled, up to a maximum of $10,000.

(2) For failure to comply with any provision of this franchise other than subsection (1) of this section, up to $50.00 per day for each failure to fulfill franchise provision, up to a maximum of $3,000.

(3) Prior to imposing any penalty under this section, the City shall provide franchisee with written notice specifying the nature of the violation. Franchisee shall be subject to penalty if the violation is not remedied within 30 days of receipt of notice. If the violation cannot be satisfied within 30 days, franchisee shall notify the City of the expected date on which the violation will be remedied. This notice shall not provide franchisee with immunity from penalties under this section.

(4) Payment of liquidated damages does not preclude the City from terminating the franchise pursuant to AMC 3.26.310(2). (Ord. 5815 § 1, 2013).

(d) Prohibit any person from providing service for the benefit of a charitable, civic or benevolent activity. Merely operating as a nonprofit entity does not qualify under this exception.

Upon the giving of such notice of termination, the franchisee shall have a franchise which will terminate five years from the date of notice of termination.

(2) In the event the franchisee desires to terminate service given under the terms of this franchise, then it shall give not less than two years notice of the intent to terminate service and obligations under the franchise. In the event of a voluntary termination of service by the franchisee, the City shall have a right and option to purchase all of the equipment of the franchisee at a price which will be agreed upon between the parties.

(1) The street or road access is blocked and there is no alternate route; provided, that the City shall not be liable for any such blocking of access;

(2) Excessive weather conditions render providing service unduly hazardous to persons providing service or such termination is caused by accidents or casualties caused by an act of God or a public enemy;

(3) A customer has not paid for service provided after a regular billing and after a 15-day written notice to pay; or

(4) Ninety days’ written notice is given to the Council and to affected customers and written approval is obtained from the Council. (Ord. 4707 § 1, 1986; Ord. 4083 § 11, 1977).

3.28.120 Subcontracts.

(Ord. 4707 § 1, 1986; Ord. 4083 § 12, 1977).

3.28.130 Rates.

(c) To protect against injuries to users or collectors, to protect against damage and spilling during cold weather, all cans shall be rigid, rodentproof and fireproof.

(d) The user shall provide safe access to the pick-up point so as not to jeopardize the safety of the driver of a collection vehicle or the motoring public or to create a hazard or risk to the person providing service.

The user shall provide a safe alternative access point or system.

(2) To protect the privacy, safety, pets and security of customers and to prevent unnecessary physical and legal risk to the collectors, a residential customer shall place the container to be emptied outside of any locked or latched gate and outside of any garage or other building.

(3) No stationary compactor or other container for commercial or industrial use shall exceed the safe loading design limit or operation limit of the collection vehicles provided by the franchisee serving the service area.

Within 30 days of the termination of this franchise the Grantee shall pay a pro rata fee for the period from the end of the prior payment date to the date of termination in addition to any other sums due the City. Because of Grantee’s difficulty in calculating a franchise fee based on Grantee’s gross income, the per lineal foot fee is being used in this franchise. (Ord. 4972 § 1, 1991; Ord. 4821, 1988).

3.30.110 Term of franchise.

(3) The arbiters shall decide all matters in dispute within 90 days of the appointment of the third arbiter.

(4) The arbiters shall make their decision following a hearing wherein both of the parties hereto shall be permitted to submit such evidence and arguments as they deem appropriate to support their respective positions.

(5) The arbiters shall, by majority vote, make such procedural rules and determinations as may be necessary to fairly and expeditiously resolve all matters in dispute.

(6) In deciding the matters in dispute, the arbiters shall be guided by the following principles:

(a) The franchise fee should reflect both the economic burden that the Grantee’s franchise places upon the public way and the economic benefit that the Grantee derives from the franchise.

(b) In recognition of the changing and expanding nature of the telecommunications industry and technology, the parties agree that should the nature or extent of the Grantee’s business change during the term of this franchise, the franchise should be modified to mitigate, at the Grantee’s expense, any additional costs, damages, or difficulties experienced by the City or third parties located therein.

(c) The franchise should be modified, as needed, to keep current with the needs of the Grantee and the City. (Ord. 4972 § 1, 1991; Ord. 4821, 1988).

There is hereby granted by the City of Albany, hereinafter referred to as “City,” to AT&T Corp., authorized to conduct business in Oregon, their successors and assigns, hereinafter each referred to as “Franchisee,” the nonexclusive right and privilege to conduct business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 133.721(8) within the City and to place, erect, lay, maintain and operate in, upon, over and under streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds within the City, poles, wires and other appliances and conductors for all telephone, telegraph and other communication purposes unless otherwise regulated. Such wires and other appliances and conductors may be strung upon poles or other fixtures above ground, or at the option of the Franchisee, its successors and assigns, may be laid underground, and such other apparatus may be used as may be necessary to properly operate and maintain the same.

The scope of this grant allows the installation, maintenance and repair of telecommunications facilities by the Franchisee in the City’s rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services, Internet access services, and private line services through but not within the City. In the event the Franchisee intends to provide services other than telecommunication services, Internet services or private line services or intends to provide any of the services to or for customers within the City’s boundaries, Franchisee shall be required to obtain an additional or revised agreement from the City to the extent required by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of communications facilities within the public way as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. This franchise agreement anticipates 8,389 feet of cable and/or of conduit owned and maintained by Franchisee at $2.00 per foot resulting in an annual fee of $16,788. The fee shall be adjusted annually by the change in the Consumer Price Index Urban Consumers. The Franchisee agrees to provide a map documenting the location of the 8,389 feet of conduit.

Said work shall be done in compliance with State and Federal laws, as well as local rules, regulations, ordinances or orders, which may during the continuance of this franchise be adopted from time to time by the City. Franchisee shall obtain from the City all applicable permits, which will require plan submittal, approval, and the payment of fees before work begins. The Franchisee shall file with the City maps showing the location of any construction, extension, or relocation of any of the facilities of the Franchisee and shall obtain the City’s approval of the location and plans prior to the commencement of the work. All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the Franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, bridges, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets, bridges, or other public ways or places. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, highway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and tracks, or any other type of structures or improvements by the City. Unless approved by the City, no newly overlaid street or newly constructed street shall be excavated by the Franchisee for a period of five years from the time of completion of the street overlay or the street construction. In any such case, Franchisee shall be excused by the City from extending services if a practical alternate route cannot be found. When any excavation is made by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall promptly restore the affected portion of the street, bridge, easement area, or public place to the reasonably same conditions in which it was prior to the excavation. The restoration shall be done in compliance with City specifications, requirements, and regulations in effect at the time of such restoration. If the Franchisee fails to restore promptly the affected portion of the street, bridge, or public place to the same condition in which it was prior to the excavation, the City may make the restoration; and the reasonable costs of making the restoration, including the cost of inspection, supervision, and administration shall be paid by the Franchisee.

Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in a form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost of removal of any property of Franchisee. In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit the liability of the Franchisee for damages. The City, at its sole option, may waive this requirement, or permit the consolidation of the construction bond with the performance bond. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

The Franchisee shall furnish maps or drawings to the City or contractor, as the case may be, showing the approximate location of all its structures in the area involved in such proposed work.

(Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

If, at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the franchise territory, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers or other appurtenances to the system of the Franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done and any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Franchisee, at its sole expense; provided, that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of the City, in which case costs for repairs shall be borne by the City. The City shall hold the Franchisee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s cutting or moving of Franchisee’s facilities.

3.40.180 Forfeiture and remedies.
In addition to any other rights set out elsewhere in this franchise, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture of the franchise, and all of the Franchisee’s rights arising thereunder in the event that Franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise, including but not limited to failing to pay or any suspension of Franchisee’s payments of franchise fees to the City under this franchise, failure by Franchisee to submit timely reports regarding the calculation of its gross revenues-based franchise fees to the City, failure to maintain the liability insurance and/or bonds required under this franchise, or failure to comply with all other State, Federal or local laws as set forth in this franchise. In the event Franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise, the City shall provide written notice of default and shall allow 45 days for Franchisee to remedy the violation. Extraordinary events (earthquake, flood, fire) beyond the control of the Franchisee shall result in an additional 60 days to remedy the violation. All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5493, 2001; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

3.40.190 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise. All remaining provisions of this franchise shall then continue in full force and effect. If any provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope and breadth, such provisions shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope and breadth permitted by law. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

3.40.200 Attorneys’ fees and jurisdiction.
In the event an attorney is employed to enforce the provisions of this franchise (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings affecting creditors’ rights generally), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred, irrespective of whether any legal proceeding is commenced. If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought to construe, interpret or enforce the terms of this franchise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith, both at trial and on any appeal therefrom or petitions for review thereof. Such sum shall include an amount estimated by the court as the reasonable costs and fees to be incurred by the prevailing party in collecting any monetary judgment or award or otherwise in enforcing any order, judgment or decree entered in such suit, action or other proceeding. Jurisdiction for all litigation will rest exclusively with the courts of the State of Oregon with venue in Linn County. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

3.40.210 Successors and assigns.
This franchise is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Franchisee, however, shall not make any assignment without the written consent of the City, and any assignment made without the City’s consent shall be null and void. The City will not unreasonably withhold approval of an assignment. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5493, 2001; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

3.40.220 Franchise nonexclusive.
This franchise is not exclusive and shall not be construed as a limitation on the City in granting rights, privileges and authority to other persons similar to, or different from, those granted by this chapter, or in constructing, installing, maintaining or operating any City-owned public utility. In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than Franchisee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of conducting business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 133.721(8) within the City, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, insofar as this is not in conflict with rules of government, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. (Ord. 5838 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5471 § 1, 2001).

3.50.010 Franchise granted.
There is hereby granted by the City of Albany, hereinafter referred to as “City”, to MCI Worldcom, authorized to conduct business in Oregon, their successors and assigns, hereinafter each referred to as “Franchisee”, the nonexclusive right and privilege to conduct business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 133.721(8) within the City and to place, erect, lay, maintain and operate in, upon, over and under streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds within the City, poles, wires and other appliances and conductors for all telephone, telegraph and other communication purposes. Such wires and other appliances and conductors may be strung upon poles or other fixtures above ground, or at the option of the Franchisee, its successors and assigns, may be laid underground, and such other apparatus may be used as may be necessary to properly operate and maintain the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of communications facilities within the public way as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. This franchise agreement anticipates 7,623 feet of cable and/or of conduit owned and maintained by Franchisee at $2.00 per foot resulting in an annual fee of $15,246. The Franchisee agrees to provide a map documenting the location of the 7,623 feet of conduit. By executing this agreement, Franchisee does not waive or otherwise release its right to institute a legal proceeding to seek relief from any provision that does not comply with state or federal law. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.020 Excavations and construction.
It shall be lawful for Franchisee, to make all needful excavations in any of such streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds in the City for the purpose of placing, erecting, laying and maintaining poles, or other supports or conduits for said wires and appliances and auxiliary apparatus or repairing, renewing or replacing the same. Said work shall be done in compliance with state and federal laws, as well as local rules, regulations, ordinances or orders, which may during the continuance of this franchise be adopted from time to time by the City. Franchisee shall obtain from the City all applicable permits, which will require plan submittal, approval, and the payment of fees before work begins. The Franchisee shall file with the City maps showing the location of any construction, extension, or relocation or any of the facilities of the Franchisee and shall obtain the City’s approval of the location and plans prior to the commencement of the work. All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the Franchisee within the City shall be so located as to not cause interference with the proper use of streets, bridges, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets, bridges, or other public ways or places. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation, highway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and tracks, or any other type of structures or improvements by the City. Unless approved by the City no newly overlaid street or newly constructed street shall be excavated by the Franchisee for a period of five years from the time of completion of the street overlay or the street construction. In any such case, the City will work with the Franchisee to identify potential alternate routes to avoid the recently overlaid or constructed streets. When any excavation is made by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall promptly restore the affected portion of the street, bridge, easement area, or public place to the reasonably same conditions in which it was prior to the excavation. The restoration shall be done in compliance with City specifications, requirements, and regulations in effect at the time of such restoration. If the Franchisee fails to restore promptly the affected portion of the street, bridge, or public place to the same condition in which it was prior to the excavation, the City may make the restoration; and the reasonable costs of making the restoration, including the cost of inspection, supervision, and administration shall be paid by the Franchisee. (Ord. 5703 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.030 Tree trimming.
Franchisee may trim trees when necessary in public rights-of-way for the operation of the lines, wires, cables and antennas or other appurtenances, provided such trimming shall be done by competent employees, agents, or contractors. Said tree trimming shall be allowed only after Franchisee makes application and a written permit is approved by the City Manager of the City of Albany or any person appointed by the City Manager to exercise this function. Tree trimming shall be performed in accordance with City ordinances. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.040 Use of poles.
On a nonpreferential basis, the City reserves to itself the right at any time to use the poles and other installations of the Franchisee erected or installed under the authority granted in this chapter for any City-owned facilities of whatsoever nature, but it is agreed that such use shall not interfere with the Franchisee’s use thereof. Franchisee shall not be required to own or operate any facilities the City is using if the Franchisee ceases to have a need therefor. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.050 Construction and performance bond – Liability insurance.
Prior to the commencement of any construction work by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall file both a construction and performance bond in an amount approved by the City in favor of the City and any other person who may suffer damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the Franchisee assured by such bond. Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in a form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost of removal of any property of Franchisee. In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit the liability of the Franchisee for damages. The City, at its sole option, may waive this requirement, or permit the consolidation of the construction bond with the performance bond. The Franchisee, pursuant to this chapter, shall also maintain in full force and effect public liability insurance in an amount specified by the City sufficient to cover potential claims for bodily injury, death or disability and for property damage, which may arise from or be related to projects and activities of the Franchisee in connection with this franchise, naming the City, agents and employees as an additional insured. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.060 Notice of additions.
Franchisee shall notify the City of any desired additions to cable plant with estimates of total additional footage. Upon approval and completion of any addition, Franchisee shall remit to the City a fee equal to the then current per-foot franchise charge, prorated from the completion date to the ending date of the then current paid period. The following year’s annual fee shall be calculated to include this additional footage. All fees are due and payable upon completion of physical construction and are not dependent upon the Franchisee actually using the media to provide services. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.070 Street repair – Expense responsibility.
Whenever Franchisee shall disturb any of the streets for the purpose aforesaid, it or they shall restore the same to good order and condition as soon as practicable without unnecessary delay, and failing to do so, the City shall have the right to fix a reasonable time within which such repairs and restoration of streets shall be completed, and upon failure of such repairs being made by said company, its successors and assigns, the City shall cause such repairs to be made at the expense of Franchisee. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.080 Improvements – Utility obstruction prohibited.
The City reserves the right to construct, install, maintain, and operate any public improvement, work or facility, to do any work that the City may find desirable on, over, or under any street, bridge or public place, and to vacate, alter or close any street, bridge or public place. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in any way to prevent the proper authorities of the City from sewering (sanitary and storm), providing water service, grading, planking, rocking, paving, repairing, altering, or improving any of the streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares, and public highways, places and grounds within the City in or upon which the poles, wires or other conductors of Franchisee shall be placed. All such work or improvements shall be done if possible so as not to obstruct or prevent the free use of said poles, wires, conductors, conduits, pipes, or other apparatus. The moving of the Franchisee’s facilities, where required due to such work by the City, will be done by Franchisee without cost to the City. The Franchisee shall furnish maps or drawings to the City or contractor, as the case may be, showing the approximate location of all its structures in the area involved in such proposed work. Any such work done for or at the request of a private individual, entity, developer or development shall be done at the expense of such private individual, entity, developer or development. (Ord. 5703 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.090 Emergency removal and alternate routing of facilities.
If, at any time, in case of fire or disaster in the franchise territory, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cable, amplifiers or other appurtenances to the system of the Franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done. Any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Franchisee, at its sole expense, provided that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of the City, in which case costs for repairs shall be borne by the City. The City shall hold the Franchisee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s cutting or moving of Franchisee’s facilities. In the event continued use of any street is denied to the Franchisee by the City for any reason, the Franchisee shall provide service to affected subscribers over such alternate routes as shall be determined by Franchisee within a reasonable period of time. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.100 Cables, wires – Rearrangement – Notice.
Whenever it becomes necessary to temporarily rearrange, remove, lower or raise the aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee to permit the passage of any building, machinery or other object, the said Franchisee will perform such rearrangement within a reasonable period after written notice from the person or persons desiring to move said building, machinery or other objects. Said notice shall bear the approval of such official as Council may designate, shall detail the route of movement of the building, machinery or other objects, shall provide that the costs of such re-arrangement shall be borne by the person or persons giving said notice and shall further provide that the person or persons giving said notice will indemnify and save Franchisee harmless of and from any and all damages or claims of whatsoever kind or nature caused directly or indirectly from such temporary rearrangement of the aerial plant of the Franchisee, and, if required by Franchisee, shall be accompanied by a cash deposit or a good and sufficient bond to pay any and all costs as estimated by Franchisee. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.110 Compliance with laws, rules and regulations.
At all times during the term of this franchise, Franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the United States of America, the State of Oregon, and the City of Albany, including all agencies and subdivisions thereof. Franchisee shall be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City of Albany and to such reasonable regulations of general applicability as the City may from time to time hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide insofar as such regulations or ordinances do not materially alter or impair the rights and obligations of Franchisee and are adopted pursuant to the lawful police power of the City. No provision of this franchise shall be construed as a waiver of local, state or federal law, or as a limit of liability. Franchisee shall at all times keep and maintain all of its poles, fixtures, conduits, wires, and its entire system in good state of repair and shall at all times conduct its operations under this franchise, including installation, construction or maintenance of its facilities, in a safe and workmanlike manner so as not to present a danger to the public or the City. The location, construction, extension, installation, maintenance, removal and relocation of the facilities of the Franchisee shall conform to the requirements of the state and federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto in force at the time of such work, and such reasonable specifications in force at the time of such work, as the City may from time to time adopt. All installations, re-arrangements, removals, lowering or raising of aerial cables or wiring or other apparatus shall be done in conformance with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code, the laws of the State of Oregon and the ordinances of the City. The City may provide such specifications relating thereto as may be necessary or convenient for public safety or the orderly development of the City. The City may amend and add to such specifications from time to time. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.140 Other fees and charges.
Nothing in this chapter shall give the Franchisee any credit against any nondiscriminatory business tax to the extent such tax applies to revenues other than those revenues that are the subject of the franchise fee, or any ad valorem property tax now or hereafter levied against real property or personal property within the City, or against any local improvement assessments levied on the Franchisee’s property. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

No interest shall be due with respect to annexation by the City for which notice was not provided to Franchisee pursuant to the provision of ORS 222.005. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be a waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5494 § 1, 2001).

3.50.190 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise.

(Ord. 5522 § 1, 2002).

3.60.160 Indemnification.
The Franchisee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its agents, officers and employees from any and all claims, demands, and damages of any kind, including attorney’s fees which may arise, from any negligent act or omissions of the Franchisee, its agents, officers or employees, in connection with the Franchisee’s operations pursuant to this franchise.

All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity.

A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5522 § 1, 2002).

3.60.190 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise. All remaining provisions of this franchise shall then continue in full force and effect. If any provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope and breadth, such provisions shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope and breadth permitted by law. (Ord. 5522 § 1, 2002).

3.60.200 Attorneys’ fees.
In the event an attorney is employed to enforce the provisions of this franchise (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings affecting creditors rights generally), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred, irrespective of whether any legal proceedings is commenced. If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought to construe, interpret or enforce the terms of this franchise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith, both at trial and on any appeal therefrom or petitions for review thereof. Such sum shall include an amount estimated by the court as the reasonable costs and fees to be incurred by the prevailing party in collecting any monetary judgment or award or otherwise in enforcing any order, judgment or decree entered in such suit, action or other proceeding. (Ord. 5522 § 1, 2002).

3.60.210 Successors and assigns.
This franchise is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Franchisee, however, shall not make any assignment without the written consent of the City, and any assignment made without the City’s consent shall be null and void. (Ord. 5522 § 1, 2002).

This franchise is not exclusive and shall not be construed as a limitation on the City in granting rights, privileges and authority to other persons similar to, or different from, those granted by this chapter, or in constructing, installing, maintaining or operating any City-owned public utility.

Prior to the commencement of any construction work by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall file both a construction and performance bond in an amount approved by the City in favor of the City and any other person who may suffer damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the Franchisee assured by such bond. Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in a form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost of removal of any property of Franchisee. In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit the liability of the Franchisee for damages. The City, at its sole option, may waive this requirement, or permit the consolidation of the construction bond with the performance bond. The Franchisee, pursuant to this chapter, shall also maintain in full force and effect public liability insurance in an amount specified by the City; see AMC 3.70.160. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.060 Street repair – Expense responsibility.
Whenever Franchisee shall disturb any of the streets for the purpose aforesaid, it or they shall restore the same to good order and condition in accordance with the City of Albany Standard Construction Specifications and the permit issued for the work as soon as practicable without unnecessary delay, and failing to do so, the City shall have the right to fix a reasonable time within which such repairs and restoration of streets shall be completed, and upon failure of such repairs being made by said company, its successors and assigns, the City shall cause such repairs to be made at the expense of Franchisee. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.070).

3.70.070 Improvements – Utility obstruction prohibited.
The City reserves the right to construct, install, maintain, and operate any public improvement, work or facility, to do any work that the City may find desirable on, over, or under any street, bridge or public place, and to vacate, alter or close any street, bridge or public place. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in any way to prevent the proper authorities of the City from sewering (sanitary and storm), providing water service, grading, planking, rocking, paving, repairing, altering, or improving any of the streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares, and public highways, places and grounds within the City in or upon which the poles, wires or other conductors of Franchisee shall be placed, but all such work or improvements shall be done if possible so as not to obstruct or prevent the free use of said poles, wires, conductors, conduits, pipes, or other apparatus, and the moving of company facilities, where required due to such work by the City, will be done by Franchisee within 120 days of notice by the City without cost to the City. The Franchisee shall furnish maps or drawings to the City or contractor, as the case may be, showing the approximate location of all its structures in the area involved in such proposed work. Any such work done for or at the request of a private individual, entity, developer or development shall be done at the expense of such private individual, entity, developer or development. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.080).

3.70.080 Emergency removal and alternate routing of facilities.
If, at any time, in case of fire, disaster, or other threat to public safety in the franchise territory, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers or other appurtenances to the system of the Franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done. Any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Franchisee, at its sole expense; provided, that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of the City, in which case costs for repairs shall be borne by the City. The City shall hold the Franchisee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s cutting or moving of Franchisee’s facilities. In the event continued use of any street is denied to the Franchisee by the City for any reason, the Franchisee shall provide service to affected subscribers over such alternate routes as shall be determined by Franchisee within a reasonable period of time. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.090).

3.70.090 Cables, wires – Rearrangement – Notice.
Whenever the City determines that the public interest requires that it is necessary to rearrange, remove, lower or raise the aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee to permit the passage of any building, machinery or other object, or to widen/realign City streets, or to make any other alteration or improvement which will require rearrangement of Franchisee’s facilities or equipment, the said Franchisee will perform such rearrangement within a reasonable period after written notice from the City. Said notice shall bear the approval of such official as Council may designate and shall provide that the costs of such rearrangement shall be borne by any third persons whose activities create the need for rearrangement except that a request by the City of Albany, on behalf of itself or any other unit of government, to rearrange aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee shall be accomplished by the Franchisee within 120 days at no cost to the City. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.100).

3.70.100 Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.
At all times during the term of this franchise, Franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the United States of America, the State of Oregon, and the City of Albany, including all agencies and subdivisions thereof. Franchisee shall be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City of Albany and to such reasonable regulations of general applicability as the City may from time to time hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide insofar as such regulations or ordinances do not materially alter or impair the rights and obligations of Franchisee and are adopted pursuant to the lawful police power of the City. No provision of this franchise shall be construed as a waiver of local, State or Federal law, or as a limit of liability. Franchisee shall at all times keep and maintain all of its poles, fixtures, conduits, wires, and its entire system in good state of repair and shall at all times conduct its operations under this franchise, including installation, construction or maintenance of its facilities, in a safe and workmanlike manner so as not to present a danger to the public or the City. The location, construction, extension, installation, maintenance, removal and relocation of the facilities of the Franchisee shall conform to the requirements of the State and Federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto in force at the time of such work, and such reasonable specifications in force at the time of such work, as the City may from time to time adopt. All installations, rearrangements, removals, lowering or raising of aerial cables or wiring or other apparatus shall be done in conformance with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code, the laws of the State of Oregon and the ordinances of the City. The City may provide such specifications relating thereto as may be necessary or convenient for public safety or the orderly development of the City. The City may amend and add to such specifications from time to time. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.110).

3.70.110 Sale of subscriber lists prohibited.
The Franchisee shall not sell, or otherwise make available any list which identifies subscribers by name or address, to any person, agency or entity, except as needed to maintain current services or implement new services to subscribers in connection with Franchisee’s services. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.120).

3.70.120 Payment.
(1) Effective August 13, 2014, and until the franchise’s expiration, which is set as August 13, 2024, said Franchisee shall pay to the City quarterly as specified below, seven percent of gross revenues derived within the corporate limits of the City. A minimum fee of $750.00 per quarter will be due the City for administration of this agreement and for use of the City’s right-of-way unless the seven percent of gross revenue exceeds the $750.00 fee, then the greater amount will be due the City. The minimum fee amount shall be adjusted annually by the change in the Engineering News-Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (Seattle). The adjustment will only apply to the flat minimum fee amount. This franchise fee shall be deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Finance Director of the City and postmarked on or before the last business day of the quarter that said revenue was received by the Franchisee.

(a) Payment of Franchise Fees. Payments due under this provision shall be computed and paid quarterly for the preceding quarter, as of March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st, each quarterly payment due and payable no later than 45 days after such dates.

(2) If a payment is not mailed or sent electronically within 45 days of the due date set forth above, the payment shall be deemed delinquent and shall accrue a late fee of nine percent interest per annum until collected. Payments made by Franchisee will be accepted by the City from the Franchisee, in payment of any separate permit fees that are imposed by the City on Franchisee for street openings, construction or inspection or maintenance of fixtures or facilities. However, Franchisee shall not deduct charges and penalties imposed by the City for noncompliance with charter provisions, ordinances, resolutions, or permit conditions from the franchise fee required by this chapter.

(3) “Gross revenues” mean any revenue derived by the Grantee from the operation of the system in the service area, following generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), consistent with Federal and State law. However, such phrase shall not include: (1) any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability collected by the Franchisee from customers for pass-through to a government agency, including the Federal Communications Commission user fee; (2) unrecovered bad debt; (3) advertising agency commissions and launch fees to the extent consistent with GAAP, and (4) franchise fees and any public, education and government (PEG) amounts received from customers. Grantee shall report gross revenues to the City using the accrual method of accounting, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Nothing in this section shall impair the City’s ability to challenge Grantee’s interpretation of GAAP. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.130).

3.70.130 Abandonment.
If the Franchisee goes out of business or withdraws service from the area and as a consequence refuses to renew the agreement, all rights to the use of the connection media revert to the City who may sell, lease or otherwise use the connection media at its sole discretion. The connection media shall be left in working order and not be intentionally cut or destroyed. The City may require the media be removed from all poles and underground conduits by the former Franchisee at its own expense. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.135).

3.70.140 Other fees and charges.
Nothing in this chapter shall give the Franchisee any credit against any nondiscriminatory business tax to the extent such tax applies to revenues other than those revenues that are the subject of the franchise fee, or any ad valorem property tax now or hereafter levied against real property or personal property within the City, or against any local improvement assessments levied on the Franchisee’s property. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.150 Reporting of funds.
With each franchise fee payment, the Franchisee shall furnish a sworn statement or declaration under oath from the Chief Finance Officer or designee, setting forth the amount and calculation of the payment. The statement shall detail the calculation of the franchise fee paid, and shall specify the nature and amount of all exclusions and deductions from such revenue claimed by the Franchisee in calculating the franchise fee. The City Manager of the City may require the Franchisee to provide any additional information reasonably necessary for administration of the franchise fee. The Franchisee shall keep available and open to inspection by the City Manager of the City, all accounts, books, and other records reasonably necessary for ascertaining the franchise liability. Franchisee shall provide any additional information requested by the City within 48 hours of any such request delivered to Franchisee, to be produced at Albany City Hall, office of the City Manager, during regular office hours. In the event that an audit of the franchise fee payments results in a determination that an additional payment is due to the City, such additional payment shall be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date the original payment was due. If the additional payment amount exceeds five percent of the amount reported, Franchisee shall reimburse City for all audit costs. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.160 Indemnification and insurance requirements.
Franchisee shall defend, save harmless, and indemnify the City from any loss or claim against the City on account of, or in connection with, any activity of Franchisee in the construction, operation, or maintenance of its technical facilities and systems services. The Franchisee will not be required to indemnify the City for the negligent or intentional acts of the City or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees.

The Franchisee shall, for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, prior to commencing construction of any kind, have in full force and effect, and file and maintain during the term of the franchise certificate of insurance evidence thereto with the City Recorder, good and sufficient policies covering:

(1) Workers’ compensation insurance as required by the State of Oregon including employers’ liability with limits not less than $1,000,000; Franchisee shall ensure that each of its subcontractors complies with these same requirements and shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City; and

(2) Commercial general liability insurance with limits of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 general aggregate, with the aggregate on a per-project basis; and

(3) Business automobile liability insurance, for any owned, hired or non-owned vehicles used in the performance of this agreement with combined single limits of $5,000,000 each accident; and

(4) Pollution liability insurance with limits of $5,000,000 each incident and in the aggregate. If policy is on a “claims made” basis it must provide a 24-month tail or reporting period.

The City of Albany, its officers, agents, and employees, shall be named an additional insured in said policy for losses caused in whole or in part by reason of the exercise of the rights and privileges herein granted.

Upon any material alteration or cancellation of any of the coverage, the Franchisee shall give the City notice as allowed per insured’s insurance policy in advance of the effective date of the alteration or cancellation of the coverage.

Each policy, commercial general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation, shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City.

The insurance policy limits required in this section may be satisfied by provider through a combination of the underlying insurance policy and umbrella (excess) liability policy(ies) so long as said umbrella policies are, at a minimum, “follow form” and provide insurance equal to or greater than coverage afforded by the underlying liability policy(ies). (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.170 Term and negotiation.
The rights, privileges and franchise herein granted shall continue and be in force until August 13, 2024. Upon a material change in technology, either party may provide six months’ notice, in writing, to renegotiate this agreement. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.180 Forfeiture and remedies.
In addition to any other rights set out elsewhere in this franchise, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture of the franchise, subject to 45-day right to cure, and all of the Franchisee’s rights arising thereunder in the event that Franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise, including but not limited to failing to pay or any suspension of Franchisee’s payments of franchise fees to the City under this franchise, failure by Franchisee to submit timely reports regarding the calculation of its gross revenues-based franchise fees to the City, failure to maintain the liability insurance and/or bonds required under this Franchise, or failure to comply with all other State, Federal or local laws as set forth in this franchise. All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.190 Bonds and other surety.
Except as expressly provided herein, Franchisee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence at the time this franchise is granted. The City acknowledges that the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of Franchisee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the City agrees to give the Franchisee at least 90 days’ prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement and the amount. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the Franchisee’s legal, financial, or technical qualifications that would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford compliance therewith. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014).

3.70.195 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise. All remaining provisions of this franchise shall then continue in full force and effect. If any provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope and breadth, such provisions shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope and breadth permitted by law. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006. Formerly 3.70.190).

3.70.200 Attorneys’ fees and jurisdiction.
In the event an attorney is employed to enforce the provisions of this franchise (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings affecting creditors’ rights generally), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred, irrespective of whether any legal proceeding is commenced. If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought to construe, interpret or enforce the terms of this franchise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith, both at trial and on any appeal therefrom or petitions for review thereof. Such sum shall include an amount estimated by the court as the reasonable costs and fees to be incurred by the prevailing party in collecting any monetary judgment or award or otherwise in enforcing any order, judgment or decree entered in such suit, action or other proceeding. Jurisdiction for all litigation will rest exclusively with the courts of the State of Oregon with venue in Linn County. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.210 Successors and assigns.
This franchise is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Franchisee, however, shall not make any assignment without the written consent of the City, and any assignment made without the City’s consent shall be null and void. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.70.220 Franchise nonexclusive.
This franchise is not exclusive and shall not be construed as a limitation on the City in granting rights, privileges and authority to other persons similar to, or different from, those granted by this chapter, or in constructing, installing, maintaining or operating any City-owned public utility. In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than Franchisee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of conducting business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 759.005(1) within the City, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, insofar as this is not in conflict with rules of government, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. (Ord. 5839 § 1, 2014; Ord. 5652 § 1, 2006).

3.80.010 Franchise granted.
There is hereby granted by the City of Albany, hereinafter referred to as “City,” to Astound Broadband, LLC, hereinafter referred to as “Astound,” a Washington limited liability company authorized to conduct business in Oregon, their successors and assigns, hereinafter each referred to as “Franchisee,” the nonexclusive right and privilege to provide telecommunications service (as defined in ORS 759.005(8)), private telecommunication network (as defined in ORS 759.005(4)) service, and Internet access service (as defined in ORS 305.822(1)(b)) within the City and to place, erect, lay, maintain and operate in, upon, over and under streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds within the City (collectively, “public ways”), poles, wires, conduits, cabinets, appurtenances, and other appliances and conductors (collectively, “facilities”) for all communication purposes. Such facilities may be strung upon poles or other fixtures above ground, or at the option of the Franchisee, its successors and assigns, may be laid underground, and such other apparatus may be used as may be necessary to properly operate and maintain the same unless otherwise regulated.

The scope of this grant allows the installation, maintenance and repair of telecommunications facilities by the Franchisee in the City’s rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services, Internet access services, and private line services. In the event the Franchisee intends to provide cable services/system (shall have the meaning specified in the definition of “cable system” in 602(6) of the Cable Communication Policy Act of 1984), Franchisee shall be required to obtain an additional or revised franchise from the City to the extent required by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of communications facilities within the public way as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.020 Excavations and construction.
It shall be lawful for Franchisee to make all needful excavations in any of such streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds in the City for the purpose of placing, erecting, laying and maintaining poles, or other supports or conduits for said wires and appliances and auxiliary apparatus or repairing, renewing or replacing the same. Said work shall be done in compliance with State and Federal laws, as well as local rules, regulations, ordinances or orders, which may during the continuance of this franchise be adopted from time to time by the City. Franchisee shall obtain from the City all applicable permits, which will require plan submittal, approval, and the payment of fees before work begins. The Franchisee shall file with the City maps showing the location of any construction, extension, or relocation of any of the facilities of the Franchisee and shall obtain the City’s approval of the location and plans prior to the commencement of the work. All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the Franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of public ways, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets, bridges, or other public ways or places. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of traffic conditions or public safety in a timely manner in order to protect the public. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of street vacation, highway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and tracks, or any other type of structures or improvements by the City. This work shall be completed within 120 days of notice from the City. Unless approved by the City, no newly overlaid street or newly constructed street shall be excavated by the Franchisee for a period of five years from the time of completion of the street overlay or the street construction. In any such case, Franchisee shall be excused by the City from extending services if a practical alternate route cannot be found. When any excavation is made by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall promptly restore the affected portion of the street, bridge, easement area, or public place to the reasonably same conditions in which it was prior to the excavation. The restoration shall be done in compliance with City specifications, requirements, and regulations in effect at the time of such restoration. If the Franchisee fails to restore promptly the affected portion of the street, bridge, or public place to the same condition in which it was prior to the excavation, the City may make the restoration; and the reasonable costs of making the restoration, including the cost of inspection, supervision, and administration shall be paid by the Franchisee. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.030 Tree trimming.
Subject to the provisions of this chapter, Franchisee may trim trees when necessary in public rights-of-way for the operation of the lines, wires, cables and antennas or other appurtenances, provided such trimming shall be done by competent employees, agents, or contractors; and it shall be done without cost or expense to the City.

Said tree trimming shall be allowed only after Franchisee makes application and a written permit is approved by the City Manager of the City of Albany or any person appointed by the City Manager to exercise this function. Tree trimming and applications therefor shall be in accordance with City ordinances, and in the absence of any specific ordinance requirement, subject to such terms as the City shall reasonably require for such purposes. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.040 Use of poles.
The City reserves to itself the right at any time to use the poles and other installations of the Franchisee erected or installed under the authority granted in this chapter for any City-owned facilities of whatsoever nature, but it is agreed that such use shall not interfere with the Franchisee’s use thereof. Franchisee shall not be required to own or operate any facilities the City is using if the Franchisee ceases to have a need therefor. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.050 Construction and performance bond.
Prior to the commencement of any construction work by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall file both a construction and performance bond in an amount approved by the City in favor of the City and any other person who may suffer damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the Franchisee assured by such bond. Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in a form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost of removal of any property of Franchisee. In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit the liability of the Franchisee for damages. The City, at its sole option, may waive this requirement, or permit the consolidation of the construction bond with the performance bond. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.070 Street repair – Expense responsibility.
Whenever Franchisee shall disturb any of the streets for the purpose aforesaid, it or they shall restore the same to good order and condition in accordance with the City of Albany Standard Construction Specifications and the permit issued for the work as soon as practicable without unnecessary delay, and failing to do so, the City shall have the right to fix a reasonable time within which such repairs and restoration of streets shall be completed, and upon failure of such repairs being made by said company, its successors and assigns, the City shall cause such repairs to be made at the expense of Franchisee. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.080 Improvements – Utility obstruction prohibited.
The City reserves the right to construct, install, maintain, and operate any public improvement, work or facility, to do any work that the City may find desirable on, over, or under any street, bridge or public place, and to vacate, alter or close any street, bridge or public place. If City vacates any portion of the public way containing facilities, City shall reserve an appurtenant easement for public utilities within that vacated portion within which Franchisee may continue to operate existing facilities under the terms of this franchise for at least the remaining term as set forth in AMC 3.80.170. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in any way to prevent the proper authorities of the City from sewering (sanitary and storm), providing water service, grading, planking, rocking, paving, repairing, altering, or improving any of the streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares, and public highways, places and grounds within the City in or upon which the poles, wires or other conductors of Franchisee shall be placed, but all such work or improvements shall be done if possible so as not to obstruct or prevent the free use of said poles, wires, conductors, conduits, pipes, or other apparatus, and the moving of company facilities, where required due to such work by the City, will be done by Franchisee within 120 days of notice by the City without cost to the City. The Franchisee shall furnish maps or drawings to the City or contractor, as the case may be, showing the approximate location of all its structures in the area involved in such proposed work. Any such work done for or at the request of a private individual, entity, developer or development shall be done at the expense of such private individual, entity, developer or development. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.090 Emergency removal and alternate routing of facilities.
If, at any time, in case of fire, disaster, or other imminent threat to public safety in the franchise territory, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers or other appurtenances to the system of the Franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done in a manner that minimizes disruption to Franchisee’s services and facilities, and City shall provide prompt notice to Franchisee. Any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Franchisee, at its sole expense; provided, that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of the City, in which case costs for repairs shall be borne by the City. The City shall hold the Franchisee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s cutting or moving of Franchisee’s facilities. In the event continued use of any street is denied to the Franchisee by the City for any reason, the Franchisee shall provide service to affected subscribers over such alternate routes as shall be determined by Franchisee within a reasonable period of time. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.100 Cables, wires – Rearrangement – Notice.
Whenever the City reasonably determines that the public interest requires that it is necessary to rearrange, remove, lower or raise the aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee to permit the passage of any building, machinery or other object, or to widen/realign City streets, or to make any other alteration or improvement which will require rearrangement of Franchisee’s facilities or equipment, the said Franchisee will perform such rearrangement within a reasonable period after written notice from the City. Said notice shall bear the approval of such official as Council may designate and shall provide that the costs of such rearrangement shall be borne by any third persons whose activities create the need for rearrangement except that a request by the City of Albany, on behalf of itself or any other unit of government, to rearrange aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee shall be accomplished by the Franchisee within 120 days at no cost to the City. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.110 Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.
At all times during the term of this franchise, Franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the United States of America, the State of Oregon, and the City of Albany, including all agencies and subdivisions thereof. Franchisee shall be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City of Albany and to such reasonable regulations of general applicability as the City may from time to time hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide insofar as such regulations or ordinances do not materially alter or impair the rights and obligations of Franchisee and are adopted pursuant to the lawful police power of the City, and are adopted and enforced in a reasonable, uniform, and nondiscriminatory manner. No provision of this franchise shall be construed as a waiver of local, State or Federal law, or as a limit of liability. Franchisee shall at all times keep and maintain all of its poles, fixtures, conduits, wires, and its entire system in good state of repair and shall at all times conduct its operations under this franchise, including installation, construction or maintenance of its facilities, in a safe and workmanlike manner so as not to present a danger to the public or the City. The location, construction, extension, installation, maintenance, removal and relocation of the facilities of the Franchisee shall conform to the requirements of the State and Federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto in force at the time of such work, and such reasonable specifications in force at the time of such work, as the City may from time to time adopt. All installations, rearrangements, removals, lowering or raising of aerial cables or wiring or other apparatus shall be done in conformance with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code, the laws of the State of Oregon and the ordinances of the City. The City may provide such specifications relating thereto as may be necessary or convenient for public safety or the orderly development of the City. The City may amend and add to such specifications from time to time. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.120 Sale of subscriber lists prohibited.
Except as otherwise expressly permitted by law, the Franchisee shall not sell, or otherwise make available any list which identifies subscribers by name or address, to any person, agency or entity, except as needed to maintain current services or implement new services to subscribers in connection with Franchisee’s services. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.130 Payment.
Effective on the date when Franchisee begins construction of facilities in the City, and until the franchise’s expiration as provided in AMC 3.80.170, Franchisee shall pay to the City monthly the greater of: (a) seven percent of gross revenues collected by Franchisee and derived from Franchisee’s provision of all services authorized and delivered pursuant to this agreement within the corporate limits of the City or (b) a minimum fee of $750.00 per month will be due the City for administration of this agreement and for use of the City’s right-of-way. If the seven percent of gross revenues exceeds the minimum fee each month, then the greater amount will be due the City. In lieu of all or part of the franchise fees required under this section, Franchisee may, with the consent of the City, provide to the City in-kind services with a value equal to or greater than the franchise fees, or portion of franchise fees, that the in-kind services replace. The value of in-kind services will be determined based upon the standard rates Franchisee charges to third parties for substantially equivalent services.

Commencing on March 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, the minimum franchise fee (the “fee”) will be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index, published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, as reported each January (“CPI”). The CPI adjustment will be based on the increase in the CPI, if any, computed by reference to the schedule entitled “CPI-U, U.S. City Average, Portland-Salem, All Items, 1982-84 = 100” and calculated using the following formula: new year fee = (prior year fee) x (CPI) + (prior year fee); provided, however, in no event will the increase in the fee exceed five percent in one year. In the event the CPI is converted to a different standard reference base or otherwise revised, the determination of the fee will be made with the use of such conversion factor, formula or table for converting the CPI as may be published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; or if the Bureau should fail to publish same, then with the use of such conversion factor, formula or table for converting the CPI as may be published by Prentice Hall, Inc., Commerce Clearinghouse or any other nationally recognized publisher of similar statistical information. If the CPI ceases to be published and there is no successor thereto, such other index as the parties may agree in writing will be substituted for the CPI. This franchise fee shall be deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Finance Director of the City and postmarked on or before the last business day of the month following the month revenues were received by the Franchisee. If a payment is not mailed by the date set forth above, the payment shall be deemed delinquent and shall accrue interest at a rate of nine percent per year. Payments made by Franchisee will be accepted by the City from the Franchisee, in payment of any separate permit fees that are imposed by the City on Franchisee for street openings, construction or inspection or maintenance of fixtures or facilities. However, Franchisee shall not deduct charges and penalties imposed by the City for noncompliance with charter provisions, ordinances, resolutions, or permit conditions from the franchise fee required by this chapter. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.135 Abandonment.
If the Franchisee goes out of business or withdraws service from the area and as a consequence refuses to renew the agreement, all rights to the use of the connection media revert to the City who may sell, lease or otherwise use the connection media at its sole discretion. The connection media shall be left in working order and not be intentionally cut or destroyed. The City may require the media be removed from all poles and underground conduits by the former Franchisee at its own expense. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.140 Other fees and charges.
Nothing in this chapter shall give the Franchisee any credit against any uniform, nondiscriminatory business tax to the extent such tax applies to revenues other than those revenues that are the subject of the franchise fee, or any ad valorem property tax now or hereafter levied against real property or personal property within the City, or against any local improvement assessments levied on the Franchisee’s property. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.150 Reporting of funds.
With each franchise fee payment, the Franchisee shall furnish a sworn statement or declaration under oath from the Chief Finance Officer or designee, setting forth the amount and calculation of the payment. The statement shall detail the gross linear feet of cable which exists within the Albany City limits and the calculation of the franchise fee paid, and shall specify the nature and amount of all exclusions and deductions from such revenue claimed by the Franchisee in calculating the franchise fee. The City Manager of the City may require the Franchisee to provide any additional information reasonably necessary for administration of the franchise fee. The Franchisee shall keep available and open to inspection by the City Manager of the City, all accounts, books, and other records reasonably necessary for ascertaining the franchise liability. Franchisee shall provide any additional information requested by the City within 48 hours of any such request delivered to Franchisee, to be produced at Albany City Hall, office of the City Manager, during regular office hours. In the event that an audit of the franchise fee payments results in a determination that an additional payment is due to the City, such additional payment shall be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date the original payment was due. If the additional payment amount exceeds five percent of the amount reported, Franchisee shall reimburse City for all audit costs. Any action by the City to recover an underpayment of the franchise fee shall be commenced within two years of the date the original payment was due. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.160 Indemnification and insurance requirements.
The Franchisee shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the City, its agents, officers and employees from any and all claims, demands, and damages of any kind, including attorney’s fees which may arise, from any negligent act or omissions of the Franchisee, its agents, officers or employees, in connection with the Franchisee’s operations pursuant to this franchise. The Franchisee will not be required to indemnify the City for the negligent or intentional acts of the City or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees.

The Franchisee shall, for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, prior to commencing construction of any kind, have in full force and effect, and file and maintain during the term of the franchise a certificate of insurance evidence thereto with the City Recorder, good and sufficient policies covering:

(1) Workers’ compensation insurance as required by the State of Oregon including employers’ liability with limits of $1,000,000; Franchisee shall ensure that each of its subcontractors complies with these same requirements and shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City; and

(2) Commercial general liability insurance with limits of $5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 general aggregate, with the aggregate on a per-project basis; and

(3) Business automobile liability insurance, for any owned, hired or non-owned vehicles used in the performance of this agreement with combined single limits of $5,000,000 each accident; and

(4) Pollution liability insurance with limits of $5,000,000 each incident and in the aggregate. If policy is on a “claims made” basis it must provide a 24-month tail or reporting period.

The City of Albany, its officers, agents, and employees, shall be named an additional insured in said policy for losses caused in whole or in part by reason of the exercise of the rights and privileges herein granted.

Upon any material alteration or cancellation of any of the coverage, the Franchisee shall give the City 30 days’ notice in advance of the effective date of the alteration or cancellation of the coverage, if not replaced.

Each policy, commercial general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation, shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.170 Continuation – Renegotiation and termination.
The rights, privileges and franchise herein granted shall continue and be in force until August 13, 2024. If any change in Federal or State law materially affects any provision of this franchise, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to amend the affected provisions of this franchise to conform to the changed law. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.180 Breach and remedies.
In addition to any other rights set out elsewhere in this franchise, the City may terminate this franchise if Franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise, including but not limited to failing to pay or any suspension of Franchisee’s payments of franchise fees to the City under this franchise, failure by Franchisee to submit timely reports regarding the calculation of its gross revenues-based franchise fees to the City, failure to maintain the liability insurance and/or bonds required under this franchise, or failure to comply with all other State, Federal or local laws as set forth in this franchise, and the violation continues for 45 days after Franchisee receives notice of the violation from the City. All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.190 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise. All remaining provisions of this franchise shall then continue in full force and effect. If any provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope and breadth, such provisions shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope and breadth permitted by law. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.200 Attorneys’ fees and jurisdiction.
In the event an attorney is employed to enforce the provisions of this franchise (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings affecting creditors’ rights generally), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred, irrespective of whether any legal proceeding is commenced. If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought to construe, interpret or enforce the terms of this franchise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith, both at trial and on any appeal therefrom or petitions for review thereof. Such sum shall include an amount estimated by the court as the reasonable costs and fees to be incurred by the prevailing party in collecting any monetary judgment or award or otherwise in enforcing any order, judgment or decree entered in such suit, action or other proceeding. Jurisdiction for all litigation will rest exclusively with the courts of the State of Oregon with venue in Linn County. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.210 Successors and assigns.
This franchise is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Franchisee, however, shall not make any assignment without the written consent of the City, and any assignment made without the City’s consent shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, Franchisee may assign this franchise without the City’s consent (a) to an entity controlled by, under common control with, or controlling Franchisee, or (b) by mortgage, hypothecation, or other security instrument to secure indebtedness. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.80.220 Franchise nonexclusive.
This franchise is not exclusive and shall not be construed as a limitation on the City in granting rights, privileges and authority to other persons similar to, or different from, those granted by this chapter, or in constructing, installing, maintaining or operating any City-owned public utility. In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than Franchisee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of conducting business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 133.721(8) within the City, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, insofar as this is not in conflict with rules of government, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. (Ord. 5840 § 1, 2014).

3.90.010 Franchise granted.
There is hereby granted by the City of Albany, hereinafter referred to as “City,” to Casco Communications Inc., dba Casco Communications, hereinafter referred to as “Grantee,” an Oregon corporation authorized to conduct business in Oregon, their successors and assigns, hereinafter each referred to as “Franchisee,” the nonexclusive right and privilege to conduct business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 133.721(8) within the City and to place, erect, lay, maintain and operate in, upon, over and under streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds within the City, poles, wires and other appliances and conductors for all telephone, telegraph and other communication purposes. Such wires and other appliances and conductors may be strung upon poles or other fixtures above ground, or at the option of the Franchisee, its successors and assigns, may be laid underground, and such other apparatus may be used as may be necessary to properly operate and maintain the same.

The scope of this grant allows the installation, maintenance and repair of telecommunications facilities by Grantee in the City’s rights-of-way to provide telecommunications services, Internet access services, and private line services. In the event the Grantee intends to provide services other than telecommunications services, Internet access services, or private line services, Grantee shall be required to obtain an additional or revised franchise from the City to the extent required by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to prescribe which public ways will be used and the location of communications facilities within the public way as may be reasonably necessary to minimize public inconvenience. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.020 Excavations and construction.
It shall be lawful for Franchisee to make all needful excavations in any of such streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares and public highways, places and grounds in the City for the purpose of placing, erecting, laying and maintaining poles, or other supports or conduits for said wires and appliances and auxiliary apparatus or repairing, renewing or replacing the same. Said work shall be done in compliance with State and Federal laws, as well as local rules, regulations, ordinances or orders, which may during the continuance of this Franchise be adopted from time to time by the City. Franchisee shall obtain from the City all applicable permits, which will require plan submittal, approval, and the payment of fees before work begins. The Franchisee shall file with the City maps showing the location of any construction, extension, or relocation or any of the facilities of the Franchisee and shall obtain the City’s approval of the location and plans prior to the commencement of the work. All transmission and distribution structures, lines, and equipment erected by the Franchisee within the City shall be so located as to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, bridges, and other public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets, bridges, or other public ways or places. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of traffic conditions or public safety in a timely manner in order to protect the public. Franchisee shall protect, support, temporarily disconnect or relocate any of its equipment required to do so by the City by reason of street vacation, highway and street construction, change or establishment of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, and tracks, or any other type of structures or improvements by the City. This work shall be completed within 120 days of notice from the City. Unless approved by the City, no newly overlaid street or newly constructed street shall be excavated by the Franchisee for a period of five years from the time of completion of the street overlay or the street construction. In any such case, Franchisee shall be excused by the City from extending services if a practical alternate route cannot be found. When any excavation is made by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall promptly restore the affected portion of the street, bridge, easement area, or public place to the reasonably same conditions in which it was prior to the excavation. The restoration shall be done in compliance with City specifications, requirements, and regulations in effect at the time of such restoration. If the Franchisee fails to restore promptly the affected portion of the street, bridge, or public place to the same condition in which it was prior to the excavation, the City may make the restoration; and the reasonable costs of making the restoration, including the cost of inspection, supervision, and administration shall be paid by the Franchisee. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.030 Tree trimming.
Subject to the provisions of this chapter, Franchisee may trim trees when necessary in public rights-of-way for the operation of the lines, wires, cables and antennas or other appurtenances, provided such trimming shall be done by competent employees, agents, or contractors; and it shall be done without cost or expense to the City.

Said tree trimming shall be allowed only after Franchisee makes application and a written permit is approved by the City Manager of the City of Albany or any person appointed by the City Manager to exercise this function. Tree trimming and applications therefor shall be in accordance with City ordinances, and in the absence of any specific ordinance requirement, subject to such terms as the City shall reasonably require for such purposes. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.040 Use of poles.
The City reserves to itself the right at any time to use the poles and other installations of the Franchisee erected or installed under the authority granted in this chapter for any City-owned facilities of whatsoever nature, but it is agreed that such use shall not interfere with the Franchisee’s use thereof. Franchisee shall not be required to own or operate any facilities the City is using if the Franchisee ceases to have a need therefor. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.050 Construction and performance bond.
Prior to the commencement of any construction work by the Franchisee, the Franchisee shall file both a construction and performance bond in an amount approved by the City in favor of the City and any other person who may suffer damages as a result of the breach of any duty by the Franchisee assured by such bond. Such bond as contemplated herein shall be in a form approved by the City and shall, among other matters, cover the cost of removal of any property of Franchisee. In no event shall the amount of said bond be construed to limit the liability of the Franchisee for damages. The City, at its sole option, may waive this requirement, or permit the consolidation of the construction bond with the performance bond. The Franchisee, pursuant to this chapter, shall also maintain in full force and effect public liability insurance in an amount specified by the City; see AMC 3.90.160. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.060 Street repair – Expense responsibility.
Whenever Franchisee shall disturb any of the streets for the purpose aforesaid, it or they shall restore the same to good order and condition in accordance with the City of Albany Standard Construction Specifications and the permit issued for the work as soon as practicable without unnecessary delay, and failing to do so the City shall have the right to fix a reasonable time within which such repairs and restoration of streets shall be completed, and upon failure of such repairs being made by said company, its successors and assigns, the City shall cause such repairs to be made at the expense of Franchisee. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.070 Improvements – Utility obstruction prohibited.
The City reserves the right to construct, install, maintain, and operate any public improvement, work or facility, to do any work that the City may find desirable on, over, or under any street, bridge or public place, and to vacate, alter or close any street, bridge or public place. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed in any way to prevent the proper authorities of the City from sewering (sanitary and storm), providing water service, grading, planking, rocking, paving, repairing, altering, or improving any of the streets, alleys, avenues, thoroughfares, and public highways, places and grounds within the City in or upon which the poles, wires or other conductors of Franchisee shall be placed, but all such work or improvements shall be done if possible so as not to obstruct or prevent the free use of said poles, wires, conductors, conduits, pipes, or other apparatus, and the moving of company facilities, where required due to such work by the City, will be done by Franchisee within 120 days of notice by the City without cost to the City. The Franchisee shall furnish maps or drawings to the City or contractor, as the case may be, showing the approximate location of all its structures in the area involved in such proposed work. Any such work done for or at the request of a private individual, entity, developer or development shall be done at the expense of such private individual, entity, developer or development. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.080 Emergency removal and alternate routing of facilities.
If, at any time, in case of fire, disaster, or other threat to public safety in the franchise territory, it shall become necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City to cut or move any of the wires, cable, amplifiers or other appurtenances to the system of the Franchisee, such cutting or moving may be done. Any repairs rendered necessary thereby shall be made by the Franchisee, at its sole expense, provided that such repairs are not necessitated by a negligent act of the City, in which case costs for repairs shall be borne by the City. The City shall hold the Franchisee, its agents, employees, officers and assigns hereunder harmless from any claims arising out of the City’s cutting or moving of Franchisee’s facilities. In the event continued use of any street is denied to the Franchisee by the City for any reason, the Franchisee shall provide service to affected subscribers over such alternate routes as shall be determined by Franchisee within a reasonable period of time. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.090 Cables, wires – Rearrangement – Notice.
Whenever the City determines that the public interest requires that it is necessary to rearrange, remove, lower or raise the aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee to permit the passage of any building, machinery or other object, or to widen/realign City streets, or to make any other alteration or improvement which will require rearrangement of franchisee’s facilities or equipment, the said Franchisee will perform such rearrangement within a reasonable period after written notice from the City. Said notice shall bear the approval of such official as Council may designate and shall provide that the costs of such rearrangement shall be borne by any third persons whose activities create the need for rearrangement except that a request by the City of Albany, on behalf of itself or any other unit of government to rearrange aerial cables or wires or other apparatus of the Franchisee shall be accomplished by the Franchisee within 120 days at no cost to the City. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.100 Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations.
At all times during the term of this franchise, Franchisee shall comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of the United States of America, the State of Oregon, and the City of Albany, including all agencies and subdivisions thereof. Franchisee shall be subject to the lawful exercise of the police power of the City of Albany and to such reasonable regulations of general applicability as the City may from time to time hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide insofar as such regulations or ordinances do not materially alter or impair the rights and obligations of Franchisee and are adopted pursuant to the lawful police power of the City. No provision of this franchise shall be construed as a waiver of local, State or Federal law, or as a limit of liability. Franchisee shall at all times keep and maintain all of its poles, fixtures, conduits, wires, and its entire system in good state of repair and shall at all times conduct its operations under this franchise, including installation, construction or maintenance of its facilities, in a safe and workmanlike manner so as not to present a danger to the public or the City. The location, construction, extension, installation, maintenance, removal and relocation of the facilities of the Franchisee shall conform to the requirements of the State and Federal statutes and regulations adopted pursuant thereto in force at the time of such work, and such reasonable specifications in force at the time of such work, as the City may from time to time adopt. All installations, rearrangements, removals, lowering or raising of aerial cables or wiring or other apparatus shall be done in conformance with the requirements of the National Electric Safety Code, the laws of the State of Oregon and the ordinances of the City. The City may provide such specifications relating thereto as may be necessary or convenient for public safety or the orderly development of the City. The City may amend and add to such specifications from time to time. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.110 Sale of subscriber lists prohibited.
The Franchisee shall not sell or otherwise make available any list which identifies subscribers by name or address to any person, agency or entity, except as needed to maintain current services or implement new services to subscribers in connection with Franchisee’s services. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.120 Payment.
Effective August 13, 2014, and until the franchise’s expiration, which is set as August 13, 2024, said Franchisee shall pay to the City quarterly as specified below seven percent of gross revenues derived within the corporate limits of the City. A minimum fee of $750.00 per quarter will be due the City for administration of this agreement and for use of the City’s right-of-way unless the seven percent of gross revenue exceeds the $750.00 fee, then the greater amount will be due the City. The minimum fee amount shall be adjusted annually by the change in the Engineering News-Record (ENR) Construction Cost Index (Seattle). The adjustment will only apply to the flat minimum fee amount. This franchise fee shall be deposited in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the Finance Director of the City and postmarked on or before the last business day of the quarter that said revenue was received by the Franchisee.

Payment of Franchise Fees. Payments due under this provision shall be computed and paid quarterly for the preceding quarter, as of March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st, each quarterly payment due and payable no later than 45 days after such dates.

If a payment is not mailed or sent electronically within 45 days of the due date set forth above, the payment shall be deemed delinquent and shall accrue a late fee of nine percent interest per annum until collected. Payments made by Franchisee will be accepted by the City from the Franchisee, in payment of any separate permit fees that are imposed by the City on Franchisee for street openings, construction or inspection or maintenance of fixtures or facilities. However, Franchisee shall not deduct charges and penalties imposed by the City for noncompliance with charter provisions, ordinances, resolutions, or permit conditions from the franchise fee required by this chapter.

“Gross revenues” means any revenue derived by the Grantee from the operation of the system in the service area, following generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), consistent with Federal and State law. However, such phrase shall not include: (1) any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability collected by the Franchisee from customers for pass-through to a government agency, including the Federal Communications Commission user fee; (2) unrecovered bad debt; (3) advertising agency commissions and launch fees to the extent consistent with GAAP; and (4) franchise fees and any public, education and government (PEG) amounts received from customers. Grantee shall report gross revenues to the City using the accrual method of accounting, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Nothing in this section shall impair the City’s ability to challenge Grantee’s interpretation of GAAP. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.130 Abandonment.
If the Franchisee goes out of business or withdraws service from the area and as a consequence refuses to renew the agreement, all rights to the use of the connection media revert to the City who may sell, lease or otherwise use the connection media at its sole discretion. The connection media shall be left in working order and not be intentionally cut or destroyed. The City may require the media be removed from all poles and underground conduits by the former Franchisee at its own expense. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.140 Other fees and charges.
Nothing in this chapter shall give the Franchisee any credit against any nondiscriminatory business tax to the extent such tax applies to revenues other than those revenues that are the subject of the franchise fee, or any ad valorem property tax now or hereafter levied against real property or personal property within the City, or against any local improvement assessments levied on the Franchisee’s property. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.150 Reporting of funds.
With each franchise fee payment, the Franchisee shall furnish a sworn statement or declaration under oath from the Chief Finance Officer or designee, setting forth the amount and calculation of the payment. The statement shall detail the calculation of the franchise fee paid, and shall specify the nature and amount of all exclusions and deductions from such revenue claimed by the Franchisee in calculating the franchise fee. The City Manager of the City may require the Franchisee to provide any additional information reasonably necessary for administration of the franchise fee. The Franchisee shall keep available and open to inspection by the City Manager of the City, all accounts, books, and other records reasonably necessary for ascertaining the franchise liability. Franchisee shall provide any additional information requested by the City within 48 hours of any such request delivered to Franchisee, to be produced at Albany City Hall, office of the City Manager, during regular office hours. In the event that an audit of the franchise fee payments results in a determination that an additional payment is due to the City, such additional payment shall be subject to interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date the original payment was due. If the additional payment amount exceeds five percent of the amount reported, Franchisee shall reimburse City for all audit costs. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.160 Indemnification and insurance requirements.
Franchisee shall defend, save harmless, and indemnify the City from any loss or claim against the City on account of, or in connection with, any activity of Franchisee in the construction, operation, or maintenance of its technical facilities and systems services. The Franchisee will not be required to indemnify the City for the negligent or intentional acts of the City or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees.

The Franchisee shall, for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this section, prior to commencing construction of any kind, have in full force and effect, and file and maintain during the term of the franchise certificate of insurance evidence thereto with the City Recorder, good and sufficient policies covering:

(1) Worker’s compensation insurance as required by the State of Oregon including employers’ liability with limits not less than $1,000,000; Franchisee shall ensure that each of its subcontractors complies with these same requirements and shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City; and

(2) Commercial general liability insurance with limits of at least $5,000,000 per occurrence and $5,000,000 general aggregate, with the aggregate on a per project basis; and

(3) Business automobile liability insurance, for any owned, hired or non-owned vehicles used in the performance of this agreement with combined single limits of $5,000,000 each accident; and

(4) Pollution liability insurance with limits of $5,000,000 each incident and in the aggregate. If policy is on a “claims made” basis it must provide a 24-month tail or reporting period.

The City of Albany, its officers, agents, and employees, shall be named an additional insured in said policy for losses caused in whole or in part by reason of the exercise of the rights and privileges herein granted.

Upon any material alteration or cancellation of any of the coverage, the Franchisee shall give the City notice as allowed per insured’s insurance policy in advance of the effective date of the alteration or cancellation of the coverage.

Each policy, commercial general liability, auto liability and workers’ compensation, shall contain a waiver of subrogation against the City.

The insurance policy limits required in this section may be satisfied by provider through a combination of the underlying insurance policy and umbrella (excess) liability policy(ies) so long as said umbrella policies are, at a minimum, “follow form” and provide insurance equal to or greater than coverage afforded by the underlying liability policy(ies). (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.170 Term and negotiation.
The rights, privileges and franchise herein granted shall continue and be in force until August 13, 2024. Upon a material change in technology either party may provide six months’ notice, in writing, to renegotiate this agreement. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.180 Forfeiture and remedies.
In addition to any other rights set out elsewhere in this franchise, the City reserves the right to declare a forfeiture of the franchise, subject to 45-day right to cure, and all of the Franchisee’s rights arising thereunder in the event that Franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise, including but not limited to failing to pay or any suspension of Franchisee’s payments of franchise fees to the City under this franchise, failure by Franchisee to submit timely reports regarding the calculation of its gross revenues-based franchise fees to the City, failure to maintain the liability insurance and/or bonds required under this franchise, or failure to comply with all other State, Federal or local laws as set forth in this franchise. All remedies and penalties under this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are cumulative, and the recovery or enforcement of one is not a bar to the recovery or enforcement of any other such remedy or penalty. The remedies and penalties contained in this chapter, including termination of the franchise, are not exclusive, and the City reserves the right to enforce the penal provisions of any ordinance or resolution and to avail itself of any and all remedies available at law or in equity. Failure to enforce shall not be construed as a waiver of a breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter. A specific waiver of a particular breach of any term, condition or obligation imposed upon the Franchisee by, or pursuant to, this chapter or acceptance of any payment due shall not be waiver of any other or subsequent or future breach of the same or of any other term, condition or obligation itself. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.190 Bonds and other surety.
Except as expressly provided herein, Franchisee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the franchise or continuing its existence at the time this franchise is granted. The City acknowledges that the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of Franchisee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the franchise and the enforcement thereof. Initially, no bond or other surety will be required. In the event that one is required in the future, the City agrees to give the Franchisee at least 90 days’ prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement and the amount. Such reason must demonstrate a change in the Franchisee’s legal, financial, or technical qualifications that would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the franchise or afford compliance therewith. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.195 Severability.
In the event any of the provisions of this franchise are deemed to be void, invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be severed from the remainder of this franchise so as not to cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of this franchise. All remaining provisions of this franchise shall then continue in full force and effect. If any provision shall be deemed invalid due to its scope and breadth, such provisions shall be deemed valid to the extent of the scope and breadth permitted by law. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.200 Attorneys’ fees and jurisdiction.
In the event an attorney is employed to enforce the provisions of this franchise (including any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings affecting creditor’s rights generally), the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred, irrespective of whether any legal proceeding is commenced. If any legal action, arbitration or other proceeding is brought to construe, interpret or enforce the terms of this franchise, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred in connection therewith, both at trial and on any appeal therefrom or petitions for review thereof. Such sum shall include an amount estimated by the court as the reasonable costs and fees to be incurred by the prevailing party in collecting any monetary judgment or award or otherwise in enforcing any order, judgment or decree entered in such suit, action or other proceeding. Jurisdiction for all litigation will rest exclusively with the courts of the State of Oregon with venue in Linn County. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.210 Successors and assigns.
This franchise is binding upon and will inure to the benefit of all parties hereto, their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns. Franchisee, however, shall not make any assignment without the written consent of the City, and any assignment made without the City’s consent shall be null and void. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

3.90.220 Franchise nonexclusive.
This franchise is not exclusive and shall not be construed as a limitation on the City in granting rights, privileges and authority to other persons similar to, or different from, those granted by this chapter, or in constructing, installing, maintaining or operating any City-owned public utility. In the event the City enters into a franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other person or entity other than Franchisee to enter into the City’s streets and public ways for the purpose of conducting business as a telecommunications carrier as that term is defined in ORS 759.005(1) within the City, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, insofar as this is not in conflict with rules of government, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law. (Ord. 5845 § 1, 2014).

(3) The Director shall have the authority to refrain from classifying a dog as dangerous or potentially dangerous, even if the dog has engaged in the behaviors specified in subsection (1) or (2) of this section, if the Director determines that the behavior was caused by abuse, torment, or other provocation of the dog or if the injury was the result of intervention by the injured party in a fight between the dog and another animal.

(2) The Director shall give the dog’s owner written notice by certified mail or personal service of the dog’s specific behavior, of the dog’s classification as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog, and of the additional restrictions applicable to that dog by reason of its classification. The Director is encouraged to share this information with victims as well. Other forms of notification which result in actual notice of the information required above shall be sufficient. If the owner denies that the behavior in question occurred, the owner may appeal the Director’s decision to the Hearings Officer by filing, with the Director, a written request for hearing. The request for hearing must be received, by the Director, within 15 days of the following, whichever occurs first:

(a) The date of mailing of notice to the owner, by certified mail;

(b) The date the notice is personally served upon the owner; or

(c) The date when the owner acquired actual knowledge of the information required to be contained in the notice.

(3) The Hearings Officer shall hold a public hearing on any appeal from the Director’s decision to classify a dog as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog. The owner and any other person having relevant evidence concerning the dog’s behavior as specified in AMC 6.18.020 shall be allowed to present testimony. Information concerning medical condition rendered by a medical doctor may be presented as testimony at the hearing or in writing. Any written medical information offered at the hearing shall be made available to the Director, owner, and victim at least five days prior to the hearing. The hearing shall be audio-recorded by the Hearings Officer. Any party to the hearing may also audio-record the hearing, but the audio recording prepared by the Hearings Officer shall be the official recording which shall be part of the record of the proceeding. The hearing procedure shall not be deemed flawed nor the outcome invalidated due to technical failures or other good-faith errors which impair the audibility or completeness of recording. The Hearings Officer shall determine whether the behavior specified in AMC 6.18.020 was exhibited by the dog in question. The Hearings Officer shall issue an order containing his/her determination, which shall be final. The Hearings Officer may recess the hearing to a later date and request that either party provide additional evidence if the Hearings Officer determines that such evidence would be helpful to the decision. Failure by a party to provide the requested evidence may be considered by the Hearings Officer in making a decision, but the Hearings Officer shall have no obligation to request supplemental evidence or continue the hearing simply because a party to the proceeding does not present compelling evidence.

(4) Once the owner has received notice of the dog’s classification pursuant to subsection (2) of this section, the owner shall comply with the restrictions specified in the notice until such time as the Director’s decision is reversed on appeal. Additionally, the Director shall have authority to impound the dog pending completion of all appeals if the Director has reasonable grounds to believe that the owner of the dog has failed to comply with any of the restrictions specified in the notice of classification. If the Director’s decision concerning the classification of the dog is upheld on appeal, the dog’s owner shall pay to the City all costs incurred in the dog’s impoundment.

(1) Physically restrain the dog to prevent it from having off-leash access to any public sidewalk, roadway, adjoining property, or any other portion of the property from which the public is not excluded. A potentially dangerous dog shall not be allowed off the premises of the owner or keeper except while on a leash not to exceed 10 feet in length and, if the Director finds warranted, wearing a muzzle of sufficient strength and construction to prevent the dog from biting a human or animal.

(2) Fasten to a collar and keep on the dog at all times such tag as may be issued by the City of Albany, identifying the dog as a potentially dangerous dog.

(3) Pay an annual fee of [____] at the time the tag described in subsection (2) of this section is issued and a like fee each year thereafter so long as the dog remains within the corporate limits of the City of Albany. This fee shall be in addition to any other license fee.

(4) Notify the Director by certified mail where the dog is kept within 10 days of any change.

(5) Post a warning sign, supplied by the Director, at the location the dog is kept, in a conspicuous place visible from the public sidewalk or road adjoining the property or, if no such public sidewalk or road adjoins the property, then at the boundary line of the property where access is provided to the property.

(6) Have a microchip implanted in the dog which includes its classification status and the applicable Albany Police Department case number and provide the microchip identification information number to the Director.

(7) Keep the dog licensed by the applicable licensing authority.

(NOTE: Rabies vaccination will be required in order to maintain license status.)

(8) The requirements of this section shall apply to any person to whom ownership of a potentially dangerous dog is transferred.

(9) The owner of any dog classed as potentially dangerous may apply to the Director, after the expiration of at least two years from the date of original classification or one year following completion of training designed and conducted to address the behavior upon which the original classification was based to have the classification as “potentially dangerous” removed as follows:

(a) If an application follows training, the application must be accompanied by a written statement from the trainer describing the trainer’s qualifications, the course of training, and results thereof.

(b) If the application is based on any circumstance other than the training described in subsection (9)(a) of this section, the application must be accompanied by a written statement describing the grounds for the requested relief.

(c) The application must be accompanied by an application fee in an amount to be set by the City Council by separate resolution.

(d) The classification of “potentially dangerous” shall only be removed if the Director or Hearings Officer has received clear and convincing evidence that the dog is unlikely to ever again engage in behavior justifying a dangerous or potentially dangerous classification.

(e) The Director shall notify the owner of his/her decision in writing; and if the Director declines to remove the potentially dangerous classification, the owner may appeal the Director’s decision to the Hearings Officer by filing, with the Director, a written request for a hearing. The request for a hearing must be received by the Director within 15 days following whichever first occurs:

(i) The date of mailing of the notice to the owner, by certified mail;

(ii) The date the notice is personally served upon the owner; or

(iii) The date when the owner acquired actual knowledge of the information required to be contained in the notice.

(f) The Hearings Officer shall hold a public hearing on an appeal from the Director’s decision not to lift the classification that a dog is potentially dangerous. The owner and any other person having relevant evidence concerning the dog’s rehabilitation or other circumstances which make it unlikely that the dog will ever re-offend may present testimony. The hearing shall be audio-recorded by the Hearings Officer. Any party to the hearing may also audio-record the hearing, but the audio recording prepared by the Hearings Officer shall be the official recording which shall be part of the record of the proceeding. The hearing procedure shall not be deemed flawed nor the outcome invalidated due to technical failures or other good-faith errors which impair the audibility or completeness of the recording. The Hearings Officer shall issue an order containing his/her determination which shall be final. (Ord. 5769 § 1, 2011; Ord. 5026 § 1, 1993; Ord. 4847 § 1, 1989).

6.18.050 Consequence of a determination that a dog is dangerous.
(1) Unless an alternative disposition is adopted pursuant to the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, any dog that has been found to be a dangerous dog shall be euthanized. If a dog is euthanized by a licensed veterinarian, the veterinarian shall certify to the City of Albany that the dog has been euthanized.

(2) Following the hearing called for in AMC 6.18.030(3) to review the Director’s decision to classify a dog as dangerous, the owner or person in control of the dog may propose an alternative to euthanasia (“alternative” or “alternative order”) in the event that the Hearings Officer affirms the Director’s classification of the dog as dangerous. Before determining the acceptability of any alternative, the terms of the alternative must be provided to the Director in writing and the Director will thereafter provide written notice of the terms of the proposed alternative to the victim. If the alternative is relocation, the Director shall also provide written notice to the law enforcement agency with jurisdiction in the location where relocation is proposed. The Hearings Officer shall not consider any proposed alternative until and unless such notice has been provided to all listed parties and they have been given a 10-day opportunity to submit written comments to the Hearings Officer concerning the terms of the proposed alternative. In considering a proposed alternative, the Hearings Officer shall take into consideration the extent to which abuse, torment, or provocation, while not excusing the dog’s behavior, may have been a factor in the behavior and the extent to which the proposed alternative mitigates against a reoccurrence of these factors. The alternative may only be accepted by the Hearings Officer as an alternative to euthanasia in the event that the Hearings Officer determines, based upon substantial evidence in the record, that all of the following conditions have been met:

(a) All costs associated with the quarantine and impoundment of the dog pending adjudication as provided at AMC 6.18.070 have been paid; and

(b) The alternative will have no additional costs to the City; and

(c) A relocation alternative shall include specific conditions concerning the future care, control, and supervision of the dog which satisfies the Hearings Officer that the dog is unlikely to repeat the behavior upon which a classification is based, including disclosure to subsequent owners of the dog’s classification and the behavior which resulted in the classification. Removal from the City limits, without more, shall not satisfy these criteria. Examples of appropriate conditions, depending upon the behavior which resulted in the classification, may include prohibitions against ownership transfers to households containing minor children or other vulnerable parties, prohibitions on relocation to urban areas, or any other condition deemed by the Hearings Officer to be reasonably necessary to reduce the likelihood of re-offense.

(3) In the course of presenting an alternative as called for in subsection (2) of this section, the burden of proof shall rest with the owner or person in control of the dog. In deciding upon an appropriate alternative, the Hearings Officer may, but is not required to, solicit the opinion of third parties who, in the exclusive discretion of the Hearings Officer, have special knowledge or expertise that may be helpful in fashioning an appropriate alternative.

(4) If an alternative is adopted for a dangerous dog, all of the terms thereof shall be incorporated into a written order.

(5) A dog which, subsequent to adoption of an alternative order, again engages in behavior from which it could be classified as dangerous or potentially dangerous shall be euthanized. (Ord. 5769 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4847 § 1, 1989).

6.18.055 Notice of location of potentially dangerous or dangerous dog in City.
(1) No person shall keep within the City any dog which has previously been classified as potentially dangerous or dangerous by any jurisdiction other than the City of Albany without providing notice to the City as required herein. This requirement shall also apply to any dog that has received any classification or designation by any jurisdiction other than the City of Albany as a result of the dog having caused injury to any person or animal. If such classification resulted from serious injury to a human being or the death of an animal, the dog may not be relocated to the City of Albany. Thereafter, all provisions of this chapter shall apply to any dog lawfully relocated to the City of Albany as if the classification had been made by the City. The notice required herein shall be given in writing to the Albany Police Department within five days of the animal first being kept within the City and shall contain the following information:

(a) The name, address, and date of birth of the animal’s owner or keeper; and

(b) The address at which the animal will be kept; and

(c) The jurisdiction which classified the dog; and

(d) The behavior from which the classification resulted.

(2) This section shall not apply to dogs brought into the City by any unit of government for purposes of impoundment or quarantine or by any person for veterinary care. (Ord. 5769 § 1, 2011).

6.18.060 Penalty.
The violation of any provision of this chapter shall be punishable subject to the penalties set forth in AMC 1.04.010. In addition to these penalties, the Municipal Court Judge may order the dog in question euthanized if the Judge finds that the owner of the dog has failed to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter after having received notification that the dog in question has been classified as a dangerous or potentially dangerous dog. (Ord. 5769 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4927 § 1, 1990; Ord. 4847 § 1, 1989).

6.18.070 Quarantine or impoundment pending adjudication.
(1) If the owner of any dog is cited for a violation of this chapter, the Director may quarantine or impound the dog pending adjudication of the violation if, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, he/she believes that the dog constitutes a threat to public safety and/or private property. If the dog’s owner is adjudged to have committed the violation which caused the impoundment, the dog’s owner shall pay to the City all costs incurred in the dog’s quarantine or impoundment.

(2) Any dog considered for classification as potentially dangerous or dangerous may be quarantined or impounded if the Director or designee, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, believes that the dog constitutes a threat to public safety and/or private property. If the dog is ultimately classified as potentially dangerous or dangerous, the dog owner shall pay to the City all costs incurred in the dog’s quarantine or impoundment. (Ord. 5769 § 1, 2011; Ord. 4847 § 1, 1989).

The fact that contributions to an organization profiting from social gambling do not qualify for charitable deduction for tax purposes or that the organization is not otherwise exempt from payment of federal income taxes pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, constitutes prima facie evidence that the organization is not a bona fide charitable, fraternal or religious organization. (Ord. 4669 § 2, 1985).

7.12.050 Requirements.
Prior to engaging in social games in the City of Albany, the organization must show it has existed and operated with its principal place of business within the City of Albany for one year prior to the conducting of those games and has complied with ORS 465.100. (Ord. 4669 § 3, 1985).

(3) It shall be the responsibility of the owner, manager or other person in charge of any premises mentioned in subsection (1) of this section to post signs of the required number and form in the prescribed locations; to ascertain that such signs are posted in such a manner as not to be easily removed or dislodged; and to make reasonable inspections of such signs during such times as they are required to be displayed so as to ascertain that they remain on display in the condition required by this section. Failure to carry out such responsibilities shall be unlawful.

(4) The fact that signs were posted pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not, of itself, constitute a defense to a prosecution brought under any other section of this chapter.

(5) Signs of the number, size and design required by this section, but imposing stricter requirements than those provided in subsection (2) of this section shall be deemed to comply with the provisions of that subsection. (Ord. 4570 § 1, 1983; Ord. 3584 § 2, 1971).

7.12.062 Employment of juveniles for certain purposes prohibited.
It is unlawful for any person to knowingly or recklessly hire, employ or otherwise engage for payment in money or any valuable consideration any juvenile for the purpose of furnishing obscene material to any person, for the purpose of selling admission to or acting as an usher or attendant at any obscene performance, for the purpose of delivering obscene materials, or for any other purpose when the duties of such juvenile will require or permit him/her to enter upon any premises where obscene materials are sold or displayed or any obscene performance is exhibited; provided, however, this section shall have no application where the parent or lawful guardian of a juvenile consents to such employment and the employment is not otherwise prohibited by state law. (Ord. 5026 § 1, 1993; Ord. 3584 § 2, 1971).

Examples of such sheeting strength yields would include strength yields equal to or greater than American Society for Testing and Materials (ASDM) D638 Tensile Strength, yield value of 8,000 psi. When this sheeting is installed it shall be installed in a manner intended to provide an appearance approximating glass in the window casing, and consistent in appearance with the surrounding surface in the case of all other openings that require securing.

(2) As used herein, “plywood material” means a minimum of one-half-inch-thick exterior grade or better plywood which can maintain its tensile strength through long exposure to moisture.

(3) As used herein, “cross-beam” means a minimum of one-and-one-half-inch-by-three-and-one-half-inch-thick piece of solid wood material or stronger.

(4) Unless otherwise granted a variance by the City of Albany from strict compliance herewith, material such as particle board, wafer board, masonite or other similar material shall not be used for boarding up real property. (Ord. 5901, 2018).

(1) General Requirement. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, all real property that is unsecure shall be secured by boarding unsecure windows, doors, and other openings with sheeting material in accordance with AMC 7.82.030.

(2) When real property board-up is required all street, alley, sidewalk, and public facing sides of the structure shall have polycarbonate material used. All other sides of the structure can use plywood or polycarbonate material as described in AMC 7.82.030.

(3) Boarding Standard – Windows.

(a) Internal Compression Method. Windows with broken, missing, or removed glass, or that are otherwise unsecure, shall be boarded as follows:

(i) All remaining broken glass shall be removed from the window opening, including damaged frames, as to provide a clean opening;

(ii) The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that, when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it;

(iii) A hole shall be drilled into each of the four corners of the sheeting material. The holes shall be positioned so they are not more than one inch from the window frame at the width and no more than six inches from the window sill and top frame;

(iv) Two solid continuous cross-beams shall be cut in sufficient length to be no less than eight inches longer than the horizontal width of the interior window casing. Each cross-beam shall be predrilled with holes that are positioned to match the horizontal pattern of the holes in the sheeting;

(v) The sheeting shall be secured in place over the exterior of the window opening by placing a three-eighths-inch or larger corrosion resistant, smooth-head carriage bolt through each of the holes in the sheeting and then placing one washer onto each of the carriage bolts; the cross-beams shall then be aligned and affixed to such carriage bolts from the interior of the window opening. Another nut and washer shall be placed onto each of the carriage bolts and tightened with a ratchet to achieve sufficient torque and a slight deflection in the cross-beams so that the nuts cannot be loosened by hand. Once secured, no space shall exist between the sheeting and the exterior window casing.

(b) Exterior Screw Method. Fixed or inoperable windows with intact glass, or windows in which the internal compression method is impractical, shall be secured as follows:

(i) The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that, when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it;

(ii) Drill and countersink holes shall be made along the perimeter of the sheeting material starting with a hole at each of the four corners and adding additional holes at 10-inch increments around the perimeter of the sheeting. Minimum length two-and-one-half-inch corrosion resistant security head screws shall be used in each hole to affix the sheeting to the window frame or exterior casing;

(iii) In the event the sheeting cannot be secured by cutting the sheeting material so as to neatly fit the inside window casing, the sheeting shall be placed over the exterior window casing such that the sheeting material covers the entire window casing and extends beyond the window casing at least eight inches on center. The sheeting material shall be secured with minimum length two-and-one-half-inch corrosion resistant security head screws secured at the corners, and along the sheeting outer edges in 10-inch spaced increments as described in subsection (3)(b)(ii) of this section.

(c) Variance. If circumstances make the foregoing methods of installation impractical such as due to excessive frame, door and wall damage, or windows that are in an arc encasing or other unusual inset or characteristic the window or opening shall still be installed with the sheeting, but may be affixed and secured in any manner approved by the City of Albany as to achieve substantial compliance with this chapter.

(4) Boarding Standard – Unsecure Doors; Sliding or Other Doors.

(a) Exterior Access Door. At least one exterior door shall allow authorized persons access to the interior of the real property. Such exterior access door shall be secured by hinged sheeting material. The door shall be securely locked using a padlock and hasp assembly that is bolted through the sheeting material. The lock loop portion of the hasp shall be attached to the door frame using a minimum of three-inch-long security screws.

(b) Sliding glass doors and other exterior doors. Sliding glass doors or exterior doors other than the exterior access door shall be secured in the same manner as described in subsection (3) of this section.



(Ord. 5901, 2018).

7.82.050 Alternative board-up variance.
(1) The City Manager or designee may grant a variance allowing all sides of a house to be boarded up using plywood material described in AMC 7.82.030 for up to 60 days.

(2) After the 60-day variance period has expired all street, alley, sidewalk, and public facing sides of the structure shall be boarded up using polycarbonate material described in AMC 7.82.030. (Ord. 5901, 2018).

7.82.060 Joint and several obligations.
A financial institution that is not an owner of the unsecured real property to which an order to secure such real property is issued by the City of Albany shall be required to comply with any such orders as prescribed herein.

However, nothing herein shall absolve or diminish the owners’ obligation to comply with the requirements of this chapter regardless of the issuance of any order to financial institution. A financial institution not in ownership of the unsecured real property and any owner shall be jointly and severally liable to comply with this chapter, and shall be jointly and severally liable for all civil penalties and charges levied against them for noncompliance with any portion of this chapter. (Ord. 5901, 2018).

7.82.070 Failure to comply.
Any owner or financial institution that fails to comply with the requirements of this chapter, upon notice of noncompliance from the City of Albany, shall jointly and severally be subject to a civil penalty of $500.00 for each violation of this chapter. Failure to comply with any portion of this chapter within 30 days of such notice, received via certified mail or in person, shall result in a civil penalty of an additional $500.00 per day for each day thereafter that such owner or financial institution remains in noncompliance with this chapter. In addition to the fine imposed herein, the City of Albany may, but is not required to, secure the unsecured real property itself or through any authorized third party or agent as described in AMC 7.82.080. (Ord. 5901, 2018).

7.82.080 Public nuisance – Abatement.
Real properties not secured within 30 days of notice as required under AMC 7.82.020 are hereby declared a public nuisance and are subject to abatement and subsequent liens as described in AMC 7.84.150 through 7.84.170. (Ord. 5901, 2018).

(7) Within 10 days after the posting and delivering/mailing of the notice, the owner or person in charge of the property shall abate the condition, substance, act, or nuisance specified in the notice, or appeal the City Manager’s decision to the Municipal Court as specified in subsection (8) of this section.

Article II. Improper Use of Transit Shelters

7.84.310 Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide for the safety, convenience, and comfort of transit passengers, for safety of City of Albany personnel, for the preservation of service quality in the City’s ability to provide a cost-effective source of reliable transportation, and to prevent transit system security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to establish rules and regulations governing conduct on City of Albany property. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

7.84.320 Definitions.
“Transit shelter” shall mean any and all City-owned or managed bus shelters, train shelters, non-covered bench areas related to bus or train transportation and the train depot. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

(4) Remain in or within 20 feet of a bus shelter or train depot seating for a period in excess of one hour within a 24-hour period; however, a person in possession of a paid or issued train ticket for the date of the alleged violation of this article shall be exempt from this subsection up until the departure time as stated on the ticket or as may be modified by the service operator;

(5) Place any object or substance on the seats of a bus shelter or train depot seating that inhibits the proper use of such seats; or

(6) Block or obstruct the use of the seats or floor area of a bus shelter or train depot seating. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

7.84.340 Exclusions.
In addition to other measures provided for in violation of this article, any other Albany Municipal Code ordinance, or the laws of the State of Oregon, the City may exclude an individual from any or all transit shelters for a violation of any provision of this section, or a violation of any criminal law of the State of Oregon while in or within 20 feet of a transit shelter for a period not to exceed 180 days. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

7.84.350 Issuance of exclusion notice.
The Chief of Police is designated as the person in charge of civil exclusion zones for the purpose of issuing exclusion notices in accordance with this article. The Chief of Police may authorize employees of the Albany Police Department to issue exclusion notices in accordance with this article. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

7.84.360 Procedure for exclusion.
Upon the first violation of this article, a party may be verbally warned of the offense. Upon a second violation within a 12-month period, a person in violation may be excluded from all transit shelters for a period of 90 days. All subsequent violations will carry a 180-day exclusion from the date of the violation.

At the time a person is verbally warned, cited to appear, arrested or otherwise taken into custody for violating any of the offenses specified herein, the officer making such warning, arrest or citation may deliver to that person a written notice excluding that person from any or all transit shelters and the area within 20 feet of the shelter. The exclusion shall take place immediately and apply to all City-owned transit shelters. A violation of a second or subsequent offense of this article may result in a charge of criminal trespass in the second degree (ORS 164.245).

The notice shall specify the area from which the person is excluded, the length of the exclusion, the penalty for entering the excluded area and contain information concerning the right to appeal the exclusion to the Judge of the Municipal Court. (Ord. 5835 § 1, 2014).

7.84.370 Appeal and variance.
(1) The person to whom an exclusion notice is issued shall have the right to appeal the issuance of the notice. The exclusion notice will notify the person of the right to appeal and the process for such appeal.

(a) An appeal of the exclusion must be filed, in writing, within five business days from the date of the issuance of the notice of exclusion. The appeal must be filed with the Municipal Court. A hearing on the appeal shall be held before the Judge of the Albany Municipal Court. The exclusion shall be stayed during the pendency of the appeal.

(b) The City shall have the burden to show by a preponderance of evidence that the exclusion was based upon the conduct proscribed in the citation. Copies of documents in its control and which are intended to be used by the City at the hearing shall be made available to the appellant upon written request prior to the hearing.

(c) A determination by a court having jurisdiction of the matter that the officer who issued the exclusion notice at the time had probable cause to arrest or cite the person to whom the exclusion notice was issued for the conduct described therein shall be prima facie evidence that the exclusion was based on conduct prohibited by those statutes.

(2) An individual with a disability who is transit-dependent shall not be issued a complete exclusion from the transit shelters unless the person engaged in violent, seriously disruptive or criminal conduct, or in conduct posing a serious threat to the safety of others or to the operation of the transit system. Absent such a finding, if the Albany Municipal Court determines that a violation was more probable than not, the Albany Municipal Court shall order a qualified exclusion to permit the person with a disability to use the transit system for trips of necessity, including travel to and from medical and legal appointments, school or training classes, places of employment, obtaining food, clothing and necessary household items, or for accessing any critical services.

Any person asserting the right to a qualified exclusion on the basis of transit dependence shall have the burden of establishing transit dependence by a preponderance of the evidence.

(3) Any variance may be granted at any time during the exclusion period by the Chief of Police, his or her designee or by the Municipal Court.

(4) All variances shall be in writing, for a specific period of time and only to accommodate a specific purpose, all of which shall be stated in the variance.

(5) The person shall keep the variance on his or her person at all times the person is within the area of exclusion.

(6) In the event a person is found to be outside the scope of the terms of the variance, the variance shall immediately become void and that person is subject to arrest for the crime of criminal trespass in the second degree (ORS 164.245) and/or interfering with public transportation (ORS 166.116).

7.85.040 Police Chief’s determination.
(1) If the Police Chief suspects that property may be a chronic nuisance, the Police Chief may notify the owner and the owner’s registered agent, if known, in writing. In deciding whether to proceed, the Police Chief shall consider whether the owner has reported the incidents and otherwise acted responsibly and whether proceeding would discourage future reporting and cooperation in discouraging unlawful behavior. The notice shall contain the following information:

(a) The street address or description sufficient for identification of the property;

(b) That the Police Chief is considering whether the property is a chronic nuisance property together with a concise description of the information upon which the Police Chief is relying. If any of the incidents relied on occurred on property other than that which is subject of the notice, the notice may include a concise description of the location and the causal relationship between the subject property and the incident; and

(c) A direction that the owner has 15 days from the date of mailing the notice to provide information to the Police Chief demonstrating that the property is not a chronic nuisance inform the Police Chief of the actions the owner intends to take to address the allegations, or indicate good cause as to why the owner cannot do so.

(2) If the owner fails to respond or to demonstrate to the Police Chief that further action should not be taken, the Police Chief may issue a determination of chronic nuisance and direct the owner to abate the nuisance within 30 days, or show good cause to the Police Chief why the owner cannot meet the deadline. The notice shall state that:

(a) If the nuisance is not abated within the 30-day period, and good cause for failure to abate is not shown, the Circuit Judge may order abatement or closure of the property with appropriate conditions. The Circuit Judge may also employ any other remedy deemed by the Judge to be appropriate to abate the nuisance, including but not limited to authorizing a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction;

(b) If the Circuit Judge orders the property owner to take some action to abate the nuisance, the owner may be required to pay to the City a civil penalty of $250.00 a day for each day the owner fails to take action;

(c) If the Circuit Judge orders the owner to abate the nuisance, the owner may be required to pay a civil penalty of $500.00 per incident for subsequent incidents, as defined by AMC 7.85.030(2)(c), occurring on the property within six months of the order;

(d) Permitting chronic nuisance property is a violation of this chapter; and

(e) The above remedies are in addition to those otherwise provided by law.

(3) Service of the notice to the property owner provided for in this chapter is completed upon delivery in person or upon mailing the notice by certified mail addressed to:

(a) The owner’s registered agent, if any is known; or

(b) The owner at the address of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property, or to such other address as shown on the tax rolls of the county in which the property is located or such other place which is believed to give the owner actual notice of the determination by the Police Chief.

(4) A copy of the notice shall be served on occupants of the property, if different from the owner. Service shall be completed upon delivery in person or upon mailing the notice first class addressed to occupant of each unit of the property believed to be a chronic nuisance property.

(5) In addition, a copy of the Police Chief’s determination that the property is a chronic nuisance shall be posted on the main entrance of the property in a conspicuous manner.

(6) The failure of any person or owner to receive actual notice of the determination by the Police Chief shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this chapter. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.050 Determination of Hearing Officer.
(1) If the Police Chief determines that the owner has failed to abate the chronic nuisance or demonstrate good cause as to why the owner cannot do so, the Police Chief may refer the matter to the Circuit Judge for a hearing. The Circuit Judge may give notice of the hearing to the owner and occupants, if different from the owner, and post notice of the hearing on the main entrance of the property. At the time set for the hearing, the owner and occupants may appear and be heard. The Circuit Judge may determine de novo whether the property is a chronic nuisance property, whether the nuisance has been abated, and whether the owner has shown good cause or otherwise has a valid defense.

(2) The City has the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is a chronic nuisance property. If the City is relying on an incident that occurred on property other than the property that is the subject of the chronic nuisance determination, the City shall demonstrate some causal relationship between activities occurring on the property and the incident. The activities must have contributed to, but need not be the sole or predominant cause of, the incident. Evidence demonstrating a causal connection may include, but is not limited to:

(a) That the owner knew or reasonably should have known that the resident or other person associated with the property would engage in conduct listed in AMC 7.85.030(2); or

(b) Activities on the subject property that encouraged, engendered, promoted, contributed to, or otherwise made the incident more likely to occur.

(3) It shall be an affirmative defense to an action under this chapter that the owner could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, control the activities on the subject property that constituted the incident or made the incident more likely to occur or otherwise remedy the situation leading to the finding that the property is a chronic nuisance. The owner has the burden of proving this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The action shall be dismissed if the Circuit Judge determines that the owner has proven this defense.

(4) If the owner can prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner is unable to remedy the chronic nuisance within the time frames required by this chapter, the Circuit Judge may elect to grant more time and continue its final determination as the Circuit Judge determines is just. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.060 Remedies.
(1) If the Circuit Judge determines that property is a chronic nuisance and the owner has not demonstrated a valid defense, the Judge may order that the nuisance be abated or close and secure the property against all use and occupancy for a period of not less than 30 days and not more than six months.

(2) Prior to issuing any order of abatement or closure, a Circuit Judge may consider the following factors:

(a) The actions taken by the owner(s) to mitigate or correct the problem at the property;

(b) The financial position of the owner;

(c) Whether the problem at the property was repeated or continuous;

(d) The magnitude or gravity of the problem;

(e) The level of cooperation of the owner in addressing the problem, including whether the owner reported the incidents;

(f) The time and cost to the City in attempting to correct the problem; and

(g) Any other factor deemed relevant by the Circuit Judge. These factors are guidelines to inform the decision-making process, but the presence or absence of any factors shall not control the decision by the Circuit Judge.

(3) The order may include conditions under which abatement or closure is to occur.

(4) Upon a determination by the Circuit Judge that the property is a chronic nuisance, the Police Chief may file a notice of the proceedings to be placed with the county property records.

(5) The remedies in this section are in addition to those otherwise provided by law. The City may also employ any other remedy deemed by it to be appropriate to abate the nuisance, including but not limited to authorizing a civil complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.070 Multi-unit property.
(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, in the case of multi-unit residential property, such as apartment complexes under one ownership, the chronic nuisance determination and closure remedy shall be directed only to the unit or units that are the source or location of the incidents.

(2) A chronic nuisance determination and remedy may be applied to multiple units, up to and including the entire property, if the Circuit Judge determines that:

(a) The incident occurred in the common areas of the property or otherwise are not reasonably attributable to a particular unit;

(b) The nature or scope of the incidents is such that they cannot reasonably be attributed to a particular unit; or

(c) Incidents continue to occur despite previous imposition of remedies on specific units and the owner has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to mitigate or correct the nuisance. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.080 Civil penalty.
(1) If the Circuit Judge finds that a property is a chronic nuisance property and orders the owner to take some action to abate the nuisance, the Judge may impose upon the owner a civil penalty of up to $250.00 per day, payable to the City, for each day after the deadline that the owner fails to take the action ordered.

(2) If the Circuit Judge orders the owner to abate the nuisance, the Judge may impose upon the owner a civil penalty of $500.00 per incident for subsequent incidents, as defined by AMC 7.85.030(2), occurring on the property within six months of the order.

(3) A civil penalty is assessed by issuing written notice of penalty to the owner of the chronic nuisance property and the owner’s registered agent, if any is known. The notice shall contain the following information:

(a) The street address or description sufficient for identification of the property;

(b) That the Circuit Judge has found that the owner has failed to take the action required by the Judge, or that after an order to abate the nuisance, a subsequent nuisance activity has occurred, with a concise description of the conditions leading to the Judge’s findings;

(c) That the owner may request a hearing on the validity of the assessment of the penalty by filing a request with the Circuit Judge within 14 days of the notice. The request must specifically state the grounds upon which the owner believes that the penalty is not valid;

(d) The penalty is final when 14 days have elapsed from the date of the notice if a request for hearing is not filed, or upon entry of an order upholding the penalty by the Circuit Judge after hearing.

(4) The Circuit Judge shall not impose more than 10 days of civil penalties at a time. The Judge may impose additional civil penalties after 10 days by reissuing notice of imposition of penalties. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.090 Penalty and costs of review as lien.
(1) The Police Chief may forward a statement of the assessments for penalties, cost of abatement and, if ordered by the Circuit Judge, hearing costs and attorney’s fees to the Finance Director. The Finance Director shall notify the owner by mail of the sum of money due to the City. If the sum is not paid within 45 days from the billing date, the Director shall file with the Circuit Judge a statement of the sum due, plus an additional charge of 30 percent to cover administrative expenses. The owner shall be notified by mail of the time and place the Circuit Judge will consider the statement of penalties and costs, and will be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard in objection thereto. The Judge will only determine if the statement of penalties and cost is correct, and will not reconsider the decision as to whether the penalties and costs of the hearing should be imposed. The Judge shall determine the correct amount of penalties and cost and shall declare the same to be a lien upon the property involved, to be entered in the minor lien docket and enforced against the property, in the same manner provided for enforcement of liens for street improvement.

(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the authority of the City to enter into a settlement of the dispute, including waiving some or all amounts due to the City. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.100 Closure of property.
If the Circuit Judge’s order of closure of a property is not appealed, or if the Judge upholds an appeal of an order which has been challenged, the City shall take steps to physically secure the property against all use, and post conspicuous notices that the property has been closed. All costs reasonably incurred by the City in securing the property shall be made an assessment lien upon the property in the manner described in AMC 7.85.090. Costs may include but are not limited to staff time and materials. Prior to physically closing the property, the City may, but is not required to, provide the owner with a brief opportunity to physically secure the property against all use at the owner’s expense. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.110 Entering closed property.
It is unlawful for any person to enter, use, or remain in or on property that has been ordered closed pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.120 Liability.
Nothing herein shall be relied on or construed as establishing any City responsibility, obligation or liability to any third party, for damages or otherwise arising from the actions or inactions of the City in applying this chapter. Nothing herein lessens or otherwise alters the property owner’s responsibility to third parties arising from use and condition of the property. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

7.85.130 Violation.
Violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is a misdemeanor punishable as provided by AMC 1.04.010. (Ord. 5883 § 1, 2016).

The contamination of any premises in the City of Albany due to the presence thereon of hazardous materials is hereby declared to be a nuisance. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

(1) No person, partnership, corporation, or other entity shall cause any premises in the City of Albany, whether publicly or privately owned, to become contaminated with hazardous material.

7.86.040 City may abate nuisance.
(1) Unless a hazard to public safety has been declared by the City Manager or his/her designee, as hereinafter set forth, the City shall notify any owner or person in charge of any premises contaminated by hazardous material to remove or clean up said contamination in a manner consistent with all applicable state, federal, and local laws and regulations. Notice shall be given by certified mail with a return receipt requested, addressed to the owner of the premises as shown by the assessment records of the County in which the premises are located. In the event that the premises owner fails to initiate clean-up within 10 days of said notice and complete clean-up within 90 days of said notice, the City may undertake the clean-up of the hazardous material or may contract with a third party for such clean-up.

(2) In the event that the City elects to proceed with clean-up as provided in subsection (1) above, all costs incurred by the City shall be calculated and shall be the joint and several responsibility of the premises owner and the responsible party and will become a lien against the premises on which the hazardous material was located. In computing its costs, the State Fire Service Mobilization Plan (ORS 476.560) shall be used as a reference to establish the dollar rate for City personnel and equipment used in the clean-up of the hazardous material. Should the City contract with a third party for any of the clean-up, all costs thereby incurred shall be the joint and several responsibility of the owner of the premises and the responsible party.

All provisions in this chapter which empower or authorize City action shall be permissive and not mandatory. The City and its officers and employees shall be entitled to exercise discretion in determining the extent to which contamination of premises with hazardous materials warrants a City response. Such considerations may include the apparent danger to public health, the likely spread of contamination, financial resources available to the City for initiation of clean-up, other demands on City staff or financial resources, the likelihood that the costs of clean-up can be recovered from the owner of the premises or the responsible party, and the nature of the hazardous materials. This enumeration is not exclusive and is intended only to illustrate the types of discretionary criteria the City may employ in determining whether or not a particular hazardous material discharge warrants a City response. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

7.86.050 Right to enter.
In the event it becomes necessary or desirable for the City to clean up any hazardous contamination, pursuant to this chapter, any and all employees of the City engaged in said remediation effort shall have unrestricted access to the contaminated premises at all times. Should the City contract with a third party for all or any part of the clean-up, all agents and employees of said contractor shall have unrestricted access to the premises. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

7.86.060 Interference with clean-up personnel prohibited.
No person shall interfere with or deny access to any person authorized to enter contaminated premises for the purposes of clean-up as provided by AMC 7.86.040. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

7.86.070 Declaration of public hazard.
In the event that the City Manager or his/her designee determines, in the exercise of reasonable discretion, that the contamination of hazardous materials on premises within the City of Albany constitutes an immediate hazard to public safety or danger to adjoining premises, the City may dispense with a notice provision required in AMC 7.86.040(1) and proceed forthwith to clean-up of the hazardous material at the expense of the owner of the premises and the responsible party. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

7.86.080 Costs of clean-up to become a lien.
Upon completion of the clean-up all costs and administrative fees associated therewith shall be billed to the owner of the premises and/or the responsible party, if known, and in the event said costs are not paid within 30 days, the City shall file with the City Recorder and thereafter present to the City Council an itemized statement of the costs incurred. The Council shall thereafter provide an opportunity for a public hearing concerning the reasonableness of the costs incurred and shall thereafter, by ordinance, determine the reasonableness of the cost which shall then become an obligation owed to the City by the owner of the premises, and the City shall have a lien upon the premises for said sum and the lien shall be entered in the lien docket and enforced against the premises in the manner provided for the enforcement of City liens. (Ord. 5210 § 1, 1995).

7.90.010 Purpose.
The purpose of adopting this chapter is to regulate certain business activities that present an extraordinary risk of being used by criminals to dispose of stolen property. Despite the best efforts of legitimate secondhand dealer businesses, this risk is present because these businesses process large volumes of goods and materials that can be the subject of theft. This chapter is intended to reduce this type of criminal activity by providing timely police awareness of such property transactions and by regulating the conduct of persons engaged in this business activity. These regulations are necessary and the need for the regulations outweighs the regulatory effect that may result from their adoption. (Ord. 5849 § 1, 2015; Ord. 5837 § 1, 2014).

(Ord. 5849 § 1, 2015; Ord. 5837 § 1, 2014).

7.90.080 Reporting of secondhand dealer transactions.
(1) Dealers shall provide to the Albany Police Department all required information as set forth by the Albany Police Department for each regulated property transaction (not including sales). The Chief of Police may designate the format for the transfer of this information and may direct that it be communicated to the Criminal Investigations Unit by means of mail, the Internet, or other computer media.

(a) In any such case that the Chief directs that the information be transmitted via computer media, the Chief may also direct the system that will be utilized in order to ensure conformity among all secondhand dealers.

7.90.090 Regulated property sale limitations.
(1) Regulated property is subject to the following limitations:

(a) Holding Period. Regulated property acquired by any secondhand dealer must be held for a period of 14 full days from the date of acquisition. Firearm transactions conducted by Federal firearm licensed dealers are exempt from the 14-day hold. Pawnbroker loan transactions are exempt from the 14-day hold requirements of this section because of the redeemable nature of the loans and the holding requirements in ORS Chapter 726. However, if the loan is converted to a buy by the pawnbroker within 14 days from the date of the pawn transaction, the difference between the original date of the pawn and the buy will count toward the 14-day hold requirement. All other provisions of this section remain in effect.

(b) Requirements of Held Property. All held property must remain in the same form as when received, must not be sold, dismantled or otherwise disposed of to allow for identification and examination by the Albany Police Department. Held property must be kept at the business location during this holding period so that it can be inspected during normal business hours (as provided in AMC 7.90.110). Held property, other than property on police hold, may be held in a place within public view, as long as the other requirements of this subsection (1)(b) are met.

(c) Consignment Sales. Items consigned to a secondhand dealer must be reported as purchases when accepted.

(d) Held property requirements do not apply if:

(i) The property is received from a secondhand dealer regulated by the City of Albany who has already satisfied the holding requirements of this chapter and the dealer records the original transaction report number on the transaction report completed for the new transaction; or

(ii) If a customer, who originally purchased property from a secondhand dealer, returns it to that dealer with the original receipt.

(2) Notwithstanding this section, the Chief of Police may determine that certain types of transactions pose a reduced risk of being an outlet for the sale of stolen property and therefore may modify the hold period and/or reporting requirements for those types of transactions. Those transactions and the modified requirements are described in AMC 7.90.120.

(3) Upon reasonable belief that an item of regulated property is the subject of a crime, any peace officer may provide notice to any dealer that a specifically described item of regulated property must be held in a separate police hold area for a period not to exceed 30 days from the date of notification, and is subject to the requirements of subsection (1)(b) of this section. The hold may be extended an additional 30 days upon notice provided to the dealer that additional time is needed to determine whether a specific item of regulated property is the subject of a crime. The dealer shall comply with the hold notice and notify the Albany Police Department Detective Unit of the hold notice no later than five calendar days from the day the notice was received, either by telephone, fax, email or in person. A dealer must notify the Detective Unit of his/her intent to dispose of any item of regulated property under police hold at least 10 days prior to doing so.

(a) A police hold area must meet the following criteria:

(i) Located out of public view and access; and

(ii) Marked “Police Hold”; and

(iii) Contain only items that have been put on police hold.

(b) If it is not possible or practical to move an item to or store an item in the police hold area, a dealer may submit a written request to the Chief of Police or his/her designee for approval to keep the item with other held property. Approval may be granted with the understanding that the item will be clearly marked as being on police hold and kept from public view and access.

(4) Upon probable cause that an item of property is the subject of a crime, the Chief of Police or his/her designee may take physical custody of the item or provide written notice to any dealer to hold such property for a period of time as determined by the Chief of Police, not to exceed the statute of limitations for the crime being investigated. Any property placed on hold pursuant to this subsection is subject to the requirements found in subsection (1)(b) of this section and will be maintained in the police hold area unless seized or released by the police. Seizure of property will be carried out in accordance with Oregon Revised Statutes.

(5) If a dealer acquires regulated property with serial numbers, personalized inscriptions or initials, or other identifying marks which have been destroyed or are illegible due to obvious normal use, the dealer shall continue to hold the property at the business location for a period of 90 full days after acquisition. The dealer must notify the Albany Police Department by writing “90 day hold” next to the item on the transaction report or by an electronic means approved by the Albany Police Department. The held property must conform to all the requirements found in subsection (1)(b) of this section.

(6) If a dealer receives information that leads to an objectively reasonable basis to believe that any property already at his/her business location has been previously lost or stolen, he/she must report that belief to the Albany Police Department by day’s end. The notice must include the transaction report number and any additional information regarding the name of the owner, if known.

(7) If a peace officer seizes any property from a dealer, the dealer must notify the Albany Police Department of the seizure no later than five calendar days from the day the seizure occurs. The dealer must provide the name of the agency, the name of the peace officer, the number of the receipt left for the seizure, and the seized property information. Notification to the Albany Police Department may be given by telephone, fax, email, or in person. (Ord. 5849 § 1, 2015; Ord. 5837 § 1, 2014).

7.90.100 Tagging regulated property for identification.
Dealers shall affix a tag to every item of regulated property, which must contain a unique, legible number. That unique number must either be the same as the transaction report number for that item or be referenced to the transaction report required by the Albany Police Department. After the holding period has expired, the transaction number must remain identifiable on the property until the sale of the property.

(1) After the applicable holding period has expired, hand tools, or items that are sold with other like items and have no identifiable numbers or markings need not remain tagged.

(2) After the applicable holding period has expired, items that are remanufactured need not remain tagged. (Ord. 5849 § 1, 2015; Ord. 5837 § 1, 2014).

7.90.110 Inspection of property and records.
Upon presentation of official identification, a dealer shall allow any representative of the Albany Police Department to enter the business location to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. The inspection will be for the limited purpose of inspecting the business location, regulated property, and related records as provided in this chapter. Except by mutual agreement with the dealer or by court order, any inspection under this section may occur only during the dealer’s normal business hours. (Ord. 5849 § 1, 2015; Ord. 5837 § 1, 2014).

(a) For any cause that would be grounds for denial of a license; or

(b) Upon finding that any violation of the provisions of this chapter, Federal, State or other local law has been committed and the violation is connected with the operation of the permitted business location so that the person in charge of the business location knew, or should reasonably have known, that violations or offenses were permitted to occur at the location by the dealer or any principal or employee engaged or employed in the management or operation of the business location; or

7.96.030 Commencement of proceedings.
(1) When the Chief of Police believes that a structure has been or is being used or maintained in violation of Section 7.96.020, the Chief of Police may commence proceedings to cause the closure of the structure as well as the imposition of civil penalties against any or all of its owners. In the event the Chief of Police wishes to commence proceedings:

(a) The Chief of Police shall notify the owner(s) of record in writing that the structure has been determined to be specified crime property. The notice shall contain the following information:

(i) The street address and a legal description sufficient for identification of the premises on which the structure is located;

If no address appears or is known to the Chief of Police, then a copy shall be mailed first class, postage prepaid, addressed to such person at the address of the structure believed to be specified crime property.

(c) A copy of the notice shall be served on the occupant of the structure if that person is different than the owner. Service of this notice shall occur not less than five days prior to the commencement of any judicial proceeding and be made either personally or by mailing a copy of the notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, to them at the structure.

Furthermore, a copy of the notice may be posted at the property if 10 days have elapsed from the service or mailing of the notice to the owner(s), and no contact has been received by the City from them during that period of time.

(d) The failure of any person or owner to receive actual notice of the determination by the Chief of Police shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this chapter.

(e) Actual notice of any owner or occupant or other person or entity to whom notice must be given is adequate to satisfy any notice requirement set forth in this chapter.

(2) Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth above, the Chief of Police shall send a copy of the notice to the City Manager as well as any other documentation which he/she believes supports the closure of the structure and the imposition of civil penalties. The City Manager may then authorize the City Attorney’s office to commence civil proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking the closure of the structure as well as the imposition of civil penalties against any or all of the owners thereof, and any such other relief as may be deemed appropriate.

(3) Nothing contained in subsection (2) above shall be construed to limit the ability of the City Attorney prior to the institution of judicial proceedings to enter into agreements with an owner willing to voluntarily abate the condition(s) giving rise to the violation. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.96.040 Commencement of actions – Burdens of proof, defenses –Mitigation of civil penalty.
(1) Except in a proceeding under Section 7.96.050, if after the commencement but prior to the trial of an action brought by the City pursuant to this chapter, an owner specifically stipulates with the City that they will pursue a course of action as the parties agree will necessarily abate the conditions giving rise to the violation(s), the City shall agree to stay proceedings for a period of not less than 10 nor more than 60 days. The owner or the City may thereafter petition the court for such additional like periods of time as may be necessary to complete the action(s) contemplated by the stipulation, however, in the event that the City reasonably believes the owner is not diligently pursuing the action(s) contemplated by the stipulation, it may then apply to the court for a release from the stay seeking some relief as is deemed appropriate.

(2) In an action seeking the closure of a structure as specified crime property, the City shall have the initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the structure is a specified crime property.

(3) In an action seeking civil penalties from an owner, the City shall have the initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the owner had knowledge of activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this chapter.

(4) It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a structure that the owner of a structure at the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the structure was being used or maintained as specified crime property.

(5) In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court shall consider any of the following factors, if appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable:

(a) The actions taken by the owner(s) to mitigate or correct the problem at the structure;

(b) The financial condition of the owner;

(c) Whether the problems at the structure was repeated or continuous;

(d) The magnitude or gravity of the problem;

(e) The economic or financial benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the owner(s) as a result of the conditions at the structure;

(f) The cooperativeness of the owner(s) with the City;

(g) The cost to the City of investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition;

(h) Any other factor deemed by the court to be relevant. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.96.050 Closure during pendency of action.
In the event that it is determined that the structure is an immediate threat to the public health, safety, and welfare, the City may apply to the court for such interim relief as it deems appropriate. In such an event, the notification procedures set forth at Section 7.96.030 and the limitation of Section 7.96.040(1) need not be complied with. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.96.060 Enforcement of closure order – Costs – Civil penalty.
(1) In the event that a court finds that a structure constitutes specified crime property as defined in this chapter, the court may order that it be closed for any period of up to one year, and that the owner(s) pay to the City a civil penalty of up to $500.00 for each day the owner had knowledge of activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this chapter.

(2) The court may also authorize the City to physically secure the structure against use or occupancy in the event that the owner(s) fail to do so within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the City to effect a closure shall be made an assessment lien upon the property. As used in this subsection, “costs” means those costs actually incurred by the City for the physical securing of the structure, as well as tenant relocation costs given pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not be obligated to pay tenant relocation costs.

(3) The City Recorder effecting the closure shall prepare a statement of costs and the City shall thereafter submit that statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the statement is made within the period prescribed by Oregon Rule of Civil Procedure 68, a certified copy of the statement, including a legal description of the property, shall be forwarded to the office of the City Recorder who thereafter shall enter the same in the City’s lien docket.

(4) Liens imposed by this chapter shall be collected in all respects as provided for street improvement liens, and shall bear interest at the rate of nine percent per year from 10 days after the entry in the lien docket.

(5) A tenant as defined by ORS 91.705(13) may, at the option of the City, be paid their reasonable relocation costs as those are determined by the City, if without actual notice the tenant moved into the structure after either:

(a) An owner or agent received notice of the Chief of Police’s determination pursuant to Section 7.96.030(1); or

(b) An owner or their agent received notice of an action brought pursuant to Section 7.96.040.

(6) Any person who is assessed the costs of closure and/or a civil penalty by the court shall be personally liable for the payment thereof to the City. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.96.070 Relief from closure order.
An owner of a structure determined to be specified crime property may obtain relief from the court’s judgment if:

(1) They appear and pay all costs associated with the proceedings under this chapter.

(2) They file a bond in such a place and form as the court may, by order, direct in an amount not less than the tax assessed value of the structure; and keep said bond in force for a period of not less than one year or for such period as the court directs.

(3) They enter into a stipulation with the City that they will immediately abate the conditions giving rise to the specified crime property and prevent the same from being established or maintained thereafter. The stipulation will then be made part of the court’s file. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.96.080 Attorneys fees.
In any action seeking the closure of the structure pursuant to this chapter, the court may, in its discretion, award attorneys fees to the prevailing party. (Ord. 4823, 1988).

7.98.010 Purpose.
The following chapter is established by the Albany City Council to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Albany by providing for the regulation of the planting, maintenance, and removal of trees in the City of Albany. Trees of significant size possess considerable environmental and aesthetic qualities beneficial to the community. These standards are intended to balance the preservation of significant trees as a benefit to the community with the individual right to use and enjoy property. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993).

7.98.020 Definitions.

(2) “City Forester” means the person designated by the Parks and Recreation Director to be the authorized representative in matters concerning the urban forest of the City of Albany.

(3) “Critical root zone” means the area around a tree where roots are critical to a tree’s survival. The critical root zone is estimated and expressed as a circle around the center of a tree’s trunk, where the radius is calculated by adding one foot for every one inch of trunk diameter plus the tree trunk’s radius; where all tree measurements are consistent with those for establishing tree circumference. For example, a tree with a tree circumference of 6.5 feet would have a trunk radius of 1 foot and diameter of 25 inches. The critical root zone would be a circle with a radius of 26 feet (1 ft + (25 in * 1 ft/in)) from the center of the tree’s trunk and have a total diameter of 52 feet.

(4) “Hazardous or dangerous tree” means a tree that is classified as a hazardous or dangerous tree by the City Tree Commission.

(5) “Person” means any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental entity, or any other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns.

(6) “Public trees” means trees located on property designated as a public park and trees located in public right-of-way not defined as street right-of-way.

(8) “Remove or removal” means to fell or sever a tree or the intentional use of any procedure, the natural result of which is to cause the death or substantial destruction of the tree. Removal does not in any context include normal pruning of trees.

(9) “Significant tree” means:

(a) Any heritage, rare, threatened, or endangered tree of any size as defined or designated under State or Federal law; or

(b) Any tree designated as significant by the City Tree Commission by virtue of heritage parameters or size.

(10) “Street trees” means trees located in public rights-of-way within the City.

(12) “Tree circumference” means the distance measured around the trunk of a tree at four and one-half feet above the mean ground level from the base of the trunk. The circumference of a tree with multiple trunks is determined by adding together the individual trunk circumferences greater than six inches. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993).

(5) All building material or other debris shall be kept at least four feet from any street tree or public tree.

(6) Unless removal is expressly authorized by a land use action or approval issued by the City of Albany, it shall be unlawful to remove any tree larger than or equal to 6.5 feet in circumference (approximately 25 inches in diameter), public or private, within the City of Albany city limits without first making application to the City of Albany and obtaining a permit or as otherwise authorized by this code.

7.98.050 Street trees – Classification and spacing.
(1) The City Tree Commission shall develop and maintain a list of approved trees for planting along streets. The trees will be listed in three size classes based on mature height: small (under 30 feet); medium (30 to 50 feet); and large (over 50 feet). Lists of trees not suitable for planting will also be created by the City Tree Commission.

(2) The City Tree Commission shall develop criteria on the spacing of street trees. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.030).

The distance street trees may be planted from curbs or curblines and sidewalks will be in accordance with the three size classes listed in AMC 7.98.050(1). No tree may be planted in a planting strip with a width of less than the following: small trees, three feet; medium trees, five feet; and large trees, eight feet. The exception to this rule shall be when curb and sidewalk are protected by a chemical or mechanical barrier approved by the City Forester. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993).

7.98.070 Distance from street corners and fire hydrants.
The City Tree Commission shall establish standards for planting street trees in vision clearance areas. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993).

7.98.080 Planting in roadways having no gutter or curb.
No trees, shrubs, or plantings more than 18 inches in height above the adjacent grade shall be planted in the public right-of-way abutting roadways having no established curb or gutter, unless approved by the City Engineer. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5841 § 2, 2014; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.130).

7.98.090 Tree topping.
It shall be unlawful for any person to top any street tree, public tree, or heritage tree. Topping shall be defined as the cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches in diameter within the tree’s crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal top. Trees severely damaged by storms or other causes or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where normal pruning practices are impractical may be exempted at the determination of the City Forester.

Such declaration shall prescribe dates during which permits are not required, but in no event may any single declaration exceed 21 days.

(2) Additional tree removal permits are not required for any trees that have been authorized for removal in an approved site plan review processed in accordance with the Albany Development Code. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.150).

7.98.110 Private utility tree policy.
Upon obtaining a permit from the City Forester, a private utility maintaining its utility system in a street may prune or cause to be pruned, using proper arboricultural practices in accordance with said permit, any tree located in or overhanging the street that interferes with any light, pole, wire, cable, appliance or apparatus used in connection with or as a part of the utility system; but no tree shall be pruned without the consent of the abutting owner until the utility shall have given a written, printed, or verbal notice to the owner or occupant of the premises. The City Forester must be notified before any work proceeds. In cases of emergency, the consent of the abutting property owner may not be required, but notification of any work completed must be reported to the City Forester. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.040).

7.98.120 Heritage trees.
The City Tree Commission may designate certain trees as “heritage trees” within the City with the consent of the owner(s) of record. The purpose of the heritage tree designation is to recognize, foster appreciation of, and protect trees having significance to the community. The City Tree Commission shall have the authority to determine, select, and identify such trees that qualify as heritage trees. Once a tree is designated as a heritage tree, it will remain so unless it becomes necessary to classify it as a dangerous tree and removed as such. Heritage trees may not be removed without the express consent of the City Tree Commission. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.050).

7.98.130 Pruning, corner clearance.
Every owner of any tree, located on private property, overhanging any street or right-of-way within the City shall prune the branches so the branches shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view of any street intersection, traffic sign, or traffic control device, and so that there shall be a clear space of 14 feet above street surface, and eight feet above the sidewalk surface. Said owner shall remove all dead, diseased, or dangerous trees, or broken or decayed limbs that constitute a menace to the safety of the public. The City shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the light from any street lamp, or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or sign or vision clearance area at intersections and driveways. Tree limbs that grow within 10 feet of high voltage electrical conductors shall be maintained clear of such conductors by the electric utility company in compliance with any applicable franchise agreements and AMC 7.98.110, Private utility tree policy. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.080).

7.98.140 Dead or dangerous tree removal on private property.
The City Tree Commission shall have the right to cause the pruning or removal of any dead or dangerous trees on private property within the City, when such trees constitute a hazard to life and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitute an imminent threat to other trees within the City. The City Manager or his designee will notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their own expense within 30 days after the date of service of notice. The failure of the property owner to prune or remove said dead or dangerous tree within 30 days of the delivery of notice shall be deemed a violation of the Albany Municipal Code, and, in addition to prosecution of said violation, the City Manager or his authorized representative may at any time thereafter prune or remove said dead or dangerous tree and assess the cost against the property as provided hereafter.

(1) Deadline to Remove Dead or Dangerous Trees. Within 30 days after the date of service of the notice, the owner of the property shall cause the tree determined to be dead or dangerous to be removed.

(2) Requested Removal by City. At the request of the owner, the City Manager or his/her designate will cause said dead or dangerous tree to be removed for a fee sufficient to cover the direct cost plus 30 percent for administrative overhead with a minimum fee.

(3) Removal by City. The City Manager or his/her designate may cause to be removed any tree determined to be dead or dangerous at any time following the deadline for removal set forth at subsection (1) of this section. The cost of the removal of said dead or dangerous tree shall be as calculated in subsection (2) of this section and will be a charge to the owner of the property and will become a lien against the property.

(4) Right to Enter. In the event that it becomes necessary for the City Manager or his/her designate to undertake the removal of the said dead or dangerous tree from any private property within the City, the designate of the City Manager shall have the right at reasonable times to enter into or upon said property to remove said dead or dangerous tree.

(5) Cost to Become a Lien. Upon completion of the removal of a dead or dangerous tree under these provisions and in the event that the fee is not paid within 30 days thereafter, the City Manager or his/her designate shall file with the City Recorder and thereafter present to the City Council an itemized statement of the cost thereof. After providing the notice and hearing set forth below, the City Council shall, by ordinance, determine the reasonableness of said statements of costs and adjust the same, and thereupon the amount of said statements as approved by the City Council shall be an obligation owed to the City of Albany by the owner or owners of the real property involved, and the City shall have a lien upon said real property for such sum and the lien shall be entered in the lien docket and enforced against said property in the same manner provided for the enforcement of City liens.

(6) Notice and Hearing. Prior to the adoption of the ordinance referred to above, the City Manager or his/her designate shall cause a notice to be mailed by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the record owner or owners of any real property upon which the City proposes to impose a lien for the costs of the removal of a tree determined to be dead or dangerous. This notice shall be mailed to the owner or owners of the real property in question at the address designated on the Linn or Benton County real property tax assessment rolls. An error in the name of the property owner or owners shall not void the assessment nor will a failure to receive the notice of the proposed assessment render the assessment void and any lien imposed pursuant to this section shall be a valid lien against the property. The notice shall contain a summary of the costs which are proposed to be assessed against the owner’s property and shall advise of the City’s intent to assess said costs against the real property upon which the work was performed and shall further advise the owner or owners of their right to a hearing before the City Council concerning the proposed assessment and the date and time of said hearing.

(7) Summary Abatement. The procedure provided in this section is not exclusive but is in addition to abatement procedure provided by other ordinances. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.1100, 7.98.110).

7.98.150 City’s power and authority is permissive, not mandatory.
Under no circumstances shall this chapter obligate the City of Albany, or any employee or agent thereof, to undertake any particular action to enforce any of the terms of this chapter. All authority granted to the City, its agents and employees, shall be permissive and not mandatory, and the City, its agents and employees shall have complete discretion to determine whether or not enforcement action of any type should be undertaken and if so, the nature of the enforcement action itself. The remedies provided in these regulations shall be cumulative and in addition to any and all remedies available at law or equity. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5181 § 1, 1995. Formerly 7.98.105).

7.98.160 Arborist certification.
A tree contractor shall have on staff an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture to be qualified to prune, treat, or remove street or public trees within the City. The certified arborist must oversee all pruning work and certify that all work meets the City’s pruning specifications. If a certified arborist is not on the staff of the contractor, the City Forester, applying criteria developed by the City Tree Commission, must approve the tree service contractor before the work begins. In cases where the professional opinion of a certified arborist differs from that of the City Forester, the City Forester may refer the matter to the City Tree Commission for a decision. Nothing in this section shall prevent the employees of public agencies who are not certified arborists from pruning trees on the grounds of those public agencies. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993).

7.98.170 Permit approval.
The Parks and Recreation Director or designee shall approve or conditionally approve permits when it has been demonstrated that one or more criteria in AMC 7.98.180 have been met. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001).

7.98.180 Tree removal permit criteria.
(1) Tree removal will be approved when:

(a) It has been determined by the City Forester or by a certified arborist, without objection from the City Forester, that a tree is hazardous, dangerous, or significantly impacted by aggressive pests or pathogens, with a potential to spread and no other viable options are reasonably available to minimize hazard or alleviate risk of pest or pathogen to spread; or

(b) A logging permit issued by the Oregon Department of Forestry has been submitted to the City Forester; or

(c) Trees are overcrowded and it is determined by the City Forester that removal will have a positive impact on the overall site and will not compromise the health of residual trees; or

(d) When necessary pursuant to a building permit for an improvement for which a site plan approval is not required; or

(e) Variance Clause. When unique circumstances specific to the applicant’s situation have been expressed in writing with the application and the City Tree Commission has approved removal. Unique circumstances that could allow for a variance may include but are not necessarily limited to:

(i) A tree that is causing significant negative impacts to improvements or personal property;

(ii) Personal health reasons such as severe allergic conditions; or

(iii) The tree is invasive, having significant negative impact to surrounding vegetation.

(2) In all other cases, a tree removal permit shall be denied. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001).

7.98.200 Conditional permit approval.
The City Forester may specify conditions to the approval of tree removal. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the methods for protecting residual trees identified in AMC 7.98.215 and/or a requirement for certified arborist oversight during construction activities, specific construction methods such as critical root zone protection and protective fencing, post-removal site cleanup, maintenance of replacement trees, and/or post-construction evaluation of tree health. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001).

7.98.205 Permit fees.
Permit application fees for removal permits shall be established by Council resolution. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001).

7.98.210 Appeals.
Any person who is denied a permit or is granted a permit with conditions may appeal the denial or imposition of condition by filing a written notice of appeal to the City Forester. The notice must be received within 15 calendar days of the date of denial or the date of issuance of the permit with conditions imposed. The appeal must describe in writing the specific basis upon which the appellant asserts that the decision was in error. The specific basis may include but not necessarily be limited to private need, which is unique to the property owner’s circumstances as stated in AMC 7.98.180(1)(e). The City Tree Commission will review all appeals. Appeals of decisions made by the City Tree Commission are made to the City Council in accordance with AMC 2.23.060. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001).

7.98.215 Protecting residual trees.
When removing trees under a permit or site plan approval, precautions shall be made to protect residual trees and tree roots from damaging agents during and after the removal process. The following tree protection specifications should be followed to the maximum extent feasible for all projects with protected existing trees:

(1) Within the drip line of any protected existing tree, there shall be no cut or fill over a four-inch depth unless a qualified arborist or forester has evaluated and approved the disturbance.

(2) Prior to and during construction, an orange fence shall be erected around all protected existing trees that is a minimum of four feet tall, secured with metal T-posts, no closer than six feet from the trunk or within the drip line, whichever is greater. There shall be no storage or movement of equipment, material, debris, or fill within the fenced tree protection zone.

(3) During the construction stage of development, the applicant shall prevent the cleaning of equipment or material or the storage and disposal of waste material such as paints, oils, solvents, asphalt, concrete, motor oil, or any other material harmful to the life of a tree within the drip line of any protected tree or group of trees.

(4) No damaging attachment, wires, signs, or permits may be fastened to any protected tree.

(5) Large property areas containing protected trees and separated from construction or land clearing areas, road rights-of-way, and utility easements may be “ribboned off,” rather than erecting protective fencing around each tree as required in subsection (2) of this section. This may be accomplished by placing metal T-post stakes a maximum of 50 feet apart and tying ribbon or rope from stake-to-stake along the outside perimeters of such areas being cleared.

(6) The installation of utilities, irrigation lines, or any underground fixture requiring excavation deeper than six inches shall be accomplished by boring under the root system of protected existing trees at a minimum depth of 24 inches. The auger distance is established from the face of the tree (outer bark) and is scaled from tree diameter at breast height as described in the table below.

7.98.220 Penalties.
Any person violating any of the provisions of this code relating to the planting, pruning, trimming, or removal of trees shall be strictly liable for such violations and punished under the general penalty provided for in Chapter 1.04 AMC. Proof of a specific criminal intent shall not be required. Any violation of this chapter which affects an individual tree shall be a separate offense. (Ord. 5948 § 1 (Exh. A), 2020; Ord. 5712 § 1, 2009; Ord. 5495 § 1, 2001; Ord. 5096 § 2, 1993. Formerly 7.98.170).

The Council shall not extend or furnish sewer service facilities to any residential, commercial or industrial property when the property is without the City limits and is contiguous to the City limits and eligible for annexation within the City limits, except pursuant to the health hazard exception set forth in subsection (4) of this section. The health hazard exception and the findings required therefor are unique to this section and shall have no applicability to any other provision of this code nor shall it entitle the affected property owner(s) to any service, benefit, or discount applicable to health hazards as discussed in other sections of the Albany Municipal Code.

(2) Users. No use or benefits of the sanitary sewer system or wastewater treatment plant of the City shall be extended to or made available to any property not within the corporate limits of the City, except under a contractual agreement with another municipality, service district, or the owners of said property and only then when such property is not located so as to be eligible for annexation to the City at the time the sewer service is requested.

(3) Contract. Use and benefits of the wastewater treatment system and wastewater treatment plant may be granted to property outside of the City on a contractual basis only. For individual property owners the contract shall require that the property owner shall annex his property to the City at the earliest date that the same becomes eligible for annexation under the laws of the State. The contract may further require for financing of the sewer extension, termination of service of the contract if any conditions are not met and any other requirements which are to be deemed in the best interest of the City.

(4) Health Hazard Exception. The Council may authorize the extension of sanitary sewer facilities to property outside of the City limits upon finding that all elements of the following criteria have been met:

(a) The extension will serve only existing residential use(s);

(b) The extension is necessary to mitigate an existing hazard to human health resulting from a failing or inadequate sewage disposal system;

(c) The health hazard cannot practicably be mitigated without connection to the City sanitary sewer system;

(d) Provisions have been or will be made to connect a residential user to the sanitary system at no cost to the City;

(e) The owner(s) of the property to be served pursuant to this exception has executed an irrevocable application for annexation, on a form provided by the City, whereby the City may submit the question of annexation to the voters at any election(s). The property must be contiguous to the City limits and within the urban growth boundary. The annexation application shall not require the owner(s) to pay for the cost of the election. The application shall be binding upon the heirs and subsequent assigns of the owner;

(f) The property owner has tendered the required sewer system development charges to the City and waived any objection thereto;

(g) The property owner has waived, in writing, any objection to a sewer rate differential which may exist, or may be subsequently created, whereby sewer users outside the City are charged a reasonable premium over and above that charged to City residents.

(5) Limitation on Subsequent Sewer Utilization in the Event of Health Hazard Exception.

The City of Albany is hereby directed to collect the fees and charges provided in this chapter from each owner or tenant of property which disposes of wastewater, whether in the City system or otherwise, and monthly each owner or tenant shall be charged the rates set forth in accordance with the provisions of AMC 10.01.070 and 10.01.080.

(1) Administrative Costs. The administrative costs for collection of all fees and charges shall be paid from the sewer fund.

(2) Delinquency. Such sewer use charges or sewer system development charges levied in accordance with this chapter shall be a debt due to the City and shall be a lien upon the property. If this debt is not paid within 30 days after it is due and payable, it shall be deemed delinquent and may be recovered by civil action in the name of the City against the property owner, the person, or both. Change of ownership or occupancy of premises found delinquent shall not be cause for reducing or eliminating the debt due.

(3) Means of Collection – Interest. Should the City find it necessary to collect any delinquent fees or charges for sewer connection or sewer use, it shall be entitled to use any means provided by the laws of the State or permitted by the Charter and ordinances of the City, or any delinquencies in payment of either sewer system development charges or sewer use charges may be certified to the Tax Assessor of Linn County for collection in the manner and as provided by ORS 454.225. Fees and charges which are delinquent shall draw interest at nine percent per annum. Interest shall not be charged if the account is brought current within 60 days of becoming due and payable. If not so paid, interest shall accrue from the date the debt is due. Any interest charge due hereunder which is not paid when due may be recovered in an action at law by the City.

(4) Penalty for Certification. In the event it becomes necessary to certify the service charges established because of the nonpayment therefor, there shall be added to the charges a penalty in the amount of 10 percent thereof and the same shall bear, when certified, interest at the rate of nine percent per annum from the date of such certification.

(5) Hearing Rights. Customers shall have the opportunity, if they do not agree with the billing, to have a hearing on their account. The hearing shall be held by a hearings officer appointed by the Finance Director. The hearings officer’s decision shall be binding. Notice to the utility by the customer of his/her request for a hearing must be given in writing with an explanation of why the customer feels that the bill is incorrect. If a hearing is held and the hearings officer finds in favor of the customer, any or all appropriate charges may be returned to the customer or customer’s account based upon his/her findings. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5541, 2002; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.095 Adjustments, back-billing, credits and refunds.
(1) The utility may make adjustments, back-bill, apply credits, pay refunds, or waive fees and charges in accordance with City Council policy. If no Council policy exists, the utility may make adjustments where it is deemed necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the utility. A full explanation of the reason for the adjustment or refund must be filed with the office records and will be made available upon request. Refunds are to be made to the party that made the payment.

When the utility determines that a customer has been mistakenly charged too much for sewer services, the utility will apply a credit to the account based on the date the error first occurred, the date the current customer became responsible for the bill, or a period not to exceed six years, whichever is less. If the date cannot be reasonably determined, the utility will estimate the amount of the credit based on a period not to exceed six years.

When the utility determines that a customer has not been charged or has not been charged enough for sewer services, the utility will back-bill the account based on the date the error first occurred, the date the current customer became responsible for the bill, or a period not to exceed six years,

whichever is less. If the date cannot be reasonably determined, the utility will estimate the bill for a period not to exceed one year. Customers who receive such a delayed bill will be offered the opportunity to make arrangements for installment payments.

(2) Nonregistering Meters. The utility may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The sewer bill will be calculated using an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer’s prior use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions.

(3) Adjustments Due to Leaks. Where a water leak exists underground between the meter and the building during the monitoring period for wastewater flow charges, the utility may allow for an adjustment on the wastewater variable charges. In order to qualify for a credit, the leak must be large enough to cause the total consumption to be greater than one and one-half the average amount that has been previously charged to the premises, and the leak must be repaired within 30 days after the customer has been notified of such leak.

For most customers, the variable charges will be adjusted to reflect past winter water consumption records for the property. For customers that are billed based on actual monthly water consumption, the variable charges will be calculated using an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer’s prior use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions. Where past water consumption records are not available, the variable charges will be adjusted to reflect the average water consumption for similar accounts.

No adjustment to the sewer bill will be allowed where it is determined that excess water consumption is due to the apparent continued waste of water due to a negligent failure to repair a leak. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5541, 2002).

10.01.100 Public sewers required.
(1) Connection Requirements. All property with buildings or structures normally used or inhabited by people and such property is located within 300 feet of a sanitary sewer shall be required to have or make a connection to such sewer.

(2) Malfunctioning or Failing Septic Systems. All property with structures or buildings normally used or inhabited by people that is served by septic tanks, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal facilities that are found to be failing and/or causing contamination of soil surface, surface water, or groundwater shall connect to any public sanitary sewer system ordered and constructed to alleviate such contamination. When a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable materials. No repairs, expansions, or modifications to septic tanks, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal systems shall be allowed when the property being served by said systems is within 300 feet of sewer system.

(3) Declared Health Hazard. All property with structures or buildings normally used or inhabited by people that is located within territory declared by the Oregon State Health Division or the Linn or Benton County Health Department to contain conditions causing a danger to public health shall connect to any public sanitary sewer system ordered and constructed to alleviate such health hazard. When a public sewer becomes available to a property served by a private sewage disposal system, a direct connection shall be made to the public sewer in compliance with this chapter, and any septic tanks, cesspools, or similar private sewage disposal facilities shall be abandoned and filled with suitable materials.

(4) Polluted Discharges. It shall be unlawful to discharge to any natural outlet within the City or in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, any sanitary sewage, industrial waste, or other polluted water, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with State and Federal laws and any provisions of this chapter.

(5) New Service Connections. The utility may furnish and install a service of such size and at such location as the applicant requests; provided:

(a) The location is such that the utility has in place a sewer main of sufficient size to provide service without detriment to existing customers. In all cases, the final location of the proposed service shall be subject to approval by the utility.

(b) That such a sewer main is adjacent to and extends along the full length of the property frontage along the right-of-way.

(c) Where a parcel has more than 300 feet of frontage along the right-of-way and the parcel is being developed in phases and the sewer main is not immediately needed for the full length of the parcel to facilitate service to other properties or to meet other utility system needs, the requirement of subsection (5)(b) of this section may be reduced, when approved, by delaying the requirement for a sewer main adjacent to that portion of the parcel that remains as an undeveloped portion of a future phase. Such delay, if authorized, is contingent upon the owners of the parcel signing a waiver of remonstrance agreement that commits the parcel to participate in a future local improvement district for the extension of sewer main(s).

(d) Where the property abuts more than one street or right-of-way, sewer mains shall be extended for the full length of the property frontages along the rights-of-way for all frontages, unless it is determined that the extensions on the frontages from which service is not being taken is not currently needed to facilitate service to other properties, and that said sewer mains may be completed at a future time. Such delay, if authorized, is contingent upon the owners of the parcel signing a waiver of remonstrance agreement that commits the parcel to participate in a future local improvement district for the extension of sewer main(s).

(e) The utility shall have sole authority in determining any and all conditions necessary for the provision of service to a property. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.110 Main extensions.
(1) A main extension and/or special facilities shall be required to service all property which cannot obtain service as outlined in AMC 10.01.100(5).

(2) The following rules shall apply to all extensions:

(a) The minimum size of the sewer main to be installed shall be eight inches in diameter where a larger size is not needed to provide an adequate system, conform with the size of existing mains, meet future needs, or conform to the size specified by the utility’s sewer system facility plan.

(b) All sewer mains shall be public, installed in public rights-of-way or public utility easements. The normal routing for the sewer main extension shall be in a dedicated street right-of-way.

(c) In areas of service below the main system service elevation, special facilities (e.g., pump station) will normally be required in addition to main extensions to provide service.

(d) Financing of Extensions. There are two basic means of financing main extensions, as outlined below.

(i) Total Project Cost. Under this method, the developer is required to pay the total cost of the project. An estimate covering approximate total costs related to the project may be supplied by the utility. If developers install the project themselves or through their own contractor and supply materials, a cash advance sufficient to cover the estimated cost for the utility services needed on the project may be required prior to starting the project. Upon completion of the project, actual costs will be computed and an adjustment made to the contractor or to the utility, as appropriate. In the case of complex projects (projects involving disruption of or cutting into existing roadways, utilities, or pedestrian ways, or other projects where partial completion of the project could result in expense to the utility), the developer may be required to supply a bond to cover the estimated cost of engineering and construction.

(ii) Local Improvement Districts. Local improvement districts may be formed and bonds sold to fund main extensions and special facility projects.

(e) Installers of any and all sewer lines or appurtenances must meet minimum standards. These standards shall include, but are not limited to, insurance requirements, bonding requirements, and experience in the field of sewer line installation. The sewer lines must be installed in accordance with the utility’s specifications which are available upon request. Unless the work is being performed under a City contract, all main extensions shall require a “permit to construct public facilities” and the payment of the associated permit fee. The permit fee shall be 2.5 percent of the total construction cost unless otherwise set by Council resolution.

(f) If developers install and purchase the material themselves, they must guarantee the project for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the project by the utility. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.120 Service lateral construction.
In order to regulate connections to the public sewers, to ensure the proper installation of connections to the public sewers, and to ensure the proper construction of private service laterals, the following regulations shall apply:

(1) Encroachment Permit Required. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining an encroachment permit.

(2) Application and Fee. The owner of the service lateral or his agent shall make application for an encroachment permit to the Building Department. The permit application shall be supplemented by any drawings, specifications, or other information considered pertinent. A permit and inspection fee shall be paid to the City at the time the application is filed.

(3) Installation Costs. All costs and expense incident to the installation of the service lateral shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation.

(4) Conformation to State Codes. All service lateral construction shall, at a minimum, meet the requirements of the Plumbing Code and the Occupational Safety and Health Code of the State of Oregon. The City may establish more stringent requirements when it is in the best interest of the City to do so.

(5) Size, Slope, Location, and Length. The size, slope, and location of service laterals within public rights-of-way and easements shall be subject to the approval of the Public Works Director and shall have a diameter of not less than four inches and a slope of not less than one-eighth inch per foot. Where private service laterals will exceed 100 feet in length, as measured from the public main to the structure, the Public Works Director may require extension of public sanitary sewers into the interior of the property.

(6) Inspection. All excavations for service laterals in the public right-of-way shall be open trench unless approved by the Public Works Director; and no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected. The owner of the service lateral shall notify the City when the sewer is ready for inspection. The connection to the public sewer shall be made only under the supervision of the Public Works Director or his representatives.

(7) Connection to Public Sewer. The sewer connection shall be made at the “Y” branch. If the “Y” branch is not used or is not available, the owner shall, at his expense, install a “Y” branch in the public sewer or with prior approval of the Public Works Director, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer and a “sewer boot” connection may be made. Under no circumstances shall the connection pipe extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. All connections shall be made secure and watertight. If necessary in the opinion of the utility, the property owner may be required to connect to a manhole or may be required to install a manhole on the sewer main as a condition of providing service to the property. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.130 Service lateral maintenance.
(1) Each property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the building sewer(s) from the structure or facility served to the connection with the POTW. “Maintenance” shall include, but is not limited to, removal of any blockages, debris, grease, tree roots, and other material as required to ensure a free flow of wastewater through the lateral; disconnection of abandoned services from the public sewer; and prevention of unpolluted water from entering the service lateral.

(2) “Unpolluted water” includes, but is not limited to, storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff, parking lot and subsurface drainage, noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Public Works Director. Blockages found within the public right-of-way or easement that are the result of structural failure of the pipe shall be the responsibility of the City as detailed in AMC 10.01.132. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.132 Service lateral replacement.
(1) Lateral Replacement within Public Rights-of-Way. The City shall repair or replace structural failures of sanitary sewer service laterals in public rights-of-way when, in the judgment of the Public Works Director, repair or replacement of the service lateral is warranted.

(2) Lateral Replacement on Private Property.

(a) Public Improvement Projects. When, in the judgment of the Public Works Director, replacement of a service lateral is required concurrent with a public improvement project, the City may fund replacement of sanitary sewer service laterals on private property from the property line to the structure. The Public Works Director shall consider such factors as the cause of the failure; the age of the lateral; pipe material, length and condition; ease of repair; conflict with existing structures and improvements; budget authority; and competing priorities in determining the scope and extent of City-funded, private service lateral replacements on private property. City-funded replacements of sanitary sewer laterals on private property shall meet City construction standards and shall be contingent on full and complete consent of the property owner.

(b) Other Replacements. Structural failure of building sewers on private property may be eligible for one-time-only, City-funded replacement. When, in the judgment of the Public Works Director, replacement of a building sewer is required for properties directly fronting a public sanitary sewer, the City may replace the building sewer on private property from the property line to the structure. Properties that do not directly front a public sanitary sewer may only be eligible for City participation in replacement of a portion of the building sewer.

(c) The Public Works Director shall consider criteria given in subsection (2)(a) of this section in determining the scope and extent of the building sewer replacements. City replacement of building sewer replacements shall be contingent upon prior application and approval by the Public Works Director. Any costs incurred or work completed prior to filing an application and receiving approval for replacement shall be ineligible for reimbursements. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999).

10.01.133 Assistance in removal of unpolluted waters.
It is the policy of the City to work with property owners in a cooperative manner to remove extraneous flows listed in AMC 10.01.040(1)(j) from the sanitary sewer collection system.

(1) Separation of Roof, Footing and Other Unpolluted Water. The City shall assist property owners disconnecting roof, footing, area and other unpolluted water sources from the sanitary sewer through funding and installation of curb cuts, and drain lines from the face of curb to the property line. The property owner shall be responsible for connection to the drain line at the property line, permit fees and all improvements on private property. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999).

10.01.134 Basement flooding protection loans.
The City hereby adopts the following loan program to assist property owners protect their basements from occasional damages due to surcharges within the sanitary sewer system:

(1) Loan Program. A 10-year loan may be available to property owners at an interest rate established by City Council resolution. The purpose of the loan is to assist property owners in financing improvements that will protect basements from damage that may occur as a direct result of surcharging of the public sanitary sewer system. The loan program shall not be available to properties subject to basement flooding for causes unrelated to surcharging of the public sanitary sewer system, including, but not limited to, groundwater seepage and localized storm- and surface-water flooding.

(2) Application. The owner of the property or authorized agent shall make application for a basement flooding protection loan to the Public Works Department. The application shall be supplemented by any drawings, specifications, or other information as requested by the City.

(3) Loan Requirements. Applicants must have fee title ownership of the property, or equitable interest in the property under an instrument of trust or installment purchase contract. To qualify for the loan, improvements on the property must have been constructed prior to January 1, 1999, property taxes must be current at the time of loan closing, and the property owner shall provide evidence of sufficient hazard insurance to cover all City loans and superior liens.

(4) Loan Security. The obligation to repay the loan shall be secured by a lien being placed against the property to be improved. Owners purchasing under contract and title holder(s) shall jointly execute lien agreements.

(5) Loan Repayment. The loan shall be repaid over 10 years, monthly or semiannually, from the date of entry of the lien into the lien docket. The interest rate for the loan shall be established by City Council resolution. A basement flooding protection loan shall be repaid in full if the property is sold or refinanced before the loan is repaid and may be repaid in part or in full at any time without penalties. The lien shall not be subject to subordination.

(6) Collection of Delinquent Loan Payments. The method and schedule for collection of delinquent loan payments shall be established by City Council resolution.

(7) Eligible Costs. Eligible loan expenses shall be determined by the City on a case-by-case basis and shall be limited to only the work necessary to protect a basement from flooding that is directly related to surcharging of the public sanitary sewer system. Expenses incident to the installation of basement flooding protection, including title reporting fees, lien filing fees, permit fees, and improvement expenses to install a backwater valve, ejector pump, sump pump, yard leaders for rain gutters, rerouting of basement plumbing, and related expenses may be eligible for a basement flooding protection loan. Loans shall be available only after completion of all work, final approval of eligible loan costs, and placement of a lien securing the loan.

(8) Maximum Loan Amount. The maximum loan amount shall be established by City Council resolution.

(9) Indemnification. The owner shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation.

(10) Service Lateral Replacement. When, in the judgment of the Public Works Director, replacement of a building sewer is required concurrent with basement flooding protection, the City may replace the building sewer in accordance with AMC 10.01.132(2)(b). The Public Works Director shall consider criteria given in AMC 10.01.132(2)(a) in determining the scope and extent of replacement of the building sewer. City-funded replacements of sanitary sewer laterals on private property shall meet City construction standards and shall be contingent on full and complete consent of the property owner. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999).

10.01.138 Appeal process.
Appeals to policy issues concerning sewer lateral maintenance, including the basement flooding loan protection program and service lateral replacements, shall be made to the City Council. The City Council defers final decision authority for technical issues relating to sewer lateral maintenance to the Public Works Director. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5415 § 1, 1999).

10.01.140 Protection from damage.
No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the City of Albany’s wastewater treatment system. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.150 Nuisance.
(1) Any property with buildings and structures normally used or inhabited by people and which buildings or structures are not connected to a public sewer system and such property is located within 300 feet of a public sanitary sewer and for which a nonconnection permit has not been issued is declared a nuisance and may be abated as hereinafter set forth.

(2) The abatement procedures set forth herein are not exclusive but are in addition to abatement procedures provided by other ordinances, statutes, and common law. Nor are these abatement procedures a penalty for violating this code. Rather, these procedures are a supplement to all existing penalties. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.160 Notice to abate.
(1) If the Director or his designate determines that a nuisance exists pursuant to AMC 10.01.150(1) and, in the exercise of his discretion, that the nuisance should be abated, he shall cause a notice to be posted on said property directing the property owner to abate said nuisance.

(2) At the time of posting, the Director or his designate shall cause a copy of the aforesaid notice to be forwarded by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to the record owner or owners of said property, or their agent at the address designated on the Linn County real property tax assessment rolls.

(3) The notice to abate shall contain:

(a) A description of the real property, by street address or otherwise, upon which the nuisance exists.

(b) A direction to abate the nuisance by a specified time which may be set by the Director or his designate. Said time shall be at least 30 days and at most 180 days.

(c) A description of the nuisance.

(d) A statement that unless the nuisance is corrected, the City may abate the nuisance and the cost of abatement, including but not limited to, the costs of all permits, system development charges, construction fees and material costs shall be assessed against the real property.

(4) Upon completion of the posting and mailing, the persons doing said posting and mailing shall execute and file certificates stating the date and place of mailing and posting respectively.

(5) An error in the name or address of the property owner/owners/agent shall not make the notice void and in such case the notice shall still be sufficient. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.170 Abatement procedures.
(1) In the event that the property in question has not been lawfully connected to a public sanitary sewer nor obtained a nonconnection permit within the time specified in the notice of abatement, the Director or his designate may cause said property to be connected to the public sewer.

(2) The aforesaid connection may be completed by the City or by private contractors hired by the City for the completion of said work.

(3) The City, or the aforesaid private contractor and all authorized employees and agents thereof, shall have the right at reasonable times to enter into or upon the property in question as necessary to complete said connection.

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Director or his designate finds that the property has not been connected to the public sewer within the time specified in the notice, but finds that the property owner/owners are making a good faith effort to complete said connection, the Director or his designate may grant one or more 30-day extensions upon the written request from the property owner/ owners in question. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.180 Assessment of costs.
(1) Upon completion of the connection pursuant to the foregoing abatement procedures, the Director or his designate shall prepare a recap of all costs incurred in construction of the sewer connection in question. Said costs shall include the costs of all permits and system development charges customarily charged by the City at the time of said connection. To this sum shall be added 15 percent to help defer the City’s engineering, legal and administrative expenses incurred in the aforesaid connection.

(2) A summary of costs shall be mailed by registered or certified mail to the same person or persons to whom the notice of abatement was sent as per AMC 10.01.160(2), or their successors in title, and shall advise of the City’s intent to assess said costs against the real property and shall further advise the owner/owners of their right to a hearing before the City Council prior to assessment upon receipt by the Director, within 30 days of the date of mailing, of a written request for hearing.

(3) If the costs of abatement are not paid to the City within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the summary of costs, said summary shall be presented to the City Council and if the Council finds said costs to be reasonable, the Council shall pass an ordinance directing the amount of said costs be entered in the docket of City liens; and upon such entry being made, said costs shall constitute a lien upon the property in question. Prior to passing said ordinance, the Council will afford the property owner/owners a right to be heard by the Council if a written request for hearing has been received by the Director within 30 days of the date of mailing of the aforesaid summary of costs.

(4) The lien shall be enforced in the same manner as liens for street improvements and shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Council at the time of the ordinance referred to above. The interest shall commence from the date of entry of the lien in the lien docket and shall have priority over all other liens and assessments to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(5) An error in the name of the property owner/ owners/agents shall not void the assessment, nor will a failure to receive the notice of the proposed assessment render the assessment void, but it shall remain a valid lien against the property. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.185 Hauled waste.
All hauled waste must be discharged at the City of Albany wastewater treatment plant in accordance with rules and regulations shown in Chapter 10.06 AMC. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5165 § 2, 1994).

10.01.210 Penalties.
Willful or continued violation of any of the provisions herein established shall be deemed a misdemeanor and anyone convicted of such misdemeanor shall be subject to penalties as provided in AMC 1.04.010. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

10.01.220 Severability.
If any provision, paragraph, word, section, or article of this chapter is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections, and chapters shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect. (Ord. 5636, 2006; Ord. 5016, 1992).

This chapter provides for the orderly and efficient functioning of the City of Albany publicly owned treatment works, through regulation of discharges into the wastewater treatment system by enforcement of administrative regulations.

(1) Purpose and Policy. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the wastewater treatment system and enables the City of Albany (City) to protect public health and the environment in conformity with all applicable State and Federal laws relating thereto.

The objectives of this chapter are:

(a) To protect the health of the City employees working in the City wastewater treatment system;

(b) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater treatment system that will interfere with the normal operation of the system, or contaminate the resulting sludge;

(2) Limitations on Wastewater Strength.

(a) Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Users subject to categorical pretreatment standards are required to comply with applicable standards as set out in 40 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 and incorporated herein.

(i) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users, in accordance with subsection (2)(a)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The Director may convert the mass limits of the categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director. When converting any mass limits to concentration limits, documentation will be made that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as prohibited by subsection (2)(d) of this section. The Director will document how the equivalent limits were derived for any changes from mass limits to concentration and make this information publicly available upon request.

(iii) Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.

(iv) Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.

(v) Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the Director within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.

(b) State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on users of the POTW shall be met by all users that are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than Federal requirements and limitations, or those in this chapter or any other applicable ordinance.

(c) Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to amend this chapter to provide for more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW where deemed necessary to comply with the objectives set forth in AMC 10.06.010.

(d) Dilution. No user shall increase the use of potable or process water in any way for the purpose of diluting a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the applicable standards set forth in this chapter. The City may impose mass limitations on users that are using dilutions to meet the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements of this chapter.

(e) Specific Pollutant Limitations.

(i) No nondomestic user shall discharge wastewater containing restricted substances into the POTW in excess of limitations specified in its wastewater discharge permit or published by the Director. The Director shall publish and revise from time to time standards for specific restricted substances, termed local limits, including designation of affected nondomestic users. These standards shall be developed in accordance with 40 CFR 403.5 and shall implement the objectives of this chapter. Standards published in accordance with this section will be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of Section 307(d) of the Act.

(ii) The Director may develop best management practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements of subsection (1) of this section.

(iii) The Director may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration limits referenced above.

(3) Accidental Discharges. As appropriate, industrial users shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited or regulated materials or substances established by this chapter. Where deemed necessary by the City, facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user’s cost and expense. An accidental spill prevention plan (ASPP) or slug discharge control plan showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the City for review and approval before implementation. The City shall determine which industrial users are required to develop an ASPP and require said industrial users to submit the ASPP within 60 days after notification by the City. Each industrial user shall implement its ASPP as submitted after such ASPP has been reviewed and approved by the City. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures by the City shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify its facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.

(a) Any user required to develop and implement an accidental spill prevention plan shall submit a plan that addresses, at a minimum, the following:

(i) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;

(ii) Description of stored chemicals;

(iii) Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge that would violate any of the standards in subsection (1) of this section;

(iv) If necessary and applicable, procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic chemicals (including solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response.

(b) Industrial users shall notify the City (wastewater treatment plant) immediately upon the occurrence of an accidental or other discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW. The notification shall include location of discharge, date and time thereof, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. Any industrial user that discharges prohibited materials shall be liable for any incurred expense, loss, or damage to the POTW, in addition to the amount of any fines imposed on the City on account thereof under State or Federal law.

(c) Written Notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability that may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability that may be imposed by this chapter or other applicable law.

(d) Signs shall be permanently posted in conspicuous places on industrial user’s premises, advising employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (3)(a) of this section. Employers shall instruct all employees who may cause or discover such a discharge with respect to emergency notification procedure.

(e) Industrial users required to develop an ASPP or slug discharge control plan, including significant industrial users, are required to notify the City immediately of any changes at the industrial facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

(4) Special Agreements. The City reserves the right to enter into special agreements with users setting out special terms under which the industrial user may discharge to the wastewater treatment system. In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard. However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. Industrial users may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from U.S. EPA. Such a request will be approved only if the user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by U.S. EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13. (Ord. 5708 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5637, 2006).

10.06.050 Hauled waste.
All hauled waste including septage must be discharged at the City of Albany wastewater treatment plant. All discharges at any other point within the wastewater treatment system, including sanitary sewer manholes, are hereby prohibited. Administration and enforcement of hauled waste permits shall be the same as industrial permits, AMC 10.06.060, 10.06.070, and 10.06.090.

10.06.070 Reporting and monitoring requirements.
(1) Reporting Requirements for Industrial Users.

(a) Final Compliance Report. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance by the industrial user with applicable categorical pretreatment standards and requirements set forth in this chapter or a wastewater discharge permit, or within 30 days following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW by a new source, any industrial user subject to this chapter shall submit to the City a report indicating the nature and concentration of all prohibited or regulated substances contained in its discharge, and the average and maximum daily flow in gallons. The report shall include a statement, signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operations and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required in order to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.

(b) Periodic Compliance Reports.

(i) Any significant industrial users subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the Director, but in no case less than twice per year, submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge that are limited to such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP), the user must submit documentation required by the Director or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (11) of this section.

(ii) Reports of industrial users shall contain all results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass where required by the City. The frequency of monitoring by the industrial user shall be as prescribed within the wastewater discharge permit. If an industrial user monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the wastewater discharge permit, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

(iii) The City may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the industrial user. Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director shall be included as a condition in the user’s permit. This authorization is subject to the industrial user meeting the conditions specified in 40 CFR Part 403.12(e)(2) as amended.

(iv) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.

(2) Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments or, if 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA administrator.

(3) Sample Collection. Data collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and must be representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

(a) Except as indicated in subsections (3)(b) and (c) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.

(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.

(c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in AMC 10.06.060(4) and subsection (1)(a) of this section, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection (1)(b) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

(4) Notification and Resampling. In the event an industrial user’s monitoring results indicate a violation has occurred, the industrial user must immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation) notify the City and resample its discharge. The industrial user must report the results of the repeated sampling within 30 days of discovering the first violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City performs sampling at the user’s facility at least once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user. If the City performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user, the City will perform the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user to perform the repeat sampling and analysis.

(5) Inspection and Sampling. The Director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.

(a) The Director shall have the right to set up on the industrial user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection compliance, monitoring, and/or metering operations.

(b) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director or authorized representatives shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.

(c) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.

(d) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

(6) Record Keeping. Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, documentation supporting any monitoring waiver for pollutants not present established under subsection (1)(b)(iii) of this section, and documentation associated with best management practices established under AMC 10.06.040(2)(e)(ii). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with the Albany Municipal Code, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Director.

(7) Report of Changed Conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify the City of any planned significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or pretreatment systems that might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater.

(a) The Director may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater permit application under AMC 10.06.060(4), if necessary.

(b) The City may issue a wastewater permit under AMC 10.06.060(7) or modify an existing wastewater permit under AMC 10.06.060(8).

(c) No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the Director has responded to the industrial user’s notice.

(d) For purposes of this requirement, flow increases or loading increases of 20 percent or greater and/or the discharge of any previously unreported pollutant shall be deemed significant.

(8) Notification of Significant Production Change. An industry operating under a wastewater discharge permit incorporating equivalent mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall notify the City within two business days after the user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not notifying the City of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.

(9) Confidential Information. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, and monitoring programs, and from City inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State laws.

(a) Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

(b) When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the Albany Municipal Code, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.

(10) Notification by Industrial Users Discharging Hazardous Waste. In compliance with 40 CFR 403.12(p), industrial users shall notify the Director, EPA, and DEQ in writing of any discharge into the municipal wastewater system of a substance that, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.The City may request additional information on the nature and concentration of the discharge, and may prohibit such discharge of wastewater containing hazardous waste.

(11) Certification Statements. All applications, reports, or information to the City shall be signed and certified in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(l).

(a) Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports and Initial Monitoring Waiver.

(c) Grease interceptors shall be located outside the building in order to facilitate cleaning, inspection, and maintenance. Installation of smaller grease traps or grease interceptors located inside any building will be allowed only under circumstances where exterior installation is not effective or not practicable, and shall be approved only on a case-by-case basis.

(d) The owner of any facility with a grease interceptor installation shall maintain the grease interceptor at all times in a manner that shall prevent fat waste, oil, or grease from being carried into the sewer system. Authorized City employees shall be allowed access to grease interceptors for the purpose of inspection and/or to verify compliance with this chapter. Fat waste, oil, or grease removed from such a facility shall not be disposed of in the sanitary sewer or the storm drain system, and recovered grease shall be stored in a manner to prevent spillage or runoff to the sanitary sewer or storm drain system. A record of disposal shall be maintained for review upon request by the City. (Ord. 5708 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5637, 2006. Formerly 10.06.070).

10.06.090 Enforcement.
(1) Emergency Suspension of Service and Wastewater Discharge Permit. The City may, after informal notice to the industrial user (in writing, in person, or by telephone), order the suspension of the wastewater treatment service and revoke the wastewater discharge permit to an industrial user when it appears to the City that an actual or threatened discharge:

(a) Presents or threatens an imminent or substantial danger to the health or welfare of persons or substantial danger to the environment; or

(b) Threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or to violate any pretreatment limits imposed by this chapter.

Any industrial user notified of the City’s suspension order shall immediately cease all discharges. In the event of failure of the industrial user to comply with the suspension order, the City may immediately take all necessary steps to halt or prevent any further discharge by such industrial user into the POTW. The City shall have authority to physically cap, block, or seal the industrial user’s sewer line (whether on public or private property) in order to terminate service under this section. The City shall have the right to enter upon the industrial user’s property to accomplish the capping, blocking, or sealing of the industrial user’s sewer line. The City may also commence judicial proceedings immediately thereafter to compel the industrial user’s specific compliance with such order and/or to recover civil penalties. The City shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or wastewater treatment service upon clear and convincing proof by the industrial user of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge or conditions creating the threat as set forth above.

(2) Industrial User Prohibited Conduct. An industrial user shall not:

(a) Fail to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge;

(b) Fail to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or characteristics;

(c) Refuse reasonable access to the industrial user’s premises by representatives of the City for the purpose of inspection or monitoring; or

(d) Violate the provisions of the wastewater discharge permit or the provisions of this chapter.

The City may seek any and all of the remedies or penalties provided in this chapter (including termination of wastewater services and/or revocation of wastewater discharge permit) against any industrial user who violates any of the foregoing prohibitions.

(3) Procedure. The procedures set forth below apply in those situations where emergency suspension of service pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is not needed. Ordinarily, the enforcement procedure outlined below will be followed in the order hereinafter set forth, and enforcement will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City reserves the right and discretion to impose any of the sanctions listed below for any violation should the City deem such action appropriate or necessary in the individual circumstances.

(a) Notification of Violation. Whenever the City determines that any industrial user has violated or is violating the provisions of subsection (2) of this section, the City may serve upon such industrial user a written notice of violation stating the nature of the violation(s). Where directed to do so by the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction of the violation(s) will be submitted to the City by the industrial user, within a time frame as specified in the notice of violation. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

(b) Administrative Order. Whenever the City determines that any industrial user has violated or is violating any provision of this chapter of the Albany Municipal Code or an industrial wastewater discharge permit issued and approved hereunder, or has violated any directives or orders issued and approved hereunder, the City may serve upon such industrial user a written administrative order stating the nature of the violation(s) and imposing sanctions. This notice shall be served upon the industrial user either by personal service to any owner, operator, authorized agent, or any employee of the industrial user at any office maintained by the industrial user either within or outside of the City of Albany. Service of the notice may also be accomplished by mailing the notice, via registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the industrial user at any office maintained by the industrial user either within or outside of the City of Albany.

These sanctions may include:

(i) An order requiring corrective action.

(ii) An order setting civil penalties as described in AMC 10.06.100 in the event corrective action is not undertaken as ordered in subsection (3)(b)(i) of this section.

(iii) An order imposing civil penalties as described in AMC 10.06.100 in lieu of, or in addition to, an order of corrective action.

(iv) An order requiring payment of City costs incurred as a result of a violation.

(v) An order requiring a compliance schedule containing milestones and applicable reporting requirements, or requiring an industrial user to submit a compliance schedule for approval by the City.

(vi) Revocation of the industrial user’s wastewater discharge permit.

(vii) Disconnection from the wastewater discharge system pursuant to the rights and procedures set forth concerning emergency suspension of service in subsection (1) of this section.

(c) Appeal of Administrative Order. An industrial user served by an administrative order may within seven days of the receipt of the order request in writing that the Director review the enforcement action. The request (letter of appeal) will state all points of disagreement and objection to the order. Upon receipt of the letter of appeal, the City shall cause a hearing to be held before the Public Works Director of the City of Albany, or his authorized representative. The Public Works Director, or his authorized representative, shall conduct the hearing with the advice and counsel of the City Attorney and shall establish such rules and procedures as may be determined by the City in order to meet due process minimums. Following the close of the hearing, the Public Works Director, or his authorized representative, shall enter appropriate findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an administrative order with respect to the alleged violations and under the terms of the order, may impose any or all of these sanctions referred to in subsection (3)(b) of this section. Said sanction may exceed those originally purposed in the notice of proposed administrative order. The findings, conclusions, and order shall be served upon the industrial user in the manner provided above for the service of the notification of an administrative order.

(d) Within seven days of its receipt of the determination as outlined above, the industrial user may appeal the findings, conclusions, and order of the Public Works Director or his authorized representative by serving a written notice of such appeal in the same manner as provided above for the service of the initial appeal. Thereafter, a hearing on the appeal shall be scheduled before the City Council of the City of Albany, or such Appeal Hearings Officer as the City may appoint for such purpose. The City Manager of the City of Albany shall have the authority and discretion to appoint an Appeal Hearings Officer or direct the appeal to the City Council. Thereafter, the City Council or the Appeal Hearings Officer may render its decision based upon the record of the hearing on the administrative order, grant an additional hearing to take additional evidence, or conduct a de novo hearing. The City Council, or Appeal Hearings Officer, in consultation with the City Attorney, shall establish rules and procedures for the conduct of the appeal in order to accord the industrial user minimum due process. The City Council or Appeal Hearings Officer shall affirm, reverse, or modify the findings, conclusions, and administrative order and shall serve its decision, in writing, upon the industrial user in the manner provided for the service of the original administrative order. The decision of the City Council or Appeal Hearings Officer shall be final.

(4) Judicial Proceedings. Following the entry of any final administrative order by the City with respect to the violation by an industrial user of subsection (2) of this section, the City may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court to enforce the penalty or remedy imposed by the City hereunder.

(5) Enforcement Actions – Annual Publication. A list of all industrial users in significant noncompliance during the 12 previous months shall be annually published by the City in the largest daily newspaper circulated in the area of the municipality or a newspaper of general circulation, summarizing the violations and enforcement action undertaken by the City. For the purpose of this subsection, an industrial user is in significant noncompliance if its violation meets one or more of the criteria stated under the definition of significant noncompliance in AMC 10.06.030(59).

(6) Affirmative Defense – Upset.

(a) For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards and requirements because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

(b) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (6)(c) of this section are met.

(c) An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

(i) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset;

(ii) The facility was at the time of the upset being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and was in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(iii) The industrial user has submitted the following information to the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):

(A) A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(B) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(C) Steps being taken to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(d) In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.

(e) Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards.

(f) Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with applicable pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of their treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

(7) General/Specific Prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in AMC 10.06.040 if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with a discharge or discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:

(a) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference; or

(b) No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user’s prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.

(8) Affirmative Defense – Bypass. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an individual user’s treatment facility shall be an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against the industrial user if the user can demonstrate that such a bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage, and there were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance. In order to be eligible for the affirmative defense, the industrial user must demonstrate that there was no feasible alternative to the bypass, and meet all required conditions of 40 CFR 403.17, including notification of the bypass.

(9) Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Director may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan. However, the Director may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Director is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user. (Ord. 5708 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5637, 2006. Formerly 10.06.080).

10.06.100 Penalties.
(1) Civil Penalties. Any industrial user who violates an administrative order of the City, or who fails to comply with: (a) any provision of this chapter, or (b) any regulation, rule, or permit of the City, issued pursuant to this chapter, shall be liable to the City for a civil penalty. The amount of such civil penalty shall be not less than $250.00 per violation nor more than $2,500 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. Such penalties may be collected by judicial actions commenced by the City as provided in AMC 10.06.090(4). In addition, the City may issue an administrative order terminating the industrial user’s wastewater service if a civil penalty is not paid when due.

(2) Administrative Fines. When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or pretreatment requirement, the Director may fine such user. The amount of such administrative fine shall be not less than $250.00 per violation nor more than $2,500 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation.

(3) Recovery of Cost Incurred by the City. Any user violating any of the provisions of this chapter who discharges or causes a discharge producing a deposit or obstruction or causes damage to or impairs the City’s wastewater treatment system shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The City may require the user to pay for the cost incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge and for cost incurred by the City in investigating the violation and in enforcing this chapter against the user, including reasonable administrative costs, fees for testing, attorney fees, court costs, and all expenses of litigation. Refusal to pay the ordered costs shall constitute a violation of this chapter, enforceable under the provisions of AMC 10.06.090. The user shall also reimburse the City for any and all fines or penalties levied against the City as a result of a discharge by the user.

(4) Falsifying Information. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report and plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under AMC 10.06.070, shall (in addition to civil and/or criminal penalties provided by state law) be subject to general criminal penalties under subsection (6) of this section.

(5) Fraud and False Statements. Any reports required in this code and any other documents required to be submitted by the City or maintained by the industrial user shall be subject to enforcement provision of the Albany Municipal Code, municipal, State, and Federal law relating to fraud and false statements. In addition, the industrial user shall be subject to general criminal penalties under subsection (6) of this section.

(6) General Criminal Penalties. Any user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a crime and subject to penalties under a misdemeanor or felony as determined by the court. (Ord. 5708 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5637, 2006. Formerly 10.06.090).

10.06.110 Severability.
If any provision, paragraph, word, section, or article of this chapter is invalidated by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions, paragraphs, words, sections, and chapters shall not be affected and shall continue in full force and effect. (Ord. 5708 § 1, 2008; Ord. 5637, 2006. Formerly 10.06.100).

(3) A written warning notice to the customer shall be left at the premises on or about the forty-sixth day following the original billing date stating that payment must be received in the City business office within 72 hours (three days) or water service will be terminated. In the case of a multi-family unit serviced by a single meter, the written warning notice will be left at each dwelling unit whether or not occupied.

(4) In all cases of past due turn-offs, a notice shall be left on the door or mailed to the customer on or about the forty-ninth day following the original billing date stating that water has been turned off and will remain turned off until all past due amounts and penalty charges are paid. Turn-off notices for multi-family units serviced by a single meter will be left at each dwelling unit whether or not occupied. A service charge established by Council resolution will be charged and collected for each past due or disconnection notice sent or delivered to the customer’s premises.

(5) In all instances where water has been turned off because of nonpayment of a past due account, a service charge established by Council resolution will be collected in addition to the past due amount prior to restoring any service during regular work-

ing hours. An additional fee will be collected for restoration of service after regular working hours.

(6) The City Manager or the City Manager’s agent, in the case of extreme hardship or by prior arrangement with the user, shall have the discretion of renewing or not discontinuing service to a past due account upon acceptance of a valid plan for the payment of all past due, current, and future charges.

(7) Notice shall be given with the past due notice that the customer shall have the opportunity, if they do not agree with the billing, to have a hearing on their account. The hearing shall be held by a Hearings Officer appointed by the Finance Director and the Hearings Officer’s decision shall be binding. Written notice to the utility by the customer of a request for a hearing must be given prior to the water service being disconnected; otherwise, the customer must pay all past due accounts plus any restoration charges prior to service being restored. If the hearing is held and the Hearings Officer finds in favor of the customer, any or all of the appropriate charges may be adjusted or returned to the customer based upon the findings of the Hearings Officer.

(8) If any unpaid account balance remains after the initial due date of the closing bill, the utility may:

(a) Apply deposit.

(b) Transfer any remaining balance to the customer’s new water account.

(c) Initiate other collection action against the customer.

(9) In cases where termination of service for a past due account may cause severe hardship or loss of life, the utility may initiate other collection action against its customers. This action may include the use of small claims court and/or district court, if appropriate. (Ord. 5542, 2002; Ord. 4940 § 1, 1990; Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

(6) Customer Request for Service Discontinuance.

(a) Customers may have their water service discontinued by notifying the utility during normal working hours and providing at least 24 hours’ advance notice (excluding weekends) of the desired weekday date of discontinuance. The customer will be required to pay all water charges through the date of such discontinuance.

(b) If notice is not given to the utility, the customer will be required to pay for the water service through the date the utility has learned that the customer has vacated the premises or otherwise has discontinued service.

(7) Restoration – Reconnection Charge. The utility shall charge, as provided by Council resolution, for restoring water service which has been discontinued because of noncompliance with these rules. Water service which has been discontinued because of nonpayment or noncompliance with these rules shall not be restored in the name of any relative, friend, family member, nor in the same customer name when the head of the household has not changed or when the customer of record at that service location would continue to receive water service unless all charges have been paid.

(8) Penalty for Turning on Water Service Without Authority. Should the water be turned on by any water customer or other person without authority from the utility, the water may then be shut off at the main or the meter may be removed. The charge for shutting water off at the main shall be the actual cost plus 15 percent overhead. The charge for removing and/or reinstalling the meter shall be established by Council resolution. All such charges shall be chargeable to the customer, and water shall not again be furnished to the customer until said charges are paid.

(9) Tampering. Water services locked off for nonpayment or noncompliance will be subject to tampering fees as specified by Council resolution should any consumer or person without authority from the utility remove or destroy said locking devices in order to self-restore water service. Tampering charges and/or costs shall be chargeable to the customer. (Ord. 4940 § 1, 1990; Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.090 Meter testing.

(2) On Customer Request.

(a) A customer may request the utility to test the meter serving the customer’s premises.

(b) The utility may require the customer to deposit an amount to cover the reasonable cost of the test as established by Council resolution.

(c) This deposit will be returned if the meter is found to register more than two percent fast. This deposit will be forfeited if the meter is found to be accurate or slow.

(d) A written report giving the results of the test shall be available to the customer within 10 days after completion of the test.

(3) Utility Initiated Meter Testing.

(a) The utility may temporarily interrupt water service in order to test existing meters or make repairs.

(b) In lieu of subsection (3)(a) of this section, the utility may, at customer’s expense, install bypass piping in order to maintain water service during meter testing or repairs. (Ord. 5472, 2001; Ord. 4940 § 1, 1990; Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.095 Adjustments, back-billing, credits and refunds.
(1) The utility may make adjustments, back-bill, apply credits, pay refunds, or waive fees and charges in accordance with City Council policy. If no Council policy exists, the utility may make adjustments where it is deemed necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the utility. A full explanation of the reason for the adjustment or refund must be filed with the office records and will be made available upon request. Refunds are to be made to the party that made the payment.

When the utility determines that a customer has been mistakenly charged too much for water services, the utility will apply a credit to the account based on the date the error first occurred, the date the current customer became responsible for the bill, or a period not to exceed six years, whichever is less. If the date cannot be reasonably determined, the utility will estimate the amount of the refund based on a period not to exceed six years.

When the utility determines that a customer has not been charged or has not been charged enough for water services, the utility will back-bill the account based on the date the error first occurred, the date the current customer became responsible for the bill, or a period not to exceed six years, whichever is less. If the date cannot be reasonably determined, the utility will estimate the bill for a period not to exceed one year. Customers who receive such a delayed bill will be offered the opportunity to make arrangements for installment payments.

(2) Nonregistering Meters. The utility may bill the customer for water consumed while the meter was not registering. The bill will be calculated using an estimate of consumption based either upon the customer’s prior use during the same season of the year or upon a reasonable comparison with the use of other customers receiving the same class of service during the same period and under similar circumstances and conditions.

(3) Adjustments on Account of Leaks. Where it can be demonstrated that an existing leak on the customer’s side of the meter has been repaired, the utility may allow an adjustment of up to 50 percent of the estimated excess consumption due to leakage, for no more than the last two billing periods. Adjustments shall not be permitted when the excess consumption is due to the apparent continued waste of water due to a negligent failure to repair the leak. (Ord. 5542, 2002; Ord. 5472, 2001).

11.01.100 New service connections and meters.
(1) The utility may furnish and install a service of such size and at such location as the applicant requests, provided:

(a) Such requests are reasonable.

(b) The location is such that the utility has in place a distribution main of sufficient size adequate to provide service to this location without detriment to existing customers. In all cases, the final location of the proposed meter shall be subject to approval.

(c) That such a distribution main is adjacent to and extends along the full length of the property frontage along the right-of-way.

(d) Where a parcel has more than 150 feet of frontage along a right-of-way and the parcel is being developed in phases; and the water line is not currently needed for the full length of the parcel to facilitate service to other properties, to provide fire protection, or to meet other utility system needs, the requirement of subsection (1)(c) of this section may be reduced, where approved, by delaying the requirement for a water main adjacent to that portion of the parcel which remains as an undevel-

oped portion of a future phase. Such delay, if authorized, is contingent upon the signing of a waiver of remonstrance agreement which commits the parcel to participate in a future local improvement (assessment) district for the extension of water main(s).

(e) Where the property abuts more than one street or right-of-way, water mains shall be extended for the full length of the property frontages along the rights-of-way for all frontages, unless it is determined that the extensions on the frontages from which service is not being taken is not currently needed for water pressure, system capacity, or fire protection, nor to facilitate service to other properties, and that said water mains may be completed at a future time. In that case, where authorized, the owners of the property to be serviced shall sign a waiver of remonstrance agreement which commits the parcel to participate in a future local improvement (assessment) district for the extension of this water main. This agreement may be incorporated into the water service application form.

(f) The utility shall be the sole judge in determining the meaning and provisions of, and conformance with, any conditions for providing service to a property.

(g) Service taps on 16-inch and larger mains shall include an accessible gate or butterfly valve in a valve box at the connection of the main and the service line. Direct taps on 16-inch and larger mains shall be minimized.

(h) The applicant shall provide and maintain an accessible, unflooded vault of a size as specified for all meters larger than two inches.

(2) A water system development charge, an installation fee, and a deposit is hereby established. The water system development charge shall be imposed upon all connections or intensification of use made to the water system of the City in accordance with Chapter 15.16 AMC. The water system development charge shall be deposited in the water improvement fee or water reimbursement fee funds. Such funds shall be accounted for separately. System development charge revenue shall only be used in accordance with Chapter 15.16 AMC. The water fees and deposits are established by Council resolution.

(3) Included in the charges are all meters and necessary appurtenances for installation and continued operation of the service which the utility will supply.

(4) All meters shall be sealed by the utility at the time of installation and no seal shall be altered or broken except by an authorized agent of the utility.

(5) Change in Location or Reduction in Meter Size or Service.

(a) Change in the location of service at the convenience or request of the customer shall be done at the customer’s expense.

(b) Reduction in meter size requested by the customer shall be only if the request is reasonable and approved. Charges for these reductions are established by Council resolution.

(6) Increases in the Size of the Meter and Service. If a change in the size of a meter and service is requested and approved, the installation will be accomplished at a charge based upon time and material costs plus 15 percent overhead. Where the meter size increases, a connection charge shall also be charged, but a credit, equal to current connection charge for the existing meter, shall be given toward the connection charge for the new meter.

(7) Ownership. The service connection, whether located on public or private property, is the property of the utility and the utility reserves the right to repair, replace, and maintain it, as well as to remove it upon discontinuance of service.

(8) Charges for Service Pipes Connected without Permit. If the premises are connected without the application prescribed in this section, such premises shall be immediately disconnected. Before a new connection is made, the applicant shall pay double the rate for the estimated quantity of water consumed prior to the effective date of metered service, plus a tampering fee as authorized by Council resolution. A new connection shall only be made upon compliance with provisions of this Code.

(9) Abandoned and Nonrevenue-Producing Services. Where a service connection to any premises has been abandoned or not used for a period of one year or longer, the utility may remove such service or meter. If the service or meter has been removed, service shall be restored only upon the owner making application and paying all costs associated with the reinstallation.

(10) Leaking or Unused Services. Where there is a leak between the main and the meter, the utility shall make all repairs. When a service connection is damaged or destroyed by contractors or others, or where service connections are destroyed by electrolysis, the person, contractor, or company responsible for such damage or destruction shall pay the utility for the cost of repairing or replacing such connections on the basis of the direct cost to the utility in labor and in materials, plus 15 percent overhead. Where a customer service line is leaking or has a history of repair problems which has resulted in leak adjustments, service to this customer shall not be activated until the customer can demonstrate the problem has been eliminated. Action necessary may be in the form of partial or total replacement of the customer’s plumbing and/or deposit of sufficient funds to cover estimated consumption.

Customers with serious water leaks which will cause extreme financial hardship or detrimental service to other customers may have their water service terminated after 24 hours’ notice. In cases of leakage causing severe detriment to other customers’ service, water service may be terminated immediately. (Ord. 4967 § 1, 1991; Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.110 Multiple-block dwellings.
(1) Number of Services to a Separate Unit. Separate service units under single or common control or management will each be supplied through individual service connections unless otherwise authorized.

(2) For division of multiple-block dwellings not under common management, new service must be supplied to each unit.

(3) Service to Multiple-block Dwellings. Separate houses, buildings, living, or business quarters on the same premises, or on adjoining premises, under a single control or management, may be served as authorized by either of the following methods:

(a) Through separate service connections to each or any unit if that pipeline system for each service is independent of the others and is not interconnected.

(b) Through a single service connection to each physically separated structure.

(c) The liability for payment of charges for all water furnished to combined units, supplied through a single service connection of approved capacity, is that of the owner of the property. (Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.120 Main extensions.
(1) A main extension and/or special facilities shall be required to service all property which cannot obtain service as outlined in Section 11.01.100 of this code.

(2) The following rules shall apply to all extensions:

(a) The minimum size of the water main to be installed shall be six inches in diameter where a larger size is not needed to provide required fire flows, provide adequate system or customer flows and/or pressures, conform with the size of existing mains being connected to, meet future needs, or conform to the size specified by the utility’s water system facility plan.

(b) All water mains shall be public, installed in public rights-of-way or public utility easements. The normal routing for the water main extension shall be in a dedicated street right-of-way.

(c) The Public Works Director or Director’s agent shall design or approve extensions to the water system and shall have the sole right to determine size, location, and type of facility to be constructed. All engineering shall be based on both domestic and fire protection design criteria. Those not designed by the Public Works Director or Director’s agent shall be designed by a registered engineer licensed in the State of Oregon to design these facilities. All water main extensions shall be designed and constructed to meet the approval of the utility and the Oregon State Health Division. All extensions shall be consistent with the water system facility plan.

(d) The installation of all water facilities shall be by City forces or through a bonded contractor.

(e) All main extensions shall extend to the extreme property line of the development or lot. If the property has excess frontage on the right-of-way and only partial development is to occur, then some consideration may be given to shortening the extension, provided sufficient assurance is given to ensure the completion of the extension at the time other development occurs. Where mains are being extended into the interior of a property or development, the mains shall be extended through to the boundaries of the property at all such points as shall be determined as needed unless it is determined that the extensions are not needed to provide current or future looping of water mains, or to provide current or future service to adjacent properties.

(f) The utility may pay for the additional cost of materials due to the oversizing of main extensions over eight inches in low- and medium-density residential development, provided the petitioner’s individual service and fire protection needs do not dictate a larger line size. The utility may pay for the additional cost of materials due to the oversizing of main extensions over 12 inches in diameter for all other land uses, provided the petitioner’s individual service and fire protection needs do not dictate a larger line size. The oversize payment shall be limited to pipe and fitting material cost differences only.

(g) The utility may, at its option, supply materials for main extension projects. All material supplied by contractors must meet strict material specifications set forth by the utility. Failure to do so will result in nonacceptance of the projects. All materials supplied by the utility to any main extension project shall be billed at the utility’s replacement cost, plus a 15 percent overhead and handling charge.

(h) All main extensions and system design shall include fire hydrants and other devices at intervals consistent with the recommendations of the water system facility plan, except as modified by the fire marshal. The fire hydrants shall be considered as incidental to the water mains. Where local improvement districts are established, the cost of fire hydrants shall be considered as part of the total assessable cost. Where mains are extended under permit, the cost of fire hydrants shall be the responsibility of the permittee. Where fire hydrants are installed on an existing water main to provide fire protection for a proposed development, the installed cost of the fire hydrants shall be the responsibility of the developer.

(i) Under conditions where hydrants are required within the property to be served, the main must be extended to the hydrant locations. Easements for these internal lines and hydrants must be provided by the developer.

(j) In large projects or projects where extensive engineering or design is required prior to preliminary estimates or design being obtained, a cash advance may be required to cover the cost of such engineering or design. All engineering drawings and documents and other work completed by the utility will be understood to be the property of the utility.

(k) In areas of service above the main system service elevation, special facilities will normally be required in addition to main extensions to provide service (AMC 11.01.130).

(l) Financing of Extensions. There are two basic means of financing main extensions, as outlined below.

(i) Total Project Cost. Under this method the developer is required to pay the total cost of the project. An estimate covering approximate total costs related to the project may be supplied by the utility. If developers install the project themselves or through their own contractor and supply materials, a cash advance sufficient to cover the estimated cost for the utility services needed on the project may be required prior to starting the project. Upon completion of the project, actual costs will be computed and an adjustment made to the contractor or to the utility appropriately. In the case of complex projects (projects involving disruption of or cutting into existing roadways, utilities, or pedestrian ways, or other projects where partial completion of the project could result in expense to the utility), the developer may be required to supply a bond to cover the estimated cost of engineering and construction.

(ii) Local Improvement Districts. Local improvement districts may be formed and bonds sold to fund main extensions and special facility projects.

(m) Subject to available funds, refunds may be made to the developer in areas where the developer is required to extend mains beyond the property frontage. If developers are to install the project themselves or through their own contractor and supply materials, they must secure three competitive bids for the total construction cost of the extension. These bids must be turned into the utility for review and approval of utility participation, prior to beginning work. Where approved for funding, an invoice shall be submitted to the utility after construction is completed for its portion of the project cost. The cost to the utility shall not exceed the cost determined using the lowest bid.

(n) Installers of any and all water lines or appurtenances must meet minimum standards. These standards shall include, but are not limited to, insurance requirements, bonding requirements, and experience in the field of water line installation. The water lines must be installed in accordance with the utility’s specifications which are available upon request. Unless the work is being performed under a City contract, all main extensions shall require a “permit to construct public facilities” and the payment of the associated permit fee. The permit fee shall be 2.5 percent of the total construction cost unless otherwise set by Council resolution.

(o) If developers install and purchase the material themselves, they must guarantee the project for a period of one year from the date of acceptance of the project by the utility.

(p) A contract agreement between the developer and the utility outlining the above criteria must be signed before the start of the project. (Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.130 Special facilities.
(1) In any high-elevation service area, special facilities in the form of booster pumps, storage tanks, control equipment, etc., may be required. The utility shall approve all special facilities and shall have the sole right to determine the size, location, and type of facility to be constructed.

(2) The party or parties requesting the service to the high-elevation service area shall pay the full cost of said facilities including materials, installation, engineering, surveying, etc., as may be required. (Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.140 Service outside City limits.
(1) Application for Service. Each application for service outside the City may be acted upon on its merits without regard to any other past or present application or service. If service is approved, the cost of service connection fees plus applicable rates will be those charges and regulations set forth and approved by the Council and the same as they may be amended from time to time unless otherwise set forth in a service contract.

(a) Service Limitation. The utility shall not provide water service to any property outside the Albany City limits when such property is contiguous to the City limits and eligible for annexation to the City of Albany unless Council finds that it is in the public interest to do so. The property owners requesting water service must submit a signed and notarized irrevocable request to annex before receiving water service.

(b) Users. No use or benefits of the City water system shall be extended to or made available to any property outside the City limits, except under a contractual agreement with the owners of said property, and only then when the property is not contiguous to the City of Albany at the time the water service is requested unless Council finds that it is in the public interest to do so.

(c) Contract. Use and benefits of the water system may be granted to property owners outside of the Albany City limits on a contractual basis only. Except for contracts with another public agency, the contract shall require that in order to continue to receive water service, the property owner shall annex the property to the City of Albany at the earliest date that the property becomes eligible for annexation under the laws of the State of Oregon.

(4) In the case of existing fire services which do not meet the conditions of subsection (3) of this section, the hydrants or hose connection may be sealed in such a manner as to indicate use thereof. If the seal is found to be broken, it will be assumed that water is being used from the fire service which is a violation of these rules and which results in action being taken as outlined in subsection (5) of this section.

(5) Where any violation of any of the above subsections exists, service may be immediately discontinued. In the case where no detector or proportional meter exists, then one will be required before service is restored. In cases where there is a detector or proportional meter, then the owner or agent must provide satisfactory assurances that the use of water will cease or appropriate means are provided to ensure payment for all the water used. The customer will also be required to pay for all water used. The utility shall estimate this amount in cases where it cannot be determined. The bill must be paid prior to service being restored.

(6) No charge will be made for water used in the extinguishing of fires.

(7) The cost of all detector checks, proportional meters, backflow devices, and related appurtenances shall be borne by the customer.

(8) Service connections and all equipment appurtenant thereto, including the meter, shall be the sole property of the utility.

(9) Standby charges for automatic fire service are established by Council resolution.

(10) Pressure and Supply. The utility assumes no responsibility for loss or damage because of lack of water or pressure and merely agrees to furnish such quantities and pressures as are available in its general distribution system. The service is subject to shutdowns and variations required by the operation of the system. (Ord. 4878, 1989; Ord. 4664, 1985).

11.01.180 Fire hydrants.
(1) Unauthorized Use of Fire Hydrant. No person or persons other than those designated and authorized by the proper authority, or by the utility, shall open any fire hydrant or attempt to draw water from it in any manner. Violation of this regulation will result in a water-use fee due and payable immediately. Any future water service request will be denied until this fee has been paid. Continual violation of this rule shall lead to prosecution.

(2) Damage of Fire Hydrants. No person or persons shall damage or tamper with any fire hydrant. Any violation of this regulation shall lead to prosecution.

(3) Authorized Use. In order to obtain authorization to use a fire hydrant, the customer must contact both the utility and the Fire Department. The utility will determine a hydrant the customer may use, after which they must get the Fire Department’s written permission.

At the time the customer signs up for temporary water supply from a fire hydrant, the customer must supply the utility with an estimate of water to be used, address and name of who will be responsible for the bill, and the time and date water will be taken from the system. This information will be placed on the appropriate form and signed by the customer or the authorized agent of the customer. The bill will be generated from metered usage readings after the service is used. If an account is to be active more than 60 days, a partial bill will be prepared.

Any party using a hydrant must install an auxiliary control valve on the hydrant. This valve will be used to control the volume of water discharged from the hydrant. Where the use of the water from the hydrant requires backflow prevention, the customer is responsible for the proper installation and operation of the required backflow prevention assembly.

(4) Water Bill. The amount to be paid for the water used shall be based upon a standard account: Set-up fee plus a bulk rate charge established by Council resolution.

(5) Moving of Fire Hydrants. When a fire hydrant has been installed in the location specified by the proper authority, the utility has fulfilled its obligation.

No person shall remove vegetation in such a manner as to increase the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. Within the limits established through any required State or Federal permits, the property owner or lessee shall maintain and stabilize the banks of the watercourse within their property lines in order to protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse. Watercourse banks shall be stabilized using planted vegetation and natural materials instead of hard materials (e.g., concrete, asphalt, rock, logs, lumber, etc.) wherever practicable. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.090 Discharges in violation of industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Director at the following times: prior to the Director allowing discharges to the stormwater system; or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, or development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.100 Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or suspected release of materials that is resulting in or may result in illegal discharges of pollutants onto or into public rights-of-way, stormwater, the municipal stormwater system, or Waters of the State, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, immediate notification, containment, and cleanup of such release.

(1) In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the Public Works Department immediately in person or by telephone. Notification of the emergency response agencies or the Public Works Department does not relieve the discharger of their responsibility to also notify appropriate State and Federal agencies.

(a) Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the City of Albany Public Works Director within five business days of the original notice. The notice shall include a detailed written statement submitted by the discharger describing the causes of the discharge, measures taken to mitigate the spill, and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence.

(b) If the discharge emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.

(2) The person responsible for the discharge of pollutants or hazardous materials to the environment shall be responsible for all cleanup costs. All related City expenses including, but not limited to, costs for identification, hazard assessment, and containment shall also be fully reimbursed.

(3) In general, reimbursement costs are those incident costs that are eligible, reasonable, necessary, and allocable to the incident. Costs allowable for reimbursement may include, but are not limited to:

(a) Disposable materials and supplies provided, consumed and expended specifically for the purpose of the incident for which reimbursement is being requested;

(b) Compensation of the employees for the time devoted specifically to the incident;

(c) Rental or leasing of equipment used specifically for the incident;

(d) Replacement costs for equipment or property owned by the City that is contaminated or damaged beyond reuse or repair;

(e) Decontamination of equipment that was used during the incident;

(f) Special technical services required for the incident; and

(g) Laboratory expenses for the purpose of analyzing samples taken during the incident. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.120 Requirement to eliminate illegal discharges.
The Director may require, by written notice, that a person responsible for an illegal discharge immediately, or by a specified date, discontinue the discharge and, if necessary, take measures to eliminate the source of the discharge to prevent the occurrence of future illegal discharges. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.140 Requirement to eliminate illicit connections.
The Director may require, by written notice, that a person responsible for an illicit connection to the stormwater system immediately, or by a specified date, comply with the requirements of this title to eliminate the connection, regardless of whether or not the connection or discharges to it had been established or approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this title.

If, subsequent to eliminating a connection found to be in violation of this title, the responsible person can demonstrate that an illegal discharge will no longer occur, said person may request City approval to reconnect. The reconnection or reinstallation of the connection shall be at the responsible person’s expense. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.143 Requirement to remediate.
Whenever the Director finds that an illegal discharge is taking place or has occurred that will result in or has resulted in pollution of stormwater, the stormwater system, or Waters of the State, the Director may require by written notice to the owner of the property and/or the responsible person or entity that the pollution be remediated and the affected property restored within a specified time pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 12.80 AMC. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.147 Requirement to monitor and analyze.
The Director may require, by written notice, that any person engaged in any activity and/or owning or operating any facility that may cause or contribute to stormwater pollution, illegal discharges, and/or non-stormwater discharges to the stormwater system or Waters of the State, to undertake at said person’s expense such monitoring and analyses and furnish such reports to the City of Albany as deemed necessary to determine compliance with this title. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.150 Suspension of access.
The City of Albany may, without prior notice, suspend access to the stormwater system when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of persons, to the stormwater system, or Waters of the State.

If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order, the City of Albany may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater system, prevent or minimize danger to the environment, or to prevent or minimize danger to persons. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.160 Damage to the stormwater system.
When a discharge causes obstruction, damage, or other impairment to the stormwater system, the Director may assess a charge against the discharger for the work required to clean or repair the facility. If the discharger fails to pay said charge, the costs to clean or repair the facility may be assessed against the property pursuant to AMC 12.80.040. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5498 § 1, 2001).

12.10.170 Right of entry – Inspection and sampling.
The Director shall be authorized and have the right to inspect all premises, sites, and/or activities covered under this title to determine compliance with this title and any rules or orders adopted by the Council or issued pursuant to this title.

(1) The Director shall have the right to set up on the discharger’s or permittee’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection compliance, and/or monitoring operations.

(2) Where a discharger or permittee has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the dischargers shall make necessary arrangements so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Director or authorized representatives shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.

(3) Facility operators shall allow the Director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by State and Federal law.

(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly modified or removed by the discharger at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced without the consent of the Director. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the discharger.

(5) Unreasonable delay in allowing the Director access to a permitted facility is a violation of this title. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the Director reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this title. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.35.100    Removal of excavation, embankment or fill required when determined to be a hazard.

12.35.005 Grading – Relationship to floodplain.
Grading (including excavation and fill) proposed in the floodplain is regulated and permitted through Article 6 of the Albany Development Code and does not require an additional grading permit under this chapter. (Ord. 5747 § 1, 2010).

12.35.010 Grading – When permits are required.
Grading permits are not required by the City of Albany for grading activities (including excavation and fill) within the City limits, except in the following circumstances:

(1) When any grading is proposed in any watercourse shown in the City of Albany Drainage Master Plan, in any watercourse receiving drainage from a public roadway, or in any watercourse lying within a public easement or right-of-way. A watercourse is any natural or artificial stream, river, creek, ditch, drainageway, channel, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows in a definite direction or course, either continuously or intermittently, and has a definite channel, bed and banks, and includes any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or flood water.

(2) When placement of a structure is proposed in a watercourse shown in the City of Albany Drainage Master Plan, or within a public easement or right-of-way.

(3) When grading involving more than 50 cubic yards is proposed in areas that have an average slope of 12 percent or greater.

(4) When grading is proposed over an existing public storm drain, sanitary sewer, or waterline. This does not include grading authorized under a public works contract awarded by the City of Albany, grading approved as part of a permit to construct public facilities as provided in Chapter 15.06 AMC, or grading conducted by City of Albany maintenance forces.

(5) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, a grading permit is not required in any of the following circumstances:

(a) Grading incidental to a valid building permit and excavation below grade for basements, foundations, or footings for retaining walls or other structures authorized by a valid building permit;

(b) Construction of driveways or underground utilities;

(c) Grading or landscaping when less than 50 cubic yards of earth is moved;

(d) Grading or excavation associated with public works projects, roads, public ways, graves, or work controlled by other processes or regulations, such as wells, tunnels, utilities, or disposal sites;

(e) Minor adjustments in active grading permits or applications when necessary in order to adhere to City requirements or good engineering practices;

(f) Grading or excavation determined by the Public Works Director or designee to be in substantial compliance with the intent of the grading ordinance. Such a determination shall be appealable to the City Council. In the event of such an appeal, the decision of the City Council shall be final.

(g) Grading proposed in areas that have an average slope of 12 percent or greater that has been approved through a land use decision under Article 6 of the Albany Development Code. (Ord. 5747 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. E), 2006; Ord. 5328 § 1, 1997; Ord. 5265 § 4, 1996. Formerly 18.04.015).

12.35.020 Grading – General provisions.
The rules prescribed in this chapter shall apply to all lands within the City limits of the City of Albany.

(1) Compliance. No excavation or grading operation shall hereafter be performed, or existing graded lot altered, without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

(2) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and other chapters conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(3) Relationship to Permits Required by State or Federal Agencies. Excavation, grading, and fill activities may require State and/or Federal permits. Such permits are likely to be required if hydric soils are present on the site or if the site contains other wetland characteristics. The issuance of a permit by the City of Albany under this chapter does not eliminate the need for compliance with other State, Federal, or local regulations.

(4) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The issuance of a permit by the City of Albany under this chapter constitutes a determination that the applicant has met the minimum requirements for the City’s regulatory purposes. Issuance of a permit does not relieve the permit holder from any responsibilities or liabilities that grading, excavation or fill activities may create if third parties are damaged or injured by such actions. (Ord. 5747 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. E), 2006; Ord. 5265 § 4, 1996. Formerly 18.04.020).

(1) Provisions have been made to maintain adequate flood-carrying capacity of existing watercourses, including future maintenance of that capacity.

(2) No grading will be permitted over an existing public storm drain, sanitary sewer, or water line unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the proposed grading will not be detrimental to the anticipated service life, operation and maintenance of the existing utility.

(3) The applicant shall notify the City of Albany, any adjacent community, and the Natural Hazards Mitigation Office of the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development of any proposed grading activity that will result in alteration or relocation of a watercourse.

(4) All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to the nearest practicable watercourse approved by the designee as a safe place to deposit such waters. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of non-erosive downdrains or other devices.

(5) Building pads shall have a drainage gradient of two percent toward approved drainage facilities, unless waived by the Public Works Director or designee; except the gradient from the building pad may be one percent if all of the following conditions exist throughout the permit area:

(a) No proposed fills are greater than 10 feet in maximum depth.

(b) No proposed finished cut or fill slope faces have a vertical height in excess of 10 feet.

(c) No existing slope faces, which have a slope face steeper than 10 horizontal to one vertical, have a vertical height in excess of 10 feet.

(6) In areas that have an average slope of 12 percent or greater, the following requirements also apply:

(a) Cut and fill slopes shall not exceed a two (horizontal) to one (vertical) ratio. Slopes which are steeper (e.g., 1.5:1, or 1:1) may be approved by the Public Works Director or designee, upon certification by a qualified soils engineer or geologist that the slope will remain stable under foreseeable conditions. The certification must delineate any specific stabilization measures deemed necessary by the soils engineer or geologist. (Ord. 5747 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010; Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. E), 2006; Ord. 5265 § 4, 1996. Formerly 18.04.040).

12.35.060 Grading – Permits shall be tentative pending resolution of appeals.

12.80.020 Notices deemed received.
Written notices required by this title shall be deemed received by an alleged violator under any of the following circumstances, whichever shall first occur:

(1) Upon personal service to the violator, or the violator’s authorized agent, or any person apparently in charge of any office or place of business maintained by the alleged violator; or

(2) Upon execution of any return receipt or other proof of receipt of mail delivery by the alleged violator or any of the persons listed in subsection (1) of this section; or

12.80.025 Emergency suspension of municipal stormwater system access.
When the Director finds that any discharger has violated any provision of this title, or any order issued hereunder, or that the discharger’s past violations are likely to recur, and that said violations have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system or Waters of the State which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of people or the environment, the Director may issue an order to the discharger directing an immediate cease and desist of all such violations.

(1) The order will direct the discharger to:

(a) Immediately comply with all title requirements; and

(b) Take such appropriate preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including immediately halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.

(2) Any person notified of an emergency order directed to him under this title shall immediately comply and stop or eliminate any endangering discharge. In the event of a discharger’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the emergency order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize harm to the municipal separate storm sewer system or Waters of the State, and/or endangerment to persons or the environment, including immediate termination of the facility’s municipal stormwater connection or other municipal utility services.

(3) The Director may require a person that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent danger to submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Such written statement shall be submitted to the Director within 30 days of receipt of the order.

(4) A person commits an offense if the person reinstates municipal separate storm sewer system access to premises terminated pursuant to this chapter without the prior approval of the Director.

(5) The Director may allow the discharger to recommence its discharge when it has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless further termination proceedings are initiated against the discharger under this chapter.

12.80.030 Warning notice.
When the Director finds that any person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, or any order issued hereunder, the Director may serve upon that person a written warning notice, specifying the particular violation believed to have occurred and requesting the discharger to immediately investigate the matter and to seek a resolution whereby any offending discharge will cease. Investigation and/or resolution of the matter in response to the warning notice in no way relieves the alleged violator of liability for any violations occurring before or after the receipt of the warning notice. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.031 Notice of violation.
Whenever the Director finds that a person has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title, or any order issued hereunder, the Director may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person stating the nature of the violation(s).

(2) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice may set forth a deadline within which a compliance schedule for such remediation or restoration must be completed in accordance with AMC 12.80.036. Said notice may further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore the affected property within the deadlines established by and agreed to in the compliance schedule, the work will be done by the City or a contractor designated by the Director and the expense thereof shall be the responsibility of the violator pursuant to AMC 12.80.040. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

The schedule will also address measures to prevent recurrence of the problem. Once approved by the Director, any violation of the compliance schedule is considered a violation of this section. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.040 Abatement.
(1) Immediate Abatement. The Director is authorized to require immediate abatement of any violation of this title that constitutes an immediate threat to the environment or the health, safety or well-being of the public. If any such violation is not abated immediately as directed by the Director, the City of Albany is authorized to enter onto private property and to take any and all measures required to remediate the violation. Any expense related to such remediation undertaken by the City of Albany shall be fully reimbursed by the property owner and/or responsible party. Any relief obtained under this section shall not prevent the City from seeking other and further relief authorized under this title.

(2) Abatement by the City. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in any enforcement action issued by the Director under this chapter, or in the event of a decision of an appeal under AMC 12.80.070, within 10 days of the decision of the City Council, Building Board of Appeals, or Appeal Hearings Officer upholding the decision of the Director, the City or a contractor designated by the Director may enter upon the subject private property and is authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent, or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the City or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.

(3) Recovery of Abatement Costs. Within 30 days after abatement of the nuisance by the City, the Director or his/her designee may prepare a summary of all costs incurred to abate the nuisance, including administrative costs. This summary of costs may be delivered to the same person or persons to whom the enforcement action was sent per AMC 12.80.020, or their successors in title, and shall advise of the City’s intent to assess said costs against the real property and shall further advise the owner/owners of their right to a hearing before the City Council prior to assessment upon receipt by the Director, within 15 days of the date of receipt of notice, of a written request for a hearing.

(a) If the costs of abatement are not paid to the City within 30 days from the date of the receipt of the summary of costs, said summary shall be presented to the City Council and if the Council finds said costs to be reasonable, the Council shall pass an ordinance or resolution directing the amount of said costs be entered in the docket of City liens; and upon such entry being made, said costs shall constitute a lien upon the property in question. Prior to passing said ordinance or resolution, the Council will afford the property owner/owners a right to be heard by the Council if a written request for hearing has been received by the Director within 30 days of the date of mailing of the aforesaid summary of costs.

(b) The lien shall be enforced and shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Council at the time of the ordinance or resolution referred to above. The interest shall commence from the date of entry of the lien in the lien docket and shall have priority over all other liens and assessments to the maximum extent permitted by law.

(c) An error in the name of the property owner/owners/agents shall not void the assessment nor will a failure to receive the notice of the proposed assessment render the assessment void, but it shall remain a valid lien against the property. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.050 Violations deemed a public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties herein provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this title is a threat to the environment, public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored by the City at the violator’s expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken by the City. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.060 Penalties.
(1) Administrative Fines. When the Director finds that a discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this title or any order issued hereunder, and that said violations have caused or contributed to an actual or threatened discharge to the municipal stormwater system or Waters of the State which reasonably appears to present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of people or the environment, the Director may fine such discharger. The amount of such administrative fine shall not be less than $250.00 per violation nor more than $2,500 per violation. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation.

(2) Recovery of Costs Incurred by the City. Any person violating any of the provisions of this title who discharges or causes a discharge producing an obstruction or causes damage to or impairs the City’s stormwater system shall be liable to the City for any expense, loss, or damage caused by such violation or discharge. The City may require the discharger to pay for the costs incurred by the City for any cleaning, repair, or replacement work caused by the violation or discharge and for costs incurred by the City in investigating the violation and in enforcing this title against the user, including reasonable administrative costs, fees for testing, attorney fees, court costs, and all expenses of litigation. Refusal to pay the ordered costs shall constitute a violation of this title. The user shall also reimburse the City for any and all fines or penalties levied against the City as a result of a discharge by the user.

(3) Criminal Penalties. It shall be a misdemeanor punishable under the general penalty provisions of Chapter 1.04 AMC for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this title. The maximum fine or penalty imposed by the municipal court shall be no less than $250.00 for each violation and no part of the fine shall be suspended. Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate violation. The City may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the appropriate local court to enforce the penalty or remedy imposed by the City hereunder.

(4) Compensatory Action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized by this title, the Director and alleged violator may agree upon alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.070 Appeal.
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of AMC 12.80.025 and 12.80.040(1), any person or entity receiving a written notification of an enforcement action under this title may, within 10 days of the receipt of such notice, request in writing that the Director review the enforcement action. The written request (letter of appeal) shall state all points of disagreement and objection to the enforcement action. Upon receipt of the letter of appeal, a meeting shall be scheduled with the Public Works Director of the City of Albany, or authorized representative. The Director or authorized representative shall affirm, modify, or dismiss the enforcement action, and shall give written notice of his or her decision to the alleged violator.

(2) Within 10 days of receipt of the Public Works Director’s written notice of decision outlined above, the alleged violator may appeal the Public Works Director’s decision by serving a written notice of such appeal in the same manner as provided above. Thereafter, a hearing on such appeal shall be scheduled before City Council of the City of Albany, the Building Board of Appeal, or such Appeal Hearings Officer as the City may appoint for such purpose, at the discretion of the City Manager, considering the nature of the issues presented on appeal and the time constraints, resources, and schedule of the public hearing bodies. Thereafter, the City Council, Building Board of Appeal, or the Appeal Hearings Officer may render its decision based upon the record of the hearing on the enforcement action, grant an additional hearing to take additional evidence, or conduct a de novo hearing. The City Council, Building Board of Appeal, or Appeal Hearings Officer, in consultation with the City Attorney, shall establish rules and procedures for the conduct of the appeal in order to accord the discharger lawful due process. The burden of proof, on appeal, shall remain with the City by a preponderance of the evidence. The City Council, Building Board of Appeal, or Appeal Hearings Officer shall affirm, reverse, or modify the findings, conclusions, and requirements of the enforcement action and shall serve its decision, in writing, upon the discharger. The decision of the City Council or Appeal Hearings Officer shall be final. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

12.80.080 Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this title are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable Federal, State, or local law and it is within the discretion of the Director to seek cumulative remedies. The Director may recover all attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement of this title, including sampling and monitoring expenses. (Ord. 5727 § 1, 2010).

15.04.040 Action on Engineer’s report and financial investigation report.
After the Engineer’s report and financial investigation report are filed with the City Recorder, the Council may by resolution approve the reports, modify the reports and approve them as modified, require the Public Works Director or Finance Director to supply additional or different information for the improvement, or abandon the improvement. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.050 Emergencies.
In the event the Council declares by unanimous vote that an emergency exists and that an improvement is essential to the welfare of the City, the procedure described in Sections 15.04.010 to 15.04.030 shall be followed, except that the Council may then declare its intention to initiate the improvement at any time and the Engineer’s report shall be completed and construction work shall commence as soon as is reasonably possible. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.060 Resolution and notice of hearing.
After the Council has approved the Engineer’s report and financial investigation report as submitted or as modified, the Council shall declare by resolution that it intends to make the improvement. The City Recorder shall forthwith give notice of the proposed improvement by posting the notice in the City Hall and by sending a copy of the notice by certified mail, addressed to the last known address of the person currently assessed for the properties to be benefited as shown by the records of the Linn or Benton County Assessor, that a hearing will be held to hear objections, if any, to the proposed improvement.

The notice must be mailed and posted at least 10 days prior to the hearing date.

The notice shall contain the following information and such other information that may be necessary to explain the improvement and the procedure:

The Council may provide in the improvement resolution that the construction work may be done in whole or in part by the City, by contract, by another governmental agency, or by a combination thereof. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.080 Hearing.
If remonstrances are less than the amount required to suspend the proposed improvement, the Council may by motion at the time of the hearing or within 120 days thereafter order the improvement carried out in accordance with the resolution. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.090 Call for bids.
The Council may direct the Public Works Director to prepare plans, specifications and then advertise for bids for construction of all or part of the improvement project. If part of the improvement work is to be done under contract bids, the Council shall proceed in accordance with procedures of state law for public contracting. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.100 Assessment method and alternative methods of financing.
(1) The Council, in adopting a method of assessing the cost of the improvement, may:

(a) Use any just and reasonable method to determine the extent of an improvement district consistent with the benefits derived.

(b) Use any just and reasonable method to apportion the sum to be assessed among the benefited properties.

(c) Authorize payment by the City of all or part of the cost of an improvement when in the opinion of the Council the topographical or physical conditions, unusual or excessive public travel, or another character of the work warrants only partial payment or no payment of the cost by owners of benefited properties.

(2) If some lots in a subdivision are of questionable marketability, the City may require security from the owner prior to award of bids or project construction. Such security may be, but is not limited to, a bond or deposit of collateral.

(3) The Council may elect to provide Bancroft bonding to all or any part of the improvement project. The balance of the project not Bancrofted must be secured to the City in a form acceptable to the City Finance Director prior to award of bids or project construction.

(4) Nothing contained in this section shall preclude the Council from using other means of financing improvements, including federal and state grants-in-aid, sewer charges or fees, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, or other legal means of financing. If other means of financing are used, the Council may levy special assessments according to benefits derived to cover any remaining cost. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.110 Assessment ordinance.
(1) After the work is done and the cost has been actually determined, the Council shall decide whether the benefited property shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The City Recorder or other persons designated by the Council shall prepare the proposed assessment for each lot within the assessment district and file the assessments in the City Recorder’s office.

(2) Notice of the proposed assessment shall be mailed to the owner of each lot proposed to be assessed at the address shown on the Linn or Benton County Tax Assessor’s roll. The notice shall state the amount of assessment proposed on the property and fix a date for a public hearing.

(3) At the hearing, the Council shall:

(a) Consider objections and may adopt, correct, modify, or revise the assessment against each lot in the district according to special and peculiar benefits accruing to it from the improvement.

(b) By ordinance, allocate the assessment in the manner deemed by the Council to be most equitable. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.120 Notice of assessment.
(1) Within 10 days after the ordinance levying assessments has been passed, the City Recorder shall send a notice of assessment to each owner of assessed property by registered or certified mail.

(2) The notice of assessment shall include the name of the property owner, a description of the assessed property, the amount of the assessment, and the effective date of the assessment ordinance, and shall state that interest will begin to run on the assessment and the property will be subject to foreclosure unless the owner either makes application within 10 days to pay the assessment in 20 equal installments or pays the assessment in full within 30 days after the effective date of the assessment ordinance. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.130 Lien record and foreclosure proceedings.
(1) After the assessment ordinance is adopted, the City Recorder shall enter into the docket of liens a statement of the amount assessed on each lot, parcel of land or portion of land, a description of the improvement, names of property owners, and the effective date of the assessment ordinance. On entry into the lien docket the amounts shall become liens and charges on the lots, parcels of land or portions of land that have been assessed for improvement.

(2) Assessment liens of the City shall be superior and prior to all other liens or encumbrances on property insofar as state law permits.

(3) Thirty days after the date of the assessment ordinance, interest shall be charged at a rate to be determined by the Council, and the City may foreclose or enforce collection of assessment liens in the manner provided by state law.

(4) Assessment liens that have been Bancrofted in accordance with Oregon Bancroft Bonding Act and become one year delinquent are subject to foreclosure and penalty and interest charges, as prescribed in Oregon Revised Statutes.

(5) The City may enter a bid on property being offered at a foreclosure sale. The City bid shall be prior to all bids except those made by persons who would be entitled under state law to redeem the property. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.140 Error in assessment calculation.
Claimed errors in the calculation of assessments shall be called to the attention of the City Recorder, who shall determine whether there has been an error. If there has been an error, the recorder shall recommend to the Council an amendment to the assessment ordinance to correct the error. On enactment of the amendment, the recorder shall make the necessary correction in the docket of liens and send a corrected notice of assessment by registered or certified mail. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.150 Supplemental assessments.
If an assessment is made before the total cost of the improvement is determined, and if the amount of the assessment is insufficient to defray expenses of the improvement, the Council may declare the insufficiency by motion and prepare a proposed supplemental assessment. The Council shall set a time for hearing objections to the supplemental assessment and direct the City Recorder to provide notice as required in Section 15.04.060. After the hearing, the Council shall make a just and equitable supplemental assessment by ordinance, which shall be entered in the docket of liens as provided by Section 15.04.130. Notice of the supplemental assessment shall be mailed, and collection of the assessment shall be made in accordance with Sections 15.04.130 and 15.04.150. (Ord. 4652 § 1, 1984).

15.04.160 Rebates.
On completion of the improvement project, if the assessment previously levied on any property is found to be more than sufficient to pay the cost of the improvement, the Council shall determine the excess and declare it by ordinance. When declared, the excess amounts must be entered in the lien docket as a credit on the appropriate assessment.

15.04.180 Abandonment of proceedings.
The Council may abandon proceedings for improvements made under Sections 15.04.010 to 15.04.210 at any time before final completion of the improvements.

15.16.010 Findings.
(1) The systems development charge established herein is intended to be a charge upon the act of development by whomever seeks the development. It is a fee for service because it is the development which requires essential municipal services based upon the nature of the development. The timing and the extent of the development is within the control and discretion of the developer.

(2) The systems development charge imposed by this chapter is not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of Sec. 11b, Art. XI of the Oregon Constitution or the legislation implementing that section.

(3) Even if the systems development charge herein imposed is viewed under Sec. 11b, Art. XI of the Oregon Constitution as a tax against property or against a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of that property, it is an incurred charge within the meaning of that section and the statutes implementing it because:

(a) It allows the owner to control the quantity of the service by determining the extent of development to occur upon the property.

(b) It allows the owner to determine when the service is to be initiated or increased by controlling when the development occurs.

(c) State law and the ordinances of this City require the owner to provide certain basic utility services to the property when it is developed for human occupancy. The provision of these basic utility services are a routine obligation of the owner of the affected property and essential to the health and safety of the community.

(4) Among the basic utility services required of every property with a structure designed for human occupancy, except ancillary buildings, are water, sanitary sewer, and transportation services.

(5) The systems development charge imposed by this chapter is based upon the actual costs of providing existing or planned-for capital improvements and does not impose charges on persons not receiving a service and imposing a burden upon the City’s existing capital improvements. (Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 1, 1991).

15.16.020 Definitions.
As used in this chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, the words and phrases have the following meaning:

(1) “Capital improvement(s)” means facilities or assets used for any of the following:

(a) Water supply, storage, treatment and distribution; or

(b) Sanitary sewers, including collection, transmission, treatment and disposal; or

(c) Transportation, including streets, sidewalks, bikeways, traffic signals and signage, and street drainage collection systems.

(2) “Development” means the act of making a manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate (e.g. constructing a building or conducting a mining operation) or making a physical change in the use or appearance of a structure or land which increases the usage of any capital improvements or which creates the need for additional capital improvements.

(3) “Improvement fee” means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements to be constructed after the date the ordinance codified in this chapter becomes effective.

(4) “Qualified public improvements” means a capital improvement that is required as a condition of development approval, identified in the plan adopted pursuant to AMC 15.16.060(2) and either:

(a) Not located on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval (as used in this definition, “contiguous” means in a public way which abuts); or

(b) Located in whole or in part on or contiguous to property that is the subject of development approval and required to be built larger or with greater capacity than is necessary for the particular development project to which the improvement fee is related.

(5) “Reimbursement fee” means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements constructed or under construction on the effective date of this chapter.

(6) “Systems development charge” means a reimbursement fee, an improvement fee, or a combination thereof, assessed or collected at any of the times specified in AMC 15.16.070. It shall also include that portion of a water or sanitary sewer connection charge that is greater than the amount necessary to reimburse the City for its average cost of inspecting and installing connections with the water system or the sanitary sewer system. “Systems development charge” does not include:

(a) Any fees assessed or collected as part of a local improvement district;

(b) A charge in lieu of a local improvement district assessment; or

(c) The cost of complying with requirements or conditions imposed upon a land use decision. (Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 2, 1991).

15.16.030 Purpose.
The purpose of the systems development charge is to impose a portion of the public cost of capital improvements upon those developments that create the need for, or increase, the demands on capital improvements. (Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 3, 1991).

15.16.040 Scope.
The systems development charge imposed by this chapter is separate from and in addition to any applicable tax, assessment, charge, fee, in-lieu-of assessment, or fee otherwise provided by law or imposed as a condition of development. A systems development charge is to be considered in the nature of a charge for service to be rendered or a service hookup charge. (Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 4, 1991).

15.16.050 Systems development charge established.
(1) Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or other local or state law, a systems development charge is hereby imposed upon all new development within the City, and all new development outside the boundary of the City that connects to or otherwise uses the water system or sanitary sewer system of the City.

(2) A systems development charge is also imposed upon all new development within the City, and all new development outside the boundary of the City that expands its usage of the water or sanitary sewer systems because of intensification of the existing development.

(3) Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or other local or state law, a systems development charge is also imposed upon all new development within the City that expands its usage of the transportation system or generates additional traffic because of new development or intensification of the existing development.

(4) When the Council determines to establish a systems development charge for any capital improvement it shall do so by Council resolution.

(5) Because the systems development charge and supporting calculations, including the credits established herein, are closely related to the cost of construction of the capital improvements for each of the systems, the systems development charge and calculations for each system shall be automatically adjusted on the first day of July of each calendar year. The City Engineer shall make the adjustment based upon the Seattle Construction Cost Index published by Engineering News Record (ENR) by calculating the percentage increase/decrease in the index for the period since the last adjustment and then applying that percentage to the figures used to calculate the systems development charge and any credits. (Ord. 5306, 1997; Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 5, 1991).

15.16.060 Compliance with state law.
(1) The revenues received from the water system development charge shall be deposited to the water improvement fee and/or water reimbursement fee funds. The revenues from the sewer system development charge shall be deposited to the sewer improvement fee and/or reimbursement fee funds. The revenues from the transportation system development charge shall be deposited to the transportation improvement fee and/or reimbursement fee funds. These funds shall be budgeted and expended as provided by State law. The accounting of such revenues and expenditures required by State law shall be included in the City’s annual financial audit required by ORS Chapter 294.

(2) The capital improvement plan(s) required by State law as the basis for expending revenues from the improvement fees portion of the systems development charge shall be the project lists contained within the most recently adopted water, wastewater, stormwater, and transportation system plans or the project list referenced in the associated methodology.

(3) As provided by State law, the plan or list described in subsection (2) of this section may be modified at any time. If a system development charge will be increased by a proposed modification of the list to include a capacity increasing capital improvement:

(a) The City shall provide, at least 30 days prior to the adoption of the modification, notice of the proposed modification to the persons who have requested written notice described in AMC 15.16.100(1).

(b) The City shall hold a public hearing if the City receives a written request for a hearing on the proposed modification within seven days of the date the proposed modification is scheduled for adoption. (Ord. 5750, 2011; Ord. 5456, 2000; Ord. 5306, 1997; Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 6, 1991).

15.16.070 Collection of charge.
(1) The water system development charge is payable upon issuance of a permit to connect to the water system. The sewer system development charge is payable upon issuance of a permit to connect to the sanitary sewer system. The transportation system development charge is payable upon issuance of a building permit for any new construction, including a building permit for a manufactured home park.

(2) If development is commenced or connection is made to the water system, sanitary sewer system, or transportation system without an appropriate permit, the systems development charge is immediately payable upon the earliest date that a permit was required.

(3) The Building Official or the official’s designee shall collect the systems development charge from the person responsible for or receiving the benefit of the development. The Building Official or the official’s designee shall not issue any permit or allow connection described in AMC 15.16.070 (1) until the charge has been paid in full or until provision for installment payments has been made within the limits prescribed in AMC 15.16.070(5).

(4) A systems development charge paid hereunder shall apply to the particular lot or tract for which it is issued. Any changes of use which require additional connections or intensification of use to the water, sanitary sewer, or transportation system shall cause an additional systems development charge to be paid. The owner of the property shall be given credit only for those systems development charges theretofore paid involving the same parcel of property. Where a structure which is serviced by capital improvements is destroyed by fire, flood, wind, or act of God, no systems development charge shall be imposed for a replacement of the structure, provided the use thereof is not intensified.

(5) The obligation to pay the unpaid systems development charge and interest thereon shall be secured. Acceptable security to insure payment includes: property, bond, deposits, letter of credit, or the obligor may request a lien be placed against the property to be developed. (Ord. 5334, 1998; Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 7, 1991).

15.16.080 Exemptions.
Repealed by Ord. 5730. (Ord. 5315, 1997; Ord. 5306, 1997; Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 8, 1991).

15.16.090 Credits.
(1) When development occurs that must pay a systems development charge under AMC 15.16.050, the systems development charge for the existing use shall be calculated and if it is less than the systems development charge for the proposed use, the difference between the systems development charge for the existing use and the systems development charge for the proposed use shall be the systems development charge required under AMC 15.16.050. If the change in use results in the systems development charge for the proposed use being less than the systems development charge for the existing use, no systems development charge shall be required; however, no refund or credit shall be given.

(2) A credit against the improvement fee portion of the systems development charge shall be given for the cost of a qualified public improvement associated with development.

(a) The credit provided for in this section shall be only for the improvement fee charged for the type of improvement being constructed, and credit for qualified public improvements under AMC 15.16.020(4)(b) may be granted only for the cost of that portion of such improvement that exceeds the government units minimum standard facility size or capacity needed to serve the particular development project or property. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies for credit under AMC 15.16.020(4)(b).

(b) When the construction of a qualified public improvement gives rise to a credit amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be levied against the project receiving development approval, the excess credit may be applied against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the original development project.

(c) Credits shall be used not later than 10 years from the date the credit is given.

(d) Credits shall be established using the method outlined in the transportation system development charge fee resolution or, in the case of water and sewer systems development charges, by Council policy, and shall be included in an agreement signed by the applicant and the City Engineer that states the amount of the credit and the effective date of the agreement.

(3) The Finance Director shall be responsible for all recording and accounting associated with the distribution of credits. (Ord. 5306, 1997; Ord. 5157, 1994; Ord. 4966 § 9, 1991).

15.16.100 Appeal procedures.
(1) The Finance Director will maintain a list of persons who have made a written request for notification prior to adoption or amendment of a methodology for any systems development charge. The Finance Director will mail written notice to persons on the list at least 45 days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend a systems development charge, and the methodology supporting the adoption or amendment will be available 30 days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend. The failure of a person on the list to receive a notice that was mailed will not invalidate the action of the City. The City may periodically delete names from the list, but, at least 30 days prior to removing a name from the list, will notify the person whose name is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is required if the person wishes to remain on the notification list.

(2) Parties challenging the methodology for establishing the systems development charge may appeal the methodology by filing a written appeal with the Finance Director within 60 days of passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter. Such appeals shall describe with particularity the portion of the methodology, calculations, or assumptions which are being asked for reconsideration. All appeal requests shall comply with subsection (6) of this section.

15.20.010 Findings.
(1) The Parks SDC established herein is intended to be a charge upon the act of residential development by whomever seeks the residential development. It is a fee for service because it is the residential development which requires essential municipal services based upon the nature of the residential development. The timing and the extent of the residential development is within the control and discretion of the developer.

(2) The Parks SDC imposed in this chapter is not intended to be a tax on property or on a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of property within the meaning of Sec. IIb, Art. XI of the Oregon Constitution or the legislation implementing that section.

(3) Even if the Parks SDC herein imposed is viewed under Sec. IIb, Art. XI of the Oregon Constitution as a tax against property or against a property owner as a direct consequence of ownership of that property, it is an incurred charge within the meaning of that section and the statutes implementing it because:

(a) It allows the owner to control the quantity of the service by determining the extent of residential development to occur upon the property.

(b) It allows the owner to determine when the service is to be initiated or increased by controlling when the residential development occurs.

(c) State law and the ordinances of the City of Albany require the owner to provide certain basic utility services to the property when it is developed for human occupancy. The provision of these basic services are a routine obligation of the owner of the affected property and essential to the health and safety of the community.

(4) Among the basic services required of every property with a structure designed for human occupancy, except ancillary buildings, are parks, open space, recreation centers and trails.

(5) The Parks SDC imposed in this chapter is based upon the actual costs of providing existing or planned parks capital improvements and does not impose charges on persons not receiving a service and imposing a burden upon the City’s existing parks capital improvements. (Ord. 5084 § 1, 1993).

The remaining balance of the Parks SDC shall be due and payable at the time the first placement permit is granted for each space based upon the actual number of bedrooms and square footage contained in each manufactured home. When the actual size of the manufactured home is known, at the time of placement, the correct Parks SDC shall be determined and, after applying a proportionate credit for that portion of the charge which was paid at the time of land use approval, the remaining balance shall be due and payable.

(4) The owner(s) of vacant lots or spaces within an existing manufactured home park that has received all necessary land use approvals prior to January 1, 1994, shall pay a Parks SDC which is limited to 50 percent of the applicable Parks SDC for each space at the time the first placement permit is granted for that space.

15.20.090 Credits.
(1) When residential development occurs that must pay a Parks SDC under AMC Section 15.20.050 hereof, the Parks SDC for the existing use shall be calculated and if it is less than the Parks SDC for the proposed use, the difference between the Parks SDC for the existing use and the Parks SDC for the proposed use shall be the Parks SDC required under AMC Section 15.20.050. If the change in use results in the Parks SDC for the proposed use being less than the Parks SDC for the existing use, no Parks SDC shall be required; however, no refund or credit shall be given.

(2) The City of Albany may grant a credit against the Parks SDC imposed pursuant to AMC Section 15.20.050 for the contribution of land for, or the construction of, any qualified public improvements determined by the City to satisfy a specific element of the parks capital improvements required as part of the Albany Parks and Recreation Master Plan and this Parks SDC.

(a) Such land contribution and/or construction shall be subject to the approval of the Albany Parks and Recreation Commission. The amount of credit to be applied to the Parks SDC shall be determined according to the following standards of valuation:

(i) The value of contributed lands shall be based upon a written appraisal of the fair market value conducted at the applicant’s expense and mutual consent of the City by an independent and certified appraiser. The appraisal shall be based upon comparable sales of similar property between unrelated parties; and

(ii) The cost of anticipated construction of qualified public improvements shall be based upon cost estimates which are approved by an independent and certified architect or engineer.

(b) Prior to issuance of a building or development permit, the applicant shall submit to the Parks and Recreation Commission, a proposed plan and estimate of cost of contributions of qualified public improvements. The proposed plan and estimate shall include:

(i) A designation of the development for which the proposed plan is being submitted;

(ii) A legal description of any land proposed to be contributed and a written appraisal prepared in conformity with subsection (a)(i) of this section;

(iv) An estimate of proposed construction costs approved by an independent and certified architect or engineer; and

(v) A proposed time schedule for completion of the proposed plan.

(c) The principal factors the Parks and Recreation Commission will use to determine the eligibility of a proposed qualified public improvement as a credit against a Parks SDC shall include the following:

(i) Size, location and cost of maintenance; and

(ii) The extent to which the proposed capital improvement satisfies capital improvement requirements identified in the Parks and Recreation Master Plan pursuant to AMC Section 15.20.060(2); and

(iii) Consideration shall be given only to those capital improvements which are in excess of those required as a condition of land use approval.

(d) If the Parks and Recreation Commission accepts the proposed contribution, credit shall be allowed for the appraised and agreed value of the land or qualified capital improvements.

(e) Any applicant who submits a proposed plan pursuant to this section and desires the immediate issuance of a building permit or development permit shall pay the applicable Parks SDC charges. Said payment shall be deemed paid under “protest” and shall not be construed as a waiver of any review rights.

15.30.040    Use of monies raised through connection charges.

15.30.050    Failure to pay connection charge.

15.30.010 Application of connection charges.
A connection charge shall be due and payable when any person, corporation, or legal entity, connects to or accesses the City’s sanitary sewers, water distribution facilities, storm drains, and/or improved streets, from or for the benefit of any real property against which no assessment has previously been levied or for which the cost of constructing the sanitary sewer, water distribution facility, storm drain, and/or improved street has not been paid by the property owner or predecessor thereof. The City Council shall by separate resolution establish, and may from time to time amend, a methodology which shall be used to determine the criteria by which a determination will be made concerning the application of any particular connection charge to any particular property within the City. (Ord. 5565 § 4, 2003).

15.30.020 Timing and procedures for determination of connection charge.
If the sanitary sewer, water distribution facility, storm drain, and/or improved street is to be utilized pursuant to any activity involving a land division, the amount of the applicable connection charge shall be paid, in full, prior to the signing of the final plat. In all other cases, the connection charge shall be assessed and paid, in full, prior to the issuance of any building permit or encroachment permit authorizing construction on real property which will utilize or connect to any of the City facilities in AMC 15.30.010. (Ord. 5565 § 4, 2003).

15.30.030 Determination of the amount of the connection charge.
The City Council shall, by separate resolution, establish and may, from time to time, revise, a methodology for determining a fair and equitable connection charge when such charge is due pursuant to AMC 15.30.020. (Ord. 5565 § 4, 2003).

15.30.040 Use of monies raised through connection charges.
Revenues obtained through connection charges shall only be used for the same type of facility for which the charge was collected. For example, street connection charges shall only be utilized for authorized street fund purposes. Connection charges may be used to repay third persons, other governmental entities, or the City in the event that these entities provided the original funding which constructed the improved facility to which connection is allowed. (Ord. 5922 § 1, 2018; Ord. 5565 § 4, 2003).

15.30.050 Failure to pay connection charge.
Any development permit, building permit, or encroachment permit erroneously issued by the City without payment of the connection charge required by this chapter shall be void and, in addition to any other remedy or consequence which may follow from the use or occupancy of premises without the required permit, failure to pay the connection charge within 10 days following written notice by the City, addressed to the property owner at the address shown on the applicable county tax records, shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable under the general penalty provided at AMC 1.04.010. (Ord. 5565 § 4, 2003).

It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to engage in any work, conduct, or activity for which a permit, certificate, label, or other formal authorization is required by this title or other regulation without first obtaining such permit, certificate, label, or other formal authorization. Permits are required for any work that is regulated under the State Building Code as per ORS Chapter 455 and the rules adopted thereunder, as well as any work, activity, use, or review required by any code, policy, or procedure within this jurisdiction that is enforced by the Building Official, which may include occupancy reclassifications, grading, signs, demolition, new parking lots, regrading and parking lot resurfacing/striping, or land use activity regulated by the Albany Municipal Code or development code. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

18.06.020 Application for a building permit.
To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first apply to the City of Albany Building Division. Every such application shall:

(3) Indicate the use or occupancy for which the proposed work is intended;

(4) Be accompanied by plans, diagrams, computations and specifications, and other data as required in this chapter;

(5) State the valuation of any new building or structure, or any addition, remodeling, or alteration to an existing building;

(6) Be signed by the owner, or the owner’s authorized agent;

(7) Provide satisfactory proof of ownership or agency;

(8) Provide plans showing all rights-of-way, easements, covenants, and other such interests in the land that may be impacted by construction; and

If the Building Official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications, and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this title and the technical codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees specified in Chapter 18.12 AMC have been paid, the Building Official shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant.

(2) When the Building Official issues a permit where plans are required, the Building Official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications “APPROVED.” Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the Building Official, and all work regulated by this title shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.

Construction associated with phased, partial, or deferred submittals and permits shall be done at the permit holder’s risk.

(2) The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this title. If the holder of a partial permit elects to proceed, he/she shall do so without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. Additional costs for partial permits and/or deferred submittals shall be determined and assessed by the Building Official and charged to the applicant for the permit. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh.

One set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant, and said set shall be kept in good order and in clean, legible condition on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. If the applicant needs additional copies of approved plans, the Building Official may review and approve additional copies, charging the applicant the review cost plus overhead charges for providing the additional plan copies. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

18.06.070 Validity of permit.
(1) The issuance of a permit or approval of plans, specifications, and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this title or of any other code of the jurisdiction, or any other federal, state, or local law, statute, rule, regulation, or code. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid.

(2) The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications, and other data shall not prevent the Building Official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications, and other data, requiring additional engineering data, or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of this title or of any other codes of this jurisdiction. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

18.06.080 Expiration of plan review application.
Applications for which no permit is issued within 180 days following the date of the application shall expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days upon written request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. No application shall be extended more than once, unless expressly authorized by the Building Official. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee. When an applicant applies for concurrent plan review, the applicant assumes the responsibility and risk of obtaining all approvals required by other departments within the 180-day period. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

The work shall not be considered suspended or abandoned where the permittee has pursued activities deemed by the Building Official to indicate the intent to start and complete the project. The Building Official may require the permittee to document these activities.

(2) Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply to the Building Official for an extension of the time within which work is to be completed under that permit when the permittee is unable to complete work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The Building Official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days on written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented work from being completed. No permit shall be extended more than once, unless expressly authorized by the Building Official.

(3) Where a permit has expired, the permit may be reinstated and the work authorized by the original permit can be recommenced, provided the following are met:

(b) No changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work.

(c) The original permit expired less than one year from the request to reinstate.

(4) The fee for a reinstated permit shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit plus any costs incurred as a result of investigations.

18.06.100 Investigation.
(1) Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this title or the technical codes has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, an investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work. This investigation is subject to the fees described below, and may or may not result in a penalty.

(2) The Building Official may require an investigation in order to ascertain whether a party is in possession of a state license, and/or is in compliance with other state-mandated requirements.

(3) Unless waived by the Building Official, an investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The amount of the investigation fee shall be the average or actual additional cost of ensuring that a building, structure, or system is in conformance with State Building Code requirements that results from the person not obtaining a required permit before work for which the permit is required commences. A party aggrieved by the imposition of a special investigation fee may appeal the imposition of the special investigation fee to the Albany Building Board of Appeals in the manner prescribed in Chapter 18.14 AMC. The payment of such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of this title or the technical codes, nor from any penalty prescribed by law. (Ord. 5877 § 1, 2016; Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this title and the technical codes whenever the permit is issued in error on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or if its issuance, or activity thereunder, is in violation of any state or local statute, code, or regulation, or if the permittee violates any term or condition of the permit or this title. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

(2) It shall be the duty of the person requesting any inspections required by this title to provide safe access to and means for inspection of such work, including any and all required special equipment, tools, ladders, belts, clothes, or other protective equipment or devices.

(3) It shall be the duty of the permit holder or authorized agent to request all inspections that may be necessary, or otherwise required, in a timely manner, to provide access to the site, and to provide all equipment as may be deemed necessary or appropriate by the Building Official. The permit holder shall not proceed with construction activity until authorized to do so by the Building Official.

(4) Work requiring a permit shall not be commenced until the permit holder or an agent of the permit holder has posted or otherwise made available an inspection record card, if required, such as to allow the Building Official to conveniently make the required entries thereon regarding inspection of the work.

(2) Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or is otherwise unavailable on the work site, when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the Building Official.

(3) In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid, unless authorized by the Building Official. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

A), 2006).

It shall be the responsibility of the permit holder to ensure that the results of the special inspection are made available to the Building Official and the city inspector at the job site prior to, and at the time of, the city inspection. (Ord. 5647 § 1 (Exh. A), 2006).

18.08.080 Approval required.
(1) Work shall not be done beyond the point indicated in each successive inspection without first obtaining the approval of the Building Official. The Building Official, upon notification, shall make the requested inspections and shall either indicate that that portion of the construction is satisfactory as completed, or shall notify the permit holder, or an agent of the permit holder, wherein the same fails to comply with this title. Any portions which do not comply shall be corrected and such portion(s) shall not be covered or concealed until authorized by the Building Official.

(3) In cases where there are outstanding corrections and/or deficiencies that do not present a hazard or immediate public concern, the building official may grant a temporary certificate of occupancy. When granting a temporary certificate of occupancy, the Building Official shall provide the permit holder with conditions and time restrictions for compliance and final approval.

(4) Upon failure to obtain final approval and a certificate of occupancy, when applicable, and/or upon the expiration of the permit, the Building Official, in addition to other remedies, may file a notice of noncompliance with the County Recorder. To remove the notice, proof of compliance must be provided and all enforcement costs, recording costs, and filing costs determined by the Building Official must be paid by the permit holder.

(5) Changes in the character or use of a building shall not be made except as specified in the Building Code.

(6) Issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be construed as an approval of a violation to the provisions of this code or of other City ordinances. The Building Official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a certificate of occupancy issued under the provisions of this title when the certificate is issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information, or when it is determined that the building or structure, or portion thereof, is in violation of an ordinance, regulation, or the provisions of this title.

GENERAL ADMINISTRATION OF TITLE 20
1.010 Official Name. The official name of this Title is “Title 20, Development Code and Zoning Map.” It may be referred to as “Development Code” or “Code” or “ADC.”
1.020 Purpose. The general purpose of this Code is to set forth and coordinate City regulations governing the development and use of land. The Code is more specifically intended to do the following:
(1) Serve as the principal vehicle for implementation of the City’s Comprehensive Plan in a manner that protects the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Albany.
(2) Satisfy relevant requirements of federal law, state law, statewide goals, and administrative rules.
(3) Facilitate prompt review of development proposals and the application of clear and specific standards.
(4) Provide for public information, review, and comment on development proposals that may have a significant impact on the community.
(5) Guide public and private planning policies and actions to ensure provision of adequate water, sewer, transportation, drainage, parks, open space and other public facilities and services for each development, as applicable.
(6) Establish procedures and standards requiring that the design of site improvements and building improvements are consistent with applicable standards and design guidelines.
(7) Provide for review and approval of the relationship between land uses and traffic circulation in order to minimize congestion.
(8) Require that permitted uses and site designs provide reasonable protection from fire, flood, landslide, erosion, or other natural hazards, as well as prevent the spread of blight, and help prevent crime.
(9) Protect and enhance the city’s beauty and character.
(10) Protect constitutional property rights, provide due process of law, and give consideration in all matters to affected property owner interests in making land use decisions.
1 Entire article replaced with Ordinance 5947, January 1, 2021.
Albany Development Code, Article 1 1 - 2 January 1, 2021
1.025 Legislative Intent. In addition to the purposes set forth above, subsequent amendments to this Code may be accompanied by staff reports and additional findings, which may be used to more accurately determine the purpose and legislative intent of specific provisions.
1.030 Scope and Compliance. A parcel of land or a structure may be used or developed only as this Code permits. The requirements of this Code apply to the property owner(s), the person(s) undertaking a development, the user(s) of a development, and to their successors in interest.
1.035 Severability. The provisions of this Code are severable. If any portion of this Code is declared by a court of law to be invalid or unconstitutional, the decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions.
1.040 Interpretation.
(1) Except as otherwise specified, the definitions included in Article 22 shall be used to interpret the provisions of this Code.
(2) The Director shall have the initial authority and responsibility to interpret all terms, provisions, and requirements of this ordinance. For quasi-judicial interpretations, the Type II procedure set forth in Section 1.230 shall be followed. For legislative interpretations, the procedures as set forth in Section 1.260 shall be followed. A person requesting such an interpretation shall do so in writing to the Director.
(3) The terms of this ordinance shall be liberally construed to give maximum effect to the purposes set forth in Section 1.020.
(4) Where the conditions imposed by a provision of this Code are less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by other provisions of this Code or other sections of the Albany Municipal Code, the more restrictive shall govern.
1.050 Consistency with Plan and Laws. Actions initiated under this Code shall be consistent with the adopted Comprehensive Plan of the City of Albany and with applicable state and federal laws and regulations as these plans, laws, and regulations may now or hereafter provide. Since the City of Albany has a Comprehensive Plan and implementing regulations that have been acknowledged by the State of Oregon as being in compliance with statewide goals, any action taken in conformance with this Code shall be deemed also in compliance with statewide goals and the Comprehensive Plan. Unless stated otherwise within this Code, specific findings demonstrating compliance with the Comprehensive Plan are not required for land use application approval. However, this provision shall not relieve the applicant of the burden of responding to allegations that the development action requested is inconsistent with one or more Comprehensive Plan policies.
1.055 Fees. The City Council shall establish application review fees, and fee policies by separate resolution for the performance of the actions and reviews required by this Code.
1.060 Official Action. All officials, departments, and employees of the City vested with authority to issue permits, certificates, or licenses shall adhere to and require conformance with this Title.
1.070 Certificate of Occupancy. It shall be unlawful to use or occupy any new building or premises until a certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Building Official stating that the proposed use of the building or land conforms to the requirements of the adopted building code, this ordinance, and any other City conditions attached to the development or use of the building or land.
1.080 Approval Runs with the Land. Unless expired, approval of a land use or development permit decision runs with the land. The approval transfers to a new owner if the property is sold.
LAND USE REVIEW PROCEDURES GENERALLY
1.100 Applicability of Review Procedures. Except for those activities and developments listed in Section 1.105, all land use and development permit decisions will be made by using the procedures contained in this Article. The procedure "type" assigned to each application governs the decision-making process for that permit or application. There are six types of permit/application procedures as described in subsections (1) through (6) below. Table 1.100-1 lists the City's land use and development applications and corresponding review procedure(s).
Albany Development Code, Article 1 1 - 3 January 1, 2021
(1) Type I Procedure (Ministerial Staff Review). A Type I procedure is used in applying City land use standards and criteria that do not require the use of discretion, interpretation, or the exercise of policy or legal judgment (i.e., clear and objective standards). Type I decisions are made by the Director without public notice and without a public hearing. Appeals of Type I decisions are to Circuit Court under writ of review.
(2) Type I-L Procedure (Staff Review with Notice). A Type I-L procedure is used for some tentative plats and when applying discretionary land use standards that regulate the physical characteristics of a use which is permitted outright. Type I-L decisions are made by the Director and require public notice and an opportunity for appeal to a local hearing body. With the exception of Historic Resource decisions which are appealed to the Landmarks Commission, appeals of Type I-L decisions are heard by the Planning Commission.
(3) Type II Procedure (Staff Review with Notice of Decision). A Type II procedure is used when the land use standards and criteria require some discretion, interpretation, or policy or legal judgment. The Director is the person designated in accordance with ORS 227.175 to make Type II decisions. Type II decisions require public notice and an opportunity for appeal to a local hearing body. With the exception of Historic Resource decisions which are appealed to the Landmarks Commission, appeals of Type II decisions are heard by the Planning Commission.
(4) Type III Procedure (Quasi-Judicial Review—Public Hearing). A Type III procedure is used when the land use standards and criteria require discretion, interpretation, or policy or legal judgment or for large projects. Quasi-Judicial decisions implement established policy but typically involve discretion. Type III decisions are made by the Planning Commission, Hearings Board or Landmarks Commission and require public notice and a public hearing, with an opportunity for appeal to the City Council.
(5) Type IV-Q Procedure (Quasi-Judicial Review—City Council Public Hearing). The Type IV-Q procedure is used when the land use standards and criteria require discretion, interpretation, or policy or legal judgment and is the procedure used for site-specific land use actions initiated by an applicant. The application is heard by the Planning Commission, Hearings Board, or Landmarks Commission. If the recommending body makes a favorable recommendation, the City Council will hold a hearing and make a final decision. If the Planning Commission, Hearings Board, or Landmarks Commission recommends against a proposal, the City Council will only consider the proposal on appeal by the applicant. Appeal of the City Council’s Type IV-Q decisions are heard by the state Land Use Board of Appeals.
(6) Type IV-L Procedure (Legislative Review). Legislative review procedures are used to review proposals to amend the Albany Comprehensive Plan, the City's land use regulations, and large-scale changes to the Comprehensive Plan or Plan Maps, and involve the creation, revision, or implementation of broad public policy. Legislative proposals are first considered by the Planning Commission, which makes a recommendation to City Council. City Council makes the final decision on a legislative proposal through the enactment of an ordinance. Appeals of legislative decisions are heard by the state Land Use Board of Appeals.

The pre-application conference is intended to be a tool to assist applicants in navigating the land use process, but is not intended to be an exhaustive review that identifies or resolves all potential issues, and does not bind or preclude the City from enforcing any applicable regulations or from applying regulations in a manner differently than may have been indicated at the time of the pre-application conference.

(b) The proposed use, layout, and/or design of the proposal have significantly changed; or
(c) The owner and/or developer of a project changes after the pre-application conference and prior to application submittal.
(7) Written Summary. Upon the applicant’s request, the Director shall provide the applicant with a written summary of the conference.

If the review body determines that the modified site plan is not consistent with the original approval, then approval of the site plan will be denied. If a new application is submitted, it will be subject to the Development Code standards in effect at the time the new application is submitted.
(8) The review body’s determination on consistency shall be based on a comparison of the approved site plan and the modified site plan, taking into account:
(a) The land use category;
(b) The size and scale of the proposed building(s);
(c) The number of dwelling units;
(d) Traffic and other off-site impacts;
(e) Compatibility with surrounding development;
Albany Development Code, Article 1 1 - 27 January 1, 2021
(f) Capacity of available infrastructure; and
(g) Unusual obstacles and opportunities associated with the property.
The modified site plan will be found to be consistent with the approved site plan if the review body determines that there are no greater adverse impacts, or, if additional adverse impacts are identified, they have been adequately mitigated.
(9) Conditions of approval:
(a) When reviewing a modified site plan that has different impacts than the approved site plan, the decision-maker may modify conditions or impose new ones. Only conditions related to the impact of the modified site plan may be imposed on the modified site plan approval. “Impact” means characteristics of the development such as traffic, wastewater discharge, noise, etc.
(b) The original conditions of approval imposed for the approved site plan may remain in effect or be increased as necessary to address additional impact. Conditions related to improving existing infrastructure or building new infrastructure (such as streets, sewers, etc.) may be reduced only if the modification substantially reduces the infrastructure burden created by the development.
(10) The property owner may choose to either accept approval of the modified site plan or to retain the original approval. If the property owner accepts approval of the modified site plan and any conditions that may be imposed, the property owner must give written notice to the Planning Division within 14 days of the date on the notice of decision for approval of the modified site plan. If the property owner accepts approval of the modified site plan, the new approval supersedes and voids the original approval.
If the property owner does not provide the required written notice of acceptance, or if the review body does not approve the modified site plan, the project shall continue to be subject to the original conditions of approval and timelines.
(11) When a modified site plan is approved and accepted, the approval is valid for one year beyond the date that the original site plan approval would have expired. (For example, if the original approval would have expired on July 1, 2001, the approval of the modified site plan is extended to July 1, 2002.) No additional extensions of time will be allowed for subsequent modifications.
1.340 Request to Modify a Condition of Approval. A request to modify a condition of approval is processed using the procedure assigned to the land use review and the approval criteria for the original land use review.
APPEALS
1.410 Appeals Generally. Appeals shall be heard by the reviewing body specified in Table 1.410-1 provided that the City Council has the discretion to choose to hear any appeal which would otherwise go to the Landmarks Commission or Planning Commission.

The presiding officer may establish the time allowed for presentation of information.
(2) Any objections on jurisdictional grounds shall be noted in the record.
(3) Any abstentions or disqualifications shall be determined. Members shall announce all conflicts of interest and shall disclose the time, place, and nature of any ex-parte contacts they have had.

(15) At the close of presentation of information the presiding officer shall declare that the hearing is closed unless, before the conclusion of the initial evidentiary hearing, any participant has requested an opportunity to present additional evidence, arguments, or testimony regarding the application. The local hearings authority shall grant such a request by continuing the public hearing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection, or leaving the record open for additional written evidence, arguments, or testimony pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection.
Albany Development Code, Article 1 1 - 32 January 1, 2021
(a) If the hearings authority grants a continuance, the hearing shall be continued to a date, time, and place certain at least seven days from the date of the initial evidentiary hearing.

If such a request is filed, the hearings authority shall reopen the record pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.
(c) A continuance or extension granted pursuant to this section shall be subject to the limitation of ORS 227.178, unless the continuance or extension is requested or agreed to by the applicant.
(d) Unless waived by the applicant, the hearings authority shall allow the applicant at least seven days after the record is closed to all other parties to submit final written arguments in support of the application(s). The applicant’s final submittal shall be considered part of the record, but shall not include any new evidence. This seven-day period shall not be subject to the limitations of ORS 227.178.
(e) When the hearings authority reopens a record to admit new evidence, arguments or testimony, any person may raise new issues that relate to the new evidence, arguments, testimony, or criteria for decision-making which apply to the matter at issue.

ENFORCEMENT
1.710 Inspections. The Director or designee may make periodic and routine inspections of properties and premises within the corporate limits of Albany. The purpose of these inspections shall be to determine whether there is compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations designed to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The Director is also empowered to make such inspections upon receiving complaints, specific or general information, or observations indicating the existence of hazardous conditions or non-compliance with such rules, regulations, and laws. If any authorized officer or employee of the City of Albany is denied access to any property or premises for the purposes of making an inspection provided for in this ordinance, then the officer or employee shall not inspect the premises unless and until he has obtained from the City’s municipal judge a search warrant for the inspection of the premises.
1.720 Search Warrants. A search warrant for inspections can only be issued under the terms of this ordinance when an affidavit has been filed with the City’s municipal court showing probable cause for the inspection by stating:
(1) The purpose and extent of the proposed inspection;
(2) The ordinance or ordinances that form the basis for the inspection; and
(3) Whether it is a routine or periodic inspection, an inspection initiated by complaint, other specific or general information, or an observation concerning the property or premises or the area in which it is situated.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to hinder, delay, or obstruct the inspection of premises based on a search warrant issued under the terms of this ordinance.
1.730 Abatement. The location, erection, construction, maintenance, repair, alteration or use of a building or other structure in violation of this ordinance shall be deemed a nuisance and may be abated as such.

1.740 Code Enforcement. The Director or designee may enforce the provisions of this ordinance using the remedies provided in Sections 1.610 through 1.690 herein and elsewhere within the Albany Municipal Code.

ARTICLE 2 REVIEW CRITERIA
2.010 Overview. The Development Code provides nondiscretionary and discretionary standards for the City to use in evaluating how land use proposals comply with the use and development requirements of the Code. The nondiscretionary criteria provide clear and objective standards for certainty in most situations. Discretionary criteria provide flexibility by allowing more subjective standards and objectives, and allow modification of regulations in response to specific site conditions. This chapter contains the criteria for evaluation of the following land use applications:
■ Adjustments
■ Annexations
■ Comprehensive Plan and Map Amendments
■ Conditional Uses
■ Development Code Amendments
■ Nonconforming Situations
■ Site Plan Review
■ Vacations
■ Variances, Major
■ Variances, Minor
■ Zoning Map Amendments
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5720, 8/12/09; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.020 Function of Review Criteria.
(1) Review criteria describe the issues the applicant must address and that the City or affected parties may raise. A proposal that complies with all of the criteria will be approved. A proposal that can comply with the criteria with mitigation measures or limitations will be approved with conditions. A proposal that cannot comply with the criteria outright or with mitigation measures will be denied.
(2) The review criteria are derived from the Comprehensive Plan. Reviews against the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan are not required unless specifically stated. The proposal conforms to the Comprehensive Plan if it fulfills the review criteria.
(3) When review criteria require an application to meet a specific standard, such as adequate services or no negative offsite impacts, all proposed improvements and mitigation measures must be identified before the review body will make a final decision.
[Ord. 5720, 8/12/09]
2.030 Burden of Proof. The applicant must show that the review criteria are met. The burden of proof is not on the City or other parties to show that the criteria have or have not been met.
2.040 Conditions of Approval. The City may attach conditions to the approval of a land use decision in order to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable review criteria.
2.050 Relationship to Other Regulations. When a land use application is approved based on review criteria in this Code, the applicant must still comply with other applicable codes, ordinances, statutes, and regulations.
ADJUSTMENTS
2.060 Purpose. The Adjustment review allows the Director to approve modifications to the application of most design standards in Article 8 and buffering and screening standards in Article 9, as noted in those articles. The Adjustment review process provides a mechanism by which the standards in the ADC may be modified if the proposed development continues to meet the intended purpose of those regulations. Adjustment reviews provide flexibility for unusual situations. They also allow for alternative ways to meet the purposes of the Code. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.070 Procedures. Adjustment applications are processed through a Type III procedure.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-2 January 1, 2021
2.080 Review Criteria. For each standard for which an Adjustment is requested, the applicant must show that the following criteria have been met:
(1) Granting the Adjustment will equally or better meet the purpose of the regulation to be modified; and
(2) The proposal will be consistent with the desired character of the base zone; and
(3) Any negative impacts resulting from the Adjustment are mitigated to the extent practical; and
(4) The proposal will not significantly detract from the livability or appearance of the surrounding area; and
(5) If more than one Adjustment is being requested, the cumulative effect of the Adjustments results in a project which still meets criteria (1) through (4), above. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
ANNEXATIONS
2.090 Purpose. Annexation is the first step in converting land in the Albany Urban Growth Boundary to urban land. Annexation and subsequent development may provide economic and social benefits to the City of Albany through the creation of housing; business and commercial enterprise; creation of construction and permanent jobs; and expansion of the City’s tax base. When annexations are properly timed, they allow for orderly expansion of City boundaries and contribute to logical extensions of public infrastructure. An ill-conceived annexation may impose burdens on the community that could outweigh the benefits. An annexation application must meet the quasi-judicial and legislative requirements of this Code and state law.
2.095 Procedure. Annexation applications are reviewed as a Type IV procedure. An annexation shall not be effective unless it is approved by the Albany City Council at its discretion. The procedure and standards established in this chapter are required for review of proposed annexations in order to:
(1) Provide adequate public notice, information, and sufficient time for public review before annexation hearings and elections; and
(2) Maximize citizen involvement in the annexation process; and
(3) Provide information to the public concerning the physical, environmental, financial, and related social effects of annexation.
Exception. These procedures do not apply to an annexation mandated by state law, which is a Type I procedure [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.100 Voting in Island Annexations. When considering the annexation of “island” territory as authorized by ORS 222.750, the City Council shall authorize the electors within the annexation territory to vote on the question of annexation. In such event, the votes of the electors in the annexation territory shall be counted with the votes of the electors within the city. This section shall not authorize the votes of the electors within the annexation territory to be considered separately from those of the citizens within the city, except that an annexation will not be approved unless the majority of votes cast by the city electors approve the annexation.
2.105 Annexation Agreement. The annexation applicant and the City of Albany may enter into an Annexation Agreement for the purpose of addressing the annexation-related quasi-judicial or legislative concerns of the City of Albany. The agreement may contain proffers made by the applicant to address quasi-judicial or legislative criteria or concerns. The annexation agreement may provide the basis for the City Council to determine that the proposed annexation is in the public interest. The terms of the annexation agreement may help the applicant meet applicable review criteria for annexation or enhance the public benefits that will result from the annexation. The terms of an annexation agreement may include, but are not limited to, timing of the submittal of an application for zoning, dedication of land for future public facilities, construction of public improvements, waiver of compensation claims, waiver of nexus or rough proportionality objections to future exactions, or other commitments deemed valuable to the City of Albany. The annexation agreement shall be recorded as a covenant running with the land, binding on the landowner’s successors in interest.
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-3 January 1, 2021
2.110 Review Criteria. When an annexation application has been properly initiated pursuant to ORS 222.111, 222.115, 222.125, 222.170, or 222.840, the review body shall make a quasi-judicial land use decision as to whether the proposed annexation complies with all of the following criteria: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Eligibility Criteria. The City shall determine that property is eligible for annexation based on the following criteria:
(a) The property is contiguous to the existing city limits; and
(b) The property is located within the Albany Urban Growth Boundary as established by the Albany Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Infrastructure Criteria. The City shall determine that it is timely to annex property based on the following criterion:
(a) An adequate level of urban services and infrastructure is available, or will be made available in a timely manner.
(b) As used in this section:
i. “Adequate level” means conforms to adopted plans and ordinances.
ii. “Urban services” means police, fire, and other City-provided services.
iii. “Infrastructure” means sanitary sewer, water, storm drainage, and streets.
iv. “Be made available in a timely manner” means that improvements needed for an adequate level of urban services and infrastructure will be provided at the time and place needed to serve the anticipated development. Improvements may be secured by a development agreement, annexation agreement, or other funding mechanism that will place the primary economic burden on the territory proposed for annexation and not on the City of Albany generally.
(3) Planning Criteria. The City shall determine that adequate planning has occurred based on the following criterion:
Sufficient planning and engineering data have been provided, and necessary studies and reviews have been completed so that there are no significant unresolved issues regarding appropriate Comprehensive Plan and implementing ordinances. Examples of needed studies may include public infrastructure plans, buildable lands inventories, area refinement plans, or any task in an approved work program for Periodic Review.
(4) Reasonableness Criteria. The City shall determine that it is reasonable to annex the property.
2.115 Legislative Review. The City has been entrusted by the people of Albany to make decisions affecting the livability of the community. The people rely on the City to consider factors it deems appropriate in making quality of life determinations on their behalf.
The City Council may approve an annexation request if it finds that the annexation is in the best interest of the City based on the staff report, testimony, and evidence presented at the public hearing; and any other information, evidence, or analysis the City Council deems relevant to the application. However, the City is not obligated to approve the annexation in its legislative capacity even if it determines that the quasi-judicial review criteria have been met. Following the quasi-judicial land use determination, the City may decline to take legislative action, or make a legislative determination to approve or deny the proposed annexation if it deems such action to be in the public interest. The legislative decision to approve, deny, or to decline to take such action, shall be at the sole discretion of the City and shall be made by resolution. A decision to deny an annexation shall be specifically stated in the record and noted as a legislative act separate and apart from the quasi-judicial land use decision.
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-4 January 1, 2021
2.120 Proclamation of Annexation. If the annexation is approved by the City Council, the City Council by ordinance, shall set the final boundaries of the area to be annexed by a legal description of the annexation boundary and report all changes in the boundaries of the City as required by State law.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
ZONING OF ANNEXATION TERRITORY
2.125 Interim Zoning. Any area annexed to the City shall retain the zoning classification of the county until changed by the City. During the period between the proclamation of annexation and application of City zoning, the City shall enforce the current zoning regulations of the county along with any conditions, limitations or restrictions applied by the county as though they were part of the Code, except that the provisions of this Code shall supersede comparable provisions of the county zoning regulations.
2.130 Procedure. Applying initial City zoning to annexation territory is subject to the provisions of ADC 2.700 through 2.760.
2.135 Application of Initial City Zoning. The City may exercise full discretion in determining the initial City zoning of annexation territory.
(1) The City may initiate a zoning map amendment as provided by ADC 2.710 to apply the initial City zoning to the annexation territory.
(2) The City may approve the zoning requested by the applicant.
(3) The City may select a zoning district other than that requested by the applicant in order to best satisfy the criteria for a zoning map amendment set forth in ADC 2.740. In this event, the applicant may withdraw the annexation application by written notice to the City within ten (10) days of the City’s action. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.140 Concurrent Applications. The City does not have authority to zone land or to regulate development under this Code until land is annexed. However, the applicant for annexation may request zone change and development-related applications filed for concurrent review with an annexation request. As used in this section, “development-related application” includes, but is not limited to, Site Plan Review, Conditional Use, land division, or Major Variance. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) If the applicant for annexation desires concurrent, pre-annexation determinations for related land use applications, those applications shall be processed concurrently through a Type IV-Q procedure. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) In order to be eligible for filing zone change and development-related applications for concurrent review with an annexation request, the applicant shall waive the provisions of state law and this Code that require a final decision within 120 days.
(3) The determination on all land use applications filed for concurrent review with an annexation application shall not be final for the purposes of administrative or judicial review until the date that the annexation is proclaimed
(4) All land use applications filed for concurrent review shall result in a single decision for purposes of appeal, such that all applications, excluding annexation, are subject to review on appeal if any one application is challenged.
(5) If any land use decision concurrent with annexation is reversed on appeal, all concurrent applications, excluding annexation, are void.
(6) Concurrent, development-related applications, once approved, may be modified pursuant to the procedures in ADC 1.330, or the development-related application may be withdrawn and a new application submitted for review. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(7) In the event land is not developed in substantial conformance with a concurrent, development- related approval and the decision is no longer valid, the City may initiate a zone change pursuant to ADC 2.710 to revert all or a portion of the annexation territory to the previous county zoning classification. Such a reversionary stipulation may be included in the annexation agreement.
[Ord. 5636; 1/11/06]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-5 January 1, 2021
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN AMENDMENTS
2.190 Purpose. The Comprehensive Plan is the City’s official and controlling land use document, guiding public and private activities that affect Albany’s growth, development, and livability. The Plan is intended to be a flexible document, reflecting changing circumstances and community attitudes through occasional amendments. This section provides a process for amending the Comprehensive Plan without violating its integrity or frustrating its purposes. This process applies to proposed changes to the Comprehensive Plan Map designations, text and the Urban Growth Boundary.
2.200 Frequency of Plan Amendments. Applications for Comprehensive Plan amendments submitted by property owners shall be reviewed semi-annually in April and October by the Planning Commission. The City Council, Planning Commission, Landmarks Commission, or Director may also initiate Plan amendments. These initiations are made without prejudice towards the outcome.
2.210 Procedure. If the Director determines a request for a Plan amendment is legislative, the request will be reviewed through the Type IV-L legislative procedures in Section 1.260. Quasi-judicial requests are reviewed through the Type IV-Q procedures of Section 1.250. Area specific amendments, including Map amendments outside of the City limits, are processed in accordance with the City-County Urban Growth Management Agreement. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.220 Review Criteria. Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan will be approved if the Council finds that the application meets the following applicable criteria:
(1) A legislative amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, the statewide planning goals, and any relevant area plans adopted by the City Council.
(2) A legislative amendment is needed to meet changing conditions or new laws.
(3) The requested designation for a quasi-judicial map amendment meets all of the following tests:
(a) The requested designation for the site has been evaluated against relevant Comprehensive Plan policies and on balance is more supportive of the Comprehensive Plan as a whole than the old designation.
(b) The requested designation is consistent with any relevant area plans adopted by the City Council.
(c) The requested designation is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Map pattern.
(d) The requested designation is consistent with the statewide planning goals.
2.225 Corrections to the Comprehensive Plan Map. The Director may initiate a review through the Type I procedure for these types of corrections to the Comprehensive Plan Map:
(1) A map line that was intended to follow a topographical feature does not do so. Topographical features include the tops and bottoms of hillsides, the banks of water bodies, and center lines of creeks or drainage ditches;
(2) The line on the map does not match the legal description or the map shown or referenced in the ordinance that applied the designation; or
(3) There is a discrepancy between maps, and there is clear legislative intent for where the line should be.
(4) The map line is based on the location of a reference item that has since been moved. Reference items are rights-of-way, tentative rights-of-way, utility easements and similar items. Map line changes in these cases must not be more than a minor change to the map pattern and must not significantly affect abutting lots.
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-6 January 1, 2021
CONDITIONAL USES
2.230 Purpose. The City does not allow some uses outright, although they may have beneficial effects and serve important public interests. These uses are subject to the Conditional Use regulations because they may have adverse effects on the environment, overburden public services, change the desired character of an area, or create major nuisances. A review of these proposed uses is necessary due to the potential individual or cumulative impacts they may have on the surrounding area or neighborhood. The Conditional Use review process provides an opportunity to allow the use when it will have minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose conditions to address identified concerns, or to deny the use if the concerns cannot be resolved.
Uses identified as requiring Conditional Use approval may be permitted, enlarged or altered according to the provisions of this section. In addition, when a use is not authorized in any district or when it is unclear how to classify a particular use or development within the intent of this Code, the use or type of development may be established by a Conditional Use approval in accordance with this section.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.240 Procedure. A Conditional Use application is reviewed as either a Type II or a Type III procedure, according to the Schedule of Permitted Uses.
[Ord. 5446, 5/10/00, Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
2.250 Review Criteria. Requests for Conditional Use will be approved if the review body finds that the application conforms with the Albany Development Code and all of the following criteria, either outright or with conditions that bring the proposal into compliance:
[Ord. 5886, 1/6/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) The proposed use is consistent with the intended character of the base zone and the operating characteristics of the neighborhood.
(2) The proposed use will be compatible with existing or anticipated uses in terms of size, building scale and style, intensity, setbacks, and landscaping or the proposal mitigates difference in appearance or scale through such means as setbacks, screening, landscaping or other design features.
(3) The transportation system can support the proposed use in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include street capacity and level of service, on-street parking impacts, access requirements, neighborhood impacts and pedestrian safety.
[Ord. 5720, 08/12/09]
(4) Public services for water, sanitary and storm sewer, water management, and for fire and police protection, can serve the proposed use. [Ord. 5720, 08/12/09]
(5) The proposal will not have significant adverse impacts on the livability of nearby residentially zoned lands due to:
(a) Noise, glare, odor, litter, or hours of operation.
(b) Privacy and safety issues.
(6) Activities and developments within special purpose districts must comply with the regulations described in Articles 4 (Airport Approach), 6 (Natural Resources), and 7 (Historic), as applicable.
[Ord. 5265, 12/18/96; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
2.260 Conditions of Approval. The review body may attach conditions of approval to ensure that the proposal will conform to the applicable review criteria.
Some of the most frequently imposed conditions relate to the following: uses, special yards, and spaces; fences and walls; street dedications and improvement petitions (or bonds); site entry and exit; signs; building textures, colors, architectural features and height; landscaping, screening and buffering; noise, vibration, odors or other similar nuisances; hours for certain activities; time period within which the proposed use shall be developed; duration of use; and preservation of natural vegetation and open space.
2.265 Application Contents. As applicable, application contents shall be the same as those required for Site Plan Review in Section 2.490. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-7 January 1, 2021
DEVELOPMENT CODE AMENDMENTS
2.270 Purpose. The Development Code implements the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, which reflects community values and needs. Because these values may change with time and because new techniques for implementing the Plan may become more appropriate, the Code must have some mechanism for response to those changes. Amendments to the Code should occur as needed to maintain a close relationship between it and the Comprehensive Plan.
2.280 Procedures. Code amendments shall be processed as a Type IV-L procedure in accordance with the legislative procedures of Section 1.260. Exception: The Director may initiate and approve amendments for the following types of corrections through a Type I procedure: typographical, grammatical, and cross-referencing errors. [Ord. 5635, 1/11/06; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.290 Review Criteria. The request may be approved if the Council finds that the application meets the following criteria:
(1) The proposed amendments better achieve the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan than the existing language.
(2) The proposed amendments are consistent with Development Code policies on purpose and with the purpose statement for the base zone, special purpose district, or development regulation where the amendment is proposed.
NONCONFORMING SITUATIONS
2.300 Purpose. Some lots, developments, and uses in the City of Albany were lawful before this Code was adopted or amended, but would no longer be allowed under the current terms of this Code. These provisions are intended to permit such nonconforming situations to continue, but not to encourage their perpetuation.
2.310 Status and Documentation of a Nonconforming Situation. Nonconforming situation regulations apply only to situations that were legally established. Nonconforming uses that were not allowed when established have no grandfather rights and must be removed. The property owner or applicant must document that a nonconforming situation was legally established and was maintained over time. Evidence that it was maintained over time might consist of building permits, utility hookups, tax records, business licenses, lease agreements, business receipts, or telephone directory listings.
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
2.320 Types of Nonconforming Situations. A lot of record may be nonconforming because it does not meet the dimensional or area standards currently required in a particular zoning district. A specific site may be nonconforming because it contains either a nonconforming use, an allowed residential use that exceeds the allowed density, a nonconforming development, or a combination of these.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/98]
2.325 Nonconforming Lots of Record. Legally established lots of record that do not meet the dimensional or area requirements of the zoning district in which they are located may be developed. Any new structure built on the lot must conform to the development standards (such as setbacks, lot coverage, etc.) for that zoning district. [Ord. 5338, 1/28/98; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
2.330 Certain Residential Uses Granted Special Status. Special status has been granted to single-family dwellings built before January 1, 2002, in commercial, office, mixed use, and industrial zones. Special status has also been granted for certain properties with two or more units in the Hackleman-Monteith and RS-5 Residential Single-Family zoning districts. Notwithstanding the restrictions or terms of any other section of this Code, these properties shall be deemed to be conforming to the base zoning district. See Sections 3.085, 4.075, and 5.080.
[Ord. 5555, 2/7/03; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-8 January 1, 2021
2.333 Compliance with Former Regulations. Every nonconforming use, structure, development site or situation shall maintain compliance with all applicable regulations, including conditions of approval on land use actions by which it was governed at the time it became nonconforming.
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
2.335 Loss of Nonconforming Status.
(1) The nonconforming status of a building, structure, or land shall be deemed to have terminated excluding building height, setbacks or lot coverage, if the building, structure, or land is not occupied by a permitted or legally nonconforming use for one continuous year. The “vacancy clock” stops when a land use application on the property is deemed complete. A request may be submitted to the Community Development Department for reinstatement of nonconforming status within one year from April 9, 2014, or for an extension of up to two additional years prior to the site being vacant for one year. The extension or reinstatement may be granted under the Type II procedure only if the Director finds that:
(a) Converting to a conforming use will result in a substantial economic loss; AND
(b) The proposed use will result in greater or equal conformance with the development standards of the zone than the previous use; OR
(c) Immediately surrounding properties are similarly nonconforming, and the proposed use will be compatible with both the nonconforming and conforming uses in the review area.
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(2) Any nonconforming use or development dependent upon a building or structure that has been declared a “dangerous building” and ordered demolished pursuant to the Albany Dangerous Building Code (AMC Title 18) will be considered terminated upon that declaration and order.
(3) Any nonconforming use or development dependent upon a building or structure that has been substantially damaged to the extent that repair or restoration of the building or structure would cost more than 70 percent of its fair market value will be considered terminated.
(a) Cost of repair or restoration shall be determined by the Building Official. Fair market value shall be determined by an independent appraisal acceptable to the City. The owner or applicant may appeal these determinations of value and cost to the Building Board of Appeals, or may apply for an exception under the Type II procedure.
(b) The Director may allow additional reconstruction upon finding that:
i. Conversion to a conforming use will result in substantial economic loss, and
ii. The proposed use will result in greater conformance with the development standards, or
iii. Immediately surrounding land uses are similarly nonconforming and the reconstructed use will be compatible with both the nonconforming and conforming uses in the review area.
(4) Rebuilding structures that contained nonconforming uses and which have been intentionally destroyed is prohibited.
2.340 Allowances That Apply to All Nonconforming Situations. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(1) Their status is not affected by changes in ownership.
(2) They may be changed to conforming situations by right or with an applicable land use approval. Once a conforming situation occupies a site, the nonconforming rights are lost and a nonconforming situation may not be re-established. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(3) Normal maintenance and repair is allowed.
(4) Changes that conform to the base zone development standards of the site may be made.
(5) Legal nonconforming uses may continue to operate.
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-9 January 1, 2021
(6) A change from a legal nonconforming use to a use in the same use category or to a use not otherwise permitted in the zone may be considered through a Nonconforming Use Review in accordance with Section 2.350. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
2.350 Nonconforming Use Review Procedure. A nonconforming use is reviewed through either a Type I or Type II procedure as described below.
(1) Type I Procedure. The following situations will be processed through a Type I procedure, as established in Section 1.210. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(a) Changes of use within the same use category. A change of use within the same land use category if the nonconforming use was not created unlawfully, and the new use requires no more than two new parking spaces. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(b) Nonconforming Residential Densities. Existing dwelling units may continue, may be removed or enlarged, and amenities may be added to the site. There may not be a net increase in the number of dwelling units and the building may not move further out of compliance with the base zone development standards.
(2) Type II Land Use Review. The following nonconforming situations will be processed through a Type II procedure as established in Section 1.230. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(a) Extension or reinstatement of nonconforming status per Section 2.340.
(b) A change to another use in the same use category that requires three or more new parking spaces or has increased hours, staffing, traffic, outside storage areas, or off-site impacts.
(c) A change from a legal nonconforming use to a use in a category not otherwise permitted in the base zone may be permitted if it meets the applicable review criteria in Section 2.360.
(d) Changes in operational characteristics such as increased hours, staffing, or expansions to outside storage areas.
(e) New construction or structural expansions of nonconforming uses.
2.360 Nonconforming Use Review Criteria for Type II Decisions. A request will be approved for nonconforming uses if the review body finds that the application meets all of the following criteria:
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(1) The nonconforming use was not created unlawfully. See Section 2.310.
(2) With mitigation measures, there will not be a net increase in overall adverse impacts (over the impacts of the previous use or development) on the surrounding area taking into account factors such as:
(a) Noise, vibration, dust, odor, fumes, glare, and smoke;
(b) Potential for increased litter;
(c) The amount, location, and nature of any outside displays, storage, or activities;
(d) The appearance of the new use or development will not detract from the desired function and character of the zone.
(e) The operating characteristics of the proposed use are compatible with the existing and anticipated uses. The hours of operation in residential zones cannot be extended into the period of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.;
(f) The street system has adequate capacity to accommodate the use through the horizon year of the current TSP;
(g) The site has adequate on-site parking to accommodate the development or adequate parking will be provided in accordance with Article 9;
(h) Parking areas and entrance-exit points are designed to facilitate traffic and pedestrian safety and avoid congestion;
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-10 January 1, 2021
(i) Public services for water, sanitary sewer, stormwater, water management, and for fire and police protection, can serve the proposed use;
(j) Activities and developments within overlay districts must comply with the regulations described in Article 4 (Airport Approach), 6 (Natural Resources), and 7 (Historic), as applicable;
(k) If a commercial use is proposed in an existing building in an industrial zone, the development shall not alter the existing building or site in a way that would discourage or preclude its later conversion back to an industrial use; and
(l) Any applicable criteria in (3) and (4) below. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(3)
Structural Expansions shall be limited to the following:
Existing Gross Floor Area
% of Expansion Allowed
Buildings under 4,000 sq. ft.
25%
Buildings between 4,000 and 10,000 sq. ft.
20%
Buildings larger than 10,000 sq. ft.
15%
(a) Nonconforming uses and buildings may expand one time only and must comply with current development standards.
(b) Expansion of a nonconforming use onto another site is prohibited, except when:
i. The expansion site abuts the site of the nonconforming use; and
ii. The expansion site was in the same ownership as the nonconforming site when it became nonconforming; and
iii. Prior zoning regulations on the expansion site would have allowed the use; and
iv. The expansion is approved through a nonconforming use review.
(c) Addition of new residential units to a nonconforming residential use is prohibited.
(4) Nonconforming Uses or Expansions in Residential Areas. If the nonconforming use is in a residential zone or in a mixed-use zone with residential uses adjacent to the site, the appearance of the new use or development will not lessen the residential character of the area. This is based on taking into account factors such as: [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(a) Building scale, placement, and facade;
(b) Parking area placement;
(c) Buffering and the potential loss of privacy to abutting residential uses; and
(d) Lighting and signs.
2.370 Nonconforming Site Review Criteria. Sites that are nonconforming with the current development standards and that have lost their nonconforming status are required to bring the site into compliance with current Code standards. Incremental improvements are allowed in accordance with Subsection (1).
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(1) Incremental Improvements to Nonconforming Sites. Once the cumulative value of one or more building improvements, expansions or site modifications exceeds $25,000, excluding the costs associated with voluntarily bringing the site into compliance with applicable development standards, 10% of the cost of all improvements proposed thereafter must be allocated toward improvements that bring the site into compliance with standards in this Code unless all of the standards listed below can be met at lesser cost. The value of a proposed building or site investment will be the value stated on the application for building permits or calculated by the Building Official, whichever is higher. Improvements that bring the site into compliance with the standards of this Code shall be implemented in the following order of priority, unless a greater benefit is achieved by implementing a lower order of priority item first: [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-11 January 1, 2021

official City Zoning Map is not clear as to the zoning of vacated right-of-way, the zoning of the vacated territory shall be the same as the adjoining property to which the ownership of the parcel automatically reverts.
2.650 Conditions of Approval. The City may attach conditions to the approval of a vacation request to ensure that the proposal will conform to the review criteria.
MAJOR VARIANCES
2.660 Purpose. When a practical difficulty, unusual hardship, or the literal interpretation of a provision of this Code results in rendering a property incapable of reasonable economic use or causes specific hardships unintended by the Comprehensive Plan or this Code, a Major Variance may be granted as provided in this article. [Ord. 5720, 08/12/09; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.670 Procedure. A Major Variance request shall be reviewed as a Type II procedure.
[Ord. 5720, 8/12/09; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
2.680 Regulations That May and May Not Be Varied.
(1) Unless listed in Subsection (2) below, all regulations in this Code may be modified using the Major Variance process. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Major Variances are prohibited for the following items: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(a) To allow a primary or accessory use that is not allowed by the regulations.
(b) As an exception to any restrictions on uses or development that contain the word “prohibited.”
(c) As an exception to going through a review process or meeting standards required by a review process in this Code, such as minimum lot size. [Ord. 5720, 08/12/09; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(d) As an exception to a definition or classification.
(e) As an exception to the steps of a procedure or to change assigned procedures.

The review criteria for variances from floodplain management regulations are stated in Section 6.092. All other Major Variance requests will be approved if the review body finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following criteria have been met:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) The property has unique or peculiar physical circumstances or conditions such as, irregular shape, width or depth; or exceptional natural or physical conditions such as topography, trees, native vegetation, wetlands, riparian areas, wildlife habitat, or drainage ways.
[Ord. 5720, 08/12/09; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-16 January 1, 2021
(2) The proposal will be consistent with the purpose, overview, and description for the zone in which the property is located, and with the purpose of the Significant Natural Resource Districts, if applicable; and [Ord. 5720, 08/12/09; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
(3) If more than one Major Variance is requested, the cumulative effect of the variances results in a project that is still consistent with the purpose, overview and description of the zone; and
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) The requested Major Variance is the minimum necessary to address the peculiar or unusual conditions of the site; and [Ord. 5720, 08/12/09; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(5) Any impacts resulting from the Major Variance are mitigated to the extent practical; or
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(6) Application of the regulation in question would preclude all reasonable economic use of the site.
MINOR VARIANCES
2.692 Purpose. The Minor Variance review allows the Director to approve limited modifications to the application of numeric standards for unusual situations specific to the site. Minor Variances will not be considered to avoid a review process or standard in this Code. Minor Variances are typically for requests that are 10 percent or less of a numeric standard.
Alternative setbacks in developed areas are addressed in Sections 3.240, 4.130, and 5.130 and may not require a Minor Variance.
2.694 Procedures. Minor Variance applications are processed through a Type I-L procedure. Requests not meeting the purpose of Minor Variances may be processed as Major Variances. The Director will determine whether an application is processed as a Minor Variance or a Major Variance.
2.696 Review Criteria. The applicant must show that the following criteria have been met:
(1) The Minor Variance is not requested to avoid a land use review process or increase density; AND
(2) The need for the Minor Variance is created by the unusual configuration of the property, to protect natural features, due to the location of an existing structure on the site, or the site is an infill or redevelopment site less than one acre with development on both sides; AND
(3) The Minor Variance is the minimum necessary to address the unusual circumstance, generally no more than 10 percent from a numeric standard, and the request is still consistent with the purpose of the zoning district and any applicable overlay districts. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS
2.700 Purpose. This section states the procedures and review criteria necessary to process an amendment to the base zones, special purpose districts, and other map symbols of the Zoning Map. The section differentiates between amendments that are processed in a quasi-judicial manner and those processed in a legislative manner.
2.710 Initiation.
(1) Quasi-judicial zoning map amendments may be initiated by a property owner, a representative of the owner, the Director, the Planning Commission, or the City Council.
(2) Legislative zoning map amendments may be initiated by the Director, Planning Commission or City Council. Citizens may request that the Planning Commission initiate a legislative amendment. This type of initiation is addressed in Section 1.260. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Initiations by a review body are made without prejudice towards the outcome.
2.720 Procedure. Zoning Map amendments will be reviewed through the Type IV-Q procedures as outlined in Section 1.250 or by legislative action as provided for in Section 1.260. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 2 2-17 January 1, 2021
2.730 Special Notice Requirements. If a zone change request would change the zone of property that includes all or part of a manufactured home park, the City shall give written notice by first class mail to each existing mailing address for tenants of the manufactured home park at least 20 days but not more than 40 days before the date of the first hearing on the application. The failure of a tenant to receive a notice that was mailed shall not invalidate any zone change.
2.740 Review Criteria. Zoning Map amendments will be approved if the Council finds that the applicant has shown that all of the following criteria are met:
(1) The proposed base zone is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan map designation for the entire subject area unless a Plan map amendment has also been applied for.
(2) Existing or anticipated transportation facilities are adequate for uses permitted under the proposed zone designation.
(3) Existing or anticipated services (water, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, schools, police and fire protection) can accommodate potential development in the subject area without adverse impact on the affected service area.
(4) The intent and purpose of the proposed zoning district best satisfies the goals and policies of the Comprehensive Plan.
(5) The land use and transportation pattern recommended in any applicable City-contracted or funded land use or transportation plan or study has been followed, unless the applicant demonstrates good cause for the departure from the plan or study. [Ord. 5635, 1/11/06, Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
2.750 Corrections to the Zoning Map. The Director may initiate and approve a review following the Type I procedure for the types of corrections to the Zoning Map listed below:
(1) A map line that was intended to follow a topographical feature does not do so. Topographical features include the tops and bottoms of hillsides, the banks of water bodies, and center lines of creeks or drainage ditches.
(2) The line on the map does not match the legal description or the map shown or referenced in the ordinance that applied the designation.
(3) There is a discrepancy between maps and there is clear legislative intent for where the line should be.
(4) It can be clearly shown that a map line is based on the location of a reference item that has since been moved. Reference items are rights-of-way, tentative rights-of-way, utility easements and
similar items. Map line changes in these cases must not be more than a trivial change to the map pattern and must not result in any significant impacts to abutting lots.
2.760 Zoning. For rezoning and annexation zoning requests, the zoning of the property shall be compatible with the Comprehensive Plan designation as provided in the Table 2.760-1, Plan Designation Zoning Matrix. Zoning other than that shown in the matrix requires approval of a Comprehensive Plan Map and/or Zoning Map amendment. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 1 January 1, 2021
ARTICLE 3
RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
3.010 Overview. The residential zones are intended to preserve land for housing. This Code preserves the character of neighborhoods by providing seven zones with different density standards. The site development standards allow for flexibility of development while maintaining compatibility within the City's various neighborhoods. These regulations provide certainty to property owners, developers and neighbors by stating the allowed uses and development standards for the base zones. Sites within overlay districts are also subject to the regulations in Articles 6 and 7. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
The list below is a summary of the topics covered in this article.
■ Zoning Districts
■ Schedule of Permitted Use
■ Development Standards
ZONING DISTRICTS
3.020 Establishment of Residential Zoning Districts. In order to regulate and segregate the uses of lands and buildings and to regulate the density of development, the following residential zoning districts are established:
(1) RR—RESIDENTIAL RESERVE DISTRICT. The RR District is intended to recognize areas which, because of topography, level of services, or other natural or development factors are best served by a large lot designation. This district may be applied on an interim basis until urban services become available. The minimum lot size is five acres.
(2) RS-10—RESIDENTIAL SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT. The RS-10 District is intended primarily for a lower density single-family residential environment. The average minimum lot size is 10,000 square feet.
(3) RS-6.5—RESIDENTIAL SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT. The RS-6.5 District is intended primarily for low-density urban single-family residential development. The average minimum lot size is 6,500 square feet.
(4) RS-5—RESIDENTIAL SINGLE-FAMILY DISTRICT. The RS-5 District is intended primarily for low- to moderate-density single-family development. The average minimum detached single-family lot size is 5,000 square feet. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
(5) RM—RESIDENTIAL MEDIUM DENSITY DISTRICT. The RM District is primarily intended for medium-density residential urban development. New RM districts should be located on a collector or arterial street or in Village Centers. Development may not exceed 25 units per gross acre. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
(6) RMA—RESIDENTIAL MEDIUM DENSITY ATTACHED DISTRICT. The RMA District is intended primarily for medium- to high-density urban residential development. All units, whether single- or multiple-family, shall be attached. New RMA districts should be located on a collector or arterial street or in Village Centers. Development may not exceed 35 units per gross acre.
[Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
(7) HM—HACKLEMAN-MONTEITH DISTRICT. The HM district is intended primarily to preserve the existing single-family residential character of the Hackleman and Monteith National Register Historic Districts. Conversion of single-family residential structures to other uses, including multi-family residential, is not allowed.
[Ord. 5555, 2/7/03; Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 2 January 1, 2021
3.030 Establishment of Special Purpose Districts. Special purpose districts are overlay districts that may be combined with a major zoning district. The regulations of a special purpose district are supplementary to the regulations of the underlying major zoning district. The regulations of a special purpose district and the major zoning district shall all apply to any site that has both designations. Where the regulations and permitted uses of a major zoning district conflict with those of a special purpose district, the more restrictive standards shall apply. The special purpose districts and the additional regulations that apply in such districts are summarized below:
Special Purpose District Applicable Articles
Airport Approach Article 4
Floodplain Article 6
Hillside Development Article 6
Significant Wetlands Article 6
Riparian Corridors Article 6
Wildlife Habitat Article 6
Willamette Greenway Article 6
Historic Overlay Article 7
[Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
SCHEDULE OF PERMITTED USES
3.040 Interpretation. The following provisions are used to interpret the schedule of permitted uses found in this Article:
(1) The schedule of permitted uses cannot anticipate all uses that may be located within the City. There are also situations where proposed uses may relate to more than one type of use. In both instances, the Director will determine the appropriate use category based on operating characteristics and land use impacts. Where ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use, the use may be reviewed as a Conditional Use where the Director determines that the proposed use is consistent with other uses allowable within the subject district due to similar characteristics. Use categories not listed in the schedule of permitted uses are not permitted in the residential zoning districts.
[Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Where a development proposal involves a combination of uses other than accessory uses, the more restrictive provisions of this Code shall apply. For example, if a portion of a development is subject to Conditional Use approval and the balance is subject only to Site Plan Review, the entire development shall be reviewed using the Conditional Use criteria if concurrent approval of all uses is requested. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) A change in the use of a property is subject to review as specified by the schedule of permitted uses:
(a) When the change involves a change from one use category to another in the schedule of permitted uses and the Director has not waived review under the provisions of Section 1.105, or
(b) When a property that has been unoccupied for more than one year.
[Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
3.050 Schedule of Permitted Uses. The specific uses listed in the following schedule are permitted in the zones as indicated, subject to the general provisions, special conditions, additional restrictions, and exceptions set forth in this Code. A description of each use category is in Article 22, Use Categories and Definitions.
A number appearing opposite a use in the “special conditions” column indicates that special provisions apply to the use in all zones. A number in a cell particular to a use and zone(s) indicates that special provisions apply to the use category for that zone(s). The conditions follow the schedule of uses, in Section 3.060.
Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 3 January 1, 2021
The abbreviations used in the schedule have the following meanings:
Y Yes; use allowed without land use review procedures but must meet development standards in this article and may be subject to special conditions.
S Use permitted that requires a site plan approval prior to the development or occupancy of the site or building.
CU Use permitted conditionally under the provisions of Sections 2.230-2.265 through a Type III procedure.
CUII Uses permitted conditionally through the Type II procedure.
PD Use permitted only through planned development approval.
CD Use permitted only through cluster development approval.
N No; use not permitted in the zoning district indicated.
Some zones have two abbreviations for a use category (ex. Y/CU). Refer to the special condition number to determine what review process is required based on the details of the use.

The total land area provided for the development as a whole must conform with the requirements of Article 3, Table 3.190-1, however, the amount of land on which each unit is located does not need to be split equally between the individual units - one may be larger and one smaller. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) Where detached single-family residences are permitted outright, one accessory dwelling unit (ADU) may be allowed per legally established detached single-family residence, called the “primary residence”. The ADU shall comply with the following standards:

Notwithstanding the restrictions or terms of any other section of the Albany Development Code (ADC), properties on the Special Status List shall be deemed to be conforming to the Hackleman Monteith (HM) and RS-5 Residential Single-Family (RS-5) zoning districts, as applicable. If any building on these properties is substantially destroyed, as defined in ADC Section2.335(3), it can be rebuilt to the same size (square feet) and density as existed on the property at the time the HM or RS-5 zoning was first applied, but will be subject to the regulations of any applicable overlay zone.
[Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
The Special Status List is maintained by the Community Development Department Director.
[Ord. 5789, 10/10/12]
If any of the listed buildings are converted to single-family use, the special status granted here is rescinded, and the use of the property must thereafter conform to the requirements of this article. The special status granted here will be lost if it is determined that the use that existed at the time the zone was created was not then lawfully in existence. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 10 January 1, 2021
The intent is that each and every legally established duplex and multi-family development that existed at the time the HM zone was applied or properties that were zoned RS-5 or HM from RM-3 or TM-5 by Ordinance 5673 on June 27, 2007 be put on the Special Status List. Should an existing use not be on the list, the property owner may request that the property and use be listed upon showing that the use was legally established prior to being rezoned HM or RS-5.
The property will be added to the list administratively if the owner or the City provide documents that clearly and objectively establish that the use existed prior to adoption of City zoning in 1946; or if the City can clearly and objectively verify the use was allowed in the zoning district at the time it was established and met the minimum lot size, maximum lot coverage and parking standards, as applicable. All other requests will be reviewed through the Type I-L land use process and notice will be given to property owners within 100 feet. In order to approve the request, the applicant must document when the use was established and whether the use received the relevant approvals at that time. Satisfactory evidence must be provided by the property owner or applicant to document that the use was legally established. Such evidence may consist of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, land use approvals or letters, building permits, utility hookups, tax records, or telephone directory listings, for example. When a request is approved, the property will be added to the list. [Ord. 5789, 10/10/12]
The Special Status list moved out of the Albany Development Code per Ord. 5789, 10/10/12.
HOME BUSINESSES
3.090 Purpose. The home business provisions recognize the needs of many persons who are engaged in small-scale business ventures which could not be sustained if it were necessary to lease commercial quarters, or which because of the nature of the activity would make it impractical to expand to a full-scale enterprise and that the business is incidental to the residential use. The purpose of these standards is to allow home businesses that can be compatible in scale and operating characteristics within a residential neighborhood without infringing on the right of neighboring residents to enjoy the peaceful occupancy of their homes. Home businesses do not include hobbies as defined in this Code.

(3) Hobbies.
(4) Registered or certified family child care homes per ORS 657A.440. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
3.190 Purpose. Development standards are intended to promote site planning and design that consider the natural environment, site intensity, building mass, and open space. The standards also promote energy conservation, needed privacy, safe and efficient parking areas for new development, and improve the general living environment and economic life of a development. Table 3.190-1, on the following page, summarizes the basic development standards. It should be used in conjunction with the sections immediately succeeding the table, which address special circumstances and exceptions. See Article 8 for design standards for single-family and multiple-family developments.

Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 14 January 1, 2021
3.200 Lot Size Variation Within a Land Division. Up to 50 percent of the total number of detached single-family lots in a land division may have lot sizes up to 30 percent smaller than the standard permitted in any zone provided that the average lot size for lots in the development is at least the standard required in the zone after accounting for all density bonuses. No reduction in the minimum lot size is permitted for lots created for attached housing units. In such cases, the recorded plat shall indicate that the larger lots may not be further divided or deed restrictions shall be established indicating the same.
[Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
3.210 Lot Size Variation Within Planned and Condominium Developments. In the RS-6.5, RS-5, RM, RMA, and OP districts; lot area, lot coverage, and setback requirements may be reduced for individual lot or building sites created by a filed and recorded subdivision or condominiums developed in accordance with the Oregon Revised Statutes; provided the difference in square footage between the standard lot area established in this Article and the square footage of lots created is secured for common use in open space by covenants or associations to be in effect for at least 20 years. [Note: Cluster developments see Section 11.400.] [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
3.220 Bonus Provisions for Reduction in Standard Lot Size Requirements. The following standards may be applied to development sites resulting in allowed reductions in the average minimum lot size and area per unit requirements as indicated. In no instance shall the combined total of all bonus provisions applied to a development result in an overall reduction of more than 30 percent in the standard site size or lot area per unit requirements, or result in a density that exceeds the allowed density in the zone by more than 20 percent. Some bonuses are available for lot design only, with additional bonuses available due to building design or construction. [Ord. 5338, 1/28/98; Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
Relationship to Transportation.
(1) A 10 percent reduction in the average minimum lot size required in a zoning district is allowed for proposed lots that meet the following qualifications:
(a) At least 50 percent of the lot area is located within 200 feet of a designated collector or arterial street; and
(b) The lot will not have direct access to an arterial.
For example, if the average minimum lot size for the zone is 10,000 square feet, the average lot size may be 9,000 square feet for those properties within 200 feet of the collector or arterial. The remaining lots in the development must average 10,000 square feet. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
(2) For multi-family developments, condominiums, and townhouses; when any portion of a building is located within 200 feet of a designated arterial, the area per unit requirements in those buildings can be reduced by 10 percent. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
Significant Natural Resource Overlays. A transfer of development density from undeveloped buildable land within the Significant Natural Resource Overlay Districts to other property within the development proposal site under the same ownership is allowed if it meets the following standards:
(3) Development Density to Transfer from Overlay Districts. The land area from which density can be transferred excludes developed and unbuildable areas, such as water bodies, areas below ordinary high water mark, floodways, the unbuildable portions of lands within the Significant Natural Resource Overlay Districts, and easements.
• Residential Zoning – The applicant may choose to transfer up to 50 percent of the development density if the above standard is met. For example, if the base zoning would have allowed 8 single-family units (net), 4 units can be transferred; if it would have allowed 20 multi-family units (net), 10 units can be transferred.
• Open Space Zoning – If the lot was legally created prior to July 1, 1991, and the area is of sufficient size and dimension to comply with the development standards for a single-family home, one single-family unit can be transferred. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 3 3 - 15 January 1, 2021
(4) Development Density in Receiving Area. Up to a maximum 20 percent reduction in average minimum lot size, or lot area per unit requirements, is allowed in order to accommodate the density transfer. [Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
Energy Conservation.
(5) Solar Access Protection. If buildings are sited (either by site design or defining buildable areas) and covenants or other mechanisms are established that protect solar access of south building walls from shading by structures and vegetation, a density bonus of up to 10 percent may be allowed. Table 3.220-1 indicates the amount of bonus that shall be given, based on the percentage of lots or multiple-family units that are protected. For subdivisions, to receive a bonus, a covenant or other mechanism shall be established that provides and protects solar access for the southerly building area of protected lots from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on December 21. For multiple unit developments to receive a bonus, protected units shall receive this same solar access protection for south facing walls, and the south facing glass of those units shall total at least 7 percent of the conditioned area. (South facing is defined as being within 25 degrees of true south.)

Moderate-Cost and Affordable Housing
(6) Provision of Moderate-Cost and Affordable Housing. For the provision of housing that is affordable to low- and moderate-income households earning 120 percent of less of the area median income (AMI), a density bonus through lot size reductions is permitted as provided in Table 3.220-2.
(a) For the purpose of this section, “AMI” means the area median income for the county in which the project is located.
(b) “Affordable” means that the sales price or rental amount is within the means of a household that may occupy moderate- and low-income housing. In the case of dwelling units for sale, affordable means housing in which the mortgage, amortization, taxes, insurance, and condominium or association fees, if any, constitute no more than 30 percent of such gross annual household income for a household of the size that are most likely to or intended to occupy the unit in question. In the case of dwelling units for rent, affordable means housing for which the rent and utilities constitute no more than 30 percent of such gross annual household income for a household of the size that are most likely to or intended to occupy the unit in question. Projects must include contractual obligations for continued availability to low- and moderate-income persons for a period of at least 30 years.

ARTICLE 4
COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
4.010 Overview. The zones created in this article are intended to provide land for commercial, office and industrial uses. The differences among the zones, in the permitted uses and development standards, reflect the existing and potential intensities of commercial and industrial development. The site development standards allow for flexibility of development while minimizing impacts on surrounding uses. The regulations in this article promote uses and development that will enhance the economic viability of specific commercial and industrial areas and the city as a whole. Development may also be subject to the provisions in Article 8, Design Standards, Article 9, On-Site Development and Environmental Standards, and Article 12, Public Improvements. Sites within overlay districts are also subject to the provisions in Article 6, Special Purpose Districts, and Article 7, Historic Overlay Districts. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
The following list is a summary of the topics covered in this article:
■ Zoning Districts
■ Schedule of Permitted Uses
■ Development Standards
■ Airport Approach Overlay District
ZONING DISTRICTS
4.020 Establishment of Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts. In order to regulate and segregate the uses of lands and buildings and to regulate the density of development, the following commercial and industrial zoning districts are created:
(1) OP – OFFICE PROFESSIONAL DISTRICT. The OP district is intended to provide a vertical or horizontal mix of professional offices, personal services, live-work, residential and limited related commercial uses in close proximity to residential and commercial districts. The limited uses allowed in this district are selected for their compatibility with residential uses and the desired character of the neighborhood. OP is typically appropriate along arterial or collector streets as a transitional or buffer zone between residential and more intense commercial or industrial districts.
(2) NC – NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. The NC district is intended primarily for small areas of retail establishments serving nearby residents’ frequent needs in convenient locations. The NC District is typically appropriate for small clusters or service centers located at intersections within residential neighborhoods. Businesses should fit into the residential pattern of development and not create land use, architectural or traffic conflicts. Generally, uses located within NC Districts should have as their primary market area the population within a one-half mile radius.
(3) CC – COMMUNITY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. The CC district recognizes the diversity of small to medium-scale businesses, services and sites mostly located on arterial streets and highways. Design guidelines, building location and front-yard landscaping will provide a coordinated and enhanced community image along these major transportation corridors as they develop or redevelop. Sound and visual buffers should be used to mitigate impacts on nearby residential areas.
(4) RC – REGIONAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. The RC district is intended primarily for developments that serve the wider Albany region. RC allows a wide range of retail sales and service uses, and is typically appropriate for developments that require large sites near Interstate 5. Design guidelines, building location and front-yard landscaping will provide an enhanced community image along major transportation corridors. These uses often have significant impacts on the transportation system. Sound and visual buffers may be required to protect nearby residential areas. RC districts may not be appropriate in all locations.
Albany Development Code, Article 4 4 - 2 January 1, 2021
(5) TD – TRANSIT DISTRICT. The TD district is intended primarily for regional transit facilities and related uses. This district is suitable as a major office employment center because of easy access to mass transit. Mixed-use development including a multi-modal transportation facility, a park-and-ride facility, and office space should be developed within this district.
(6) IP – INDUSTRIAL PARK DISTRICT. The IP district is intended primarily for light manufacturing, high-tech, research and development, institutions and offices in a quality environment. Uses are characterized by attractive building architecture and landscaped yards and streetscapes, and the absence of objectionable external effects. The district is designed for industrial and business parks containing offices together with clean, non-polluting industries. IP is located along or near highly visible corridors to provide a positive image and a transition to residential or natural areas from heavier industrial uses.
(7) LI – LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT. The LI district is intended primarily for a wide range of manufacturing, warehousing, processing, assembling, wholesaling, specialty contractors and related establishments. Uses will have limited impacts on surrounding properties. This district is particularly suited to areas having good access to highways and perhaps to rail. LI may serve as a buffer around the HI district and may be compatible with nearby residential zones or uses.
(8) HI – HEAVY INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT. The HI district is intended primarily for industrial uses and support activities that are potentially incompatible with most other uses and which are characterized by large amounts of traffic, extensive shipping of goods, outside storage or stockpiling of raw materials, by-products, or finished goods, and a controlled but higher level of noise and/or pollution. This district is located away from residential areas and has easy access to highways and perhaps to rail. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
4.030 Special Purpose Districts. Special purpose districts are overlay districts that may be combined with a major zoning district. The regulations of a special purpose district are supplementary to the regulations of the underlying major zoning district. The regulations of a special purpose district and the major zoning district shall both apply to any site that has both designations. Where the regulations and permitted uses of a major zoning district conflict with those of a special purpose district, the more restrictive standards shall apply. The special purpose districts and the additional regulations that apply in such districts are summarized below:
Special Purpose District Applicable Articles
Floodplain Article 6
Wetlands Article 6
Willamette Greenway Article 6
Airport Approach Article 6
Hillside Development Article 6
Historic Overlay Article 7
[Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
4.035 Relationship to State, Federal and Other Local Regulations. In addition to the regulations of this Code, each use, activity, or operation in the City of Albany must comply with applicable state and federal standards. Other local regulations include those in Article 6, Special Purpose Districts, and those of the Building Division and Fire Department. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
SCHEDULE OF PERMITTED USES
4.040 Interpretation. Each use category in the schedule of permitted uses is described in Article 22, Use Categories and Definitions. Article 22 classifies land uses and activities into categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods and services are sold or delivered, and certain site factors. In addition to the clarification in Article 22, the following provisions shall be used to interpret the schedule of permitted uses found in this Article: [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
Albany Development Code, Article 4 4 - 3 January 1, 2021
(1) The schedule of permitted uses cannot anticipate all uses that may be located within the city. There are also situations where proposed uses may relate to more than one type of use. In both instances, the Director will determine the appropriate use category based on operating characteristics and land use impacts. Where ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use, the use may be reviewed as a Conditional Use where the Director determines that the proposed use is consistent with other uses allowable within the subject district due to similar characteristics.
(2) Where a development proposal involves a combination of uses other than accessory uses, the more restrictive provisions of this Code shall apply. For example, if a portion of a development is subject to Conditional Use approval and the balance is subject only to Site Plan review, the entire development shall be reviewed utilizing the Conditional Use criteria if concurrent approval of all uses is sought.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) A change in the use of a property is subject to review as specified by the schedules of permitted uses:
(a) When the change involves a change from one use category to another in the schedule of permitted uses and the Director has not waived review under the provisions of Section 1.105,
OR
(b) When a property that has been unoccupied for more than one year and is non-conforming under the provisions of Article 2 is proposed to be occupied.
4.050 Schedule of Permitted Uses. The specific uses listed in the following schedule (Table 4.050-1) are permitted in the zones as indicated, subject to the general provisions, special conditions, additional restrictions, and exceptions set forth in this Code. A description of each use category is in Article 22, Use Categories and Definitions. The abbreviations used in the schedule have the following meanings:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Y Yes; use allowed without review procedures but may be subject to special conditions.
S Use permitted that requires a site plan approval prior to the development or occupancy of the site or building.
CU Use considered conditionally through the Type III procedure under the provisions of Sections 2.230-2.260.
CUII Uses considered conditionally through the Type II procedure under the provisions of Sections 2.230-2.260. Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
PD Use permitted only through Planned Development approval.
N No; use not allowed in the zoning district indicated.
X/X Some zones have two abbreviations for a use category (ex. Y/CU). Refer to the special condition to determine what review process is required based on the details of the use.
A number opposite a use in the “special conditions” column indicates that special provisions apply to the use in all zones. A number in a cell particular to a use and zone(s) indicates that special provisions apply to the use category for that zone(s). The conditions are found following the schedule, in Section 4.060.

DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
4.090 Purpose. Development standards are intended to promote site planning and design that consider the natural environment, site intensity, building mass, and open space. The standards also promote energy conservation, needed privacy, safe and efficient parking areas for new development, and improve the general living environment and economic life of a development. Table 4.090-1, on the following page, summarizes the basic development standards. It should be used in conjunction with the sections immediately succeeding the table, which address special circumstances and exceptions. See Article 8 for design standards for single-family and multiple-family developments.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00, Ord. 5555, 2/7/03; Ord. 5742, 7/14/10, Ord. 5768, 12/7/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

4.110 Measurements. Setback distances must be measured perpendicular to all portions of a property line.
[Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
4.130 Setback Alternative in Developed Areas. When an addition or new development is proposed in an area containing the same types of uses that were developed to a previous setback standard, the Director or review body may approve setbacks that are the same as those for the existing buildings on the site for additions, or the same as those for buildings on abutting parcels for new development. In such instances, the Type I procedure will be used to process requests, and approval will be based upon the following criteria:
(1) The area between buildings is sufficient for adequate property maintenance and rear yard access.
(2) If there are primary structures on both abutting lots with front setbacks less than the required setback, the proposed front setback for a structure is not less than the average of the abutting structures.
[Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
(3) If only one abutting property contains a primary structure, the proposed front setback is no less than the setback of the abutting structure on that property. [Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
(4) A driveway extending at least 20 feet from the street right-of-way must precede on-site parking spaces or parking structures.
(5) For detached dwellings, no wall of a dwelling unit may be closer than 10 feet to a window of another dwelling unit. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]

ARTICLE 5
MIXED USE ZONING DISTRICTS
5.000 Purpose. This article is intended to define the character of Albany’s mixed-use zoning districts. The mixed-use zones implement the concepts identified in the Balanced Development Patterns Project (2001) and the Town Center Plan (Central Albany Land Use and Transportation Study, CALUTS, 1996). These zoning districts are compatible with the Village Center Comprehensive Plan designation applied in the Central Albany area, North Albany, east of Interstate 5 on Knox Butte Road, and south of Oak Creek near Highway 99E (Pacific Boulevard). The mixed-use zones may be applied outside of the Village Center plan designation. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
5.020 Overview. The mixed-use zoning districts are the center of neighborhood and commercial activity, providing a horizontal or vertical mix of retail and residential uses to serve nearby neighborhoods. Other uses may include offices, and community and personal services. Centers are easily accessible to nearby residences, are pedestrian-friendly, and relate to adjacent land uses. Commercial uses must fit the scale of adjacent neighborhoods and the desired character envisioned for each Village Center or mixed-use area. The mixed-use zones differ in permitted uses, development standards, and design based on the unique objectives of each area. Design standards may be adopted to define the unique architectural and streetscape features of each area. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
Development may also be subject to the provisions in Article 8, Design Standards; Article 9, On-Site Development and Environmental Standards; and Article 12, Public Improvements. Sites within overlay districts are also subject to the provisions of Article 6, Special Purpose Districts, and Article 7, Historic Overlay Districts.
The list below is a summary of the topics covered in this article.
■ Zoning Districts
■ Schedule of Permitted Uses
■ Development Standards
[Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
ZONING DISTRICTS
5.030 Establishment of Mixed Use Zoning Districts. In order to implement the mixed-use and livability concepts in the Town Center and Albany Comprehensive Plans, the following zoning districts are created:
(1) HD – HISTORIC DOWNTOWN DISTRICT. The HD district is intended for a dense mixture of uses with an emphasis on entertainment, theaters, restaurants, nightlife and specialty shops. High-density residential infill on upper floors is encouraged, as is the continued presence of the government center and supporting uses. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(2) DMU – DOWNTOWN MIXED USE DISTRICT. The DMU district is intended for a mix of retail, services, institutions, offices, and housing that supports businesses in and around the Historic Downtown District. Mixed uses are encouraged both horizontally and vertically. High-density residential infill and office employment are both encouraged. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(3) CB – DOWNTOWN CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. The CB district is intended for a broad mix of residential and non-residential uses. Mixed uses are encouraged both horizontally and vertically. High-density residential infill is encouraged to support nearby businesses.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(4) MUR – MIXED USE RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT. The MUR district is intended primarily to create a residential district that allows a mixture of neighborhood commercial uses that meet the daily needs of area residents. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
Albany Development Code, Article 5 5 - 2 January 1, 2021
(5) WF – WATERFRONT DISTRICT. The WF district is intended to transition Albany’s Willamette River waterfront into a vibrant center characterized by a variety of housing choices and a mixture of housing, office, and retail uses. Infill and redevelopment are encouraged, as well as adaptive reuse of existing buildings until the area is redeveloped. Development and design standards will result in great neighborhoods, a pedestrian-friendly environment, and an enhanced community image.
[Ord. 5635, 1/11/06; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(6) LE – LYON-ELLSWORTH DISTRICT. The LE district is intended primarily as a location for development that serves the Historic Downtown district and Downtown Central Business district. This district is the most desirable location in the Central Albany area for parking structures with ground-floor commercial uses.
(7) MS – MAIN STREET DISTRICT. The MS district is intended primarily as an employment center with supporting commercial and retail services for residents and employees in the area. Infill and redevelopment are encouraged provided there is no adverse impact to surrounding residences.
[Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(8) ES – ELM STREET DISTRICT. The ES district is intended primarily to provide enough land for Albany General Hospital and associated medical uses while maintaining compatibility with adjacent residences in scale and design. Light commercial and personal services are encouraged to serve the nearby residents. Removal of existing residences and landscapes is discouraged. New parking facilities should be underground or completely screened. Only the amount of parking that is necessary should be allowed for uses in this district, to minimize the amount of land consumed by parking.
(9) PB – PACIFIC BOULEVARD DISTRICT. The PB district is intended as an auto-oriented commercial area along Pacific Boulevard in the Central Albany area. Design guidelines and front-yard landscaping will provide a coordinated look and enhance the community image along this major corridor as it develops or redevelops. Commercial infill and redevelopment are encouraged. Sound and visual buffers should be used to protect nearby residential areas. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(10) MUC – MIXED USE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT. The MUC zoning district is intended primarily to provide a mix of convenience commercial, personal services, offices and medium density residential uses. The district would typically be anchored by a grocery store and may include a mix of smaller retailers, offices, live-work units, and residences. The MUC district is easily accessible to nearby residences, and commercial uses are compatible in scale and design with adjacent neighborhoods. Uses in the MUC zone will serve area residents and should not draw from the region. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5577, 7/28/04; Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]

SCHEDULE OF PERMITTED USES
5.050 Interpretation. Each use category in the schedule of permitted uses is described in Article 22, Use Categories and Definitions. Article 22 classifies land uses and activities into categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods and services are sold or delivered, and certain site factors. In addition to the clarification in Article 22, the following provisions shall be used to interpret the schedule of permitted uses found in this Article: [Ord. 555, 2/7/03]
(1) The schedule of permitted uses cannot anticipate all uses that may be located within the city. There are also situations where proposed uses may relate to more than one type of use. In both instances, the Director will determine the appropriate use category based on operating characteristics and land use impacts. Where ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use, the use may be reviewed as a Conditional Use where the Director determines that the proposed use is consistent with other uses allowable within the subject district due to similar characteristics.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Where a development proposal involves a combination of uses other than accessory uses, the more restrictive provisions of this Code shall apply. For example, if a portion of a development is subject to Conditional Use approval and the balance is subject only to Site Plan Review, the entire development shall be reviewed utilizing the Conditional Use criteria if concurrent approval of all uses is sought.
(3) A change in the use of a property is subject to review as specified by the schedules of permitted uses:
(a) When the change involves a change from one use category to another in the schedule of permitted uses and the Director has not waived review under the provisions of Section 1.105, or
(b) When a property that has been unoccupied for more than one year and is non-conforming under the provisions of Article 2 is proposed to be occupied. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
5.060 Schedule of Permitted Uses. The specific uses listed in the following schedule (Table 5.060-1) are permitted in the zones as indicated, subject to the general provisions, special conditions, additional restrictions, and exceptions set forth in this Code. A description of each use category is in Article 22, Use Categories and Definitions. The abbreviations used in the schedule have the following meanings:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Y Yes; use allowed without review procedures but may be subject to special conditions.
S Use permitted that requires a site plan approval prior to the development or occupancy of the site or building.
CU Use considered conditionally under the provisions of Sections 2.230-2.260 through the Type III procedure.
CUII Uses considered conditionally through the Type II procedure under the provisions of Sections 2.230-2.260. [Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
PD Use permitted only through Planned Development approval.
N No; use not allowed in the zoning district indicated.
X/X Some zones have two abbreviations for a use category (ex. Y/CU). Refer to the special condition to determine what review process is required based on the details of the use.
A number appearing opposite a use in the “special conditions” column indicates that special provisions apply to the use in all zones. A number in a cell particular to a use and zone(s) indicates that special provisions apply to the use category for that zone(s). These conditions are found following the schedule in Section 5.070.

SPECIAL STATUS
5.080 Existing Single-Family Uses Granted Special Status.
Single-Family Homes. Notwithstanding the restrictions or terms of any other section of the Albany Development Code (ADC), all single-family residential units legally established before January 1, 2002, shall be deemed to be conforming to the base zoning district. If any building on these properties is substantially destroyed, as defined in ADC Section 2.335(3), it may be rebuilt to the same density, size (square feet) and setbacks as existed on the property at the time it was destroyed, but will be subject to the regulations of any applicable overlay zone. If any single-family dwelling is converted to non-residential use, the special status granted here is rescinded, and the use of the property shall thereafter conform to the requirements of Article 5. The special status granted herein shall be lost if is determined that the residence was not legally established prior to January 1, 2002.

The purpose of the Special Status List is to recognize existing buildings in the WF zone that pre-date the current zoning (applied in 2006) that were typically designed for industrial uses and may not readily convert to non-industrial uses permitted in the WF zone. Special standards are imposed to ensure that the additional industrial and commercial uses permitted on these sites because of their special status listing do not detract from the desirability of existing or future residential uses in the Waterfront zone and to encourage conversion of Special Status List sites to permitted uses.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(2) Additional uses. The Industrial and Commercial uses listed in (a) through (f), below, will be considered through the Conditional Use process for Special Status List sites. Any lawfully established use not listed below and not otherwise permitted in the WF zone shall be regulated as a non-conforming use, pursuant to ADC Sections 2.300-2.370. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) Contractors and Industrial Services: Salvage or wrecking operations and dry-cleaning plants are prohibited. All other Industrial Services may be considered through a Conditional Use review.

(a) An existing use lawfully established prior to the effective date of the WF zone (1/11/06) does not require a Conditional Use review to continue operations within an existing building and shall not be considered a non-conforming use.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(b) A site modification or expansion of less than 15 percent of the square footage of the existing building(s) that does not include a change of use shall be reviewed as a Type II Conditional Use, subject to the standards in (3), above, except as excluded under ADC Section 1.105.

Continuous Storage Operations: Operations that continuously store equipment or materials, including, but not limited to lumber yards, automobile junkyards, logging or sawmill operations, storage yards for heavy equipment, automobile dealership lots, and other storage operations with similar impacts. These operations are included in the definition of floodplain development. Critical Facility: A facility that needs to be operable during a flood, or for which even a slight chance of flooding might pose unacceptable risk to health and safety. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and other emergency responders, and installations that produce, use or store hazardous materials. Datum: Until recently, the FIRMs have referenced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29). A newer more accurate vertical datum, the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88), will be used for all FIRM updates. The 2010 Albany FIRMs reference the NAVD 88 datum. NAVD 88 will be used for floodplain management purposes in the City of Albany. The conversion factor from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88 for all flooding sources in Albany is +3.38 feet. This represents an average conversion offset. This simplified uniform conversion procedure can be used for entire counties when the maximum error is not more than 0.25 feet (3 inches) for that county, which is the case for the City of Albany. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): The federal agency charged with implementing the National Flood Insurance Program. FEMA provides floodplain maps to the City of Albany. Flood: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: (a) the overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or (b) the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

Floodplain: The combined area of the floodway and the flood fringe. Also known as the 100-year floodplain, and the Special Flood Hazard Area. Note Floodplain Relationships diagram in Figure 6.075-1. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Floodplain Development: Any man-made change to real property, including but not limited to, construction or placement of buildings or other structures, fencing, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, land clearing, drilling, or Continuous Storage Operations in the Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain). Floodproofing: Any combination of structural or nonstructural provisions, changes or adjustments to structures, land or waterway for the reduction or elimination of flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents during a 100-year flood. Floodway: The regulatory floodway is the stream channel plus that portion of the overbanks that must be kept free from encroachment in order to discharge the 1-percent-annual-chance flood without increasing flood levels by more than 1.0 foot. Note Floodplain Relationships diagram in Figure 6.075-1.

An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking vehicles, building access or storage, in any area other than a basement area, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that the enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable design requirements of this Article found in Section 6.121(1). National Flood Insurance Program: FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has three basic components – flood hazard mapping, flood insurance, and floodplain regulations. The combination of the three all work together to reduce flood damages. NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the federal government and each participating community. Local, state and federal governments and private insurance companies must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The City of Albany joined the NFIP in 1985. The community's role is of paramount importance. Residents and property owners can get federally-backed flood insurance only if the community carries out its responsibilities. The community enacts and implements the floodplain regulations required for participation in NFIP. The community's regulations must meet the regulations set by its state, as well as the NFIP criteria. Nonresidential: For the purposes of development in the floodplain, FEMA defines nonresidential construction to include structures not used for human habitation. This includes parking, limited storage, and building access associated with residential uses, as well as commercial, industrial, and institutional uses. This differs from the definition of nonresidential in other Articles and Sections of this Code, and from the definition in the locally adopted State Building Codes.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 6 January 1, 2021
Oregon Drainage Law: Oregon, through court decisions, has adopted a civil law doctrine of drainage. Generally, under this doctrine, adjoining landowners are entitled to have the normal course of natural drainage maintained. The lower landowner must accept water that naturally comes to his land from above, but he is entitled not to have the normal drainage changed or substantially increased. The lower landowner may not obstruct the runoff from the upper land, if the upper landowner is properly discharging the water. The drainage law has developed without legislative action; therefore there are no Oregon Revised Statutes, rules or other laws to cite. Note that this definition is intended to provide general information and should not be used as the basis for legal advice or legal decisions. Permanent Foundation: A natural or manufactured support system to which a structure is anchored or attached. A permanent foundation is capable of resisting flood forces and may include posts, piles, poured concrete or reinforced block walls, properly compacted fill, or other systems of comparable flood resistivity and strength.

Residential: For the purposes of development in the floodplain, FEMA defines residential construction to include the entire habitable structure, including bathroom, laundry rooms, hobby rooms, workshops, etc. Residential accessory structures are considered residential construction. This differs from the definition of residential in other Articles and Sections of this Code, and from the definition of residential and habitable in the locally adopted State Building Codes. Special Flood Hazard Area: Areas subject to inundation during the occurrence of the 1 percent annual flood. These areas include both the flood fringe and the floodway and are collectively commonly referred to as the “100-year floodplain.” Start of Construction Start of ConstructionStart of Construction

Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 49 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 7 January 1, 2021
Substantial Improvement: For the purposes of this section any and all repairs, reconstruction, additions or improvements of a structure occurring within the ten years prior to the date of the application for the current improvement, the cost of which, when cumulatively added to the costs of prior improvements, equals or exceeds 49 percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. Cumulative value will be computed by adding the valuations of all improvements within the ten-year period as calculated on the associated building permit plus the valuations that would have applied for improvements requiring permits but for which no permit was actually issued. This cumulative value shall be used in comparing the value of improvements against the current market value of the structure before the start of construction of the new improvement. The market value determination shall be based upon the county assessor's most recent computation of real market value at the time of the current application. This term includes structures that have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (a) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or (b) Any restoration or rehabilitation of a structure on the City’s Local Historic Inventory or the National Register of Historic Places (additions and new construction are not exempt); [Ord. 5875, 10/28/16] (c) Maintenance, replacement, or repair of prior lawfully constructed improvements. Watercourse: Any natural or artificial stream, river, creek, ditch, channel, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine or wash in which water flows in a definite direction or course, either continuously or intermittently, and has a definite channel, bed and banks; including any adjacent area subject to inundation by reason of overflow or flood water. This also includes any topographic feature not meeting the above definition that is identified in the City’s Stormwater Master Plan as needing preservation. GENERAL PROVISIONS 6.080 Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. These regulations apply to all areas in the City of Albany that are subject to inundation from a 100-year flood. These areas have been identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the Flood Insurance Study for Linn County, Oregon and Incorporated Areas effective date September 29, 2010 and as revised effective date December 8, 2016, 2016, and associated Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) with Community Number 410137. These areas are depicted on the FIRMs by the letter A and AE. The Flood Insurance Study and FIRMs are on file at the City of Albany, Community Development Department at 333 Broadalbin Street SW. [Ord. 5875, 10/28/16] In addition, the City Council may adopt by resolution more current floodplain studies or boundary information. If the new information conflicts with the current effective Flood Insurance Study of Flood Insurance Rate Maps, the more restrictive information will apply. [Ord. 5773, 02/08/12] Precise Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain) boundaries may be difficult to determine from the maps referred to above due to their large scale and lack of site specific studies. In such instances, the Floodplain Administrator may apply FEMA base flood elevations to topographic maps or site surveys in order to determine actual boundaries. In the absence of FEMA base flood elevations, the Floodplain Administrator shall reasonably use other sources of floodplain and floodway data to determine base flood elevations and boundaries. However, when elevation data is not available through FEMA or another authoritative source and the development consists of 4 or more lots, 4 or more structures, or 4 or more acres, the applicant shall generate and have certified by a registered engineer the base flood elevation.

Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 8 January 1, 2021
6.081 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased as a result of failure of manmade structures and/or natural causes. This article does not imply that the land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article does not create any duty or liability on the part of the City of Albany or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10]
6.082 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another ordinance, Building Codes, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

Appeals to the interpretations of the Floodplain Administrator shall be reviewed by the Hearings Board as a Type II procedure in accordance with Sections 1.040 and 1.410 of this Code. Appeals to the land use decisions (Types I-L, II, and III) resulting from the Floodplain Development Permit applications shall be reviewed in accordance with Section 1.410 of this Code. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10; Ord. 5947, 01/01/21] 6.092 Variances. Variances from the terms of this section shall be granted only, when because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of this section deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in vicinity and under identical zoning classifications. Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the physical characteristics of the land and are not dependent upon the occupants, type, or use of a structure. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10]
No variance will be given to the standards for development in a floodway. Variances from the floodplain management regulations of this section shall be reviewed using the Major Variance procedure (see Article 2) and shall be approved if the review body finds that all of the following criteria have been met: [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] (1) The applicant can show good and sufficient cause; and (2) Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and (3) Issuing the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and (4) The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. (5) Variances from the required lowest floor elevation for new construction and substantial improvements may be granted if the review body find that the request meets criteria (1)-(4) and the parcel is one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level. As the lot size increases the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. (6) Variances may be granted for a water dependent use provided that the structure or other development meets criteria (1)-(4) and is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 10 January 1, 2021
(7) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on Albany’s Local Historic Inventory or the National Register of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in this section. [Ord. 5875, 10/28/16] (8) Variances may be granted for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria and otherwise complies with Building Codes. Upon issuing the variance, the Floodplain Administrator will notify the applicant in writing that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] 6.093 Floodplain Development Permit Required. A Floodplain Development Permit is required prior to initiating floodplain development activities, as defined in Section 6.075, in the Special Flood Hazard Area. This Article cannot anticipate all development activities that may be located within the Special Flood Hazard Area. The floodplain development permit shall expire 180 days after issuance unless the permitted activity has been substantially begun and thereafter pursued to completion. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] All development activities that require a Floodplain Development Permit shall be processed in accordance with ADC Section 1.100, Land Use Application Procedures. When ambiguity exists concerning the appropriate classification of a particular activity, the use may be reviewed as a conditional use when the Floodplain Administrator determines that the proposed activity is consistent with other activities allowable within the subject district due to similar characteristics and impacts. When a development proposal involves a combination of activities, the more restrictive provisions of this Code shall apply. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] A. The following activities will be processed through a Type I procedure as established in ADC 1.210: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] (1) Any structure 200 square feet or more. (2) Any substantial improvement to an existing structure as defined in this code. (3) Placement of a recreational vehicle more than 180 consecutive days, as described in 6.124(2)-(3). (4) Solid fences and walls that require a permit as listed in Section 6.125. (5) Any site improvement for development in the floodplain pursuant to Section 6.110 that is not exempt under Section 6.094 and does not already require a permit elsewhere in this Section of the Code. [Ord. 5875, 10/28/16]
B. The following activities will be processed through a Type I-L procedure as established in ADC 1.220:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] (1) Any development in the floodway allowed by Sections 6.100-6.101. (2) Grading, excavation, fill, and paving pursuant to Section 6.111 that cumulatively impacts more than 50 cubic yards of the native elevation and contours of the site or that otherwise requires a permit per this Article, and any associated retaining walls. (3) Mining and drilling operations that result in sledge, slag, or other materials remaining in the Special Flood Hazard area will be considered fill for the purposes of this Article and will be reviewed through the applicable criteria in Section 6.111. (4) Additions or expansions of Continuous Storage Operations pursuant to Section 6.112. (5) New Continuous Storage Operations pursuant to Section 6.112. (6) Land Divisions of 19 lots or less pursuant to Section 6.110. [Ord. 5767, 12/7/11; Ord. 5875, 10/28/16]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 11 January 1, 2021
C. The following activities will be processed through a Type II procedure as established in ADC 1.230: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] (1) Any alteration of a Watercourse, pursuant to 6.101 and the applicable criteria in Section 6.111.
D. The following will be processed through a Type III procedure as established in ADC 1.240:
Ord. 5947, 1/01/21 (1) Land Divisions of 20 or more lots, Cluster Developments and Planned Developments pursuant to Section 6.110. [Ord. 5875, 10/28/16] (2) Manufactured home parks pursuant to Section 6.110 will be reviewed through the Manufactured Home Park application process. 6.094 Floodplain Development Permit Exemptions. The following development activities in the flood fringe do not require a Floodplain Development Permit. These exemptions do not apply to development in the floodway. (Note: Federal and State laws and regulations, including Oregon Drainage Law, may still apply to exempted development activities.) [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] (1) Structures less than 200 square feet that meet the provisions of 6.122. (2) Grading, excavation, fill or paving less than 50 cubic yards (cumulative).

[Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] 6.109 Residential Development Standards. Applications proposing new residential dwelling units or the creation of residential lots or parcels on property with Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain) on it must comply with either the clear and objective standard in subsection (1) or the discretionary standard in subsection (2), below. (1) Clear and objective standard. No new dwelling units or new residential lots or parcels are allowed within the floodplain. An application to develop property that has floodplain on it, but where no development is proposed within the boundaries of that floodplain will be processed as otherwise required in this Code. In case of land divisions, “no development” means the floodplain area has been excluded from the land division. This can be done by setting the property aside for some other purpose than later development (for example, as a public drainage right-of-way). (2) Alternative review. Residential development is allowed within the floodplain subject to the provisions of this Floodplain overlay district and the standards in Sections 6.100 through 6.125.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21] 6.110 Site Improvement, Land Division and Manufactured Home Park Standards. Site improvements, land divisions, and manufactured home parks in the Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain) shall be reviewed by the Planning Division as a part of the land use review process. An application to develop property that has floodplain on it, but where no development is proposed in that floodplain will be processed as otherwise required in this Code. In the case of a land division, “no actual development” means the floodplain area has been excluded from the land division. This can be done by setting the property aside for some other purpose than later development (for example, as a public drainage right-of-way). [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] In addition to the general review criteria for site improvements, land divisions and manufactured home parks, applications that propose actual development within the Special Flood Hazard Area shall also be subject to the following standards: [Ord. 5338, 1/28/98; Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] (1) All proposed new development and land divisions shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and ensure that building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. (2) All new development and land division proposals shall have utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. (3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid functional impairment, or contamination from them, during flooding. (4) All development proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage. (5) Any lot created for development purposes must have adequate area created outside of the floodway to maintain a buildable site area meeting the minimum requirements of this Article. (6) Any new public or private street providing access to a residential development shall have a roadway crown elevation not lower than one foot below the 100-year flood elevation. (7) All development proposals shall show the location of the 100-year flood contour line followed by the date the flood elevation was established. When elevation data is not available, either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source, and the development is four or more acres or results in four or more lots or structures, the elevation shall be determined and certified by a
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 14 January 1, 2021
registered engineer. In addition, a statement located on or attached to the recorded map or plat shall read as follows: “Development of property within the Special Flood Hazard Area as most currently established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency or City of Albany may be restricted and subject to special regulations by the City.” [Ord. 5338, 1/28/98] (8) In addition to the general review criteria applicable to manufactured home parks in Article 10, applications that propose actual development within a Special Flood Hazard Area shall include an evacuation plan indicating alternate vehicular access and escape routes. 6.111 Grading, Fill, Excavation, and Paving. A floodplain development permit is required for grading, fill, excavation, and paving in the Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain), except activities exempted in Section 6.094 of this Article. No grading will be permitted in a floodway, except when the applicant has supplied evidence prepared by a professional engineer that demonstrates the proposal will not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the 100-year flood. The permit will be approved if the applicant has shown that each of the following criteria that are applicable have been met: [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10; Ord. 5929, 7/26/19]
(1) Provisions have been made to maintain adequate flood-carrying capacity of existing watercourses, including future maintenance of that capacity. (2) The proposal will be approved only where adequate provisions for stormwater runoff have been made that are consistent with the Public Works Engineering standards, or as otherwise approved by the City Engineer. (3) No grading, fill, excavation, or paving will be permitted over an existing public storm drain, sanitary sewer, or water line unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Engineer that the proposed grading, fill, excavation, or paving will not be detrimental to the anticipated service life, operation and maintenance of the existing utility. (4) In areas where no floodway has been designated on the applicable FIRM, grading will not be permitted unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative effect of the proposed grading, fill, excavation, or paving when combined with all other existing and planned development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than a maximum of one foot (cumulative) at any point within the community. (5) The applicant shall notify the City of Albany, any adjacent community, and the Natural Hazards Mitigation Office of the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development of any proposed grading, fill, excavation, or paving activity that will result in alteration or relocation of a watercourse (see Section 6.101). (6) All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry waters to the nearest practicable watercourse approved by the designee as a safe place to deposit such waters. Erosion of ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of non-erosive down spouts and diffusers or other devices. (7) Building pads shall have a drainage gradient of two percent toward approved drainage facilities, unless waived by the Building Official or designee. 6.112 Continuous Storage Operations. The regulation of storage in the flood fringe focuses on long-term storage activities associated with continuous operations as defined in this Article. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] A continuous storage operation is allowed if it can be shown that: (1) The materials or equipment will not be flammable, hazardous, explosive or otherwise potentially injurious to human, animal, or plant life in times of flooding; and (2) The materials or equipment are not subject to major damage by flood and are firmly anchored to prevent flotation or is readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning. 6.113 Critical Facility Standards. Construction of new critical facilities, and additions to critical facilities built after September 29, 2010, shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, located outside the limits of the Special Flood Hazard Area (100-year floodplain). [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 15 January 1, 2021
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the Special Flood Hazard Area if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the Special Flood Hazard Area shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility shall also be protected to the height utilized above. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that hazardous materials will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible. [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] 6.120 Building Standards. Applications for building permits within the Special Flood Hazard Area, as established in Section 6.080, shall be reviewed by the Building Official pursuant to locally adopted state building codes. In addition to building code criteria, all development in the Special Flood Hazard Area, except that exempted in Section 6.094, is subject to the following building standards: [Ord. 5746, 9/29/10] (1) Property owners or developers shall file with the City two elevation certificates in a format that is acceptable to FEMA. These certificates must be approved by the Building Official, prepared by a registered surveyor or professional engineer, architect or surveyor, and maintained for public inspection. A Pre-Construction Elevation Certificate shall be submitted and approved prior to setback and foundation inspection approval. A Post-Construction Elevation Certificate shall be submitted and approved prior to final inspection approval for all building permits when the Pre-Construction Elevation Certificate shows the building site to be within a Special Flood Hazard Area and lowest adjacent grade to be at or below the base flood elevation (BFE). The Post-Construction certificate must contain: 1) the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor including basement of all new or substantially improved structures; 2) the elevation of any flood proofing; and 3) whether or not the structure contains a basement. (2) The lowest floor, including basement, of any proposed structure (including residential and non-residential structures) shall be placed at least one (1) foot above the 100-year flood as determined by the latest Flood Insurance Study. (3) When elevation data is not available either through the Flood Insurance Study, FIRM, or from other sources of floodplain and floodway data as described in Section 6.080, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., when available. (4) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. (5) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. (6) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during a flood.

(1) Acceptable are materials and installation methods that allow for the entry and exit of floodwater. (2) Wood fence boards should be spaced to allow for the entry and exit of floodwater. (3) Solid fences and freestanding walls must include a flap or opening in the areas at or below the Base Flood Elevation at least once every three fence panels or 24 feet, whichever is less. Fences less than 24 feet in length shall have at least one flap or opening in the areas at or below the Base Flood elevation. The minimum dimensions of the flap or opening shall not be less than 12"x12" or 8"x18". Openings shall not include any screening of any type or size. If flaps are used, they may be secured to allow closure during normal use, but must be capable of self-release and opening to full dimensions when under pressure of no greater than 30 pounds per sq. ft. These standards do not apply to retaining walls which shall meet the same standards as other building, paving, and grading activities.
Solid fences and walls constructed within Zone A, where the base flood elevation has not been determined, can use other sources of floodplain and floodway data to determine base flood elevations and boundaries as described in Section 6.080, or the openings can be placed within one foot of the finished grade along the fence alignment. (4) Other fence materials and construction that would restrict the flow of floodwaters will require a permit so they can be reviewed and adapted to meet the intent of this section of the Code.
HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT
6.170 Purpose. The Hillside Development overlay district (/HD) is intended to regulate the development of potentially hazardous terrain, minimize public and private losses due to earth movement hazards in specified areas, and minimize erosion and related environmental damage. It is not the intent of Hillside Development standards to transfer density within a development. [Ord. 5668, 4/11/2007]
6.180 Applicability. Except as specified below, the Hillside Development standards apply to any property proposed for development that has slopes of 12 percent or greater as shown on Plate 7 of the Albany Comprehensive Plan. Where Plate 7 shows that there are slopes 12 percent or greater on a property, the applicant may choose to submit a topographic survey, prepared and stamped by a licensed surveyor or civil engineer, showing two-foot contour intervals for the entire site. If the applicant chooses to submit survey information, and the survey indicates that the property does not contain slopes 12 percent or greater, the Hillside Development standards will not apply. [Ord. 5668, 4/11/2007; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
The interior remodeling of existing buildings, including the creation of additional dwellings units within an existing dwelling, is exempt from the requirements of the Hillside Development overlay District provided there is no increase in the building footprint. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
6.190 Procedure. Hillside Development is reviewed concurrently with the land use application(s) required for the development and is processed using the same procedure as the primary land use application. Hillside Development that only requires a building permit is reviewed administratively as a Type I procedure.
[Ord. 5668, 4/11/2007; Ord. 5886, 1/6/17; Ord. 5923, 2/8/19; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
6.200 Geotechnical Report Required. For any development subject to the applicability criterion in ADC 6.180, an applicant shall provide a geologic and soils report prepared and stamped by a certified engineering geologist or a licensed civil engineer, licensed in the specialty of geotechnical engineering with the State of Oregon.
The report must identify the following:
(1) All geologic and soils hazards and certify that the site, and each individual lot if land division is proposed, are suitable for the proposed development.
(2) Area(s) suitable for building and describe how slopes will be stabilized.
(3) Suitable building footprint(s) for development on each lot.
(4) Any requirements that must be met from the time construction begins to the time construction is completed.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 19 January 1, 2021
(5) Any requirements that must be met after construction is completed (e.g., maintenance requirements for continued slope stabilization). [Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
6.210 Drainage. In all slope areas, impervious surface drainage from roofs, driveways, and parking areas must be directed to a City storm drain or other City-approved drainage system. Development activities must not block the flow of stormwater in natural drainageways without prior approval from the Public Works Director.
[Ord. 5265, 12/18/96]
6.220 Street and Driveway Standards. Street grades shall generally be 12 percent or less. Grades on Arterial or Collector streets must be no more than 6 percent and 10 percent respectively (see Section 12.210). Street grades of up to 15 percent may be permitted for a distance of no more than 200 feet. No intersections are permitted where street grades exceed 12 percent. Where practical, streets must be contoured to hillside areas in order to minimize environmental and scenic disruption. Driveways must have a grade of 15 percent or less, unless the Public Works Director approves a greater slope.
6.230 Modification of Standards. The following Development Code standards may be modified through the application process, if approved by the review body:
(1) Front, side and rear yards may be reduced if the geotechnical report explains why the reduction is warranted. The reduction must be approved by the review body. A variance application is not required, but a developer must make a specific written request for the reduction to the City for consideration.
(2) Building height limitations may be exceeded on hillside lots, if the geotechnical report explains why the additional height is warranted. The additional height requires approval by the review body, provided it does not exceed 45 feet. [Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
6.235 Applications for Residential Development. For the construction of new residential dwelling units within the Hillside Development overlay district that meet the applicability criteria in ADC 6.180, in lieu of compliance with sections 6.200 through 6.230, applicants may choose to provide a certification from an Oregon licensed Engineering Geologists (CEG) or an Oregon licensed Geotechnical Engineer (GE) stating:
(1) That the proposed development activity will not impact or be impacted by existing or potential stability problems or any of the following site conditions: springs or seeps, depth of soil bedrock, variations in soil types, or a combination of these conditions; or
(2) If proposed development activity will impact or be impacted by any of the conditions listed in (1), the methods for safely addressing the impact of the conditions.
If a certification is submitted under subsection (2), the certification shall also include a signed and notarized statement from the property owner, and applicant, that all development will occur in accordance with the Engineer’s certification [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

6.270 Purpose and Intent. The intent of these supplemental Significant Natural Resource overlay districts is to protect significant natural resources within the City of Albany as designated under Statewide Planning Goal 5 and the provisions of the Goal 5 administrative rule (OAR 660, Division 23), while ensuring reasonable economic use of property.
More specifically, the purpose and intent of each Significant Natural Resource overlay district is as follows:
A. Riparian Corridor overlay district (/RC): To protect and enhance Albany's riparian areas, thereby protecting and restoring the hydrologic, ecological, and land conservation functions these areas provide. Significant riparian corridors support valuable fish and wildlife habitat; improve water quality by regulating stream temperatures, trapping sediment, and stabilizing streambanks; and reduce the effects of flooding.
A healthy riparian corridor is comprised of a multi-storied forest of native species of trees, shrubs, and ground cover. Many riparian corridors in Albany have the potential to be restored to higher function and value.
B. Significant Wetland overlay district (/SW): To protect and enhance the integrity, function and value of Albany’s significant wetlands and fish-bearing waterways. Wetlands and waterways provide hydrologic and ecologic functions; and reduce adverse effects of flooding. The vast majority of significant wetlands are in riparian areas. There are a small number of isolated significant wetlands. The higher quality isolated wetlands will be regulated locally (as identified in the Citywide ESEE Analysis); and the lower quality isolated wetlands will not be regulated locally, but must comply with state and federal wetland regulations.
C. Habitat Assessment overlay district (/HA): To protect habitat for northwestern pond and western painted turtles in and around Thornton Lakes by reviewing and limiting the impacts of development activities on their habitat. This was the only area in Albany where there is a documented presence of a species listed by either the federal government or the State of Oregon. The State lists the species as "sensitive, critical." The overlay identifies an area of high likelihood of turtle nesting, foraging, or migration routes. The overlay district regulations provide a limited level of protection (as identified in the Thornton Lakes ESEE Analysis). Voluntary methods of turtle habitat protection and enhancement are encouraged and essential.
6.280 Lands to Which These Regulations Apply. The procedures and requirements of this section apply only to property that is within a Significant Natural Resource overlay district.
A. Riparian Corridor overlay district (/RC): The Riparian Corridor overlay district extends 50 feet upland from the Ordinary High Water mark, measured horizontally.
If the Riparian Corridor overlay district area includes all or portions of a significant wetland, the district extends upland 50 feet, measured horizontally from the edge of the significant wetland. Fish-bearing waterways, and the significant wetlands associated with such waterways, are included in the Significant Wetland overlay district.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 21 January 1, 2021
(1) The Riparian Corridor boundary applies to the following Albany water resources (and in-stream lakes):
o Calapooia River
o Burkhart Creek
o Cathey Creek
o Cox Creek
o Crocker Creek
o Horseshoe Creek
o Oak Creek
o Periwinkle Creek
o Thornton Lakes
o Truax Creek
(2) The Willamette River Riparian Corridor is located within the Willamette River Greenway District boundary. All development on properties within the Willamette River Greenway District is subject to the regulations beginning in Section 6.500, but is not subject to the riparian corridor overlay regulations.
B. Significant Wetland overlay district (/SW): The Significant Wetland overlay district is comprised of fish-bearing waterways below the Ordinary High Water Mark, the wetlands associated with riparian corridors, and higher quality isolated significant wetlands, in the City's Local Wetland Inventory (LWI), and as amended through wetland delineations approved by the DSL and the ACE, if applicable. Notice to, and potentially permits from, DSL and ACE are still required for potential impact to all wetlands regulated by DSL or ACE.
C. Habitat Assessment overlay district (/HA): This overlay district extends 75 feet from the Ordinary High Water mark upland from East and West Thornton Lakes.
6.290 Exempt Activities. The following activities are exempt from Natural Resource Impact Review as would otherwise be required within the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts. Many of these exemptions are provided in recognition of the Albany ESEE analyses and pre-existing uses. Land use reviews as required by other sections of this Code and compliance with other local (floodplain, fill, encroachment, etc.), state, and federal regulations is still required. As a result, these activities should still be conducted in a manner that minimizes impact to Albany’s significant natural resources.
(1) Emergency procedures necessary for the immediate safety or protection of life or property, including removing hazardous trees and stream bank stabilization.
(2) Removal of refuse or any fill that is in violation of local, state or federal regulations or in-channel erosion or flood control measures approved by City of Albany Public Works, DSL, ACE and any other applicable state or federal regulatory agency. Removal or placement of material in waters of the State must be consistent with State of Oregon Removal-Fill regulations (ORS 196.795-990) and the ACE fill regulations.
(3) City construction of public infrastructure, such as transportation, stormwater, sewer, and water utilities. This exemption requires unimproved but disturbed areas to be replanted with native vegetation.
(4) Private construction of public infrastructure. The location and construction of public transportation and utility facilities and structures as identified in a City-adopted master plan. This exemption requires that unimproved but disturbed areas are replanted with native vegetation.
(5) The use of pre-existing right-of-way or easements for public infrastructure, franchise utilities, and railroads. Planting and maintaining native vegetation is encouraged.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 22 January 1, 2021
(6) Implementation of erosion prevention or flood control measures provided the measures have received any required approvals and permits from local, state or federal regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the proposed activity.
(7) Farming practices such as grazing, plowing, planting, cultivating and harvesting, that either existed on the property prior to the date of adoption of these provisions or do not include new or expanded structures, roads, or other facilities involving grading, excavation, fill, native vegetation removal, or new drainage measures.
(8) Maintenance of existing structures, impervious surfaces, and landscaped areas as described below:
(a) Ongoing maintenance of pre-existing landscaped areas, including perimeter mowing, as long as natural vegetation is not disturbed and there is no excavation, filling or reduction of natural resource area. Use of integrated pest management methods is encouraged.
(b) Ongoing maintenance of existing development, such as repair, replacement, and use of existing buildings, roads, paths, utilities, bridges, culverts, fences, flood control structures, drainageways or facilities, detention facilities, water quality facilities, and other structures and impervious surfaces, provided that such practices avoid sedimentation and other discharges into streams, lakes, or wetlands and do not add impervious surface or remove additional vegetation.
(9) Removal of live vegetation for the following purposes:
(a) Restoration and enhancement projects that have received required approvals from the appropriate local, state, or federal agency.
(b) Removal of non-native and invasive plants, including noxious weeds if consistent with local, state, and federal regulations, and replanted with species on the City's native plant list.
(c) Planting native vegetation on the City's native plant list.
(d) Felling of trees planted as Christmas trees or orchard trees.
(10) Residential development activities, such as construction of home additions, decks, patios, sheds, gardens, landscaping, etc., that impact no more than 2,000 square feet (cumulatively), or 20 percent of the Habitat Assessment overlay district area within a property, whichever is less. Development activities will be reviewed at the time of application for building permits when applicable.
Regardless of the exemption to the local Natural Resource Impact Review requirements, protection of the turtle species is regulated by the State of Oregon.
This exemption only applies to the Habitat Assessment overlay district. If the proposed activity is also located within other Significant Natural Resource overlay districts the requirements of those districts still apply.
(11) Construction of an approved, vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facility (e.g. swale), located in a portion of the Riparian Corridor that is in Degraded Quality condition and planted with native plants. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
6.300 Activities Subject to Natural Resource Impact Review. A Natural Resource Impact Review will be required for proposed development activities in the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts that are not specifically exempted from review. The review will take place concurrent with any land use application or building permit. In instances when neither is required, the Natural Resource Impact Review will be conducted independently through either a Type I or I-L process as designated below. The standards for reviewing proposed development activities in the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts are found in Section 6.305 and Section 6.310. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
A. Activities subject to review include:
(1) Land divisions;
(2) New structures, or exterior expansion of the footprint of any structure or driveways (Type I);
(3) Increases in impervious surfaces (Type I-L);
(4) Site modifications, including grading, excavation, fill or native vegetation removal (Type I-L);
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 23 January 1, 2021
(5) Private construction of public and privately owned transportation facilities and utilities not exempt through 6.290(4) or 6.290(11) (Type I-L); and
(6) Activities within the Habitat Assessment overlay district not exempt under ADC 6.290 (Type I).
B. When a proposed use or activity requires a Natural Resource Impact Review, in addition to what is required for any concurrent land use applications or building permits, the applicant shall submit a scaled site plan to the City that that shows:
(1) Topographic contours at two-foot intervals;
(2) Ordinary high water (OHW) mark of all lakes, streams, or other waterways;
(3) Location of Riparian Corridor and Habitat Assessment overlay districts based on OHW;
(4) Location of Significant Wetland overlay district based on the LWI or DSL-approved delineation or determination;
(5) The 100-year flood boundary and elevation;
(6) Existing vegetative cover and species composition;
(7) Existing and proposed site improvements;
(8) How the requirements of the applicable review standards in ADC 6.310 will be met; and
(9) A mitigation plan if required per ADC 6.400-6.410.
6.305 Residential Development Standards. Applications subject to natural resource review that are proposing new residential dwelling units or the creation of residential lots or parcels on properties that include one or more Significant Natural Resource overlay districts must comply with either the clear and objective standard in subsection (1) or the discretionary standard in subsection (2), below. As used in these subsections, the proposed division of land with a Significant Natural Resource overlay district on it is considered development “within a Significant Natural resource overlay district.”
(1) Clear and objective standard. No development, including creation of lots or parcels, is permitted within a Significant Natural Resource overlay district. An application to develop property that has one or more Significant Natural Resource overlay districts on it, but where no development is proposed within the boundaries of a Natural Resource Overlay will be processed as otherwise required in this Code.
(2) Alternative review. Residential development is permitted within a Significant Natural Resource overlay district subject to the provisions of the applicable overlay district(s) and the standards in Sections 6.300 through 6.460. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
6.310 Natural Resource Impact Review Standards.
A. General Requirements for Significant Natural Resource overlay districts. A proposed activity will not be approved unless all of the following are true:
(1) The proposed activity is allowed under the requirements of the base zone.
(2) There are no other reasonably feasible options or locations outside the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts for the proposed activity on the subject parcel.
(3) The proposed activity is designed, located and constructed to minimize excavation, grading, structures, impervious surfaces, loss of native vegetation, erosion, and adverse hydrological impacts on water resources. All activities are located as far from the water resources, and use as little of the surface area of the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts, to the extent reasonably feasible.
(4) Any proposed impacts to significant natural resources will be mitigated per the standards in Sections 6.400 and 6.410.
(5) Any applicable local, state, and federal permits are secured.
(6) The additional requirements of ADC 6.310 (B) will be met.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 24 January 1, 2021
B. Additional Requirements, Limitations, and Exceptions for Specific Activities in Riparian Corridor and Significant Wetland overlay districts. In addition to the general requirements listed above, the following requirements, limitations, and exceptions apply to development activities within the Riparian Corridor and Significant Wetland overlay districts. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Land Divisions. In addition to the regulations in Article 11, land partially situated in one of the City’s natural resource districts can be divided only if there is sufficient land outside of any Significant Natural Resource overlay district to establish a development site area and/or separate a developed area from the natural resource areas. For the purposes of this section, for residential land divisions, “sufficient land” means a minimum of 2,000 square feet per proposed lot or parcel. Applicants may also elect to follow the Cluster Development standards for land divisions in Article 11. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Structures and Land Altering Activities. The placement of structures and other impervious surfaces, as well as grading, excavation, placement of fill, and vegetation removal, are prohibited. Exceptions may be made for the purposes identified in items a-f of this Section, provided they are necessary to accommodate an approved activity and comply with any stated requirements for the activity or use.
(a) Water-Related and Water-Dependent Uses. Development of water-related and water-dependent uses.
(b) Permanent Alteration Within the Riparian Corridor. Disturbance or development within the Riparian Corridor overlay district shall be allowed under the following circumstances:
(i) The resource is characterized as 'marginal' or 'degraded' using the standards found in 6.410(5).
(ii) Demonstration that equal or better protection will be ensured through riparian corridor restoration and enhancement within the remaining overlay district area per the mitigation requirements in Sections 6.400 and 6.410. If the site is encumbered by easements or rights-of-way that would preclude onsite restoration or enhancement, an "in-lieu of payment" may be made to the City in the amount equal to the cost of onsite mitigation.
Residentially zoned lots that were created prior to December 1, 2011, that are less than 20,000 square feet and can't be further subdivided are allowed to encroach up to 25 feet into the Riparian Corridor overlay district without the requirement for restoration or enhancement of the remaining 25 feet. The mitigation requirements in Section 6.400 still apply.
(iii) In no case shall the site improvements be any closer than 25 feet from the Ordinary High Water mark or upland edge of the wetland, unless the improvements are otherwise allowed or exempted per this Section of the Code.
(c) Vegetation Removal. Removal of live vegetation that is not exempt under 6.290(9) is only allowed to accommodate an approved use or development activity under this section of the Code.
(d) Private Construction of Public Non-Master Planned Transportation Facilities and Privately Owned Transportation Facilities. In addition to other City standards, the following standards shall apply to the location and construction of public non-master planned and/or private transportation facilities and structures, such as driveways, local streets, bridges, bridge crossing support structures, culverts, and pedestrian and bike paths. In addition to other City standards, the following standards shall apply to privately constructed transportation facilities and structures:
(i) The facility is designed to be the minimum width necessary to allow for safe passage of vehicles, bicycles and/or pedestrians, and to meet minimum width requirements.
(ii) Where reasonably feasible, crossings of significant natural resources shall be aligned to minimize impact area.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 25 January 1, 2021
(iii) The number of crossings is the minimum amount necessary to afford safe and efficient access.
(iv) The number of crossings is minimized where reasonably feasible through use and creation of shared access for abutting lots and access through easements for adjacent lots.
(v) Crossing structures have a natural bottom or other design that meets ODFW fish passage requirements.
(e) Private Construction of Public Non-Master Planned Utilities and Privately Owned Utilities. In addition to other City standards, the following standards shall apply to permitted crossing, trenching, or boring for the purpose of developing a corridor for public non-master planned utilities and private utilities, within or crossing parcels in Significant Natural Resource overlay districts, as well as any above-ground utility structures.
In addition to other City standards, the following standards shall apply to privately constructed utility projects:
(i) Boring under the waterway, directional drilling, or aerial crossing is preferable to trenching. If trenching is the only feasible alternative, it shall be conducted in a dry or dewatered area with stream flow diverted around the construction area to prevent turbidity.
(ii) Common trenches for private utilities, to the extent allowed by the building code, shall be required where reasonably feasible in order to minimize disturbance of the protected resource.
(iii) Topsoil and sod shall be conserved during trench construction or maintenance, and replaced on top of the trench. Side-casting and storage of excavated material prior to replacement on top of trench is permitted. Any side-cast material not placed back on top of the trench shall be removed and may not be stored in the Significant Natural Resource overlay district after the construction or maintenance work is completed.
(iv) Hydraulic impacts on protected resources are minimized.
(v) Where reasonably feasible, crossings of significant natural resources shall be aligned to minimize impact area.
(vi) Above-ground utilities that cause ground disturbance in the Significant Natural Resource overlay district and are not within an existing right-of-way or easement, and are not shown in an approved master plan, will only be allowed in limited circumstances, and if they meet the general requirements in 6.310(A).
(f) Minor or Major Variance. Development associated with an approved Minor or Major Variance. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
C. Activities within Habitat Assessment overlay district. A wildlife habitat assessment is required if proposed development exceeds the minimum thresholds in 6.290(10). If the wildlife habitat assessment finds evidence of habitat for either the northwestern pond turtle or the western painted turtle within the overlay district, the following standards apply:
(1) New development, expansion of existing development, landscaping and other ground disturbances shall be located outside of the designated turtle habitat areas as determined by the habitat assessment; or
(2) If impacts are approved, the development/use has been proposed in a manner that will minimize the impact of the development on wildlife habitat. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has reviewed and approved a mitigation plan for any impacts to the habitat area for the proposed development. Local mitigation is not required in addition to that required by ODFW or other state and federal agencies. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 26 January 1, 2021
6.400 Mitigation Standards. Mitigation is a way of compensating for adverse impacts to the functions and values of natural resources caused by development. In many cases, mitigation may result in resource area restoration or enhancement.
If a State or Federal agency has jurisdiction regarding development impacts within the Riparian Corridor and Significant Wetland overlay districts, and they require mitigation for those impacts, the City will not impose additional mitigation requirements over the same area. Those portions of development impacts not mitigated through a State or Federal agency will be subject to local mitigation requirements. Mitigation for impacts to turtle habitat in the Habitat Assessment overlay district will be solely managed by ODFW.
The need for mitigation, restoration, or enhancement will be determined during the Natural Resource Impact Review process. The Director may allow some degree of flexibility to the standards based on the specific location and level of impact.
(1) When Mitigation is Required: Mitigation will be required under the following circumstances:
(a) Removal of one or more native trees greater than 25 inches in circumference, which requires replacement per section (2)(c).
(b) Disturbance of more than 2,000 square feet of vegetated surface area. This level of impact will require a mitigation plan per 6.410.
(c) When a request is made to develop or impact the Riparian Corridor overlay district area per 6.310(B)(2)(b), a mitigation plan will be required for enhancement of the remaining area per 6.410.
(2) Local Mitigation Standards:
(a) On-site enhancement is required when the 50-foot area of the Riparian Corridor overlay district is impacted per 6.310(B)(2)(b), unless the activity is otherwise exempted per this section of the Code.
(b) For other mitigation options, on-site mitigation shall occur within the relevant Significant Resource overlay district as close to the impact area as reasonably feasible, taking into consideration the existing natural and human-made features of the site.
If on-site mitigation is not reasonably feasible, off-site mitigation shall be permitted in other locations inside the city in the following priority order:
(i) Within the impacted Significant Resource overlay district in the same drainage system; or
(ii) Outside the impacted Significant Resource overlay district, but within 100 feet of a Significant Resource overlay district in the same drainage system; or
(iii) Outside the same drainage system, but within a Significant Resource overlay district.
(c) Tree replacement requires planting a minimum 1½-inch caliper healthy and well-branched native deciduous tree or a 5-6 foot tall native evergreen tree for each tree removed. The replanted tree shall be of a species that will eventually equal or exceed the removed tree in size if appropriate for the new location.
(d) Mitigation for impacts shall require a mitigation area ratio of 1:1; however if the quality of the resource is enhanced or restored per 6.410(5) the ratio may be lowered with Director approval.
(e) Planting densities and species composition shall be consistent with native wetland and riparian area plant communities currently or historically found in the drainage basin. Use of a reference site as guidance for developing a revegetation plan is recommended.
(f) Any mitigation requirements resulting from a proposed land division, shall require a mitigation plan concurrent with the land division process.
6.410 Local Mitigation Plan. When a local mitigation plan for impact to a significant natural resource is proposed or required as part of a development application, the applicant shall submit a mitigation plan prepared by a qualified professional with demonstrated experience in developing mitigation plans for the specific impacted resource.
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 27 January 1, 2021
(1) The mitigation plan shall document the location of the impact, the existing conditions of the resource prior to impact, presence of invasive species, the location of the proposed mitigation area, a detailed planting plan of the proposed mitigation area with species and density, and a narrative describing how the resource will be replaced, and how debris and invasive species will be removed.
(2) The mitigation plan shall comply with all applicable State and Federal regulations, in addition to the City's standards. The City may approve a development but shall not issue a building permit until all required State and Federal permit approvals have been granted and copies of those approvals have been submitted to the City.
(3) The applicant or property owner of a development subject to an approved mitigation plan shall provide assurance of completion in the form of a surety or performance bond, cash, negotiable security deposit, letter of credit, or other guarantees approved by the City Attorney that is equal to 120% of the value of the improvements installed pursuant to the plan for a 2-year period. The assurance shall be in place before the issuance of development permits to ensure the success of mitigation improvements and the survival of the plants. The assurance will be released by the City upon receiving satisfactory proof that the mitigation measures have been successfully implemented per (4) below. If mitigation improvements fail during the 2-year period, the assurance shall both be forfeited and used by the City to correct the problem pursuant to the approved mitigation plan, or the bond period may be extended for a 2½-year period with Director's approval to allow for another replanting strategy. When the City of Albany, or another unit of government, is the applicant, it must adhere to the standards in this section, but an assurance is not required.
(4) A report on the survival and health of planted vegetation, and the status of invasive species, shall be performed by a qualified professional at the expense of the applicant, and will be provided to the Community Development Department between 18 and 24 months from the initial planting that describes the health of all vegetation and shows pictures of the vegetation. The City may arrange an on-site inspection to verify information contained in the report. If the survival rate for tree and shrub species is below 80%, a replanting strategy shall be prepared, approved, and executed within 6 months of the report, with a subsequent report on survival provided to the Department between 12 and 18 months from the time of the second planting. At this point, if the survival rate is still below 80%, the bond described in (3) will either be forfeited or extended for a 2½-year period with Director's approval. If at the end of the extension period, the survival rate is still less than 80%, the bond will be forfeited.
(5) Table 6.410-1 below summarizes the quality levels, mitigation requirements and expected condition of the significant wetlands and riparian corridor areas after successful completion of the mitigation plan; ODFW will solely determine the requirements for mitigation of significant wildlife habitat.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 28 January 1, 2021
TABLE 6.410-1
Quality levels, mitigation requirements and expected condition of the significant wetlands and riparian corridor areas after successful completion of the mitigation plan.
Existing Resource Quality
Mitigation Requirements/Expected Future Resource Quality
Waterways & Significant Wetlands (riparian and isolated)
Good Quality: Little enhancement potential per the Local Wetland Inventory assessment or other wetland assessment by a qualified professional. City staff will verify existing condition.
Preserve or enhance per approved mitigation plan; Invasive species are removed and are not persisting.
Marginal Quality: Moderate enhancement potential per the Local Wetland Inventory assessment or other wetland assessment by a qualified professional. City staff will verify existing condition.
Restore to Good Quality per approved mitigation plan; Invasive species are removed and are not persisting.
Degraded Quality: High enhancement potential per the Local Wetland Inventory assessment or other wetland assessment by a qualified professional; Farmed or otherwise converted. City staff will verify existing condition.
Enhance to at least Marginal Quality; A smaller ratio of 1.0 (impact area) to 0.5 (mitigation area) may be allowed for restoration to Good Quality.
Riparian Corridor Overlay
Good Quality: Combination of native trees, shrubs, and groundcover are at least 80% of the overlay area, and there will be more than 50% tree canopy coverage at maturity.
Preserve or enhance per approved mitigation plan; Invasive species are removed and are not persisting.
Marginal Quality: Combination of native trees, shrubs, and groundcover are at least 80% of the overlay area, and there will be 25%-50% tree canopy coverage at maturity.
Restore to Good Quality with an approved plan (mature overlay area coverage will be estimated); Invasive species are removed and are not persisting;
Degraded Quality: Less vegetation and canopy coverage than Marginal Quality, and/or greater than 10% coverage of any non-native species.
Enhance to at least Marginal Quality with an approved plan (mature overlay area coverage will be estimated); A smaller ratio of 1.0 (impact area) to 0.5 (mitigation area) may be allowed for restoration to Good Quality.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
6.420 Native Plant List. The City will establish a native plant list, which includes plants that were historically found in the area at the time of European contact. If a modification is requested, the Director will determine if the modification is warranted based on consultation with knowledgeable people with backgrounds in botany or landscape architecture, as well as scientific documents. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
6.430 District Boundary Corrections and Refinements. The boundaries for the Significant Natural overlay districts are approximate.
The boundaries of the Significant Wetland overlay district are based on the locations of the significant wetlands identified in the City's Local Wetland Inventory, as reflected in Plate 6 of the Comprehensive Plan. The Riparian Corridor overlay and Habitat Assessment overlay districts were estimated by measuring from the edge of the water, which is based on an aerial photograph.
District boundary corrections and refinements will be processed administratively. District corrections will be made to correct map errors, such as when the map does not properly reflect the Local Wetland Inventory data. A district boundary refinement is an alteration made, based on professional analyses, to refine the boundary of the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts. District refinements must be made in accordance with the provisions in this code to determine the location and extent of the following:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 29 January 1, 2021
• Riparian Corridor overlay districts as measured from the Ordinary High Water (OHW) mark of rivers, lakes, and streams, and from the upland edge of adjacent significant wetlands. If a DSL-approved wetland delineation or determination results in a change to the boundary of the significant wetland adjacent to the riparian corridor, the Riparian Corridor overlay boundary will be adjusted accordingly.
• Habitat Assessment overlay districts as measured from the OHW mark of East and West Thornton Lakes. If an ODFW-approved habitat assessment results in a change to the boundary of the habitat area, the habitat assessment overlay boundary will be adjusted accordingly.
• Ordinary High Water Mark: Changes to the Riparian Corridor or Habitat Assessment overlay boundaries must be based on the location of the OHW that includes supporting information submitted by a qualified professional hydrologist or professional land surveyor.
• Significant Wetlands overlay district by delineations of significant wetlands that are approved by the DSL or by onsite wetland determinations by DSL when delineations are not needed for other purposes. DSL-approved delineations or determinations shall be required when development is proposed within 30 feet of the overlay district and will supersede the LWI mapping.
6.440 District Amendments. To amend the resource inventories or the program to protect significant natural resources on land within any of the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts requires Comprehensive Plan and Development Code amendments per the requirements in Article 2. In all instances the amendments must be based on new site-specific information. The proposed amendments are reviewed by the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD), with consultation from other State agencies such as ODFW or DSL.
6.450 Minor Variances and Major Variances. The City may grant Minor Variances or Major Variances to the standards in the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts in order to avoid rendering a property not buildable through application of this ordinance. Requests that cannot meet the provisions and review criteria for Minor Variances will be processed as a Major Variance. Minor Variance applications will be processed through the Type I-L land use process using the criteria in Section 6.450(2) below. Major Variance applications will be processed through the Type II process using the criteria in Section 2.690. The proposed activity or use must be allowed within the base zoning district in order to be considered for a Minor or Major Variance.
(1) General Standard. In evaluating any Minor or Major Variance request, the decision maker may require the applicant to incorporate design options to reduce the impact on the protected resource. These may include, without limitation, multi-story construction, alternate siting of structures, limiting the length of impervious driveway and other surfaces, and maximizing the use of native landscape materials.
(2) Minor Variances. In order for the Director to approve a Minor Variance application, the applicant shall demonstrate that all the following criteria are fully satisfied:
(a) It is an existing legal lot and there is insufficient space outside the resource area to construct a use permitted in the underlying zoning district.
(b) The development site area, including all structures and impervious surfaces, encroaches on the resource area a total of 3,000 square feet or less.
(c) The Minor Variance is the minimum necessary to allow a permitted use or achieve the minimum buildable area outlined above, while at the same time minimizing disturbance to the significant natural resources. The Director may require modifications to site development standards to enable avoidance of the resource.
(d) The encroachment does not result in a new structure or impervious surface being located closer than 25 feet from the Ordinary High Water mark. Bridges are an exception to this requirement.
(3) Major Variances. For any existing lot or parcel whose hardship cannot be alleviated with a Minor Variance application, the property owner may apply for a Major Variance per Section 2.690.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 6 6 - 30 January 1, 2021
6.460 Compliance with State and Federal Regulations. Activities wholly or partially within the Significant Natural Resource Overlay district(s) are subject to all applicable federal and state regulations. The following regulations commonly apply within the resource areas. (Note: other regulations not listed may also apply; it is the property owner's responsibility to adhere to all applicable State and Federal regulations):
(1) Oregon Department of State Lands permit requirements under the Removal-Fill Law.
(2) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit for fill activities as required under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
(3) Department of Environmental Quality permit requirements for stormwater under the Clean Water Act and state water quality regulations.
(4) Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations may apply to development activities that could impact one of the sensitive, threatened, critical, or endangered species indigenous to the region.
(5) The federal Endangered Species Act prohibits any action that causes a "taking" of any listed species of endangered fish or wildlife.
(6) The federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act prohibits taking, harming or moving any migratory bird, nest, or egg.
6.470 Violations. Activities within Significant Natural Resource Overlay districts not authorized under this Article are unlawful. The City shall seek compliance with the requirements of this Article and the resolution of violations through the procedures below. These procedures are not exclusive; may be exercised singly, simultaneously, or cumulatively; may be combined with any other remedies authorized under law; and may be exercised in any order.
(1) Voluntary cooperation to resolve violations is the preferred enforcement procedure when appropriate to the circumstances. Violations causing ongoing degradation of natural resources or repeated violations by the same individual, firm or corporation are not appropriate for voluntary enforcement procedures.
(2) Natural resource restoration shall be required for violations that result in unauthorized construction, grading, excavation, placement of fill material, or removal of native vegetation in a Significant Natural Resource Overlay district. The purpose of the restoration requirements shall be to mitigate impacts to vegetation, soils and hydrology and may include vegetation planting, fill removal, backfilling of excavated areas, restoration of ground surface contours, restoration of hydrological processes or other actions. Restoration recommendations shall be solicited from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Linn or Benton County Soil and Water Conservation Districts.
(3) Violations involving placement of fill material, excavation, grading or alteration of material within a stream or in a wetland shall be reported to the DSL and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in addition to any local actions taken per this section of the code.

DESIGNATION, RE-RATING OR REMOVAL OF HISTORIC LANDMARKS AND DISTRICTS
7.030 Purpose. The designation of historic landmarks allows the City to formally recognize, rate, and protect its historic and architectural resources. The Local Historic Inventory identifies buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts of historical importance or architectural significance that are considered exemplary of their time and style. The regulation of designated and rated historic landmarks provides a means to review proposed changes and encourage the preservation of historical or architectural values. Periodically it may be necessary to re-rate or remove the designation of a historic landmark to reflect changing conditions, community values or needs. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.035 Initiation. The process for designating or removing a landmark or historic district may be initiated by the City Council, the Landmarks Commission, or by any other interested person. Initiations by the Landmarks Commission are made without prejudice towards the outcome. At the time of initiation, the Community Development Director shall provide the property owner and applicant with information regarding the benefits and obligations of designation. No historic resource shall be designated as a landmark without the written consent of the owner, or in the case of multiple ownership, a majority of the owners. Removal of properties from the National Register of Historic Places requires review and approval by the State Historic Preservation Office and State Advisory Committee.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.040 Procedure.
(1) Designation. Requests for designations of historic landmarks and districts are reviewed through the Type IV legislative or quasi-judicial procedure. The process is legislative when it affects a large number of persons or properties. The Landmarks Commission replaces the Planning Commission as the initial review body. The City Council makes the final determination of historic designation.
(2) Amendment to Existing Historic Districts. Changes or additions to the period of significance statement, property rating structure, or boundaries of an existing historic district shall be reviewed under the Type IV legislative process. The Landmarks Commission replaces the Planning Commission as the initial review body. The City Council reviews and adopts any amendments to the historic districts.
(3) Local Historic Inventory Removal. Only landmarks outside the National Register Historic Districts that are not listed on the National Register of Historic Places individually are eligible for removal from the Local Historic Inventory. The Director may delete any demolished or removed historic structure outside the historic districts from the Local Historic Inventory through the Type I procedure. In the event a National Register building or structure is demolished or moved, an application shall be made to the State Historic Preservation Office to remove and/or redesignate the property from the National Register.
(4) Individual Property Re-Rating. The Landmarks Commission shall review requests for re-rating of individual properties. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.050 Application Contents. An application for designation of a landmark must include the following information:
(1) A written description of the boundaries of the proposed district or the location of the proposed landmark or property to be evaluated.
(2) A map illustrating the boundaries of the proposed district or the location of the proposed landmark or the property to be evaluated.
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 6 January 1, 2021
(3) A statement explaining the following:
(a) The reason(s) why the proposed district, landmark, or property should be designated.
(b) The reason(s) why the proposed boundaries of the proposed district are appropriate for designation.
(c) The potential impact, if any, that designation of the proposed district or landmark would have on the owners, surrounding residents, or other property owners in the area.
7.060 Submission of Application. Applications must be submitted at least 35 days in advance of the next regularly scheduled public meeting of the Landmarks Commission unless waived by the Director when legal notice can otherwise be achieved. All documents or evidence relied upon by the applicant shall be submitted to the Planning Division and made available to the public at least 20 days prior to the public hearing (10 days before the first evidentiary hearing if two or more evidentiary hearings are required). If additional documents, evidence or written materials are provided in support of a quasi-judicial application less than 20 days (10 days before the first evidentiary hearing if two or more evidentiary hearings are required) prior to the public hearing, any party shall be entitled to a continuance of the hearing. Such a continuance shall not be subject to the limitations of ORS 227.178. [Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.070 Designation Review Criteria. In addition to being at least fifty years of age, the review bodies must find that one of the following criteria has been met in order to approve a proposed landmark or district:
(1) The proposed landmark or district has historic significance because:
(a) There is an association with the life or activities of a person, group, organization, or institution that has made a significant contribution to the city, county, state, or nation;

(f) It is a visual landmark.
(3) The proposed landmark or district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.080 Re-Rating or Removal Review Criteria. The review body must find that one of the following criteria is met in order to approve a re-rating or remove a landmark from the Local Historic Inventory:
(1) The inventory was in error.
(2) Additional research has uncovered an association with a person, group, organization, institution or events that have made a significant contribution to the city, county, state or nation or additional research has been compiled regarding the architectural significance of a structure or style.
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 7 January 1, 2021
(3) Alterations to the structure have caused it to more closely approximate the historical character, appearance, or material composition of the original structure.
(4) Alterations to the structure have removed distinguishing features or otherwise altered the exterior such that the existing rating is no longer justified.
(5) The reasons for designating the historic landmark no longer apply. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.090 Decision. All decisions, whether to approve or deny the request, must specify the basis for the decision.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
HISTORIC REVIEW OF EXTERIOR ALTERATIONS GENERALLY
7.100 Purpose. The purpose of reviewing alterations to historic landmarks is to encourage the preservation of characteristics that led to their designation as historic landmarks. Review is required for exterior alterations or additions to buildings or structures classified as historic contributing and historic non-contributing within the historic districts, and to landmarks outside the districts. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.110 Exemptions from Review. Historic review is not required for buildings or structures originally constructed after 1945 or for changes to paint color to any home or structure.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
7.120 Procedure. A request for an exterior alteration is reviewed and processed by either the Community Development Director or the Landmarks Commission. The Landmarks Commission replaces the Hearings Board or Planning Commission as the review body.
Any exterior or interior alteration to buildings participating in Oregon’s Special Assessment of Historic Property Program will also require review and approval by the State Historic Preservation Office.
(1) The Director will approve residential alteration requests if one of the following criteria is met:
(a) There is no change in historic character, appearance, or material composition from the existing structure.
(b) The proposed alteration materially duplicates the affected exterior building features as determined from an early photograph, original building plans, or other evidence of original building features.
(c) The proposed alteration is not visible from the street.
(2) For all other requests, the Landmarks Commission will review and process the alteration proposal. The applicant and adjoining property owners within 100 feet will receive notification of the Landmarks Commission public hearing on the proposal. The Landmarks Commission will accept written and verbal testimony on the proposal. For buildings on the Special Assessment of Historic Property Program, the Landmarks Commission decision will be forwarded to the State Historic Preservation Office. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.130 Relationship to Other Land Use Reviews. Projects that require historic review may also require other land use reviews. If other reviews are required, the review procedures may be handled concurrently.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.140 Application Contents. Every application for an exterior alteration approval shall include information (e.g. drawings, photographs) which clearly shows the intended alteration and resulting appearance change of the structure. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.150 Exterior Alteration Review Criteria. For applications other than for the use of substitute materials, the review body must find that one of the following criteria has been met in order to approve an alteration request:
[Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 8 January 1, 2021
(1) The proposed alteration will cause the structure to more closely approximate the historical character, appearance or material composition of the original structure than the existing structure, or
(2) The proposed alteration is compatible with the historic characteristics of the area and with the existing structure in massing, size, scale, materials and architectural features.
The review criteria for the use of substitute siding, windows and trim shall be as found in ADC 7.170-7.225. [Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
The review body will use the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards of Rehabilitation (listed below) as guidelines in determining whether the proposed alteration meets the review criteria.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.160 The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation. The following standards are to be applied to rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility.
(1) A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.
(2) The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic material or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
(3) Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.
(4) Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
(5) Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
(6) Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.
(7) Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic material shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.
(8) Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
(9) New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.
(10) New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 9 January 1, 2021
7.165 Decisions/Appeals. All decisions must specify the basis for the decision. Landmarks Commission decisions may be appealed to the Albany City Council. Decisions of the Community Development Director may be appealed to the Landmarks Commission.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5488, 7/11/01, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
HISTORIC REVIEW OF SUBSTITUTE MATERIALS USED FOR SIDING, WINDOWS & TRIM
7.170 Purpose. The purpose of reviewing the use of substitute materials is to encourage the preservation of characteristics and materials of the historic architectural style. Review is required for the application of substitute materials for siding, windows and trim on buildings or structures originally constructed before 1946 and on the Local Historic Inventory. If these sections (7.170-7.225) conflict with other provisions of the Code relative to substitute materials to be used for siding, windows and trim, this section will control. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
7.180 Procedure. Review of a request for the use of substitute materials is reviewed and processed by the Landmarks Commission. The Landmarks Commission replaces the Hearings Board or Planning Commission as the review body.
The applicant and adjoining property owners within 100 feet will receive notification of the Landmarks Commission meeting on the proposal. The Landmarks Commission shall accept written and verbal testimony on the proposal.
The use of substitute materials on buildings participating in Oregon’s Special Assessment of Historic Property Program will also require review and approval by the State Historic Preservation Office. The Landmarks Commission decision will be forwarded to the State Historic Preservation Office.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
7.185 Relationship to Other Land Use Reviews. Projects that require an historic review may also require other land use reviews. If other reviews are required, the review procedures may be handled concurrently.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
7.190 Application Contents. Applications for the use of substitute materials for historic contributing and historic non-contributing structures and for Landmarks must include information (e.g. photographs) that clearly shows the current condition of the area intended to be altered. The types of substitute materials and proposed dimensions must be described. The application must also include the proposed methods of application of substitute materials and preservation of the original materials and architectural elements. The City may require a pest and dry rot inspection if necessary, and a report made and prepared by an entity whose primary business is pest and dry rot inspection or repair. The report must assess the condition of the structure. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
7.200 Eligibility for the Use of Substitute Materials. The City of Albany interprets the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation on compatibility to allow substitute siding and windows only under the following conditions:
(1) The building or structure is rated historic non-contributing OR, in the case of historic contributing buildings or structures, the existing siding, windows or trim is so deteriorated or damaged that it cannot be repaired and finding materials that would match the original siding, windows or trim is cost prohibitive. [Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
Any application for the use of substitute siding, windows and/or trim will be decided on a case-by-case basis. The prior existence of substitute siding and/or trim on the historic buildings on the Local Historic Inventory will not be considered a factor in determining any application for further use of said materials.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00]
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 10 January 1, 2021
7.210 Design and Application Criteria for Substitute Materials. For buildings or structures rated historic contributing or historic non-contributing, the application for the use of substitute materials on siding, windows or trim must follow these guidelines:
(1) The proposed substitute materials must approximate in placement, profile, size, proportion, and general appearance the existing siding, windows or trim.
(2) Substitute siding, windows and trim must be installed in a manner that maximizes the ability of a future property owner to remove the substitute materials and restore the structure to its original condition using traditional materials.
(3) The proposed material must be finished in a color appropriate to the age and style of the house, and the character of both the streetscape and the overall district. The proposed siding or trim must not be grained to resemble wood.
(4) The proposed siding, windows or trim must not damage, destroy, or otherwise affect decorative or character-defining features of the building. Unusual examples of historic siding, windows and/or trim may not be covered or replaced with substitute materials.
(5) The covering of existing historic wood window or door trim with substitute trim will not be allowed if the historic trim can be reasonably repaired. Repairs may be made with fiberglass or epoxy materials to bring the surface to the original profile, which can then be finished, like the original material.
(6) Substitute siding or trim may not be applied over historic brick, stone, stucco, or other masonry surfaces;
For the application of substitute siding and trim only:
(7) The supporting framing that may be rotted or otherwise found unfit for continued support shall be replaced in kind with new material.
(8) The interior surface of the exterior wall shall receive a vapor barrier to prevent vapor transmission from the interior spaces.
(9) Walls to receive the proposed siding shall be insulated and ventilated from the exterior to eliminate any interior condensation that may occur.
(10) Sheathing of an adequate nature shall be applied to support the proposed siding material with the determination of adequacy to be at the discretion of the planning staff.
(11) The proposed siding shall be placed in the same direction as the historic siding.
(12) The new trim shall be applied so as to discourage moisture infiltration and deterioration.
(13) The distance between the new trim and the new siding shall match the distance between the historic trim and the historic siding.
(14) A good faith effort shall be made to sell or donate any remaining historic material for architectural salvage to an appropriate business or non-profit organization that has an interest in historic building materials. [Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5488, 7/11/01]
7.220 Conditions of Approval. In approving an alteration request, the Landmarks Commission may attach conditions that are appropriate for the promotion and/or preservation of the historic or architectural integrity of the district, building or site. All conditions must relate to a review criterion.
[Ord. 5463, 9/13/00, Ord. 5945, 9/25/20]
Albany Development Code, Article 7 7 - 11 January 1, 2021
7.225 Decisions/Appeals. All decisions shall specify the basis for the decision. Landmarks Commission decisions may be appealed to the Albany City Council. Decisions of the Community Development Director may be appealed to the Landmarks Commission.

ARTICLE 8
DESIGN STANDARDS
8.000 Overview. The purpose of this Article is to establish additional standards for certain uses. These standards are intended to reduce adverse effects on surrounding property owners and the general public, to create a business environment that is safe and comfortable, to further energy conservation efforts within the City, to enhance the environment for walking, cycling, and mass transit use, and to ensure that high-quality development is maintained throughout Albany.
An applicant for a development that does not meet the design standards in Article 8 may apply for one or more Adjustments pursuant to ADC 2.060-2.080 except that Adjustments are not permitted to the standards in Section 8.500 (Telecommunication Facilities) and Section 8.600 through 8.620 (Supplemental Design Standards for the Oak Creek Transition Area).
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
The following list is a summary of the topics covered in this article.
■ Single-Family Homes
■ Multiple Family Development
■ Commercial and Institutional Site Design
■ Supplemental Standards in Village Centers
■ Telecommunications Facilities
■ Supplemental Design Standards for the Oak Creek Transition Area
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00, Ord. 5801, 2/13/13; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
Section 8.100 repealed by Ordinance 5947, 1/01/21.
SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES
8.110 Applicability.
(1) The standards of ADC Sections 8.110 through 8.160 apply to all new single-family detached units, manufactured homes, two-family units (duplexes), two detached primary units, and single-family attached units on individual lots in all zones that allow single-family housing, except as otherwise noted. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) In addition, except as otherwise noted, the standards of ADC Sections 8.110 through 8.160 apply to multiple-family units with individual driveways permitted pursuant to ADC 12.100(2) that are located in the WF, CB, or DMU zone, or in the HD zone in a building where ground-floor residential use is permitted pursuant to ADC 5.070(17). [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) These standards do not apply to detached accessory dwelling units, existing structures, new additions to existing structures, or to manufactured home parks. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5949, 1/01/21]
(4) Development on flag lots or on lots that slope up or down from the street with an average slope of 20 percent or more is exempt from these standards. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.120 Relationship to Historic Overlay Districts. For property inside the Historic Overlay Districts and properties designated as Historic Landmarks, the provisions in Article 7 also apply. For development subject to historic review under Article 7, the review body may grant flexibility in meeting any of the design standards where necessary to achieve historic compatibility.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 2 January 1, 2021
8.130 Home Orientation. The purpose of these standards is to create pedestrian-friendly, sociable, safe, and attractive single-family neighborhoods through human-scale design. By ensuring that the pedestrian entrance is visible or clearly identifiable from the street, these standards enhance public safety for residents and visitors and provide opportunities for community interaction. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) At least one main entrance of each new home shall be within eight feet of the longest street-facing wall of the dwelling unit (excluding the garage); and either: [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) Face the street (see Figure 8.130-1);
(b) Be at an angle of up to 45 degrees from the street; or
(c) Open onto a porch (see Figure 8.130-2). The porch must:

Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 3 January 1, 2021
8.133 Street-Facing Windows. The purpose of these standards is to create pedestrian-friendly, sociable, safe, and attractive neighborhoods. The standards enhance public safety by allowing people to survey their neighborhood from inside their residences; and also provide a more pleasant pedestrian environment by preventing large expanses of blank facades along streets. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) At least 15 percent of the area of each façade that faces a street lot line must be windows or main pedestrian entrance doors. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) All windows on a street-facing façade, including windows in garage and pedestrian doors, may be counted toward meeting this standard
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) For a pedestrian door to count toward meeting this standard, it must be the main entrance and face the street. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(4) For a corner lot, only one side of the unit must meet this standard.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.140 Additional Standards for Infill and Redevelopment. The purpose of these standards are to preserve continuity in neighborhood appearance so that new homes fit in with the existing homes in the neighborhood in terms of features such as setbacks, height, and garages. These standards only apply to proposals for infill development in residential zoning districts that allow single-family housing.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following terms are defined.
(a) “Comparable Dwelling” means an existing detached single-family dwelling (including manufactured dwellings), an attached single-family dwelling, or a duplex that is located on a comparable lot as defined below.
(b) “Comparable Lot” means a vacant or developed lot within a residential zoning district that allows detached single-family dwellings and that is not separated from the subject site by public right-of-way. Vacant lots smaller than one-fourth (1/4) the minimum lot size are not included within the definition of “comparable lots.”
(c) “Subject Site” means a property within a residential zoning district that allows detached single-family dwellings that is the site of a proposed new detached single-family dwelling (including manufactured dwellings), an attached single-family dwelling or a duplex. Subject sites include both vacant sites and those sites where a dwelling was, or will be, removed to allow for the new development. Sites larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone are not included within the definition of “subject site.” [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Determining whether a proposal is “infill development.” To determine whether the proposed development on the subject site is infill development (see example in Figure 8.140-1):
(a) Identify the total number of comparable lots that abut the subject site (i.e., share a common property line with the subject site, including those that touch at the corners).
(b) Identify the number of comparable lots abutting the subject site with comparable dwellings, excluding those lots that are larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone.
(c) If the number of lots with comparable dwellings identified in subsection (2)(b) is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the total number of comparable lots identified in subsection (2)(a), then the proposal is “infill development” and subject to the standards of subsections (3) through (6), below. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 4 January 1, 2021
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Submittal Requirements. At the time of application for a building permit, an applicant for infill development shall submit a vicinity/site plan that demonstrates how the proposed infill development on the subject site complies with standards in subsections (4) through (6) below. The vicinity/site plan must show the following for comparable lots: lot lines, footprints of dwellings, garages and carports, and the direction buildings are facing. Setbacks from the street shall be noted. Building heights must also be noted for those comparable dwellings used to demonstrate compliance with the infill height requirements in standard (6). [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) Minimum and Maximum Front Setbacks. The minimum and maximum front setbacks of an infill development are based on an evaluation of comparable dwellings that meet the following criteria (see example Figure 8.140-2):
• All or a portion of the comparable dwelling’s lot is within 150 feet of the subject site;
• The comparable dwelling’s lot has frontage on the same street as the subject site and is not a flag lot;
• The comparable dwelling’s lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone; and,
• The primary entrance of the comparable dwelling is oriented toward the same street as the proposed dwelling.
If only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria, the subject site is exempt from the infill setback standards in this subsection.
FIGURE 8.140-2. Infill development setbacks – Identifying comparable dwellings (example)
In this example, minimum and maximum front setback on the subject site are determined based on comparable dwellings on Lots “2,” “4,” and “6.”
Lot “1” is more than 150 feet from the subject site and the primary entrance of the dwelling on Lot “7” is oriented to a different street; therefore, the comparable dwellings on Lots “1” and “7” are not in the analysis.
FIGURE 8.140-1. Determining whether a proposal is “infill development” (example)
In this example, four out of five comparable lots that abut the subject site have comparable dwellings (4 / 5 = 80%); therefore, the proposal in this example is infill development.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 5 January 1, 2021
(a) Infill development is subject to the minimum and maximum setback standards in Table 8.140-1 (see example in Figure 8.140-3). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no development shall be located such that it violates minimum setback standards for the zoning district.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
TABLE 8.140-1: Minimum and Maximum Setback Standards for Infill Development Proposed Infill Development Minimum Setback Maximum Setback
Dwelling
No more than 5 feet closer to the front property line than the closest comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 8.140(4)
No more than 5 feet farther from the front property line than the farthest comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 8.140(4)
Garage or Carport
No more than 5 feet closer to the front property line than the closest garage or carport of a comparable dwelling on a comparable lot meeting the criteria in 8.140(4)
None
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
FIGURE 8.140-3. Infill development setbacks –Applying the setback standards (example)
Minimum setback - dwelling. Of the comparable dwellings on Lots “2,” “4,” and “6,” the dwelling on Lot “4” is the closest to its front property line; therefore, a dwelling on the subject site can be no closer to its front property line than five feet closer than the dwelling on Lot “4,” while still meeting the minimum setbacks for the zone.
Maximum setback - dwelling. Of the dwellings on Lots “2,” “4,” and “6,” the dwelling on Lot “2” is the farthest from its front property line; therefore, a dwelling on the subject site can be no farther from its front property line than five feet farther than the dwelling on Lot “2,” while still meeting the minimum setbacks for the zone.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 6 January 1, 2021
(5) Required Garage or Carport. Infill development may be required to have a garage or carport based on elevation of comparable dwellings that meet the following criteria (see example in Figure 8.140-4):
• All or a portion of the comparable dwelling’s lot is within 150 feet of the subject site;
• The comparable dwelling’s lot has frontage on the same street; and,
• The comparable dwelling’s lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone.
If only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria, the subject site is exempt from the infill garage and carport standards in this subsection.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(a) A proposed infill development requires a garage or carport as specified in Table 8.140-2 (see example in Figure 8.140-5). [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
TABLE 8.140-2: Infill Garage and Carport Requirements
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(b) The garage or carport may be attached or detached from the dwelling.
(c) The garage or carport’s exterior walls and roof shall not be constructed of the following materials: polyethylene, plastic, or vinyl (except vinyl residential siding), fabric, untreated wood (except cedar or redwood), corrugated metal, or sheet metal.
FIGURE 8.140-4. Infill Development garage / carport requirements – Identifying comparable lots (example)
In this example, garage / carport requirements for the subject site are determined based on an analysis of Lots “3,” “4,” “5,” and “6.”
Lots “1” and “2” are more than 150 feet from the subject site; therefore, these lots are not included in the analysis.
If more than 50 percent of the comparable dwellings on comparable lots meeting the criteria in subsection (5): Proposed infill development requires:
i. Have a garage
A garage
ii. Have a carport
A carport or garage
iii. Have either a carport or a garage
A carport or garage, provided that if (i) is true, a garage is required.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 7 January 1, 2021
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(6) Maximum Building Height. The maximum building height of an infill development is based on an evaluation of comparable dwellings on comparable lots that meet the following criteria:
• The comparable dwelling’s lot is abutting the subject site;
• The comparable dwelling’s lot has frontage on the same street; and
• The comparable dwelling’s lot is not larger than four times the minimum lot size of the applicable zone.
If only one comparable dwelling meets the above criteria, the subject site is exempt from the infill height standards in this subsection (see example in Figure 8.140-6).
(a) Maximum Building Height. A proposed dwelling on the subject site shall be no more than one story higher above ground than the lowest comparable dwelling that meets the criteria in subsection (6).
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no development shall be constructed such that it violates height standards for the zoning district.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
FIGURE 8.140-5. Infill Development – Applying the garage / carport requirements (example)
In this example, there are 4 comparable lots that meet the criteria in subsection (5). Of the 4 lots:
• 2 dwellings have garages (50%)
• 1 dwelling has a carport (25%)
• 3 dwellings have either a Carport or a Garage (75%)
Because more than 50% of the dwellings on comparable lots have a garage or carport (and more than 50% are not garages), the infill development on the subject site must have either a carport OR a garage.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 8 January 1, 2021
FIGURE 8.140-6. Infill Development height requirement (example)
In this example, maximum building height requirements for the subject site are determined based on an analysis of the dwellings on Lots “1” and “2.”
The dwelling on Lot “1” is two stories and the dwelling on Lot “2” is one story. Therefore, the proposed infill development on the subject site can be a maximum of two stories (i.e., one story higher above ground than the lowest dwelling).
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(7) Home Orientation. The main entrance of each home shall comply with home orientation standards in Section 8.130.
(8) Street-Facing Windows. The street-facing façade of each home shall comply with the window standards in Section 8.133. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.150 Parking and Access in the DMU, CB, HD, and WF Zoning Districts. These standards are intended to support a pedestrian-friendly street environment by minimizing the visual and safety impacts of driveways, parking, and garages; and to preserve on-street parking. See Article 12 for additional access standards.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) Driveway standards.
(a) Development sites abutting an alley: Vehicle access shall be via the alley rather than the public street. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(b) Development sites that do not abut an alley: Vehicle access shall meet i or ii, below.
i. Provide vehicle access from not more than one driveway to each public street abutting the development site. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
ii. Provide vehicle access to properties within the development site from shared or paired driveways with a minimum spacing between driveways of 25 feet (see Figure 8.150-1). The distance between driveways is measured along the front property line.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

[Ord. 5947,1/01/21]
(2) Parking location. Parking between the building façade and the front lot line is not permitted, except in driveways serving individual units (including shared or paired driveways), where permitted under (1), above. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(3) Garages. When parking is provided in a garage attached to the primary structure, and garage doors for motor vehicle ingress/egress face a street, the following standards must be met. A garage door is considered to be facing a street where the opening is parallel to, or within 45 degrees of, a front lot line. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) No more than one street-facing garage door for motor vehicle ingress/egress is permitted per dwelling unit. Each street-facing garage door for motor vehicle ingress/egress may not exceed 12 feet in width. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(b) See ADC Table 5.090-1 for garage setback standards. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) The standards of ADC Section 12.230 regarding design requirements abutting arterials do not apply. However, the standards of ADC 12.100 regarding limiting the location, width, and number of accesses to arterials do apply. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.160 Façade design and articulation in the DMU, CB, HD, and WF Zoning Districts. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) In order to promote buildings that provide visual interest and façade details that give a sense of quality and permanence, the front façade shall include a minimum of two of the architectural features listed below for each dwelling unit. For a corner lot, only one front façade of the dwelling unit(s) must meet these standards. Lots with frontage on First or Second Avenue shall meet this standard on the First or Second Avenue frontage. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]

MULTIPLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENT
8.200 Purpose. These sections are intended to set standards for quality designs in new multiple-family developments. Good design results when buildings are visually compatible with one another and adjacent neighborhoods and contribute to a residential neighborhood that is attractive, active, and safe.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.205 Applicability. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) Except as specified in ADC Section 8.110(2), the standards of ADC Sections 8.220 through 8.300 apply to the development of new Multiple-Family residential buildings (accessory buildings are exempt) and to the residential components of new buildings with Units Above or Attached to a Business (see ADC Section 22.310). Non-residential components of mixed-use development are subject to the Commercial and Institutional Site Design Standards of Sections 8.330 through 8.390. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Except as required to meet building code, fire code, or other regulations, expansions, and modifications to existing buildings and sites must not decrease conformance with these standards.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(3) Unless otherwise specified, these standards apply in all zoning districts [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.210 Relationship to Historic Overlay Districts. For property inside the Historic Overlay Districts and properties designated as Historic Landmarks, the provisions of Article 7 also apply. For development subject to historic review under Article 7, the review body may grant flexibility in meeting any of the design standards where necessary to achieve historic compatibility.

Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 13 January 1, 2021
ii. A credit toward the minimum common open space area required by Table 8.220-1 shall be granted to development projects providing high value outdoor recreation amenities. Provision of high value amenities is determined by the dollar amount spent on the amenities as a proportion of the overall project cost (including all construction costs except land cost). The credit is calculated as follows: if one percent (1%) of the overall project development cost is spent on outdoor recreation facilities, the minimum amount of required common open space shall be reduced by 10 percent. Further reductions in the minimum required common open space area shall be proportional to spending. For example, if 1.5 percent of a project’s cost is spent on outdoor recreation facilities, the minimum required common open space area shall be reduced by 15 percent. The total reduction shall not exceed 20 percent of the minimum required open space area. It is the responsibility of the applicant to document the overall project cost and the cost of the recreation amenities by providing cost estimates at the time of land use application.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Private Open Space. When required by Table 8.220-1, private open space shall be provided that meets the standards of this section. Development in the CB, HD, DMU, WF, LE, and MUR Zoning Districts and assisted-living and nursing home developments in all zoning districts are exempt from these requirements.

Section 8.250 repealed by Ordinance 5947, 1/01/21.
8.255 Façade design, articulation, and windows. The purpose of the standards in this section is to promote functional design and building details in new construction that provide visual interest, contribute to a high-quality living environment for residents, give a sense of quality and permanence, and enhance compatibility with the surrounding community.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Regulated façades. These standards apply to any façade that faces toward or within 45 degrees of a front lot line, except as otherwise specified below. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) For a corner or multiple frontage lots, only one front façade must meet these standards. A Willamette River setback line established pursuant to ADC 5.200 through 5.207 may be considered a front lot line for purposes of these standards. For lots with frontage on First or Second Avenue, the front façade facing First or Second Avenue shall meet these standards.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(b) Where there is more than one building on the site, these standards do not apply to any portion of a building that is separated from the front lot line by another building, based on a line perpendicular to the front lot line (see Figure 8.255-1). [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

8.260 Repealed by Ordinance 5947, 1/01/21.
8.265 Building Orientation and Entries in the HD, DMU, CB, and WF Zoning Districts. These standards are intended to promote building and site design that contributes positively to the overall streetscape by balancing connection to the street, transitions between public space and private space, and privacy. Providing appropriate transitions and privacy can make building occupants feel comfortable having windows uncovered and using outside space, which strengthens connections to the street and can help deter crime and vandalism. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) The main entrance to individual dwelling units on the ground floor and to lobbies for buildings with internally accessed units shall face a street, courtyard, or plaza (not a parking lot). For corner lots, the main entrance may face either street. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(2) In order to provide a transition between public space (the sidewalk) and private space (the dwelling) while maintaining a visual and physical connection to the street, entrances to individual dwelling units on the first story must be set back at least five feet from the front lot line and must be covered for a depth of at least three feet. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.270 Transition to Lower Density Uses.
(1) Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to create transitions between multiple-family developments and nearby, lower-density residential development, in order to reduce the impacts of the multiple-family development on lower-density development. These impacts may include incompatible building mass and scale, reduced privacy, and loss of solar access for the lower-density development. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Applicability. These standards apply to multiple-family housing in all zoning districts except HD, DMU, CB, and WF, which are subject to special interior setbacks in ADC Section 5.115. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Multiple-family buildings shall be set back at least one foot for each foot in building height from a shared property line, up to a maximum required setback of 30 feet, when the abutting lot sharing the property line meets criteria (a) or (b) below, or both. Building height is measured from the average grade to the top of the wall facing the property line or to the top of the highest window or door, whichever is higher.
(a) The abutting lot is in a residential single-family zoning district or in the HM zoning district.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 21 January 1, 2021
(b) The abutting lot has a pre-existing single-family home and is in a zoning district other than the NC, CC, RC, LI, HI, or IP. For the purposes of this section a “pre-existing single-family home” is one constructed prior to January 1, 2021. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) Active recreation areas, loading areas and dumpsters shall not be located between multiple-family buildings and abutting pre-existing single-family homes.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.280 Pedestrian Connections.
(1) Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to ensure that pedestrian circulation systems are designed to provide clear, identifiable, safe, and convenient connections within the multiple-family development and to adjacent uses and public streets/sidewalks. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Each multiple-family development shall contain an internal pedestrian circulation system that makes connections between individual units and parking areas, common open space areas, children’s play areas, and public rights-of-way. In order to ensure that connections are clear, easily identifiable, and safe, all pedestrian connections shall meet the following standards:
(a) Except as required for crosswalks, per ADC Section 8.280(4), where a walkway abuts a vehicle circulation area, it shall be physically separated by a curb that is raised at least six inches or by bollards.
(b) Walkways shall be constructed of concrete, asphalt, brick or masonry pavers, or other hard surface, and not less than five feet wide. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) All pedestrian ways shall comply with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(4) In order to provide safe crossings of streets, driveways, and parking areas, crossings shall be clearly marked with either contrasting paving materials (such as pavers, light-color concrete inlay between asphalt, or similar contrasting material) or reflective striping that emphasizes the crossing under low light and inclement weather conditions. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(5) Pedestrian connections shall be provided between the multiple-family development and all adjacent parks, schools, retail areas, bus stops, and other pedestrian ways. At least one connection shall be made to each adjacent street and sidewalk for every 200 linear feet of street frontage. Sites with less than 200 linear feet of street frontage shall provide at least one connection to the street and/or sidewalk. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.290 Vehicle Circulation System.
(1) Purpose. The standards of this section are intended to ensure that on-site vehicle circulation is clearly identifiable, safe, and pedestrian-friendly. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SITE DESIGN
8.310 Purpose. These sections are intended to set threshold standards for quality design in commercial and institutional development, and in the non-residential components of mixed-use development. Good design results in buildings that are visually compatible with one another and adjacent neighborhoods and contribute to an attractive, active, and safe built environment that facilitates easy pedestrian movement and a rich mixture of land uses. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 23 January 1, 2021
8.315 Applicability. These standards apply to the design of new development and to the expansion of existing developments where commercial and/or institutional uses, as defined in Article 22, are existing or proposed, including when such uses are part of a mixed-use development or live/work dwelling unit, with the following exceptions:
• Modifications to existing developments for which the Director has waived review under the provisions of ADC Section 1.105 are not subject to these standards.
• Utility substations and other utility facilities that do not have on-site personnel are not subject to these standards. However, telecommunication facilities are subject to other design standards in Article 8.
• Only the non-residential portion of a mixed-use development is subject to these standards. New residential Units Above or Attached to a Business are subject to Multiple-Family Design Standard as stated in Section 8.205. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Certain standards provide additional exemptions for modifications to existing sites or buildings. Unless otherwise specified, these standards apply in any zoning district except the Heavy Industrial (HI) Zoning District.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.320 Relationship to Historic Overlay Districts. For property inside the Historic Overlay Districts and properties designated as Historic Landmarks, the provisions of Article 7 also apply. For development subject to historic review under Article 7, the review body may grant flexibility in meeting any of the design standards where necessary to achieve historic compatibility.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
8.330 Entrance Orientation and Parking Location. The purpose of the entrance orientation and parking location standards is to help create an attractive streetscape and pleasant pedestrian environment that is conducive to walking, and to help further Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles such as natural surveillance of public spaces. These standards apply to new buildings (excluding accessory buildings) in all zoning districts except HD, DMU, CB, and WF. Development in HD, CB, DMU, and WF shall demonstrate appropriate building orientation through compliance with maximum front setback standards in ADC Section 5.120. Except as required to meet building code, fire code, or other regulations, expansions, and modifications to existing buildings and sites shall not decrease conformance with these standards. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Main Entrance. New buildings shall be oriented to existing or new public streets. Building orientation is demonstrated by placing buildings and their public entrances close to streets and providing pedestrians with a direct connection from the street sidewalk to building entrances in conformance with ADC 8.370(2)(b).
(a) At least one main entrance, which is in compliance with subsection (1), must be designed to include at least three (3) of the following architectural features: canopy, portico, arcade, arch, wing wall, planters, recessed doorway, transom windows, ornamental light fixtures, larger or more prominent doors, pilasters or columns that frame the doorway, or other similar features that increase the visibility of the entrance for pedestrians.
(b) Buildings separated from the street by other buildings are exempt from this standard.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Parking Location. Off-street parking must be located to the side or rear of the building(s) and not between the building and the street, except where the applicant demonstrates that one or more of the situations listed in (a)-(e) below applies and the buffer standard in subsection (3) is met (see Figure 8.330-1). Adjustments to this standard pursuant to ADC 2.060-2.080 to allow parking in front of the building may be approved upon finding that the proposed setbacks are comparable to the setbacks on adjacent developed non-residential sites and steps have been taken to mitigate the impact of parking in order to meet the purpose of the standard.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 24 January 1, 2021
(a) Locating parking to the side or rear of the building is not feasible due to the dimensions of the site including, but not limited to, the width, shape, or size of the site or the amount of site frontage.
(b) Locating parking to the rear or side of the building is not feasible due to the conservation of designated natural resources or the preservation of five or more trees over 25 inches in circumference (approximately 8 inches in diameter) or one or more individual trees equal to or greater than six and one-half feet in circumference (approximately 25 inches in diameter). Trees must be healthy specimens that can and will be retained and which are not exempt from site plan review for tree felling pursuant to ADC 9.204.
(c) Locating parking to the rear or side of the building is not feasible due to topographic constraints or natural hazards on the site.
(d) The site frontage is subject to access restrictions from a public street that would preclude placement of the parking to the side or rear of the building.
(e) The site is larger than three acres and the parking lot has been designed in accordance with the standards in Section 8.380, regardless of the number of parking spaces.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
FIGURE 8.330-1. Parking to the Side or Rear of Buildings.
(3) Parking Lot Buffer. Where a landscape buffer is required pursuant to subsection (2), a minimum 10-foot-wide landscape buffer meeting the landscaping standards in ADC 9.240 must be placed between the parking area and the street, running the length of the parking area. In zoning districts that require a landscaped front setback, the parking lot buffer requirement may be met by the required front setback standard if landscape plantings are provided at the same or greater density.

Hedge screens must be composed of evergreen shrubs that will grow to form a continuous hedge that is sight-obscuring within two years of planting.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
SUPPLEMENTAL COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN STANDARDS IN VILLAGE CENTERS
8.405 Village Center Character. The purpose of these standards is to contribute to the desired character of Albany’s village centers. They are intended to promote the design of an urban environment that is built to human scale with attractive street fronts and interconnected walkways that promote pedestrian usage and accommodate vehicles. Development in the village center must contribute to a cohesive, visually compatible and functionally linked pattern through street and sidewalk layout, building siting and character, and site design. Details count. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03]
8.410 Applicability. These standards apply to development where commercial and/or institutional uses, as defined in Article 22, are existing or proposed, including when such uses are part of a mixed-use development or live/work dwelling unit. Modifications to existing developments for which the Director has waived review under the provisions of ADC Section 1.105 are not subject to these standards. Certain standards provide additional exemptions for modifications to existing sites or buildings. These standards apply in all zoning districts within the Village Center Comprehensive Plan designation, except as otherwise specified. They are in addition to the Commercial and Institutional Site Design Standards in this article. Taken together, these design standards are intended to foster a mixed-use character for village centers. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.415 Buildings Along Public Streets.
Purpose. Buildings along the public street define the street edge and frame the streetscape. In larger development, the locations of pad site buildings also provide opportunities to frame entries into the shopping centers and contribute to the visual interest of the site. These provisions are intended to avoid deep building setbacks behind large expanses of parking areas or vacant land. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
Standards. The following standards apply in all zoning districts within designated Village Centers except HD, CB, DMU, and WF, which are subject to ADC Section 5.120.
(1) Buildings and plazas shall be located within the maximum setback area for at least 40 percent of one public street frontage.
(2) For sites with frontage on more than one public street (i.e., corner lots), this standard applies to one frontage only.
(3) The public street frontage is the length of the property as measured along the street right-of-way excluding the width of entrance driveways and/or streets.
(4) Building facades that face public streets shall be divided into human-scale proportions using at least two features such as windows, entrances, arcades, arbors, awnings, trellises with vines, or an equivalent element. A blank, uninterrupted wall shall not be longer than 30 feet.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 36 January 1, 2021
(5) No parking, loading or travel aisles shall be located between the public street and buildings within 50 feet of the street, except that a designated park-and-ride lot or one drive-through lane may be permitted. See Section 8.420(1)(b). [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(6) To count toward this standard, a plaza shall:
(a) Be well defined at the street edge by a low decorative architectural wall (no higher than three feet), or a line of shrubs or trees of the same species, or similar landscaped or built feature;
(b) Use materials that are similar in quality to the principal materials of the primary building(s) and landscape. Landscaping with drought-resistant native species is strongly encouraged;
(c) Have direct access to the public street sidewalk and be located the shortest distance to the nearest building main entrance; and
(d) Extend at least the full depth of the maximum setback. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03]
8.420 Maximum Setback.
Purpose. Customer entrances should be readily accessible from the public street sidewalk as well as from the parking lot. Build-to lines form visually continuous, pedestrian-oriented street fronts with no vehicle use area between building fronts and the street.
Standards. The following standards apply in all zoning districts within designated Village Centers that have maximum setback standards except HD, CB, DMU, and WF, which are subject to ADC Section 5.120. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) Buildings within 50 feet of a public street shall have 40 percent of the building located within the maximum setback except that: [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) If a previously recorded easement precludes meeting the maximum setback, the applicant shall demonstrate that an alternative layout best addresses the intent of this standard and the character of the village center.
(b) A building with drive-through service may have one drive-through lane between the building and the street provided that the building is set back no more than 25 feet and the drive-through lane is screened according to standards for perimeter parking area landscaping in ADC 8.470.
(2) Any building more than 50 feet from a public street is exempt from this standard.
[Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5768, 12/7/11]
8.425 Drive-up and Drive-through Uses and Facilities in the HD, CB, DMU, and WF zoning districts. The following standards apply to any development that includes new drive-up or drive-through facilities. Modifications to existing drive up or drive through facilities must not decrease conformance with these standards except as required to meet building code, fire code, or other regulations.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(1) Purpose. The following standards are intended to calm traffic, provide for adequate vehicle queuing space and safe vehicle access, and provide for pedestrian comfort and safety.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(2) Standards. Drive-up or drive-through uses and facilities (i.e., driveway queuing areas, customer service windows, teller machines, kiosks, drop-boxes, or similar facilities) within the HD, CB, DMU, and WF zoning districts shall meet all of the following standards:
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(a) The drive-up or drive-through facility shall orient to and receive access from a driveway that is internal to the development and not a street. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(b) A drive-through lane shall not be located between the building and the street.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 37 January 1, 2021

8.430 Size Limitations. See building size limitations in Tables 4.090-1 and 5.090-1, Development Standards.
[Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.440 Building Design.
Purpose. These provisions are intended to reduce the visual appearance of larger scale buildings to a smaller, pedestrian-level scale that is appropriate for a village center. They are not intended to limit the size of the building.
Standards.
(1) Façade and roofline articulation. The following standards apply to new buildings with walls, façades, and/or rooflines longer than 100 feet. Expansions and modifications of existing buildings and sites with walls, façades, and/or rooflines longer than 100 feet must not decrease conformance with these standards except as required to meet building code, fire code, or other regulations. As an alternative to meeting the standards below, development in the HD, CB, DMU, and WF zoning districts may demonstrate compliance with the façade design and articulation standards in ADC Section 8.345. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(d) Building facades longer than 100 feet shall have relief such as recessed entries, offsets, jogs, bays, columns, ribs, pilasters, piers, cornices, bases, or other distinctive constructed changes. Changes in relief in the building façade shall occur at least every 100 feet for at least 20 percent of the exterior wall area. At least two colors or textures shall be used (not including stripes or bands).
(e) Rooflines longer than 100 feet shall be relieved by elements such as parapets, gables, dormers, towers, steeples, etc.
(f) No building wall shall be longer than 300 feet unless the building façade has one or more major offsets in wall plane. A major offset in wall plane shall have a depth of at least 10 percent of the length of the longest abutting wall and shall continue for at least 20 percent of the building facade. Minor changes in wall plane such as entries, jogs, bays, columns, ribs, pilasters, piers, or cornices do not count toward meeting this standard.
(2) Cohesive development. In developments with multiple buildings, each individual building shall include predominant characteristics shared by all buildings in the development, so that the development forms a cohesive place within the district. A standardized prototype design shall be modified if necessary to meet the provisions of this Code and character of this district.
[Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(3) Building materials. Corrugated metal siding is prohibited on any building. Corrugated metal roofing is allowed. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(4) Ground floor height. In the HD, CB, and DMU zoning districts, when the first story of the building will be occupied by commercial or institutional uses, as identified in Article 22, the height of the first story shall be a minimum of 14 feet. This standard applies to new buildings (excluding accessory buildings). Modifications and expansions of existing buildings must not decrease conformance with these standards except as required to meet building code, fire code, or other regulations. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the ground floor space is designed to be suitable and attractive for a variety of retail and commercial uses, regardless of its proposed use. [Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 38 January 1, 2021
8.445 Pedestrian Network.
Purpose. By creating a safe, continuous network of sidewalks within and between developments, pedestrians will feel more inclined to walk (rather than drive). A pedestrian network that offers clear circulation corridors from the parking areas to building entries creates a friendlier, more inviting image. A detailed pedestrian circulation plan must demonstrate that the layout of sidewalks contributes to the overall pedestrian connectivity of the village center.
Standards.
(1) Sidewalks must be located to provide the shortest direct connection from the public street sidewalk(s) to all customer entrances.
(2) Sidewalks must be located to provide the shortest direct connection between all on-site customer entrances.
(3) Sidewalks must be located along every public street frontage and both sides of on-site private streets. These sidewalks must be separated from the street by a tree-lined landscape strip, except where specified elsewhere in the development code or where an alternative street design is approved by the City Engineer. Approved vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facilities are allowed in the landscape strip. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17]
(4) Extra-wide sidewalks are encouraged to provide space for tables and chairs and other pedestrian amenities, creating a concentration of activity to serve as the neighborhood center.
(5) Sites larger than eight acres shall create an open space or plaza with amenities such as benches, monuments, kiosks or public art. Amenities shall be in prominent locations, interconnected with the uses and walkways on the site, and be landscaped. Approved vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facilities are allowed in these areas. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
8.450 Privacy Considerations.
Purpose. Village centers are mixed-use areas where special attention is given to resolving potentially incompatible situations. General standards provide the flexibility to adjust the design and operating characteristics to given circumstances.
Standard.
(1) Non-residential uses and parking areas shall be arranged to minimize infringement on the privacy of adjoining residents. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03]
8.460 Parking Areas.
Purpose. While recognizing the paramount role of cars in everyday life and the need to provide adequate and convenient space for them, these standards move away from the typical suburban pattern of predominant and highly-visible parking areas in commercial developments. They are intended to reduce the scale of parking areas by siting a portion of the parking lot out of view and using increased landscaping to screen spaces and reduce the overall visual impact of large parking areas.
Standards.
(1) On-street parking spaces within 100 feet of a commercial or office development may count towards meeting the parking requirement.
(2) Shared parking is encouraged for all uses.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 39 January 1, 2021
(3) Trees intended for parking area landscaping shall provide a canopy cover of at least 20 percent of the parking area at maturity. Existing trees may be included to meet the canopy requirement, provided the site plan identifies such trees and the trees meet the standards of size, health, and placement. The extent of the canopy at maturity shall be based on published reference texts generally accepted by landscape architects, nurserymen, and arborists.
(4) Vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facilities shall be considered as the initial stormwater collection system. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
8.470 Perimeter Parking Area Landscaping.
Purpose. These provisions are intended to give parking a low profile in order to improve the pedestrian experience and the overall aesthetic quality of the street. They will minimize the expansive appearance of parking lots, increase the sense of neighborhood scale, and improve the character of a village center. They will also create an attractive, shaded environment along streets that gives visual relief from continuous hard street edges; buffer automobile traffic, and focus views for both pedestrians and motorists.
Standards.
(1) All parking areas (excluding entranceways) adjacent to a public street shall be screened with:
(a) A low continuous hedge of evergreen shrubs, trees, and plantings that are at least three feet tall within two years and grow to provide an evergreen screen of at least 70 percent; OR
(b) A berm three-foot-tall with a maximum slope of 3:1, in combination with coniferous and deciduous trees and shrubs; OR
(c) A low decorative masonry wall at least three feet tall in combination with landscaping; OR
(d) A combination of any of these methods.
(2) The landscape plan shall be prepared by a licensed landscape architect. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03]
8.475 Signs.
Purpose. Signs must be scaled appropriately to appeal to both pedestrians walking on the adjacent sidewalks and to nearby motorists. The following standards are intended to create aesthetically pleasing and cohesive sign standards while reinforcing the context of the village center.
Standards.
(1) For integrated centers, an overall sign and graphics program shall be provided as part of the development application to ensure that stand-alone signs are consolidated and that signs complement the character of the neighborhood.
(2) Monument signs are preferred rather than freestanding signs. [Ord. 5556, 2/21/03]
SUPPLEMENTAL RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS IN VILLAGE CENTERS
8.480 Applicability. These standards apply to residential development in mixed-use and residential zones within the Village Center Comprehensive Plan designation. They are in addition to the residential design standards for Single-Family Homes and Multiple-Family Homes in this article.
[Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
8.485 Purpose. These provisions are intended to promote the design of an urban environment that is built to human scale and to foster a mixed-use character for village centers with an emphasis on a high-quality pedestrian environment, high-quality and attractive building materials, and architectural details that reduce exterior building mass. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 40 January 1, 2021
Standards.
(1) A minimum of 75 percent of a building’s exterior shall be surfaced with wood, brick, stucco, stone, masonry, or lap siding. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Rooflines shall incorporate at least one of the following elements: parapets, cornices, gables, dormers, varied roof heights, or top-level balconies. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) All exterior HVAC equipment shall be screened from street-level view.
(4) Creation of alleys is not required as a development standard but is encouraged in order to provide a friendly street frontage and to set driveways and garages in the rear. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) Covered bike parking repealed by Ord. 5832, 4/9/14.
TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES
8.500 Telecommunication Facilities. Every telecommunication facility shall comply with the following standards and applicable standards of the zone.
(1) No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates that co-location is not feasible on existing towers.
(2) New towers or facilities 50 feet or more in height must provide for future co-location of other telecommunications providers.
(3) Monopole construction is preferred over the lattice style.
(4) The applicant shall consider the following locations as the preferred order of location of for a proposed communication facility: a) existing broadcasting or communication facilities; b) public structures such as water reservoirs, utility structures, fire stations, bridges, and other public buildings within all zoning districts not used primarily for residential uses; c) property zoned Light Industrial, Heavy Industrial, Industrial Park and Heavy Commercial.
(5) Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment, except when the color is dictated by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.
(6) Towers should be located in an area where they are unobtrusive and do not substantially detract from aesthetics or neighborhood character, due to either location, nature of surrounding uses, or to lack of visibility caused by natural growth or other factors.
(7) Towers shall not be located between the principal structure and a public street.
(8) Tower setbacks shall be at least the height of the tower from public streets.
(9) Tower guys and accessory structures shall satisfy the minimum setback requirements of the underlying zoning district. Vegetative screening shall be provided around any accessory building as prescribed by Section 9.250.
(10) All towers and associated facilities shall be removed within six months of the cessation of operations at the site unless the Community Development Director approves a time extension. If a tower is not removed within six months, the City may remove the telecommunications facilities and assess the costs of removal against the owner and property. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 41 January 1, 2021
SUPPLEMENTAL DESIGN STANDARDS FOR THE OAK CREEK TRANSITION AREA
8.600 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of the Oak Creek Transition Area (OCTA) is to guide development review and more detailed planning for the transitional areas between Oak Creek and adjacent developed and developable areas. The OCTA works in combination with the Open Space zone, natural resource overlay zones and the development review process to ensure that the larger Oak Creek corridor is protected for the long term and provides benefits to all of Albany. The OCTA is specifically intended to:
(1) Integrate open space areas, both public and private, near Oak Creek;
(2) Be the centerpiece of the South Albany open space system and provide multiple benefits including wetland protection and mitigation, habitat, flood storage, pathways, recreation, history, environmental education and visual identity for the area;
(3) Be South Albany’s “front yard” - physically and visually accessible to adjacent development;
(4) Create a multitude of public spaces and connections (parks, trails, trailheads, visual, etc.) between “Oak Creek Parkway” (an east-west street) and the public edge of undeveloped areas;
(5) Include a continuous east-west pathway and other pathways that connect north and south to community destinations; and
(6) Preserve archeological and historical resources as heritage sites if feasible.
8.610 Applicability. The OCTA supplemental standards apply as follows:
(1) South of Oak Creek, the standards apply between the Riparian Corridor overlay boundary around Oak Creek and the north edge of the right-of-way for Oak Creek Parkway. Oak Creek Parkway’s location is generally identified in the South Albany Area Plan chapter of the Comprehensive Plan, on Figure 2, Street Framework. NOTE: The southern boundary of the OCTA may need to deviate from the Oak Creek Parkway within the Area of Interest shown on the Street Framework if the Parkway is forced south due to development constraints.
(2) North of Oak Creek, the standards apply within 100 feet from the upland edge of the Riparian Corridor Overlay District (/RC).
8.620 OCTA Development Standards. Development within the Transition Area must satisfy all of the following standards.
(1) The design and construction of the development, utilities, and trails shall limit disturbance to natural features as much as reasonably feasible.
(2) Fences are limited to within developed areas. All fences, posts and supporting structures shall be stained, painted, or powder-coated black or a neutral earth tone color to harmonize with the surrounding landscape. Sight-obscuring fences shall be no more than three feet tall.
(3) Once a wetland delineation is approved by the Oregon Department of State Lands for any area proposed for development, the City may seek to acquire, by negotiated purchase or exercise of the power of eminent domain, all or part of the developable area on the north side of the Parkway or take such other action as may be appropriate or required to compensate the landowner for any loss of use that exceeds that which the City may require by lawful regulation.
Albany Development Code, Article 8 8 - 42 January 1, 2021
(4) Development between Oak Creek and the Oak Creek Parkway, and between 99E and Columbus Street must meet the following standards:
(a) The “development area” cannot exceed 50 percent of the subject site’s frontage on the north side of Oak Creek Parkway. The “development area” shall include all residential lots and development, all areas taken up by buildings, private yards, paving, streets, grading and non-native landscaping, but does not include parks, low-impact outdoor recreation, trails, paths, wetland mitigation or restoration, City construction of public infrastructure such as transportation, stormwater, sewer, and water utilities, or the private construction of public transportation and utility facilities and structures as identified in a City-adopted master plan. The resulting undeveloped frontage along the north side of Oak Creek Parkway shall have a continuous view of the Oak Creek Corridor and associated open space that is not obstructed by the development area. See Figure 8.620-1, 1–Permitted and 2 –Prohibited.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(b) Native vegetation, excluding any that are farmed for agricultural purposes, that is impacted in the developed area is mitigated through the enhancement or restoration of native vegetation in undeveloped areas per the relevant standards in ADC 6.400-6.420.
FIGURE 8.620-1. Oak Creek Corridor Transition Area.

(e) The Director finds that providing the landscaping in the public right-of-way in the interim fulfills the intent this Code for high-quality development (9.010) and the minimum landscaping requirements in Section 9.140(2)(a) through (c). [Ord. 5752, 3/9/11]
9.150 Parking Lot Landscaping. The purpose of landscaping in parking lots is to provide shade, reduce stormwater runoff, and direct traffic. Incorporation of approved vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facilities in landscaped areas is encouraged. Parking lots must be landscaped in accordance with the following minimum standards: [Ord. 5720, 8/12/09; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 12 January 1, 2021
(1) Planter Bays. Parking areas shall be divided into bays of not more than 12 parking spaces. At both ends of each parking bay, there shall be curbed planters at least five feet wide, excluding the curb. Gaps in the curb may be allowed for connections to approved post-construction stormwater quality facilities. Each planter shall contain one canopy tree at least 10 feet high and decorative ground cover containing at least two shrubs for every 100 square feet of landscape area. Neither planter bays nor their contents may impede access on required public sidewalks or paths, or handicapped-accessible parking spaces. [Ord. 5720, 8/12/09; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(2) Entryway Landscaping. Both sides of a parking lot entrance shall be bordered by a minimum five-foot-wide landscape planter strip meeting the same landscaping provisions as planter bays, except that no sight-obscuring trees or shrubs are permitted.
(3) Parking Space Buffers. Parking areas shall be separated from the exterior wall of a structure by pedestrian walkways or loading areas or by a five-foot strip of landscaping materials.
(4) Alternate Plan. An alternate plan may be submitted that provides landscaping of at least five percent of the total parking area exclusive of required landscaped yard areas and that separates parking areas of more than 100 spaces into clusters divided by landscape strips. Each planter area shall contain one tree at least 10 feet tall and decorative ground cover containing at least two shrubs for every 100 square feet of landscape area. Landscaping may not impede access on required public sidewalks or paths, or handicapped-accessible parking spaces.
[Ord. 5720, 08/12/09]
(5) Landscape Protection. Required landscaped areas adjacent to graveled areas must be protected, either by railroad ties secured by rebar driven 18 inches into the ground, by large boulders, or by another acceptable means of protection.
FIGURE 9.150-1. Parking lot landscaping example.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.160 Irrigation of Required Landscaping. All required landscaped areas must be provided with an irrigation system unless a licensed landscape architect, landscape construction professional, or certified nurseryman submits written verification that the proposed plants do not require irrigation.

9.170 Identification of Existing Trees. In all proposed developments, existing trees over 25 inches in circumference (8 inches in diameter) as measured 4.5 feet above mean ground level from the base of the trunk shall be noted on all development plans, with notations indicating whether they are to be removed or utilized in the development. To obtain the circumference of a tree with multiple trunks, add the individual trunk circumferences, which are greater than six inches in circumference. Clusters of trees in open space and floodplain areas may be noted in approximate locations. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 13 January 1, 2021
9.180 Landscape Plans. With the exceptions noted below, all development applications involving buildings and parking areas must include landscape plans. The following uses are required to meet the landscaping requirements of this code but are not required to submit landscape plans:
(1) Single-family dwellings, duplexes, and triplexes.
(2) Accessory buildings.
(3) Changes internal to an existing structure.
(4) Building additions involving less than 500 square feet.
9.182 Street Trees Prohibited on Right-of-Ways. Because of their potential negative impact on the public infrastructure, it is unlawful to plant any of the following trees in or on any street right-of-way or parking strip in the City: box elder, tree of heaven, golden chain, holly, silver maple, bamboo, poplar, willow, conifer, cottonwood, fruit trees (other than ornamental fruit trees), nut trees (other than ornamental nut trees), and ailanthus.
9.184 Trees Requiring Approval. It is unlawful to plant willow, cottonwood, or poplar trees anywhere in the City unless the Director of Public Works approves the site as one where the tree roots will not be likely to interfere with public sewers.
9.186 Height Requirements in Rights-of-Way. Trees or shrubs growing in the right-of-way or on private property adjacent to a street right-of-way must be trimmed to maintain a minimum canopy height of eight feet above sidewalks or 14 feet above streets or alleys. No trees, shrubs, or plants more than 18 inches tall shall be planted in the public right-of-way abutting roads having no established curb and gutter.

9.189 Planting in Roadways Having No Gutter, Curb. No trees, shrubs, or plantings more than 18 inches tall shall be planted in the public right-of-way abutting roadways having no established curb and gutter.
9.190 Completion Guarantees. Final occupancy of a development that required land use approval may be allowed prior to the complete installation of all required landscaping and irrigation only under the following circumstances: [Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
(1) A security is provided to the City equal to 110 percent of the cost of the labor and materials (plants, ground covers, and any required irrigation) that have not been installed, as verified in writing by a landscape contractor. Security may consist of a performance bond payable to the City, cash, certified check, time certificate of deposit, or lending agency certification that funds are being held until completion or such other assurances as may be approved by the Director and City Attorney. Where a financial assurance is provided for landscaped areas with post-construction stormwater facilities under subsection (4) below, no additional security under this subsection is required for that part of the landscaping. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(2) The required landscaping and irrigation shall be installed within six months of the date the final occupancy permit is issued. If an occupancy permit is not required, the landscaping and irrigation shall be installed within six months of the date of the land use approval.
[Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
(3) To verify that the landscaping, and irrigation, if required, has been installed per the approved plan, an inspection shall be made prior to any security being returned. [Ord. 5446, 5/10/2000]
(4) Required post-construction stormwater quality facilities incorporated into the required landscaped areas have been completed (or financially assured) consistent with Title 12 of the Albany Municipal Code and applicable post-construction stormwater quality permits.
[Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
[(1) repealed by Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 14 January 1, 2021
9.200 Maintenance of Landscaped Areas. It shall be the continuing obligation of the property owner to maintain required landscaped areas in an attractive manner free of weeds and noxious vegetation. In addition, the minimum amount of required living landscape materials shall be maintained. Private post-construction stormwater quality facilities located in landscaped areas and required under Title 12 of the Albany Municipal Code shall be maintained consistent with the terms of any operation and maintenance agreements between the property owner and the City consistent with the requirements of Albany Municipal Code Title 12. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
TREE PROTECTION
9.202 Purpose. Trees of significant size represent a visual and aesthetic resource to the community. Trees provide benefits including shading, reduction in excess stormwater runoff, erosion control, and wildlife habitat. These standards are intended to balance the preservation of significant trees as a benefit to the community with the individual right to use and enjoy property.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11, Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.203 Definitions. For the purposes of the following sections, these definitions apply:
(1) Critical Root Zone: The area around a tree where roots are critical to a tree’s survival. For the purposes of this section, the critical root zone is estimated and expressed as a circle around the center of a tree’s trunk, where the radius is calculated by adding one foot for every one-inch of trunk diameter plus the tree trunk’s radius, and where all tree measurements are consistent with those for establishing Tree Circumference. For example, a tree with a Tree Circumference of 6.5 feet would have a trunk radius of 1.0 feet and diameter of 25 inches. The critical root zone would be a circle with a radius of 26 feet (1ft + (25 in * 1ft/in)) from the center of the tree’s trunk and have a total diameter of 52 feet. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Fell: To remove or sever a tree or the intentional use of any procedure the natural result of which is to cause the death or substantial destruction of the tree. Fell does not in any context include normal pruning of trees. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Tree: A living, standing, woody plant. [Ord. 5764, 12/1/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(4) Tree Circumference: The circumference of a tree is measured at 4-1/2 feet above mean ground level from the base of the trunk. To obtain the circumference of a tree with multiple trunks, add the individual trunk circumferences, which are greater than 6 inches in circumference.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.204 Applicability. Except as provided below, Site Plan Review approval is required for the felling of 5 or more trees larger than 25 inches in circumference (approximately 8 inches in diameter) on a lot or property in contiguous single ownership in excess of 20,000 square feet in any zone.
[Ord. 5767, 12/7/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
The following activities are exempt from Site Plan Review under this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all tree felling activities located within Significant Natural Resource Overlay districts must meet the applicable requirements of Article 6: [Ord. 5764, 12/1/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) The action of any City official or of any public utility necessary to remove or alleviate an immediate danger to life or property; to restore utility service or to reopen a public street to traffic.
(2) Felling of any tree that is defined as a nuisance under the Albany Municipal Code.
(3) Any felling necessary to maintain streets or public or private utilities within a public right-of-way or utility easement provided the Tree Commission or City Forester approved the proposed tree felling.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 15 January 1, 2021
(4) Felling of trees planted as Christmas trees. [Ord. 5635, 1/11/06]
(5) Felling of trees on property under a Forest Stewardship Plan approved by the Oregon Department of Forestry. [Ord. 5635, 1/11/06]
9.205 Tree Felling Criteria. Except as provided for in Section 9.206, the following review criteria replace the Site Plan Review criteria found elsewhere in this Code for the purpose of reviewing tree felling. A Site Plan Review for tree felling subject to these criteria will be processed as a Type I-L land use decision.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) The Community Development Director or his/her designee shall approve a Site Plan Review for tree felling when the applicant demonstrates that the felling of the tree(s) is warranted because of the condition of the tree(s) with respect to disease, hazardous or unsafe conditions, danger of falling, proximity to existing structures or proposed construction, or interference with utility services or pedestrian or vehicular safety. The Director, in consultation with the City Arborist, may also grant an exception to any of the tree cutting standards for industrial development on industrially zoned land. The Director may require the applicant to provide a Certified Arborist’s report.
[Ord. 5767, 12/7/11; Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
(2) For property where a Site Plan Review, Conditional Use, or land division application has been approved or is currently under review for development of the property, the Community Development Director or his/her designee shall approve Site Plan Review for tree felling when the applicant demonstrates that all of the following review criteria are met:
(a) It is necessary to fell tree(s) in order to construct proposed improvements in accordance with an approved Site Plan Review or Conditional Use review, or to otherwise utilize the applicant’s property in a manner consistent with its zoning, this Code, applicable plans adopted by the City Council, or a logging permit issued by the Oregon Department of Forestry.
(b) The proposed felling is consistent with City ordinances including tree regulations in the Albany Municipal Code, and the proposed felling does not negatively impact the environmental quality of the area, including but not limited to: the protection of nearby trees and windbreaks; wildlife; erosion; soil retention and stability; volume of surface runoff and water quality of streams; scenic quality; and geological sites.
(c) The uniqueness, size, maturity, structure, and historic value of the trees have been considered and all other options for tree preservation have been exhausted. The Director may require that trees determined to be unique in species, size, maturity, structure, or historic values are preserved.
(d) Tree felling in Significant Natural Resource Overlay Districts meets the applicable requirements in Article 6. [Ord. 5764, 12/1/11, Ord. 5767, 12/7/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) For property where tree felling is proposed and there is no approved or concurrent Site Plan Review, Conditional Use, or land division application for development of the property, the Community Development Director or his/her designee shall approve a Site Plan Review application for tree felling when the applicant demonstrates that all the review criteria in subsection (2) above are met, and the following additional criteria are met: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(a) Trees shall be retained in significantly large areas and dense stands so as to ensure against wind throw.
(b) Wooded areas that will likely provide an attractive on-site amenity to occupants of future developments shall be retained.
(c) Wooded areas associated with natural drainage ways and water areas will be maintained to preserve riparian habitat and minimize erosion. The wooded area to be retained shall be at least 10 feet in width or as required elsewhere in this Code.
(d) Wooded areas along ridges and hilltops will be retained for their scenic and wildlife value.
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 16 January 1, 2021
(e) Tree felling on developable areas will be avoided to retain the wooded character of future building sites and so preserve housing and design options for future City residents.
(f) Wooded areas along property lines shall be retained at a minimum width of 10 feet to provide buffers from adjacent properties.
(g) The plan for tree felling shall be consistent with the preservation of the site’s future development potential and zoning. [Ord. 5767, 12/7/11]
(4) The Director may attach conditions of approval to the tree felling review to ensure the replacement of trees and landscape or otherwise reduce the effects of the felling, and may require an improvement assurance to ensure all conditions are met.
[Ord. 5767, 12/7/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.206 Clear and Objective Criteria for Tree Felling associated with the Development of Housing. For property where a building permit, Site Plan Review, subdivision, or partition application has been approved or is currently under review for the development of housing on a property, the applicant proposing the felling of trees may choose to meet the criteria in Section 9.206 rather than the criteria in Section 9.205. A Site Plan Review application for tree felling subject to the criteria in Section 9.206 will be processed as a Type I decision. The Community Development Director, City Forester, or his/her designee shall approve the Site Plan Review application when the applicant demonstrates that all of the following review criteria are met:
(1) The critical root zone of each tree to be felled is no more than five feet from proposed roads, driveways, utilities, and required site improvements of 10 feet from proposed residential building pads.
(2) The proposed felling is consistent with other applicable sections of the Development Code (such as Article 6, Significant Natural Resource Overlay Districts) and City ordinances, including tree regulations in the Albany Municipal Code.
Trees that do not meet the criterion (1) shall be preserved (see AMC 7.98.215 for recommended methods for protecting residual trees). [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
BUFFERING AND SCREENING
9.208 Purpose. These regulations provide screening and buffering between uses in order to reduce the potential objectionable impacts of higher intensity uses on adjacent lower intensity uses. These impacts include, but are not limited to, light pollution and glare, noise, visual impacts, and loss of privacy.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.210 General Requirements/Matrix. Buffering and screening are required in accordance with the matrix provided in Table 9.210-1. The property owner of each proposed development is responsible for the installation and maintenance of such buffers and screens. The Director may approve an Adjustment to waive the buffering/screening requirements of this section where such has been provided on the abutting property in conformance with this Code. Where a use would be abutting another use except for separation by right-of-way, buffering (but not screening) shall be required as specified in the matrix. Where a proposed use abuts undeveloped property, only one-half of the buffer width shall be required.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
9.220 Delineation of Area. A buffer consists of an area within a required setback adjacent to a property line. It has a depth equal to the amount specified in the buffer matrix and contains a length equal to the length of the property line of the abutting use or uses.
9.230 Occupancy. A buffer area may only be occupied by utilities, screening, sidewalks, bikeways, landscaping, and approved vegetated post-construction stormwater quality facilities. No buildings, vehicular access ways or parking areas are allowed in a buffer area except where vehicular access way has been approved by the City. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 17 January 1, 2021
9.240 Buffering. The minimum improvements within a buffer area consist of the following:
(1) At least one row of trees. These trees will be not less than 10 feet high at the time of planting for deciduous trees and spaced not more than 30 feet apart and five feet high at the time of planting for evergreen trees and spaced not more than 15 feet apart. This requirement may be waived by the Director when it can be demonstrated that such trees would conflict with other purposes of this Code (e.g. solar access).
(2) At least 5 five-gallon shrubs or 10 one-gallon shrubs for each 1,000 square feet of required buffer area.
(3) The remaining area treated with attractive ground cover (e.g., lawn, bark, rock, ivy, evergreen shrubs).
9.250 Screening. Where screening is required or provided, the following standards apply in addition to conditions (1) and (3) above:
(1) One row of evergreen shrubs that will grow to form a continuous hedge at least four feet tall within two years of planting, or
(2) A fence or masonry wall at least five feet tall constructed to provide a uniform sight-obscuring screen, or
(3) An earth berm combined with evergreen plantings or a fence that forms a sight and noise buffer at least six feet tall within two years of installation.
9.260 Clear Vision. Buffering and screening provisions are superseded by the clear vision requirements of Section 12.180 and by the fence and wall height restrictions of the zone when applicable.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
9.270 Landscape Plan. In lieu of these standards a detailed landscape plan, which provides the same degree of desired buffering utilizing alternative designs, may be submitted for approval.

[ Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5886, 1/6/17; Ord. 5894, 10/14/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 19 January 1, 2021
FENCES
9.360 Purpose. Fences can create a sense of privacy, protect children and pets, provide separation from busy streets, and enhance the appearance of property. The negative effects of fences can include the creation of street walls that inhibit police and community surveillance, decrease the sense of community, hinder emergency access, lessen solar access, hinder the safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles, and create an unattractive appearance. These standards are intended to promote the positive aspects of fences and to limit the negative ones. [Ord. 5751, 3/9/11]
9.370 Materials. Fences and walls shall not be constructed of or contain any material that will do bodily harm, such as electric or barbed wire, broken glass, spikes, or any other hazardous or dangerous materials, except as follows: [Ord. 5446, 5/10/00]
(1) Barbed wire is permitted on top of a six-foot-tall fence in commercial, industrial, and mixed-use zones except for HD, DMU, MUC, and MUR. The total height of the fence and barbed wire is limited to 8 feet. Barbed-wire-only fences are prohibited except as allowed under subsection (2).
(2) Correctional Institutions and High-Security Areas. Concertina wire or barbed-wire only fences may be used around correctional institutions and high-security areas provided that the fences are posted at 15-foot intervals with clearly visible warnings of the hazard.
(3) Large Animal Containment. Where cattle, sheep, horses or other livestock are permitted or existed when the property was annexed to the City, barbed wire is permitted within six inches from the top of a fence at least four feet tall that is used to contain or restrict large animals. Fences for this purpose must meet the standards in AMC 6.10.
(4) Electrically charged fences are permitted in the LI and HI zones when the following standards can be met:
(a) The fence is located outside the front setback and required landscaping, buffering or screening; and
(b) The electrically charged fence shall not exceed 10 feet in height; and
(c) The electrically charged fence shall be a pulsed charge system and not a continuous charge system.
(d) No electric fence shall be installed or used unless it is completely surrounded by a perimeter non-electrical fence or wall that is not less than six feet tall; and
(e) Warning signs stating, “Warning, Electric Fence” shall be posted at intervals not less than 50 feet; and
(f) When property lines are shared with a residential zoning district, the following additional standard shall be met:
i. A solid fence or wall between 6 and 8 feet tall shall be placed at the shared property line(s); and
ii. Warning signs shall be posted at intervals of not less than 25 feet.
(g) The fence shall be tested and approved by the State of Oregon approved testing laboratory; and
(h) The fence shall be installed and used accordance with the Oregon Electrical Specialty Code, the listing, and the manufacturer’s installation instructions; and
(i) Electrical permits and inspections shall be required for the installation. Work must be performed by a licensed Oregon electrician.
(j) In addition to the Fire Department access requirements in the Oregon Fire Code, the following additional standards are required for properties protected by an electric fence:
i. Each vehicle gate shall open automatically using a sensing device approved by the fire department. This automatic operation shall be supplemented by the installation of a Knox electric switch (with dust cover) to be installed in an approved location.
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 20 January 1, 2021
ii. The gate opening equipment shall be equipped with a battery backup in the advent of power failure (both ingress & egress sides).
iii. Power to the electrified fence, excluding gate opening controls, shall be deactivated upon activation of automatic or manual fire department access for ingress or egress through the gate.
iv. The vehicle gate shall provide a means for the fire department to egress from the site.
v. A pedestrian type gate shall be installed immediately adjacent to all vehicle access gates.
[Ord. 5751, 3/9/11]

[Ord. 5446, 5/10/00; Ord. 5555, 2/7/03; Ord. 5556, 2/21/03; Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5689, 3/12/08; Ord. 5742, 7/14/10; Ord. 5751, 3/9/11]
ENVIRONMENTAL
9.400 Purpose. These regulations are designed to protect all uses in all zones from certain objectionable off-site impacts associated with nonresidential uses. These impacts include noise, vibration, odors, degraded water quality, and glare. The standards ensure that uses provide adequate control measures or locate in areas where the community is protected from health hazards or nuisances. Use of objective standards provides a measurable means of determining specified off-site impacts. This method protects specific industries or firms from exclusion in a zone-based solely on the general characteristics of similar industries in the past.
[Ord. 5555, 2/7/03; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
9.405 Exemptions. The off-site impact standards do not apply to machinery, equipment, and facilities that were at the site and in compliance with existing regulations at the effective date of these regulations. Any new or additional machinery, equipment, and facilities must comply with the standards of this chapter. Documentation is the responsibility of the proprietor of the use if there is any question about when the equipment was brought to the site. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.410 Relationship to Other Regulations. The environmental standards are in addition to all other regulations of the Albany Municipal Code. These standards do not replace or supersede regulations of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), relevant county regulations, or standards such as the Uniform Building Code or Uniform Fire Code. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.420 Evidence of Compliance. Before approving a development application, the Director may require submission of evidence demonstrating compliance with state, federal and local environmental regulations and receipt of necessary permits.
9.425 Responsibility. Compliance with state, federal and local environmental regulations is the continuing obligation of the property owner and operator.
9.430 Measurements. Measurements for compliance with these standards are made from the property line or within the property of the affected site. Measurements may be made at ground level or at habitable levels of buildings.
If the City does not have the equipment or expertise to measure and evaluate a specific complaint, it may request assistance from another agency or may contract with an independent expert to perform such measurements. The City may accept measurements made by an independent expert hired by the owner or operator of the off-site impact source. If the City contracts to have measurements made and no violation is found, the City will bear the expense, if any, of the measurements. If a violation is found, City expenses will be charged to the violator. Nonpayment of the costs is a violation of the Code. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.435 Neighborhood Compatibility. If a site is located within 300 feet of residentially-zoned property and environmental impacts regulated by this article have not been adequately determined, the Community Development Director may require that a proposed use be considered under the Conditional Use process to provide an opportunity for public review and comment and to establish conditions to mitigate potential impacts. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
Albany Development Code, Article 9 9 - 23 January 1, 2021
9.440 Noise. The City noise standards are stated in Albany Municipal Code Title 7, Public Peace, Morals and Safety. Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) 340-035-0035, Noise Control Regulations for Industry and Commerce, is adopted here in its entirety, and as may be subsequently amended by the State of Oregon. Tables 7, 8, and 9 referenced in OAR are included here for reference only. In addition, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) has regulations that apply to firms adjacent to or near noise-sensitive uses such as dwellings, religious institutions, schools, and hospitals.

(c) The allowable noise levels cited in Tables 7, 8 and 9 shall apply to all non-residential uses.
[Ord. 5768, 12/7/11]
(2) Expert Evaluation. A noise analysis may be required in the development review process to show that a proposed activity can meet the noise standards or that residential uses are adequately buffered from noise sources.
(3) Mitigation Measures. The following noise mitigation measures may be required through development review:
(a) increased building setbacks;
(b) special berms and heavy vegetation areas;
(c) site layout to establish buffer areas or locate low-noise buildings to serve as a buffer between the noise-sensitive areas and the sound source;
(d) special sound insulation construction techniques;
(e) improvements as recommended by the DEQ or a qualified noise consultant;
(f) posting a bond or other financial agreement to ensure that the required noise reduction features are installed. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/2003]

[Ord. 5555, 2/7/2003]
9.455 Water Quality. Direct discharge of stormwater and process waste from the operation of industries shall comply with the water quality standards adopted by the City of Albany, DEQ and as authorized by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.460 Vibration. Continuous, frequent, or repetitive vibrations that exceed 0.002g peak may not be produced.
Exceptions: Vibrations from temporary construction and vehicles that leave the site (such as trucks, trains, or aircraft) are exempt; vibrations lasting less than five minutes per day are also exempt. Vibrations from primarily on-site vehicles and equipment are not exempt.
Measurements. Seismic or electronic vibration measuring equipment may be used for measurements when there are doubts about the level of vibration. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.470 Odors. Continuous, frequent, or repetitive odors or the emission of odorous gases or other matter in such quantities as to be readily detectable at any point beyond the property line of the use creating the odors is prohibited. Odor is regulated by the Department of Environmental Quality.
Exceptions: An odor detected for less than 15 minutes per day is exempt. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]
9.480 Glare and Heat. No direct- or sky-reflected glare in excess of 0.5-foot candles of light, whether from floodlights or from high-temperature processes such as combustion or welding or otherwise, visible at the lot line shall be permitted. These regulations shall not apply to signs or floodlighting of parking areas otherwise permitted by this Code. There shall be no emission or transmission of heat or heated air so as to be discernible at the lot line of the source. Strobe lights visible from another property are not allowed, except as may be required by the Federal Aviation Administration. [Ord. 5555, 2/7/03]

MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS
GENERAL
10.190 Repealed by Ord. 5445, 4/12/00
10.200 Definitions. A manufactured home park is a land-lease residential community. The land is under the same ownership; home sites within the community are leased to individual homeowners.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.205 Applicability. The following standards apply to the design of new manufactured home parks and to the expansion of existing manufactured home parks. These standards are not intended to apply to existing manufactured home parks or to render unlawful any existing manufactured home park.
However, there may be spaces in existing manufactured home parks that were constructed under previous standards where a replacement manufactured home could not now be placed in conformance with these standards. It is not the purpose of these standards to prohibit continued use of those spaces. The applicant may either select a home that could be placed in such a space in full compliance with these standards, or the applicant could seek relief as allowed by other provisions of this Code.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.210 Where Permitted. Manufactured home parks are permitted with Site Plan Review approval in the RS-6.5, RS-5, RM and RMA Districts in accordance with the standards of this Article and the standards for site plan approval, Article 2. In addition, manufactured home parks may be planned under the provisions for Planned Developments (Article 11), which may be used to provide for individual ownership of manufactured homes and sites and common ownership and maintenance of other lands and facilities. Manufactured home parks are not permitted in other zoning districts.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.220 Same Standards Apply as for Conventional Development. Except as specified otherwise by this article, the standards for developing land within manufactured home parks are the same as for all other developments in accordance with the provisions of this Code. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.230 Improvement Standards. The improvement of driveways, walkways, streets, drainage and other utilities shall conform to adopted State standards for such or shall conform to the City’s Standard Construction Specifications Manual, whichever is more restrictive. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.240 Minimum Park Size. The minimum area of the park shall be at least one acre.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/98; Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.250 Density. The maximum number of manufactured homes allowed within a manufactured home park shall be computed by dividing the total land area of the park, including private streets and common areas by the minimum lot area per dwelling unit allowed within the subject zone. The total density shall not exceed 10 units per acre. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.260 Permitted Uses. A manufactured home park may contain manufactured homes and accessory structures incidental to the primary use. Accessory uses may include: community laundry and recreation facilities, common buildings for use by park residents only, a manager’s office, and one residence (that may be other than a manufactured home) for the use of a caretaker or a manager responsible for maintaining or operating the property. Only those manufactured homes that have an insignia of compliance from either the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or the State of Oregon are permitted in a manufactured home park. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
10.270 Compatibility and Park Perimeter Standards. These standards apply only to spaces on the perimeter of the park.
Albany Development Code, Article 10 10 - 5 January 1, 2021
(1) Space Size. The size of spaces on the perimeter of the park is determined by the use of adjoining land and the zoning district. This standard does not apply to spaces that abut public streets on the perimeter of the park. For purposes of this section, “developed” means that the number of dwelling units per acre exceeds 50 percent of the maximum density allowed by the zone. For RS-10, 50 percent of the maximum density is two units/acre; for RS-6.5, four units per acre; for RS-5, five units/acre; for RM, ten units/acre; and for RMA, 20 units/acre. This definition applies equally to adjoining land that is used for a subdivision, apartment, or manufactured home park. Each side of the manufactured home park is considered separately even though the adjoining land may be zoned alike.
If the adjoining land is developed, spaces shall be at least 90 percent of the minimum single-family lot size of the adjoining zoning district. (For example, in the RS-6.5 zoning district, spaces must be 90 percent of 6,500 square feet.)
If the adjoining land is not developed, spaces shall be at least 90 percent of the minimum single-family lot size in the underlying zoning district.
A Major Variance to this standard may be appropriate where the adjacent land is protected from development (e.g. floodways, wetlands, steep slopes) and creates a natural buffer area between developable areas. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) Home Orientation. Homes on perimeter spaces shall be oriented to the street so the front door faces the street.
(3) Perimeters on Public Streets. These standards apply to spaces abutting public streets on the perimeter of the park.
(a) Setbacks. Homes and accessory structures shall meet the minimum front yard setback for the underlying zoning district.
(b) Home Orientation. Homes adjacent to local residential streets shall be oriented to the public street so the front door faces the street.
(c) Screening along collector and arterial streets. Buffering and screening shall be provided along collector and arterial streets in accordance with Sections 9.210 through 9.250. Architectural screening to include sight-obscuring fencing may be used for screening along streets classified as a collector or arterial. Long expanses of fence or wall along streets shall be designed to prevent visual monotony through the use of offsets, landscaping, and change in materials.

ARTICLE 11
LAND DIVISIONS AND PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
11.000 Overview. The most permanent feature of a community is the way land is divided into parcels. This article describes the process of converting raw land into building sites. The primary goals of this design review are to better ensure that natural features have been taken into account; that roads and utilities are properly designed and installed, and that adequate open space has been provided. This article establishes the standards and procedures for property line adjustments, partitions, subdivisions, planned developments, and condominiums.
The following is a list of the main headings in this article.
■ General Provisions
■ Lot and Block Arrangement
■ Property Line Adjustments
■ Subdivisions and Partitions
■ Planned Developments
■ Condominiums
■ Cluster Development
[Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
GENERAL PROVISIONS
11.010 Relationship to State Law. Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) Chapter 92 governs all land divisions. This chapter permits the City to develop its own procedures and review criteria. Because the state law particularly limits the City’s discretion in these matters, users of this Code are encouraged to review ORS Chapter 92 at the same time. Because of the many state requirements in this area, this article cannot be relied upon to provide all of the regulations that are applicable to land divisions. At the time of adoption of this article in 1992, the following provisions of state law were identified as particularly applicable:
■ ORS 92.025 - Prohibition of sales of lots or certain interests prior to recordation of plat.
■ ORS 92.050 - Requirements of survey and plat of subdivisions and partitions.
■ ORS 92.060 - Monument requirements for subdivisions, partitions and property line adjustments.
■ ORS 92.090 - Requisites for approval of tentative subdivision or partition plat.
■ ORS 92.120(5) - Disclosure of water rights information when dividing land.
■ ORS 92.180 - Authority to review replats.
■ ORS 92.205 - Policy on undeveloped subdivisions.
The foregoing is not intended to be an exclusive list of all of the provisions of state law, which must be considered by an applicant or staff in reviewing land division applications. By the same token, the provisions of state law, which are listed above, are not mandatory provisions of this Code. Rather they are merely intended to warn the reader of the need for careful contemporaneous review of state law.
11.020 Relationship to Public Improvements Article. All proposed developments governed by this article must meet the applicable design, and construction standards of Article 12 - Public Improvements.
11.030 Relationship to Other Local Regulations. All proposed development governed by this article must meet the underlying zoning district standards, applicable lot and block standards under this Section, the applicable on-site improvements of Article 9 (e.g., off-street parking, landscaping, buffering and screening), the applicable Natural Resource District Requirements of Article 6 (e.g., open space, floodplain, hillside development, significant wetlands, habitat assessment, riparian corridor, and Willamette River Greenway), and the post-construction stormwater quality requirements in Title 12 of the Albany Municipal Code.[Ord. 5764, 12/01/
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 2 January 1, 2021
11.040 Pre-application Conference. A pre-application conference, in accordance with Section 1.130, is required prior to submittal of an application for any land division. A pre-application conference is not mandatory for property line adjustments. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
11.050 Acceptance of Application. The Director will review the application for compliance with established application requirements within thirty (30) working days. If the application is found to be incomplete, the Director will notify the applicant of the reasons, and advise the applicant of the requirements for an acceptable application.
11.060 Expiration Dates. See Section 1.310 for expiration of land division appeals.
[Ord. 5768, 12/7/11; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
11.065 Recording Final Plats. Once city approval is granted for a final plat, it must be recorded with the Linn or Benton County Records Division.
[Ord. 5475, 4/11/2001; Ord. 5768, 12/7/11, Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
11.080 Subsequent Land Divisions and Property Line Adjustments. No subsequent land division or property line adjustment may be approved on the same lot or parcel until the previously approved land division or property line adjustment has been filed and recorded, or the previous approval is withdrawn or otherwise invalidated.
LOT AND BLOCK ARRANGEMENT
11.090 Lot and Block Arrangements. In any single-family residential land division, lots and blocks shall conform to the following standards in this Article and other applicable provisions of this Code:
(1) Lot arrangement must be such that there will be no foreseeable difficulties, for reason of topography or other condition, in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the requirements of this Code with the exception of lots designated Open Space.
(2) Lot dimensions must comply with the minimum standards of this Code. When lots are more than double the minimum area designated by the zoning district, those lots must be arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets where it would be necessary to serve potential lots. An urban conversion plan may be required in conjunction with submittal of tentative subdivision or partition plat.
(3) Double frontage lots shall be avoided except when necessary to provide separation of residential developments from streets of collector and arterial street status or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and/or orientation. When driveway access from arterials is necessary for several adjoining lots, those lots must be served by a combined access driveway in order to limit possible traffic hazards on such streets. The driveway should be designed and arranged so as to avoid requiring vehicles to back into traffic on arterials. An access control strip shall be placed along all lots abutting arterial streets requiring access onto the lesser class street where possible.
(4) Side yards of a lot shall run at right angles to the street the property faces, except that on a curved street the side property line shall be radial to the curve.
(5) Block dimensions shall be determined by existing street and development patterns, connectivity needs, topography, and adequate lot size. The average block length shall not exceed 600 feet unless adjacent layout or physical conditions justify a greater length. Block length is defined as the distance along a street between the centerline of two intersecting through streets (Figure 11.090-1). Physical conditions may include existing development, steep slopes, wetlands, creeks, and mature tree groves. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 3 January 1, 2021
FIGURE 11.090-1. Block Length
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(6) Off-street pedestrian pathways shall be connected to the street network and used to provide pedestrian and bicycle access in situations where a public street connection is not feasible.
(7) The recommended minimum distance between arterial street intersections is 1800 feet. In order to provide for adequate street connectivity and respect the needs for access management along arterial streets, the Community Development Director/City Engineer may require either a right-in/right-out public street connection or public access connection to the arterial in lieu of a full public street connection. When a right-in/right-out street connection is provided, turning movements shall be defined and limited by raised medians to preclude inappropriate turning movements.
(8) The minimum frontage of a lot on a cul-de-sac shall be 22 feet as measured perpendicular to the radius. [Ord. (9) Flag lots are allowed only when absolutely necessary to provide adequate access to buildable sites and only where the dedication and improvement of a public street is determined by the City Engineer to be not feasible or not practical. The minimum width for a flag is 22 feet, except when access is shared by an access and maintenance agreement in which case each lot shall have a minimum width of 12 feet and a combined minimum of 24 feet. [Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
(10) At all street intersections, an arc along the property lines shall be established so that construction of the street at maximum allowable width, centered in the right-of-way, shall require not less than a twenty-foot radius of the curb line. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/00; Ord. 5912, 7/11/18]
PROPERTY LINE ADJUSTMENTS
11.100 Definition. A property line adjustment means the relocation of a common property line between two abutting properties. It occurs when property lines separating two or three properties are moved to add and remove land from the properties. A property line adjustment does not result in the creation of a new lot.
11.110 Procedure. Property line adjustments are reviewed through the Type I procedure, with the Director acting as review body.
11.120 Review Criteria. The Director will approve, approve with conditions, or deny the request for a property line adjustment based on the following criteria:
(1) The property line adjustment does not create a new lot or a land-locked parcel.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
11.240 Definition. A planned development is a master planned environment intended for a variety of related activities. It promotes an integrated, coordinated development of land, normally involving increased flexibility in use and design standards, with special incentives or restrictions on development. A planned development may be primarily residential uses with associated commercial uses, a mixed-use development, or it may be a commercial or industrial development.
11.250 Purposes. The purposes of a Planned Development are to:
(1) Encourage more innovative planning that results in more desirable or sustainable environments or neighborhoods, improved protection of open spaces, transportation options, and site phasing of developments through the application of flexible and diversified land development standards than would otherwise occur under conventional land development procedures; and
(2) Facilitate the efficient use of land and resources in regard to land uses, buildings, circulation systems, natural features, energy conservations, open space and utilities. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 10 January 1, 2021
11.260 Procedure. A planned development is processed in two steps. The first step is review of the planned development project design and land uses by the Planning Commission under the Type III procedure. The final approval is reviewed by the Director through the Type I procedure. [Ord. 5832, 4/9/14]
11.270 Permitted Buildings and Uses. The following buildings and uses are permitted individually or in combination in a planned development:
(1) Residential areas:
(a) Accessory buildings and uses (permitted in combination with principal uses only);
(b) Duplexes;
(c) Dwellings, multiple-family;
(d) Dwellings, single-family;
(e) Open space;
(f) Parks, playgrounds, golf courses, driving ranges, community centers, or recreation facilities supported by the planned development; and
(g) Commercial services to primarily serve the Residential Planned Development.
(2) Industrial areas:
(a) Any use allowed outright through Site Plan Review, or by Conditional Use approval in the underlying zone is permitted. Uses specified as Conditional Uses in the underlying zone are limited to 25 percent of the site except that additional amounts may be approved through the Conditional Use process. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(b) Up to 25 percent of the total site area may be occupied by retail and service establishments not otherwise permitted within industrial districts provided that at least an equal area of the development has been previously or simultaneously developed for other permitted uses.
(c) Up to 25 percent of the total site area may be occupied by office uses not pertinent to industrial uses within the development or otherwise permitted within the underlying zoning district.
(d) Office uses, services, and other accessory uses totally supported by other permitted uses are allowed in addition to the percentage amounts specified above.
11.280 Standards That May Be Modified. The following standards may be modified in order to create developments that are superior to those that could be developed through the conventional development standards:
(1) Development Standards. Minimum lot area, width and frontage, height and yard requirements will not be used to dictate the development but will act as general guidelines that may be adjusted to provide for a higher quality development.
(2) Minimum Parking. Where the development provides common parking areas for adjacent uses, no minimum number of parking spaces will be required. It is the developer’s responsibility to provide adequate off-street parking and loading areas. In proposing the parking areas, the developer shall provide the City with information on expected demand for parking, including trip generation for the uses that share the parking area.
(3) Streets. Private streets may be constructed in a planned development. These streets may be narrower than usual where on-street parking is prohibited and where access is limited to pre-approved locations. Any private street in an industrial planned development must be constructed to public standards. All lots must be provided with direct access to a public or private street.
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 11 January 1, 2021

11.380 Definition. A condominium is a building, or group of buildings, in which units are individually owned, and the structure, common areas and facilities are owned by all of the unit owners on a proportional, undivided basis.
11.390 Procedure. A proposal for new construction of a condominium is reviewed through the planned development process. A proposal for conversion of existing units into condominiums is reviewed through the Conditional Use process in conjunction with planned development requirements. All condominium proposals must meet the appropriate requirements of ORS Chapter 100.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT
11.400 Purpose. Cluster development is intended to protect and/or restore natural and other special features in the development of a site. In return, the more flexible standards found in this section may supersede other stricter standards of this Code. Cluster developments may provide greater flexibility, reduced and/or varied lot sizes, and more variety in permitted uses. Residential density may be transferred within the development in exchange for restoring degraded or marginal quality resources located in a Significant Natural Resource overlay district or for protecting natural or other special features of the site. Developments must satisfy high-quality master planning and design requirements.
[Ord. 5923, 2/8/19]
11.405 Optional Nature. Cluster development is an optional form of development. Cluster development proposals are reviewed as part of the land division, site plan, or Conditional Use application processes.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
11.410 Eligibility. To be eligible to apply for cluster development, all of the following are required:
(1) Residential Zoning. The site must be located in a residential zoning district.
(2) Natural and Other Special Features. The site must contain one or more of the features listed in Section 11.460
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 15 January 1, 2021
(3) Professional Designer. An applicant for cluster development approval must certify in writing that a certified landscape architect, site planner, or landscape designer, approved by the Director, will be used in the planning and design process for the proposed development. [Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
11.420 Relationship to Other Regulations. If the applicant chooses the cluster development option, and the site is deemed eligible by the City, these standards will supplement other provisions of this Code. For example, a subdivision proposed as a cluster development is also subject to other provisions of Article 11 of the Development Code. Other types of residential development are subject to Site Plan Review or Conditional Use review. These provisions apply to issuance of building permits in a cluster development and to ongoing uses and activities in a cluster development.
[Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
11.430 Procedure. Cluster development proposals are reviewed as a Type III procedure.
[Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
11.440 Review Criteria. The review criteria for a cluster development are those that apply to a particular type of development. For example, the tentative plat criteria in Article 11 apply to cluster land divisions. (See Section 11.420 for relation to the other requirements.) Also, the review body must find that the application meets the following additional criterion:
(1) The proposed development meets all of the requirements for cluster development.
(2) The proposed development preserves or restores natural or other special features as identified and prioritized in ADC 11.460.
[Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11;Ord. 5923, 2/8/19]
11.450 Natural Area Requirements. Cluster developments must provide a minimum of 20 percent of the site as permanent natural areas. Land designated as Open Space on the Comprehensive Plan or Zoning maps may not be used to fulfill this requirement.
[Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07; Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
11.460 Designation of Permanent Natural Area. The required natural area may be public or private. The minimum 20 percent of the gross acreage of the development site set aside as natural area in a cluster development should be designated in the following priority order:
(1) The first priority for natural area designation is significant tree groves identified on the South Albany Area Plan Organizational Framework map in the Comprehensive Plan (Figure 1), and Oregon White Oak (Quercus garryana) trees citywide equal to or greater than six and one-half feet in circumference (approximately 25-inches in diameter) measured as defined in Article 9.203(4). For individual trees, the natural area boundary is defined as the critical root zone (as defined in Article 9.203 (1)) plus a 10-foot buffer. [Ord. 5801, 2/13/13; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(2) The second priority for natural area designation is natural resources within the Significant Natural Resource overlay districts that are of degraded or marginal quality and subsequently restored to good quality in accordance with the quality levels in ADC Section 6.410(5). This priority shall be satisfied in the following order:
(a) Habitat for western painted and northwestern pond turtles within the Habitat Assessment Overlay (/HA), as identified by a turtle habitat assessment, that is restored to good quality.
(b) Wetland within the Significant Wetland overlay district (/SW) that is restored to good quality.
(c) Riparian area within the Riparian Corridor overlay district (/RC) that is restored to good quality.
(3) The third priority for natural area designation is protection of other environmentally sensitive areas, natural and scenic features of the site. This priority shall be satisfied in the following order:
(a) Good quality habitat for western painted and northwestern pond turtles near Thornton Lakes within the Habitat Assessment overlay (/HA) as identified by a turtle habitat assessment.
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 16 January 1, 2021
(b) Good quality wetland within the Significant Wetland overlay district (/SW).
(c) Good quality riparian area within the Riparian Corridor overlay district (/RC).
(d) Other wetlands not within the Significant Wetland overlay district, as shown on the City’s Local Wetland Inventories, or by a delineation approved by the Oregon Department of State Lands.
(e) Existing channels identified in the most current version of the City of Albany Storm Water Master Plan.
(f) Springs.
(g) Land with natural slopes 12 percent or greater as designated by the Hillside Development overlay district (/HD).
(h) Wooded area with five or more healthy trees over 25 inches in circumference (approximately eight inches in diameter) measured as defined in Article 9.203(4), if approved by the City Forester. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(i) Land that provides bike or walking trails that connect to existing or proposed parks or trails, inventoried natural features, or areas zoned Open Space; or areas otherwise protected as permanent natural areas.
(j) Incorporate public parks, trails, trailheads or open space designated in the Parks, Recreation and Open Space Plan, the North Albany Refinement Plan, and the South Albany Area Plan.
[Ord. 5801, 2/13/13]
(k) Other features of the site unique to Albany, if approved by the Director.
(4) The fourth priority for natural area designation is to create “open spaces” in and around neighborhoods. This priority is satisfied by any of the following:
(a) Continuity of adjacent open space corridors or parkways.
(b) A network of interconnected open space corridors.
(c) A buffer between neighborhoods.
11.470 Creation of Permanent Natural Areas.
(1) Natural areas in a cluster development may be set aside and managed in one or more of the following ways:
(a) Portions of one or more individual lots; or
(b) Common ownership by residents of the development; or
(c) Third party (non-profit organization) whose primary purpose is to hold or manage the open space, subject to a reversionary clause in the event of dissolution of the non-profit organization; or
(d) Dedicated to City of Albany, if the City agrees to accept ownership and maintain the space.
(2) Except for Subsection (1)(d) above, natural areas shall be subject to restrictive covenants and easements reviewed by the Community Development Director and recorded and filed when the subdivision plat for the project area is recorded. Except when allowed in 11.480, an easement shall include permanent provisions prohibiting the placement of structures or impervious surfaces, alteration of the ground contours, or any other activity or use inconsistent with the purpose of these provisions. [Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
Albany Development Code, Article 11 11 - 17 January 1, 2021
11.480 Protection of Permanent Natural Areas.
(1) If any applicable overlay districts allow it, the development may encroach into permanent natural areas, only under the following circumstances:
(a) Meets the requirements of all overlay districts in Articles 4, 6 and 7; and
(b) The encroachment is necessary to meet transportation, utility infrastructure requirements, or post construction stormwater quality requirements; or
(c) The encroachment is necessary to provide bike or walking trails that connect to existing or proposed parks or trails, inventoried natural features, or areas zoned Open Space or otherwise protected as permanent natural areas. [Ord. 5801, 2/13/13; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(2) Permanent alteration by grading may be authorized for the purpose of natural resource enhancement, such as wetland, riparian, or wildlife habitat restoration.
(3) Significant wetlands, riparian corridors, and intermittent streams preserved as natural areas in a cluster development may be used for conveyance of storm waters only when the applicant has demonstrated that the discharge is compatible with the protection of the natural resource. These natural features shall not be used for drainage improvements, such as detention or retention ponds, or any other utility improvement necessary for development of the lots.
(4) Areas set aside for permanent natural areas in a cluster development cannot be further subdivided.
(5) Fences are permitted in and around the natural areas if consistent with the expressed purpose of the natural areas.
(6) Provisions must be established to ensure the continued maintenance of areas designated as natural areas through Cluster Development. See Section 11.470.
[Ord. 5562, 10/10/03; Ord. 5668, 4/11/07]
11.490 Permitted Uses. The uses allowed within cluster developments outside the permanent natural areas are determined by the underlying zoning district standards in Section 3.050, with the following exceptions:
(1) On development sites greater than 20 acres, up to 20 percent of the housing units in RS-6.5 and RS-10 may be attached single-family or condominium housing.
(2) On development sites greater than 50 acres, up to two acres may be developed with neighborhood commercial uses through a Conditional Use review. The maximum building footprint of commercial or office uses shall be 3,000 square feet. Commercial and office uses shall be limited to restaurants with no drive-through service, and convenience-oriented and personal service-oriented uses as described in Article 22. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Within the South Albany Area Plan boundary, attached single-family and duplexes will be permitted in the RS-5, RS-6.5 and RS-10 zoning districts for up to 25 percent of the total units provided when transferring density within the Oak Creek Transition Area or when transferring density of the area necessary to preserve significant tree groves identified on the South Albany Area Plan Organizational Framework map in the Comprehensive Plan (Figure 1), and oak trees over 25-inches in diameter measured at 4.5 feet from the ground. Developments may not exceed the maximum density by zoning district in 11.495 and must meet all applicable standards in the Code. [Ord. 5801, 2/13/13]
11.495 Development Standards. In a cluster development, the following development standards in Table 11.495-1 supersede the same standards in Section 3.190, Table 3.190-1. The number of allowable dwelling units is based on the maximum density for the zone as specified in the following table.
[Ord. 5923, 2/8/19; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

11.500 Perimeter Lot Compatibility. The following standards and exceptions will apply to the lots on the perimeter of a proposed cluster development.
(1) Standards. The term “standard minimum lot size” as used in this section, means the minimum lot size allowed in the underlying base zone without any reductions in size allowed elsewhere in this Code.
(a) When the proposed cluster development abuts developed property in a lower density residential zoning district, the size of lots on the perimeter of the proposed cluster development shall be at least the standard minimum lot size allowed in the zone underlying the cluster development.
Example:
(b) When the proposed cluster development abuts developed property in the same residential zoning district as the proposed cluster development, the size of lots on the perimeter of the cluster development shall be at least 70 percent of the standard minimum lot size of the underlying zoning district.
Example:
(2) Exceptions. The Perimeter Lot Compatibility standards do not apply in the following cases:
(a) Perimeter lots that are adjacent to land that is zoned for higher density housing, mixed-use or non-residential uses, or to residentially zoned property not in residential use (such as educational, institutional, religious or park uses).
(b) Where the same property owner owns the property abutting the proposed cluster development or when the perimeter lots share a property line with the Urban Growth Boundary.

ARTICLE 12
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
12.000 Overview. This article provides public improvement standards to address the City’s concerns relative to public health, safety, and welfare as it relates to the management of public transportation systems and utilities. These standards are used with the procedural and design requirements contained in other articles of the Albany Development Code. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
The following is a list of the main headings in this article.
■ General Provisions
■ Streets
■ Sidewalks
■ Street Trees
■ Bikeways
■ Utilities—General
■ Water
■ Sanitary Sewer
■ Storm Drainage
■ Improvement Assurances
■ Addresses and Street Names [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07]
GENERAL PROVISIONS
12.010 Authority. The City has jurisdiction and exercises regulatory management over all City right-of-way, franchise utility use of right-of-way, city utilities, and easements benefiting the City of Albany for provision of utility and transportation services. The City is both a service provider and property owner/manager. These responsibilities require decisions to be made in a way that protects the public health, safety, and welfare; and provides for efficient extensions of services. Right-of-way under state or county jurisdiction is also located within the city limits. In those instances, the standards in Article 12 still apply; however, the City may deviate from the standards provided herein as necessary to comply with each agency’s requirements.
(1) As a property owner and service provider, the City has sole discretion over all aspects of managing its utilities, rights-of-way, and related easements. This includes, but is not limited to, access and connection requirements; construction, modification, or alteration of public infrastructure; franchise utility requirements, required extensions of service; and frontage improvements.
(2) The standards in Article 12 are one mechanism used by the City, as a landowner and service provider, to regulate access and connection to public rights-of-way, easements, transportation systems, and utilities, including required extensions of services and frontage improvements with development. Applying these standards requires discretion and professional judgement for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare, and for overall efficient provision of urban services. These standards are not subject to the limitations of ORS 197.307(4). [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.020 Relationship to Other Local Regulations. This article supplements other municipal ordinances. If a provision of this article conflicts with another City ordinance, the ordinance that most specifically deals with the issue in question shall control. Whenever possible, the two provisions shall be interpreted in a manner that renders the provisions of both ordinances consistent. Only when such interpretation is impossible will one provision be deemed to supersede the other.
12.030 Relationship to Specialty Codes or State Law. This article supplements other existing state and local codes. Examples of these codes include, but are not limited to, the adopted building, fire, and plumbing codes. If any provision of this article conflicts with a specialty code, the specialty code shall control.
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 2 January 1, 2021
12.040 Conditions of Approval. Development approval may be conditioned upon the provision and/or guarantee of public improvements called for in an adopted public facilities master plan, or any other public improvements necessitated by the development. Development approval may likewise be conditioned when private facilities are proposed to be shared by two or more parcels. Construction of off-site improvements may be required to mitigate impacts resulting from development that relate to capacity deficiencies and public safety; and/or to upgrade or construct public facilities to City standards.
All development decisions shall be consistent with constitutional limitations concerning the taking of private property for public use.
To provide an adequate transportation system, development approvals may include conditions that require facilities for safe and convenient pedestrian and bicycle access within and from new subdivisions, multi-family developments, planned developments, shopping centers and commercial districts to adjacent residential areas and transit stops, and to neighborhood activity centers within one-half mile of the development.
(1) “Neighborhood activity centers” includes, but is not limited to, existing or planned schools, parks, shopping areas, transit stops or employment centers;
(2) “Safe, convenient and adequate” means bicycle and pedestrian routes, facilities and improvements that:
(a) Are reasonably free from hazards, particularly types or levels of automobile traffic which would interfere with or discourage pedestrian or cycle travel for short trips;
(b) Provide a reasonably direct route of travel between destinations, such as between a transit stop and a store; and
(c) Meet needs of cyclists and pedestrians, considering destination and length of trip, and considering that the optimum trip length of pedestrians is generally 1/4 to 1/2 mile.
[Ord. 5281, 3/26/1997; Ord. 5339, 1/28/1998]
Section 12.045 Repealed by Ordinance 5947, 1/01/21.
12.050 Relationship to Construction Standards. Public improvements shall be designed to comply with adopted facility master plans as much as possible. Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, public improvements shall be constructed according to the standard construction specifications. The standard specifications for construction, reconstruction or repair of streets, sidewalks, curbs, gutters and other public improvements within the City are contained in the City’s “Standard Construction Specifications.” The City Engineer may make changes to the standard specifications consistent with the application of engineering principles to the conditions. [Ord. 5339, 1/28/1998]
STREETS
12.060 General Provisions. No development may occur unless it has frontage on or approved access to a public street currently open to traffic. A currently non-open public right-of-way may be opened by improving it to City standards.
Streets shall be connected to reduce travel distance, provide multiple travel routes, and promote the use of alternative modes. Street patterns have a greater long-range effect on land use patterns, than do parcel patterns or building location.
Streets (including alleys) within and adjacent to a development shall be improved in accordance with the standards in this Article. In addition, any new street or additional street width planned as a portion of an approved street plan shall be dedicated and improved in accordance with this Article.
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 3 January 1, 2021
When the City Engineer determines that a required street improvement would not be timely, the City Engineer may accept a Petition for Improvement/Waiver of Remonstrance for a future assessment district. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
The City Engineer may approve modifications to the required street right-of-way and planter widths when necessary to accommodate approved street-side post-construction stormwater quality facilities.
[Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.070 Creation of Streets. Streets are usually created by approval of a subdivision or partition plat. However, the City Council may also approve creation of a street by acceptance of a deed. If creating a street unintentionally results in a land partition, the owner is not required to apply for partition approval as long as the resulting parcels comply with Code standards.
12.080 Classification of Streets. Arterial and collector streets are designated in the Transportation System Plan.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
12.090 Creation of Access Easements. Creation of easements to provide access to the public street system shall be approved when the applicant has demonstrated that all of the following criteria have been met:
(1) No more than two residentially zoned parcels or uses will be served by the proposed access easement;[Ord. 5947, 1/(2) There is not enough room for a public right-of-way due to topography, lot configuration, or placement of existing buildings; and
(3) The City Engineer has determined that there is no need for a public street in this location.
12.100 Access to Public Streets. With the exceptions noted in Section 1.105, the location and improvement of an access point onto a public street shall be included in the review of a development proposal. In addition, the following specific requirements shall apply to all access points, curb cuts, and driveways:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Approaches and driveways to City streets and alleys must be paved and constructed in accordance with the Standard Construction Specifications. Driveways serving more than one property shall be paved the full length of the shared portion. [Ord. 5720, 08/12/2009]
(2) Driveways for single- and two-family dwellings must have a minimum width of 10 feet and a maximum width of 24 feet (not to exceed the width of the driveway curb cut) and minimum separation of 5 feet.
Up to four multiple-family units that front on a public street may have separate driveways. The driveways shall meet the same standards as for single- and two-family dwellings.
Driveways for all other uses must have widths of 12-16 feet for one-lane (one-way) driveways, 24-32 feet for two-lane driveways, and 36 feet for three-lane driveways. Three-lane driveways must have designated lanes and turning movements. Industrial driveways shall have a width of 24-48 feet. There must be a minimum separation of 22 feet between all driveways except for single- and two-family dwellings, and multi-family dwellings of four units or less. The width of a driveway will be determined by measuring at the curb line and will exclude the transitions which must conform to standards fixed by the City Engineer. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) All driveways must be located as far as practical from a street intersection, and in no instance shall the distance from an intersection be less than the following, as measured from the nearest curb return radius:
Arterial Street 40 feet
Collector Street 20 feet
Local Street 10 feet
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 4 January 1, 2021
At intersections with bulb-outs or post-construction stormwater quality curb extensions incorporated into the curb return the measurement will be made from the nearest curb return radius. When different classes of streets intersect, the distance required is between an access point and the intersection of the street type that requires the greater distance. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(4) The location, width, and number of accesses to a public street may be limited for developments that are subject to land use review. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(5) Access points to a public street shall be the minimum necessary to provide reasonable access while not inhibiting the safe circulation and carrying capacity of the street. [Ord. 5720. 8/12/2009]
(6) Properties with frontage on more than one street may be restricted to access on the street(s) of a lower classification through site plan, land division, or other review procedures.
(7) A common access point at a property line is encouraged and may be required in order to reduce the number of access points to streets. Construction of common access points must be preceded by recording of joint access and maintenance easements.
(8) With the exception of single-family residential development, approach grades must not exceed 10 percent slope within 20 feet of a public street. Driveways for single-family residential development shall comply with applicable fire and building codes.
(9) Access to designated state highways is subject to the provisions of this Article in addition to requirements of the State Highway Division and State Department of Transportation. When regulations of the City and State conflict, the more restrictive requirements apply.
(10) For developments on property larger than five acres in contiguous ownership fronting on an arterial street or limited access highway, a frontage road may be required in order to provide a single access determined by the review body to be the most appropriate location for safety and convenience.
(11) When access is allowed on an arterial street, efforts shall be made to locate it adjacent to the interior property line where it could be shared by the adjacent property.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/1998; Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
12.110 Street Location, Width and Grade. The location, width, and grade of all streets must conform to any approved transportation master plan or recorded subdivision plat. When location of a street is not shown in an approved street plan, the arrangement of streets in a development shall either provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in the surrounding areas or conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the City to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions made continuance of or conformance to existing streets impractical or where no plan has been previously adopted.
In addition, new streets may be required to be located where the City Engineer determines that additional access is needed to relieve or avoid access deficiencies on adjacent or nearby properties. In determining the location of new streets in a development or street plan, consideration shall be given to maximizing available solar access for adjoining development sites.
Street grades must be approved by the City Engineer, who will consider drainage and traffic safety.
12.120 Rights-of-Way and Roadway Widths. Unless otherwise indicated on an approved street plan or in Section 12.130, the street right-of-way and roadway widths shall not be less than the minimum shown below in Table 12.120-1. Where a range is indicated, the width shall be determined by the City Engineer. Reductions in roadway width may be allowed to facilitate curb extensions required for approved street side post-construction stormwater quality facilities in the landscape strip/planter area. Reductions require approval of the City Engineer. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 5 January 1, 2021
TABLE 12.120-1. Street right-of-way and roadway width requirements. Minimum Rights-of-Way Minimum Roadway Type of Street Width Width
Arterial 70-120 feet 40-70 feet
Collector 60-80 feet 36-48 feet
Local* 52-56 feet 28-32 feet
Radius for turnaround at end of cul-de-sac 43 feet 36 feet
Alley 14-20 feet 12-20 feet
*When street rights-of-way are less than 60 feet wide, a parallel public utility easement 7-feet-wide shall be dedicated on both sides of the right-of-way unless waived by the City Engineer.

12.122 Local Residential Streets. There are two classes of local streets, based on projected traffic volumes. The applicant is responsible for demonstrating that each proposed street is designed for the appropriate traffic volume.
Locating approved street-side post-construction stormwater quality facilities in the landscape strip is encouraged. To accommodate the facilities, the City Engineer may approve isolated reductions in roadway width for curb extensions and larger landscape strip areas from those shown in the following subsections. The City Engineer may also approve locating the back of sidewalk immediately adjacent to the property line. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(1) Minor Local Streets. The minor local street design is intended to be the predominant street type in residential neighborhoods. A minor local street will have fewer than 1,000 average trips per day (ADT) when all future street connections are made. The standard design is a 30-foot-wide paved surface with curb and gutter, a 6-foot landscape strip, and a 5-foot sidewalk on each side within a 54-foot right-of-way. A parallel 7-foot public utility easement is dedicated on each side of the street unless waived by the City Engineer. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street. See Figure 12.122-1. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 6 January 1, 2021
(2) Network Local Streets. A network local street will have more than 1,000 ADT. The standard design is a 32-foot-wide paved surface with curb and gutter, a 6-foot landscape strip, and a 5-foot sidewalk on each side within a 56-foot right-of-way. A parallel 7-foot public utility easement is dedicated on each side of the street unless waived by the City Engineer. Parking is allowed on both sides of the street. See Figure 12.122-2.

[Alley Option removed by Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
(3) Narrow Network Local Street Option. The City Engineer may approve a narrow network local street design with a 28-foot-wide paved surface with curb and gutter, a 6-foot landscape strip, and a 5-foot sidewalk on each side within a 52-foot right-of-way. A parallel 7-foot public easement is dedicated on each side of the street unless waived by the City Engineer. Parking is restricted to one side of the street. See Figure 12.122-3.

(4) Residential Street Design for Constrained Sites. Natural features may constrain the standard local
street design. Examples of such natural features include floodplains, steep slopes, drainageways,
wetlands, riparian corridors, and tree groves. Through the subdivision or planned development
review process, the City will consider a narrower street section that does not compromise the goals
for street design in a great neighborhood. For example, the sidewalks may be placed curbside and
parking may be removed from the street in order to narrow the street paving and preserve natural
areas. See Figure 12.122-4. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

12.130 Mini-Subdivision and Partition Street and Rights-of-Way Standards. The standards in this section are
intended for use in developing residential infill parcels. The review body will approve variations to the
standards listed in Section 12.120 above, when the following criteria are met: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) The property to be divided is less than two acres and no more than eight lots will be created or served
by the street; and
(2) The proposed land division, as a whole, meets the standards for lot size and configuration for the
zoning district; and
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 9 January 1, 2021
(3) Surrounding parcels are developed or are physically incapable of being developed so that combining the proposed land division with adjoining properties in a conventional land division is not feasible.
(4) The property is not needed for continuing the adjacent public street pattern. However, pedestrian connections may be required for continuing the pedestrian circulation system.
The review body may also modify other standards in this Code as indicated in Table 12.130-1 below:

(b) Maximum street length is 400 feet.
(c) A “hammerhead” turnaround may be allowed only if no more than four residential lots are created, and the City Engineer determines that no other options exist and no traffic hazards will be created.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.140 Additional Rights-of-Way. A development project requiring land use review is required to dedicate additional right-of-way if an existing street abutting or within the development does not meet the widths designated in Section 12.120. This provision does not apply to property line adjustments or historic review. While not required to dedicate additional right-of-way, single- and two-family dwellings (and related accessory buildings) and parking lot and building additions listed in Section 1.105 are subject to setbacks from future street rights-of-way as provided in Section 3.190.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.150 Future Extensions of Streets. When it is necessary to give access to or permit a future division of adjoining land, streets shall be extended to the adjoining tract. A barricade at the end of the street shall be installed and paid for by the property owners. It shall not be removed until authorized by the City Engineer.
[Ord. 5720, 8/12/2009]
12.160 Street Alignment. As far as practical, streets shall be dedicated and constructed in alignment with existing streets. Arterial and collector streets shall have continuous alignments without offset or staggered intersections. In no case shall streets be designed so that jogs of less than 300 feet are created as measured from the centerline of any intersection involving an arterial or collector street.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/1998]
12.170 Intersections. Streets must intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. Proposed intersection of two streets at an acute angle of less than 75 degrees is not allowed. An oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection to provide at least 100 feet of street at right angles with the intersection. Not more than two streets shall intersect at any one point.
12.180 Clear Vision Area. A clear vision area must be maintained at each access to a public street and on each corner of property at the intersection of two streets or a street and a railroad. No fence, wall, hedge, sign, or other planting or structure that would impede visibility between the heights of 2 and 8 feet shall be established in the clear vision area. Visibility is not considered impeded by a fence where materials are 35 percent or less of the surface area of that portion of the fence above 2 feet. Fence posts spaced at 8 feet or more apart are not counted as part of the fence surface area. Height measurements shall be made from the top of the curb or, when no curb exists, from the established street center line grade.
[Ord. 5689, 3/12/2008]
(1) The clear vision area provisions do not apply to the following:
(a) a public utility pole,
(b) a tree trimmed (to the trunk) to a line at least eight feet above the level of the intersection,
(c) another plant species of open growth habit that is not planted in the form of a hedge and that is planted and trimmed to leave at all seasons a clear and unobstructed cross-view,
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 10 January 1, 2021
(d) a supporting member or appurtenance to a permanent building lawfully existing on the date this standard becomes effective,
(e) an official warning sign or signal,
(f) the post section of a pole sign when there are no more than two posts and any post is less than eight inches in diameter, and
(g) existing or new buildings that meet the minimum setbacks.
[Ord. 5689, 3/12/2008; Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
(2) A clear vision area consists of a triangular area:
(a) For residential local streets and driveways, two sides of the clear vision area are lot lines or a driveway for a distance specified in Table 12.180-1 below, with a third line running diagonally across the non-intersecting ends of the two sides (see illustration below, Figure 12.180-1). Where lots have rounded corners, the lot lines shall be extended in a straight line to a point of intersection. [Ord. 5886, 1/6/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

[Ord. 5886, 1/6/17; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.190 Cul-de-sacs. The street pattern may include cul-de-sacs and bulbs only if connectivity and block length standards have been met. A cul-de-sac must not exceed 400 feet. A cul-de-sac must end in a circular turnaround, except as provided in 12.130 (4)(c). Dead-end streets longer than 400 feet may be approved by the City Engineer if no other means is available for development of the property.
A 10-foot-wide lighted concrete bikeway/pedestrian accessway shall be dedicated and constructed from the end of each cul-de-sac to the nearest street or property line of adjacent property, except where the cul-de-sac abuts developed property and/or the City Engineer determines there is no need for a connection.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/1998; Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
12.200 Street Abutting New Development. Sections of existing streets that directly abut a new development and do not meet City standards shall be constructed to City standards. The City Engineer may approve construction of a partial-width street, provided the design is determined to be adequate to accommodate needed public facilities, storm drainage runoff, traffic volumes, and traffic loadings. The design of the improvement shall consider the ultimate design of the fully widened street. For purposes of this section, “development” does not include the construction of a single-family home or a duplex on an existing lot.
[Ord. 5886, 1/6/17]
A future improvement assurance, as described in Section 12.600, may be accepted by the City when the City Engineer determines that the street improvement would not be timely. [Ord. 5338, 1/28/1998]
12.210 Slope and Curves. Slope shall not exceed 6 percent on arterials, 10 percent on collector streets, or 12 percent on other streets. Center line radii or curves shall be not less than 600 feet on arterials, 400 feet on collectors, or 200 feet on other streets. When existing conditions, particularly the topography, make it otherwise impractical to provide buildable sites, steeper grades and sharper curves may be approved by the review body. In flat areas, allowance shall be made for finished street grades having a minimum slope of at least 0.5 percent, when possible.
12.220 Street Adjacent to Railroad. Whenever a proposed development contains or is adjacent to a railroad right-of-way, provision may be required for a street approximately parallel to and on each side of the railroad right-of-way at a distance suitable for appropriate use of the land between each street and the railroad. The distance shall be determined with consideration at each cross street of the minimum distance required for approach grades to a future grade separation and to provide sufficient depth to allow screen planting along the railroad right-of-way in non-industrial areas.
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 12 January 1, 2021
12.230 Access to Arterials. When a residential development abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial street, the development design shall separate residential access and through traffic; or if separation is not feasible, the design shall minimize the traffic conflicts. The design requirements may include any of the following: [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) A parallel access street along the arterial;
(2) Lots abutting the arterial of suitable depth to provide adequate buffering and having frontage along another street;
(3) Screen planting at the rear or side property line to be contained in a non-access reservation along the arterial; or
(4) Other treatment, as determined by the Director, suitable to meet the objectives of this subsection.
12.240 Property Monuments. Upon completion of a street improvement and before acceptance by the City, all property corners and other monuments disturbed or removed by the project shall be reestablished and protected by an Oregon-licensed surveyor retained by the developer.
12.250 Private Streets. Unless the review body determines that public streets are needed to provide for circulation and/or access to neighboring properties, private streets are permitted within planned unit developments, manufactured home parks, and singly-owned developments of sufficient size to warrant interior circulation on private streets. Streets classified as arterials or collectors that run through these developments must be public streets. Local streets needed for connectivity purposes shall be public streets. Gated residential streets are prohibited. Private streets shall be designed and constructed with a 20-year design life. Plats for developments containing private streets must show that streets are private and that upkeep and maintenance are the responsibility of the abutting property owners. The review body may require legal assurances for the construction and continued maintenance of private streets.
[Ord. 5338, 1/28/98; Ord. 5445, 4/12/00]
12.260 Traffic Signals. Where a single development or concurrent group of developments will create a need for a traffic signal at an intersection, such installation may be a condition of development approval.
12.270 Railroad Crossings. When an adjacent development results in a need to install or improve a railroad crossing, such improvement may be a condition of development approval.
12.280 Street Signs. The City shall approve the installation of all street signs, relative to traffic control and street names, as specified by the City Engineer for any development. The applicant shall provide and install all required street and traffic control signs. [Ord. 5720, 8/12/2009]
SIDEWALKS
12.290 Requirement. All development for which land use applications are required must include sidewalks adjacent to public streets. This requirement also applies to new single-family houses and duplexes if they are located on arterial or collector streets or on curbed local streets, if there is an existing sidewalk within 500 feet on the same side of the street. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Sidewalks shall be built when arterial and collector streets are constructed and at the discretion of the City Engineer during their reconstruction. This provision shall also apply to local streets that serve commercial and multi-family development. Sidewalks are required on both sides of all streets. If an interim street standard is being constructed which does not include bike lanes or sidewalks, interim bikeways or walkways for pedestrians shall be provided by paved roadway shoulders at least 8 feet wide on arterials and 6 feet on other streets. Provision of sidewalks may be waived when the street serves a use or combination of uses that generate fewer than 50 trips a day (based on ITE standards) and cannot be continued or extended to other properties. [Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
12.300 Design, Width, and Location. All sidewalks must be constructed, replaced or repaired in accordance with the Standard Construction Specifications. The required width and location of sidewalks is as follows:
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 13 January 1, 2021
(1) The required width for a sidewalk on an arterial or collector street is 7 feet. This may be reduced to 6 feet if the sidewalk is separated from the curb by a landscaped planter strip at least 5 feet wide. When there is inadequate right-of-way for additional width and no additional right-of-way can be obtained as a condition of development approval, the sidewalk width may be reduced to 5 feet. In all cases, any right-of-way remaining outside the sidewalk is to be landscaped and maintained by the adjoining property owner.
(2) Sidewalks along residential and other local streets must be at least 5 feet wide. A planter strip at least 6 feet wide shall separate the sidewalk from the street. Curbside sidewalk is allowed on cul-de-sac bulbs. Street trees shall be selected from the list of approved street trees established by the City. The planter strip shall be of permeable materials. Locating approved street-side post-construction stormwater quality facilities in the planter strip is encouraged.
[Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) In the Historic Downtown and Central Business districts, as defined on the zoning map, sidewalks must be at least 10 feet wide and be installed adjacent to the curb.
(4) Regardless of other provisions contained in this article, any sidewalk project that is less than 200 feet in length and connects on either end to an existing sidewalk may be designed to match the existing pattern with the approval of the City Engineer.
(5) When obstructions exist or are proposed (including, but not limited to, mailboxes, utility poles, trees, planters, fire hydrants, signs, benches, bus stops, post-construction stormwater quality facilities, etc.), provisions must be made to maintain a minimum of 4 feet of unobstructed sidewalk width on local streets, 5 feet on collector and arterial streets, and 6 feet in the Historic Downtown (HD) and Central Business (CB) districts. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
(6) Clustered mailboxes shall be on an accessible path and shall include a 72” minimum accessible turning space. Adjacent sidewalks may be incorporated in the measurement of the turning space. Where constructed in the public right-of-way, construction shall be in accordance with the Standard Construction Specifications. [Ord. 5780, 5/09/12]
(7) Maintenance of sidewalks and planter strips shall be the continuing obligation of the adjacent property owner except for approved post-construction stormwater quality facilities located in planter strips or when a double frontage single- or two-family lot backs onto an arterial. Other than approved post-construction stormwater quality facilities, planter strips shall be landscaped and maintained in like manner to the front yard setback requirements of Article 9.
[Ord. 5842, 1/01/15; Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(8) Sidewalks shall be designed to parallel streets in line and grade and shall avoid unnecessary meandering from the curb line and elevation changes except as necessary to avoid significant trees or traverse topographic barriers.
(9) Public paths not adjacent to a public street shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide.
[Ord. 5445, 4/12/2000]
12.310 Conformance to Street Grades. All sidewalks constructed adjacent to a street must be placed upon the street grade as established at the time of sidewalk construction. If a space is left between the property line and the sidewalk and/or between the sidewalk and the curb, the space shall be filled and surfaced with earth or other approved material level with the sidewalk. Exceptions to level grade between the sidewalk and curb are allowed with approved street-side post-construction stormwater quality facilities.
[Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
12.320 Timing of Sidewalk Construction. In some instances, sidewalk construction may be deferred until the proposed improvement on the property is completed. Deferral of sidewalk construction requires the approval of the City Engineer. No occupancy permit shall be issued by the Building Official for a development until the provisions of this Article are satisfied. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 14 January 1, 2021
The City Engineer may authorize a future improvement assurance (as described in Section 12.600) when, in their opinion, the construction of the sidewalk is impractical for one or more of the following reasons:
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(1) Sidewalk grades have not been and cannot be established for the property in question within a reasonable length of time;
(2) Forthcoming installation of public utilities or street paving would be likely to cause severe damage to the new sidewalk;
(3) Street right-of-way is insufficient to accommodate a sidewalk on one or both sides of the street; or
(4) Topography or elevation of the sidewalk base area makes construction of a sidewalk impractical or economically infeasible.
STREET TREES
12.321 General Requirements. When a new public street is created in conjunction with development or when required by the design standards in Article 8, street trees are required in accordance with the standards provided in the Standard Construction Specifications and the Urban Forestry Management Plan.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.324 Street Tree Planting Options. Options available to meet this requirement are identified below. Where street side post-construction stormwater quality facilities are proposed on a new public street, the option selected must match the planting option selected for the post-construction stormwater quality facilities as identified in Title 12 of the Albany Municipal Code:
(1) Submit a street tree plan to the City for planting and establishing trees within the public rights-of-way that meets the tree planting standards in the Urban Forestry Management Plan. The City Forester shall either approve or deny the plan based on the plan’s compliance with these requirements.
(2) Pay a fee to the City based upon a requirement for one tree per thirty linear feet of street frontage. This fee shall be deposited into the City’s Urban Forestry Program Fees Fund. The City shall thereafter assume responsibility for the purchase, planting, and establishment of street trees within the public right-of-way or on public lands maintained by the City within or abutting the specified development. [Ord. 5673, 6/27/07; Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
BIKEWAYS
12.330 Master Bikeways Plan. The City’s Transportation System Plan identifies existing and proposed bicycle facilities. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.340 Provisions for Bikeways. Developments adjoining or containing proposed bikeways identified in the Transportation System Plan shall construct and extend said facilities to and through the property’s frontage and along its interior, or to a point identified by the City Engineer to accommodate likely system expansion. Where the City Engineer has determined construction is untimely, provisions shall be made for the future construction and extension of said facilities.
In the case of arterial or collector streets, bike facilities shall be built during their construction and considered during their reconstruction. This provision shall also apply to local streets in other than single-family residential developments. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.350 Bikeway Design. The design of on-street bike lanes and facilities shall be in accordance with the Transportation System Plan and the City’s Engineering Standards, and must be approved by the City Engineer. The minimum width for two-way bikeways not on a roadway shall be 10 feet. A reduction in standards may be allowed when the City Engineer finds that no safety hazard will be created and special circumstances (such as physical constraints) exist. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 15 January 1, 2021
UTILITIES—GENERAL
12.360 Utility Easements. The developer shall make arrangements with the City of Albany and each utility franchise for the provision and dedication of utility easements necessary to provide full services to the development. All utility easements must be public easements.
12.370 Utility Easement Width. The standard width for public utility easements adjacent to street rights-of-way is 7 feet. The minimum width for all other public utility easements shall be 15 feet for water, 20 feet for sewer, and 15 feet for piped storm drainage unless otherwise specified by the utility provider.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.380 Information on Development Plans. The developer must show easements for all utilities. Plans showing the location of all utilities shall be submitted to the City as part of the Site Plan Review or land division process. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.390 Requirement for Underground Utilities. Except as exempted in Section 12.400, all utility lines, cables, or wires (including but not limited to those used for electricity, communication, street lighting, and cable television) constructed upon, adjacent to, or within land subdivided or prepared for development after the effective date of this Code, must be placed underground. The intent of the City is that no poles, towers, or other structures associated with utility facilities shall be permitted on any street or lot within such a subdivision or development.
12.400 Exceptions. Overhead facilities are only permitted in the following instances:
(1) Emergency installations, electric transmission lines, or through feeders operating at distribution voltages which act as a main source of supply to primary laterals and to direct connected distribution transformers and primary loads.
Should it be necessary to increase the capacity of major power transmission facilities for service to the area, new or revised installations shall be made only on rights-of-way or easements on which overhead facilities exist at the time of the capacity increase.
(2) Appurtenances and associated equipment such as surface-mounted transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, meter cabinets, telephone cable closures, and connection boxes, which cannot feasibly be located underground. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(3) Structures without overhead wires, used exclusively for fire alarm boxes, street lights, or municipal equipment installed under the supervision and with the approval of the City Engineer.
(4) Power substations, pumping plants, and similar facilities which are necessary for transmission or distribution of utility services and which cannot feasibly be located underground.
[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(5) Television antennas and satellite dishes [see Section 3.080 (12)].
(6) Onsite improvement for industrial developments. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(7) Certain industries requiring exceptionally large power supplies may request direct overhead power as a condition of site plan approval. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
(8) New development on existing individual lots of record in areas where service is currently by overhead utilities.
12.405 Property Monuments. Upon completion of a utility project and before acceptance by the City, all property corners and other monuments disturbed or removed by the project shall be reestablished and protected by an Oregon-licensed surveyor retained by the developer.
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 16 January 1, 2021
WATER
12.410 When Public Water is Available. All new development, including a single-family residence, must extend and connect to the public water system when service is available within 150 feet of the property. Fire hydrants, mains, and related appurtenances shall be installed as required by the City Fire Marshal.
12.420 When Public Water is Not Available. No new development is allowed on private well systems, except for construction of one single-family dwelling on an existing lot of record. Residential lots created by a land partition may be served by private wells if approved by the City, and provided the new lots are subject to a Petition for Improvement/Waiver of Remonstrance for a future assessment district for public water. If a second partition plat is filed on the same parcel, the application will be subject to the subdivision requirement that the development be served by public water.
12.430 Extension Along Property Frontage and Within Interior. Water distribution mains must be extended along the full length of the property’s frontage along the right-of-way or to a point identified by the City Engineer as necessary to accommodate likely system expansion. Main extensions may be required through the interior of properties when necessary to provide service to other properties or to provide looping for fire flows.
12.440 Water Plan Approval. Preliminary water plans and systems must be submitted to the City Engineer as part of the tentative plat or Site Plan Review application. These plans must provide enough information to enable the City Engineer to determine that the proposed development is feasible, but are not required to be detailed construction level documents. The City’s Engineering Standards, while not land use criteria, may be used, in whole or in part, by the City Engineer to determine the feasibility of a proposed plan.
[Ord. 5720, 8/12/2009]
12.450 Design Requirements for New Development. All new development within the City must, when appropriate, make provisions for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal water lines serving surrounding areas.

SANITARY SEWERS
12.470 When Public Sewer is Available. All new development must extend and connect to the public sewer system when service is available within 300 feet of the property.
12.480 When Public Sewer is Not Available. Where sewer is not available within 300 feet of the property, no development is allowed on private septic systems, except for construction of one single-family dwelling on an existing lot of record or on a parcel no smaller than five acres created through the land division process. Any private on-site system allowed by this section must be approved by the county.
12.490 Extension Along Property Frontage and Within Interior. Sewer collection mains must be extended along the full length of the property's frontage along the right-of-way or to a point identified by the City Engineer as necessary to accommodate likely system expansion.

12.520 Restriction of Development. The review body may restrict development approvals where a deficiency exists in the sewer system or portion thereof that cannot be corrected as a part of the development improvements.
STORM DRAINAGE
12.530 General Provisions. The review body will approve a development request only when adequate provisions for storm and flood water run-off have been made as determined by the City Engineer. The storm water drainage system must be separate from and independent of any sanitary sewer system. When possible, inlets should be provided so surface water is not carried across any intersection or allowed to flood any street. Surface water drainage patterns and proposed storm drainage must be shown on every development proposal plan. All proposed storm drainage management plans and systems must be approved by the City Engineer as part of the tentative plat or Site Plan Review process. [Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]

[Ord. 5947, 1/01/21]
12.560 Effect on Downstream Drainage Facilities. When the City Engineer anticipates that the run-off resulting from the development will overload or cause damage to an existing drainage facility, the review body will withhold approval of the development until provisions have been made for improvement, or prevention, of said potential condition. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
12.570 Storm Drainage Management Practices. Development must employ storm drainage management practices approved by the City Engineer that minimize the amount and rate of surface water run-off into receiving streams or drainage facilities or onto adjoining properties. As required by Title 12 of the Albany Municipal Code, the development must also employ post-construction storm water quality management practices approved by the City Engineer that regulate the quality of the stormwater leaving the site. Drainage management practices must include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following practices:
(1) Temporary and permanent ponding or detention of water;
(2) Post-construction stormwater quality facilities;

12.580 Design Requirements for New Development. All new development within the City must, when appropriate, provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing storm drain lines or drainageways serving surrounding areas. Extensions may be required through the interior of a property to be developed when the City Engineer determines that the extension is needed to provide service to upstream properties. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
12.581 Restriction of Development. The review body may restrict development approvals where a deficiency exists in the storm water system or portion thereof that cannot be corrected as part of the development improvements. [Ord. 5842, 1/01/15]
12.585 NPDES Permit Required. A National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit must be obtained from the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) for construction activities (including clearing, grading, and excavation) that disturb one or more acre of land, or whatever the current standard is at the time the application is submitted. [Ord. 5720, 8/12/09]
IMPROVEMENT ASSURANCES
12.590 Purpose. The purpose of improvement assurances is to provide the City with a guarantee that the improvements called for in this article, whether public or private, will be made. The type of guarantee will be determined by the City. Before issuing or renewing a development approval when the applicant has an obligation to design and construct improvements shown on the development plan, the review body may require that the applicant acknowledge the obligation.
12.600 Form and Contents. The assurance shall contain the time within which the obligation is to be met. It may take the form of a surety or performance bond, cash, a negotiable security deposit, a mutual improvement agreement, a monetary contribution to a fund for future improvements if established by a separate city ordinance, or other guarantees approved by the City Attorney sufficient to cover the cost of the work as estimated by the City. The bond shall be conditioned upon the developer’s carrying out the obligation and fulfilling the other requirements of this Title that bear on the approval of the development. The deposit or bond shall be forfeited to the City if the developer does not fulfill the requirements. The bond or deposit shall remain in the custody of the City until the obligation is completed or the bond or deposit is forfeited, or shall be placed in an escrow account subject to City control.
12.610 Noncompliance with Provisions Under Obligation. If the Director finds that a developer is not fulfilling an obligation, the Director shall, in written notice to the developer and the developer’s surety, specify the details of noncompliance. Unless the Director allows more time for compliance because of circumstances beyond the developer’s control, within 30 days after receiving the notice, the developer or the developer’s surety shall begin compliance and proceed diligently to complete fulfillment of the obligation.
Albany Development Code, Article 12 12 - 19 January 1, 2021
(1) If the developer or the developer’s surety does not begin compliance within the 30 days or the additional time allowed by the Director, or has begun but fails to diligently complete the compliance, or the compliance is otherwise not completed within the time specified in granting the development approval, the City may take the following action:
(a) Enter upon the site of the development and carry out the obligation in accordance with the provisions agreed upon under the acknowledgement;
(b) Notify the developer and the developer’s surety of the developer’s failure to perform as required by this Code;
(c) Demand payment from the developer for the unfulfilled obligation;
(d) If the security for the obligation is a bond, notify the surety that has furnished the bond that reimbursement for the expense for fulfillment of the obligation is due and payable to the City or, if the security is a deposit of cash or other assets, appropriate as much of the deposit as is necessary to recoup the expense; or
(e) Void all approvals granted in reliance on the improvement assurance.
(2) If a bond or other required security is not sufficient to compensate the City for expenses necessary to fulfill the obligation, the amount due to the City for the obligation is a lien in favor of the City and upon the entire contiguous real property of the owner of the land subject to the obligation.
(3) The lien attaches upon the filing with the City Recorder of notice of the claim for the amount due for the fulfillment of the obligation. The notice shall demand the amount due, allege the insufficiency of the bond or other security to compensate the City fully for the expense of the fulfillment of the obligation, and allege the developer’s failure to do the required obligation.
(4) The lien may be foreclosed in the manner prescribed by law for foreclosing other liens on real property.
(5) The remedies set forth for non-compliance are cumulative. In addition to the remedies set forth above, non-compliance by the developer or the developer’s surety with any term of a performance guarantee shall entitle the city to pursue any civil remedy permitted by law.

Albany Development Code, Article 13 13-1 January 1, 2021
ARTICLE 131
SIGNS
13.000 Overview. This article contains the City’s standards for signage.
The following is a list of the main headings in this article.
▪ General Provisions
▪ General Sign Regulations
▪ Exemptions
▪ Temporary Signs or Displays
▪ Permanent Signs
▪ Review Procedures
▪ Variances
▪ Nonconforming Signs
▪ Definitions
GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.110 Purpose.
(1) While signs communicate all types of helpful information, unregulated signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, illumination, movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values; the character of the various neighborhoods; the creation of a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens and encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size, and purpose of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid provision.
(2) A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection, or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral, but accessory and subordinate, part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to establish limitations on signs to ensure they are appropriate to the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests identified in subsection (1) of this section.
(3) These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
(4) These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.
(5) These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs.
1 Entire article replaced with Ordinance 5909, June 27, 2018.
Albany Development Code, Article 13 13-2 January 1, 2021
13.120 Applicability.
(1) No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, demolish, equip, use, or maintain any sign or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of this article.
(2) This article shall not be construed to permit the erection or maintenance of any sign at any place or in any manner unlawful under any other city code provision or other applicable law. In any case where a part of this article conflicts with a provision of any development, building, fire, safety, or health ordinance or code, the provision which establishes a stricter standard for the protection of the public health and safety shall prevail.
(3) Where signs within or extending into the public right-of-way require Public Works Department approval, the action giving approval for such signs may contain any condition(s) which the Public Works Department deems necessary to ensure safety, proper maintenance, and appearance and removal of such sign when required.
(4) This article is not intended to and does not restrict speech on the basis of its content, viewpoint or message. Any classification of signs in this chapter that permits speech by reason of the type of sign, identity of the sign user or otherwise, shall permit any type of speech on the sign. No part of this chapter shall be construed to favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech. To the extent any provision of this chapter is ambiguous, the term shall be interpreted to not regulate on the basis of speech content, and the interpretation resulting in the least restriction on the content of the sign message shall prevail.

22.010 Introduction to the Use Categories. This section classifies land uses and activities into use categories based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics. The use categories provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future uses to zones. The decision to allow or prohibit the use categories in the various zones is based on the zoning district purpose statements.
The Schedules of Permitted Uses (by zoning district), special conditions and the development standards are located in Article 3, Residential Zoning Districts; Article 4, Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts; and Article 5, Mixed Use Village Center Zoning Districts. The environmental performance standards in Article 9, On-site Development and Environmental Standards, may limit the placement of certain uses in some zoning districts.

22.020 Description of Use Categories.
(1) Considerations. Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely describes the nature of the primary use. Each use category is described and defined. Developments may have more than one primary use. Developments may also have one or more accessory uses. The following are considered in determining what category the use is in, and whether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory uses:
• The description of the activity(ies) in relationship to the characteristics of each use category;
• The relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity;
• Relative amounts of sales from each activity;
• The customer type for each activity;
• The relative number of employees in each activity;
• Hours of operation;
• Building and site arrangement;
• Vehicles used with the activity;
• The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity;
• Signs;
• How the use advertises itself; and
• Whether the activity would be likely to be found independent of other activities on the site.
(2) Developments with multiple primary uses. When all of the primary uses of a development fall into one use category, the development is assigned to that use category. For example, a development that contains a retail bakery and a café would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all of the primary uses are in that category. When the primary uses of a development fall into different use categories, each primary use is classified in the applicable category and is subject to the regulations for that category.
(3) Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are incidental to the primary use category and may contribute to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of the principal use. Examples of accessory uses include but are not limited to storage, employee and customer parking, and employee facilities. These uses are allowed by right in conjunction with the use unless stated otherwise in the regulations. Unless otherwise stated, they are subject to the same regulations as the primary use. [Ord. 5742, 7/14/10]
Lists of accessory uses were deleted from the use categories in Sections 22.030 to 22.370 by Ord. 5742, adopted 7/14/10].
Albany Development Code, Article 22 22 - 3 January 1, 2021
(4) Use Examples. The “Use Examples” subsection of each use category provides a list of examples of uses that are included in the category. The names of uses on the lists are generic. They are based on the common meaning of the terms and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use whose business name is “Wholesale Liquidation” but that sells mostly to consumers would be included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and Service category.
INDUSTRIAL USE CATEGORIES
22.030 Contractors and Industrial Services.
(1) Contractors and industrial services uses perform services or provide materials related to building construction or remodeling, and the repair or servicing of industrial, business or consumer machinery, equipment, products or by-products.

Water-Dependent: A use or activity that can be carried out only on, in, or adjacent to water areas because the use requires access to the water body for waterborne transportation, recreation, energy production, or source of water.
Albany Development Code, Article 22 22 - 31 January 1, 2021
Water-Oriented Use: Any use that received a demonstrable benefit from being located with a view of the river. Examples might include restaurants, residential structures, and commercial structures when river views are incorporated into the design of the river.
Water-Related: Uses that are not directly dependent upon access to a water body, but that provide goods or services that are directly associated with water-dependent land or waterway use and which, if not located adjacent to water, would result in a public loss of quality in the goods or services offered.
Wetland: Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Wrecking Yard, Motor Vehicles, and Building Materials: Any premises used for the storage, dismantling, or sale of used motor vehicles, trailers, machinery and/or building materials, or parts.
Yard: Any open space that is required, created, or is maintained on a lot and is not obstructed from the ground up by any structure or building.

Yard, Interior: Any yard, required or otherwise, that is not a front yard and that is adjacent to an interior lot line.
Zoning District: A classification of land in which only uses specified by this Code are allowed, except for nonconforming uses, and for which specific requirements are set forth pertaining to height, yard, area, coverage, landscaping, parking, and other land use restrictions.
NATURAL RESOURCE OVERLAY DISTRICT DEFINITIONS
22.500 Natural Resource Overlay District Definitions. The following definitions are specific to the Natural Resource Overlay Districts in Article 6.
Conflicting Use: A land use or other activity reasonably and customarily subject to land use regulations that could adversely affect a significant Goal 5 resource.
Development Site Area: The buildable portion of a property where the development of structures and other impervious surfaces is proposed.
ESEE Analysis: An analysis of economic, social, environmental, and energy consequences, positive or negative that could result from a decision to allow, limit, or prohibit a conflicting use per OAR 660-023-0040.
Fill or Filling: The deposition of organic or inorganic material in any amount, including the temporary stockpiling of fill material, by human action.
Function: A characteristic action or role provided by a resource. Wetland functions include fish and wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, hydrologic controls, and flood damage reduction. Riparian functions include water quality, thermal regulation, flood management, and wildlife habitat.
Impervious Surface: A surface that cannot be penetrated by water, such as pavement, rock, or a rooftop, and thereby prevents infiltration and generates runoff.
Albany Development Code, Article 22 22 - 32 January 1, 2021
Invasive Species: The Oregon Invasive Species Council defines an invasive plant as a non-native species whose introduction does, or is likely to, cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. While not all non-native species are invasive, the few that are categorized as such threaten the habitat of native plants. An invasive plant can spread rapidly and displace other desired vegetation. The Oregon Invasive Species Council maintains a list of recognized invasive plants.
Local Wetlands Inventory (LWI): A systematic survey of an area to identify, classify, and map the approximate boundaries of wetlands over one-half acre in size within the urban growth boundary, and supporting documentation required by OAR 141-086-0200. The inventories are approved by Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) and adopted by the City. Any subsequent delineations or determinations approved by the DSL amend the LWI by reference.
Native Vegetation: A plant species that is indigenous to the area and identified as naturally occurring and historically found within the City of Albany. Lawn is not considered native vegetation regardless of the species used.
Natural Bottom: When a water crossing does not have a hard or paved surface. Naturally occurring soils and plants are at the bottom of the waterway.
Non-native Vegetation: A plant species that is not indigenous to the area.
Noxious Weeds: They include plants that are injurious to public health, agriculture, recreation, wildlife or any public or private property. The State noxious weed list is the official list for the State of Oregon. Maintained by the Oregon State Weed Board and Noxious Weed Control Program, the weed list is part of the noxious weed policy and classification system. The State noxious weed list is used to prioritize activities at the state level and provide direction for development of county weed lists, local control programs and guide the use of limited resources.
Ordinary High Water Mark (OHW): A line on the bank to which the high water ordinarily rises each year and is the waterward limit of upland vegetation and soil (Source: ORS 274.005). It is generally recognizable by a visible change in the soil and vegetation.
Reference Site: A specific sampling site selected for its relatively undisturbed conditions. It is representative of the expected biological integrity of other localities along or near the same waterbody.
Riparian Corridor: A Goal 5 resource that includes the water areas, fish habitat, riparian areas, adjacent wetland, and upland areas that serve to protect water quality and the habitat functions of the water body.
Safe Harbor Goal 5 Process: An optional course of action that satisfies certain requirements under the standard Goal 5 process. For example, a jurisdiction may choose to identify “significant” riparian corridors using the safe harbor criteria outlined in OAR 660-23-0090(5) rather than follow the general requirements of determining “significance” in the standard Goal 5 process outlined in OAR 660-023-0030(4). Similarly, a jurisdiction may adopt a wetlands ordinance that meets the safe harbor requirements of OAR 660-023-0100(4)(b) in lieu of following the ESEE decision process in OAR 660-023-0040.
Sensitive-Critical Species: A species classification created under Oregon’s Sensitive Species Rule (OAR 635-100-040). The classification is applied to Oregon’s naturally reproducing fish and wildlife species, subspecies, or populations that are facing one or more threats to their population and/or habitats. The subcategory critical has the following meaning: “Critical” sensitive species are imperiled with extirpation from a specific geographic area of the state because of small population sizes, habitat loss or degradation, and/or immediate threats. Critical species may decline to a point of qualifying for threatened or endangered status if conservation actions are not taken.
Significant Wetland: A wetland identified in the Local Wetland Inventory and determined to be locally significant wetlands using the criteria in OAR 141-86-0300. These criteria include fish or wildlife habitat, hydrologic control, water quality improvement functions, presence of rare plant communities or sensitive, threatened or endangered species, or direct water connection to habitat for salmon species.
Albany Development Code, Article 22 22 - 33 January 1, 2021
Significant Wildlife Habitat Areas: A land or water area where sustaining the natural resource characteristics is important or essential to the production and maintenance of aquatic life or wildlife populations that are listed by the state or federal governments, and shown on Plate 3 of the Albany Comprehensive Plan.
Standard Goal 5 Process: The standard Goal 5 process is outlined in OAR 660-023-0030 through 660-023-0050 and consists of procedures and requirements to guide local planning for all Goal 5 resource categories. This division also provides specific rules for each of the fifteen Goal 5 resource categories (see OAR 660-023-0090 through 660-023-0230). In some cases, this division indicates that both the standard and the specific rules apply to Goal 5 decisions. In other cases, this division indicates that the specific rules supersede parts or all of the standard process rules (i.e., local governments must follow the specific rules rather than the standard Goal 5 process). In case of conflict, the resource-specific rules set forth in OAR 660-023-0090 through 660-023-0230 shall supersede the standard provisions in OAR 660-023-0030 through 660-023-0050.
Upland: Land not characterized by the presence of riparian area, water bodies or wetlands.
Wetland: Those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and which, under normal circumstances, does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.
Wetland Boundary Delineation: A determination of wetland presence that includes marking the wetland boundaries on the ground and/or on a detailed map prepared by professional land survey or similar accurate methods. A delineation approved by the Division of State Lands is required for decision-making.
Wetland Determination: An identification of an area as wetland or non-wetland. A determination that is approved by DSL is required for decision-making. [Ord. 5764, 12/1/11]
