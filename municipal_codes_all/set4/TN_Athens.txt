Preface
The Athens Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of the
ordinances of the City of Athens, Tennessee. By referring to the historical
citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine the origin
of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means that the
section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical citation
indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title
and chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations
included as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code
relating to any question that might arise. However, the user should note that
most of the administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map
Amendments, Tax Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise,
ordinances that have been passed since the last update of the code do not appear
here. Therefore, the user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city
recorder for a comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
iii
(3) That the city agrees to reimburse MTAS for the actual costs of
reproducing replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the
consultant's work, and reproduction costs are usually nominal).
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Sandy Selvage, the MTAS Sr. Word Processing
Specialist who did all the typing on this project, and Tracy Gardner,
Administrative Services Assistant is gratefully acknowledged.

separate board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality appointed or created by the municipality. The words

statutes on conflicts of interests; or

matter to be regulated or supervised; or

official or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.

interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-503. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An official
with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the meeting

recuse himself1 from voting on the measure. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-504. Disclosure of personal interest in non-voting matters. An official
or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other than
casting a vote, and who has a personal interest in the matter that affects or that
would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
interest on a form provided by and filed with the city manager. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or
policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter. (as added
by Ord. #956, June 2007)

favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
(2) That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business.
The following are not deemed to be a prohibition against accepting any
money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration or favor of any kind:
(a) Any gift, excluding money, intended for all department
heads, all members of city council, or all members of any committee or
board appointed by city council at/or near a holiday given for a
non-business purpose and motivated by the holiday season;
(b) Any unsolicited token or award of appreciation in
recognition of public service in the form of a plaque, trophy, desk item, or
other similar item provided that any such item shall not be in a form that
can be readily converted to cash;
(c) Informational materials in the form of books, articles,
periodicals, other written materials, audio tapes, video tapes or other
forms of communication;
(d) Gifts that are given for a non-business purpose and
motivated by a close personal friendship;

tokens if such merchandise items and tokens are routinely given to
customers, suppliers, or potential customers, or suppliers in the ordinary
course of business, the value of which to the official or employee does not
exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per occasion or accumulative value of more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) to the official or employee during a
calendar year from the same person or business entity; and
(f) Food, refreshments, meals, or beverages, the value of which
to the official or employee does not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) per
occasion or accumulative value of more than one hundred dollars
($100.00) to the official or employee during a calendar year from the same
person or business entity. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-506. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity. (as added by

Change 12, April 15, 2008 1-11

municipal time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage
to any private person or entity, except as authorized by legitimate contract or
lease that is determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the
municipality. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-508. Use of position or authority. (1) An official or employee may not
make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the name
of the municipality.

to secure any privilege or exemption for himself or others that is not authorized
by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality. (as added
by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-509. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept or
continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipality's charter or any ordinance or policy. (as added
by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-510. Ethics complaints. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation, and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorney's
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request the governing body to hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interest in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipality's governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
Change 12, April 15, 2008 1-12
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(d) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the
circumstances would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing
this code of ethics.
(e) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a
violation of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy,
rule, or regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the
personnel or civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code
of ethics. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)
1-511. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipality's charter or other applicable law,
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed
official or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action. (as added by Ord. #956, June 2007)

certified responsible vendor has been revoked by the alcoholic beverage
commission. If the responsible vendor's certification has been revoked, the
vendor shall be punished by the beer board as if the vendor were not certified
as a responsible vendor. "Clerk" means any person working in a capacity to sell
beer directly to consumers for off-premises consumption. Under Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 57-5-608, the alcoholic beverage commission shall revoke a
vendor's status as a responsible vendor upon notification by the beer board that
the board has made a final determination that the vendor has sold beer to a
minor for the second time in a consecutive twelve-month period. The revocation
shall be for three (3) years.
In the event a permit holder surrenders his license to sell beer, said
surrender will become effective when formal action of the beer board is taken.
Provided, however, the surrender of a permit or license shall not operate to
prevent the beer board from revoking the permit or license for violation of this
chapter or applicable state law occurring before such surrender.
Where a permit or license is revoked, no new license or permit shall be
issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages on the same premises until after
the expiration of one (1) year from the date the revocation becomes final, unless
the revocation is the result of a violation of § 8-213(13). If the revocation was the
result of a violation of § 8-213(13) and the new license or permit request is from
the permit or license holder whose permit or license was revoked, no new license
or permit shall be issued to permit the sale of alcoholic beverages on the same
premises until after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the date the
revocation becomes final. If the revocation was the result of a violation of
§ 8-213(13) and the new license or permit request is from a new owner of the
same premises affected by the revocation of a permit or license, a new license or
permit may be issued to the new owner without regard to the prior permit or
license revocation, if the new owner is otherwise entitled to a license or permit.
The applicant for a new license or permit shall not be considered a new owner
if the applicant is a corporation, limited liability company or any other form of
business in which the principal owner or owners also owned the corporation,
limited liability company or other form of business whose permit or license was
revoked the result of a violation of § 8-213(13).
No new permit shall be granted at any location where a case is pending
in court for an infraction of the beer laws of the State of Tennessee or the City
of Athens. (1972 Code, § 2-213, as replaced by Ord. #873, Jan. 2001, and
Change 12, April 15, 2008 8-17

issued a permit to sell beer for off-premises consumption and has received
certification by the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission under the
"Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act of 2006," Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 57-5-601, et seq.
(2) Penalty, revocation or suspension. The beer board may, at the time
it imposes a revocation or suspension, offer a permit holder that is not a
responsible vendor the alternative of paying a civil penalty not to exceed two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each offense of making or
permitting to be made any sales to minors, or a civil penalty not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any other offense.
The beer board may impose on a responsible vendor a civil penalty not to
exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each offense of making or permitting
to be made any sales to minors or for any other offense.
If a civil penalty is offered as an alternative to revocation or suspension,
the holder shall have seven (7) days within which to pay the civil penalty before
the revocation or suspension shall be imposed. If the civil penalty is paid within
that time, the revocation or suspension shall be deemed withdrawn.
Payment of the civil penalty in lieu of revocation or suspension by a
permit holder shall be an admission by the holder of the violation so charged
and shall be paid to the exclusion of any other penalty that the city may impose.

8-217. Loss of clerk's certification for sale to minor. If the beer board
determines that a clerk of an off-premises beer permit holder certified under
Tennessee Code Annotated, §57-5-606, sold beer to a minor, the beer board shall

(a) Name and address of person engaging towing car.
(b) State license number of disabled vehicle.
(c) Storage rates per day or part thereof.

for routine services:

(5) There may be a surcharge of one-half of the basic towing fees for
calls which are dispatched outside normal business hours.
(6) Any change of rates shall be forwarded to the city manager no later

9-513. Regulations for city approved wrecker. A city approved wrecker
permittee shall follow these procedures:

other person having an interest in a business shall not be permitted to operate
another wrecker out of the same location.
(2) Each city approved wrecker must have distinct and separate

of Athens at the owner's or operator's request when charges therefor have been
prepaid.

for releasing a vehicle other than during normal business hours, except when
the location is otherwise open for business.

towed to a city lot at no additional charge.

and while towing a vehicle.

with an additional five (5) minute grace period for those wrecker services
enroute, after being called, and except for extenuating or unusual
circumstances, a response must be made within this time after the dispatch
9-19
request is made to the wrecker operator. If the wrecker is engaged elsewhere
or for any reason the wrecker operator cannot reasonably expect to respond
within the above specified time, it shall be the duty of the wrecker operator to
so advise the Police Department and decline to accept the call, whereupon the
next wrecker operator on rotation shall be called. Class C wreckers shall be
granted additional time to respond to a tow for a large truck, road tractor and
trailers.
(12) No permittee shall refer or delegate police calls to other wrecker
companies.
(13) No answering service, paging service or similar service or
procedure may be used to forward a call to an owner or employee of the wrecker
service during normal business hours. The operator may provide for an
after-hours number which shall be provided to the city manager.
(14) The first city approved wrecker operator at the scene shall tow the
vehicle causing the greatest hazard as directed by the investigating police
officer.
(15) No repairs or other additional services shall be performed except
on written request of the owner.
(16) Wrecker or towing operators who fail to answer a call will lose the
call. If two (2) calls are missed, an investigation will be made and suspension
or removal as a city approved wrecker will be considered. Operators refusing
a call or failing to respond promptly to a call may be removed as a city approved
wrecker.
(17) If additional equipment or recovery vehicles are needed to
adequately complete a tow (i.e., tractor-trailer roll-over or difficult auto
recovery), discretion of the responding wrecker service should be used in
deciding what and whose additional equipment will be required. The severity
of the situation and the estimated response time of additional equipment will
be weighed by the officer at the scene, who is the deciding authority. (1972
Code, § 5-613)
9-514. Permit revocation/suspension. (1) The city manager shall revoke
or suspend the permit of any permittee on any of the following grounds:
(a) If the permit was procured by fraudulent conduct or false
statement of a material fact or a fact concerning the applicant which was
not disclosed at the time of his making the application that would have
constituted just cause for refusing to issue the license.
(b) Failure of a city approved wrecker permittee to have an
operable and properly equipped wrecker and qualified operator on duty

scene of accident prohibited. The wrecker operator may tow the wrecked or
disabled vehicle to the operator's place of business; provided, if the owner or
agent of the wrecked or disabled vehicle pays or secures the towing charges,
then the wrecker operator shall pull the vehicle to any place designated by said
owner or agent. It shall be unlawful for the owner of a wrecker, his agent,
employee or representative at the scene of any accident to high-pressure or
otherwise to coerce or insist upon any owner of a wrecked or disabled vehicle to
sign a work order or agreement at the scene of the accident for any repairs to be
made on such wrecked or disabled vehicle. (1972 Code, § 5-615)
9-516. Wreckers to go to scene of accident on call of owner or police only.
It shall be unlawful for any wrecker operator, or his agent or representative, to
go to any place where an accident has occurred unless called by the driver or

department dispatcher. In any event, the wrecker shall clear with the police
dispatcher before going to the accident scene. It shall be unlawful for the owner
of any wrecker or towing car, or his agent or representative, to go to the place

work. A wrecker operator shall not proceed to the scene of a disabled motor
vehicle without having been requested or notified to do so, as provided in § 9-516
of this code. Responding to a call upon notice from gas station attendants,
taxicab drivers or unauthorized persons shall be considered a violation of this
chapter. (1972 Code, § 5-617)
9-518. Solicitation of business by city employees. It shall be unlawful for
any city employee to solicit business for any wrecker or towing car operator.
Any employee guilty of violating the provisions of this section shall be subject

of the owner or operator of a wrecked or disabled vehicle to call a particular
wrecker service, whether a city approved wrecker or not. The officer shall radio
the dispatcher who shall contact the wrecker operator requested to determine
if the operator is willing and able to respond to the scene of the wreck for a
disabled motor vehicle within twenty (20) minutes, or, within thirty (30)
minutes for a Class C wrecker. If so, the dispatcher shall dispatch the operator
requested. The City of Athens assumes no liability or responsibility regarding
owner's requested wreckers. If there is any traffic hazard or other reason why
the vehicle cannot be left unattended or the requested operator cannot respond
within the applicable time limit then the dispatcher shall dispatch a city
approved wrecker. (1972 Code, § 5-619)

animal in the city animal shelter following the issuance of a warrant by the city
judge or any other judge authorized to issue a warrant, or under circumstances
where a warrant is not required under applicable law, when the seizure and

(b) Prevent the animal from causing harm or danger to other
animals, persons or property; or
(c) Preserve evidence of a violation of a city ordinance or state
law.

a violation of any section of title 10 of this code or state law, the animal
shall remain impounded until the disposition of the case if the animal
control officer for the City of Athens has reason to believe that the animal
poses a threat of harm to other animals, persons or property if released
to the owner prior to disposition of the case or the animal control officer
has reason to believe that the animal had been abused or neglected prior

12-515. Duties of the inspector. The inspector or his duly authorized
representative is hereby authorized, upon showing proper identification, to

(1972 Code, § 4-515)
12-516. Administrative rules and regulations. The inspector is hereby
authorized to make and adopt such written rules and regulations as may be
necessary for the proper enforcement of the provisions of this chapter; provided

chapter. The inspector shall file a certified copy of all rules and regulations
which he may adopt in the office of the City of Athens. Such rules and

emergency. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this code, such order shall
be effective immediately. Any person on whom such an order is directed shall
comply therewith immediately, but upon a petition shall be afforded a hearing
by the board of housing appeals as soon as possible. After such hearing,
depending upon the findings as to whether the provisions of this chapter have
12-22
been complied with, the board shall continue such order in effect, or modify it,
or revoke it. (1972 Code, § 4-517)
12-518. Service of notices and orders. (1) Whenever at least five
residents of the city charge that any dwelling is unfit for human habitation, or
whenever the inspector determines that there has been a violation, or that there
are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation of any
provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant hereto,
he shall give notice to the person or persons responsible therefor. Such notice

upon such violator if a copy thereof is delivered to him personally or by
registered mail, but if the whereabouts of such person is unknown and
the same cannot be ascertained by the inspector in the exercise of
reasonable diligence, and the inspector shall make an affidavit to that
effect, then the serving of such notice or order may be made by publishing
the same once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper
printed and published in the municipality, or in the absence of such
newspaper, in one printed and published in the county and circulating in
the municipality in which the dwelling is located. A copy of such complaint
or order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected by the notice or order. A copy of such notice or order shall also
be filed for record in the register's office of the county in which the
dwelling is located, and the filing of such notice or order shall have the
same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law.

taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with rules
and regulations adopted pursuant hereto. (1972 Code, § 4-518)

established a board of housing appeals, hereinafter referred to as the board,
which shall consist of the inspector and five members appointed by the mayor
and approved by a majority vote of the city council. All appointed members
shall be registered voters of the city and they shall not receive any remuneration
for their services. Initially two members shall be appointed for two-year terms,
12-23
and three for three-year terms, and they may be reappointed at the expiration
of their terms. All future appointments shall be for two-year terms. The
appointed members shall not be candidates for public office at the time of their
appointment, and if later they become such they must retire from the board. A
vacancy shall be filled by the mayor for the unexpired term of the member
whose term becomes vacant. The members shall be removable for cause by the
mayor upon written charges and after a public hearing.
The board shall meet within ten days after its appointment and shall
elect a chairman from among its membership. The elected member shall be
chairman until the expiration of his term. A vice-chairman shall also be elected.
His duties are to assume the responsibilities of the chairman in the latter's
absence. The duties of the chairman are to preside over the hearings and to
question petitioners. The chairman may vote on all matters. The rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law and equity shall not be controlling on
hearings. The inspector shall serve as the permanent secretary of the board, but
he shall not vote on any matter. The board shall adopt such rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this
chapter.
The inspector shall call meetings and shall notify board members. In
open meetings the board shall hear appeals. The presence of three members
shall constitute a quorum and the concurring vote of three members shall be
necessary to reverse or modify any order or notice of the inspector. The
proceedings at such hearings, including the findings and decisions of the board
shall be summarized, reduced to writing, and entered as a matter of public
record in the office of the City of Athens.
Any person affected by any notice which has been issued in connection
with the enforcement of any provision of this chapter, or of any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto, may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the board; provided that such person shall file in
the office of the City of Athens a written petition requesting such hearing and
setting forth a statement of the grounds therefor within twenty days after the
date the notice was served. Within ten days after receipt of the petition the inspector
shall set a time and place for such hearing and shall give the petitioner
written notice thereof. At such hearing the petitioner shall be given an
opportunity to be heard and to show cause why such notice should be modified
or withdrawn. The hearing before the board shall be commenced not later than
thirty days after the date on which the petition was filed; provided that, upon
written application of the petitioner to the board, the date of the hearing may
be postponed beyond the thirty day period if the petitioner shows good and
sufficient reason why it should be postponed. Any notice served automatically
becomes an order if a written petition for hearing is not filed in the office of the
City of Athens within twenty days after the notice is served. (1972 Code,
§ 4-519)
12-24
12-520. Hearings. After such hearings, the board shall sustain, modify,
or withdraw the notice, depending upon its findings as to whether the provisions
of this chapter and of the rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto have
been complied with. The board may also modify any notice so as to authorize a
variance from the provisions of this chapter when because of special conditions,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardship; provided, that the spirit of this chapter will
be observed, public health and welfare secured and substantial justice done.
The board may also extend the time specified for compliance if the case
warrants. If the board sustains or modifies such notice, it shall be deemed to be
an order and the violator shall comply with all provisions of such order within
the afore specified length of time. (1972 Code, § 4-520)
12-521. Appeal to court. Any person or persons, jointly or severally,
aggrieved by any decision of the board, or any taxpayer, or any officer,
department, board or bureau of the municipality, may seek relief therefrom in
any court of competent jurisdiction as provided by the laws of the state. (1972
Code, § 4-521)
12-522. Violations. If a person upon whom a notice has been served does
not, within the specified period after the notice was served, commence
compliance with the directives thereof, or, within the specified time, petition the
board, or if, after the board's hearing, he does not comply with the decision
thereof, such person shall be fined under the general penalty clause for this
code. (1972 Code, § 4-522)
12-523. Conflicting provisions. In any case where a provision in this
chapter is found to be in conflict with any other provision in this code, the
provision which establishes the higher standard for the promotion and
protection of the health and safety of the people shall prevail. (1972 Code,
§ 4-523)

declared that there exist in the City of Athens structures used for commercial,
business, or industrial use which are, or may become in the future, substandard
with respect to structure, equipment, or maintenance, or further, that such
conditions, including, but not limited to, structural deterioration, lack of
maintenance, and appearance of exterior of premises, infestation, plumbing,
lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential facilities and utilities, existence of
fire hazards, inadequate provisions for light and air and unsanitary conditions,
constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, welfare, and reasonable
comfort of the citizens and inhabitants of the City of Athens. It is further found
and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive
deterioration, certain properties have the further effect of creating blighting
conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and
removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in
time the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same, and that by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein
contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and the
neighborhood and property values thereby maintained, the desirability and
amenities of neighborhoods enhanced, and the public health, safety, and welfare
protected and fostered.
The purpose of this code is to protect the public health, safety, morals,
and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance,
appearance, and condition of commercial, business, and industrial premises; to
establish minimum standards governing utilities, facilities, and other physical
components and conditions essential to make the aforesaid facilities fit for
occupancy and use; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and
operators; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of
commercial, business, and industrial premises; to fix penalties for the violations
of this code, and to provide for the repair, demolition, or vacation of commercial,
business, or industrial premises. This code is hereby declared to be remedial

period not to exceed ninety (90) days beyond the expiration date of the original
notice.

required. Where the violation or condition existing on the premises is of such
a nature as to constitute an immediate threat to life and limb unless abated
without delay, the code officer may either abate the violation or condition

steam, sewage, or other materials), excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays. The notice shall be sent by United States Mail, addressed to the last
known address of the owner of record. The notice shall state that the owner of
the property is entitled to a hearing, and shall, at the minimum, contain the
following additional information:
(a) A brief statement that the owner is in violation of § 13-201
of the City of Athens Municipal Code, which has been enacted under the

cost in accordance with reasonable standards in the community, with these costs
to be assessed against the owner of the property. The provisions of subsection

residential property except that the municipality must wait until cumulative
charges for remediation equal or exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) before
filing the notice with the register of deeds and the charges becoming a lien on
the property. After this threshold has been met and the lien attaches, charges
for costs for which the lien attached are collectible as provided in subsection (4)
for these charges.
(6) Appeal. The owner of record who is aggrieved by the determination
and order of the public officer may appeal the determination and order to the
board of commissioners. The appeal shall be filed with the city recorder within
ten (10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to subsection (3)
above. The failure to appeal within this time shall, without exception, constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing.
(7) Judicial review. Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the
board of commissioners under subsection (4) above may seek judicial review of
Change 13, June 15, 2010 13-5

stayed during the pendency of judicial review.

are in addition and supplemental to, and not in substitution for, any other
provision in the municipal charter, this municipal code of ordinances or other
applicable law which permits the city to proceed against an owner, tenant or

to begin site alterations. These plans can be submitted to the public works
director at the public works service center located at 219 Alford Street.
An application for a grading permit shall be submitted along with the
necessary plans.
For all other purposes, the community development department is the
central point for receiving preliminary, revised, and final submittals. The
issuance of all other permits is based upon approvals of submitted plans.

requiring temporary and permanent provisions for its control. It should be used
as a planning and engineering implement to facilitate the necessary control of
stormwater. (as added by Ord. #894, April 2002, and replaced by Ord. #922,
Oct. 2004)
14-502. Waivers. (1) General. Any construction or site work project
shall provide for stormwater management as required by this ordinance, unless
a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the
stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the City of
Athens for approval.
(2) Conditions for waiver. The minimum requirements for stormwater
management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the
applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
(a) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not
likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this chapter.
(b) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management
of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater
management plan that has been approved by the City of Athens.
(c) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site
facility. The off-site facility must be in place and designed to provide the
level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which
would be afforded by on-site practices. Further, the facility must be
operated and maintained by an entity that is legally obligated to continue
the operation and maintenance of the facility.
(3) Downstream damage, etc. prohibited. In order to receive a waiver,
the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Athens that the
waiver will not lead to any of the following conditions downstream:

property.
(4) Grading permit not to be issued where waiver requested. No
grading permit shall be issued where a waiver has been requested until the
waiver is granted. If no waiver is granted, the plans must be resubmitted with
a stormwater management plan. (as added by Ord. #922, Oct. 2004)
14-503. Stormwater system design and management standards.
(1) Stormwater design or BMP manual. (a) Adoption. The municipality
adopts as its stormwater design and best management practices (BMP) manual
the following publications, which are incorporated by reference in this ordinance
as is fully set out herein:
(i) TDEC Sediment and Erosion Control Manual;
(ii) TDEC Manual for Post Construction.
(b) This manual includes a list of acceptable BMPs including the
specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated
and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body
of the municipality, upon the recommendation of the City of Athens,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local
maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will
be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
(2) General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless
granted a waiver or judged by the City of Athens to be exempt, the following
performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites:
(a) All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of
stormwater discharge associated with design storms specified in this
ordinance or in the BMP manual and reduce the generation of post
construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels. These
practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment
and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops,
parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to
provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.
(b) To protect stream channels from degradation, specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP
manual.
(c) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive
resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches,
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-19
recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional
performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices.
(d) Stormwater discharges from hot spots may require the
application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention
practices.
(e) Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land
disturbance permits shall consult with the City of Athens to determine
if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements.
(f) The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
BMP manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.
(3) Minimum control requirements. (a) Stormwater designs shall
meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage requirements as identified in the
BMP manual unless the City of Athens has granted the applicant a full or
partial waiver for a particular BMP under Section 4.
(b) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
City of Athens may impose any and all additional requirements deemed
necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(4) Stormwater management plan requirements. The stormwater
management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the City of
Athens to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the
potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and
future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the
measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To
accomplish this goal the stormwater management plan shall include the
following:
(a) Topographic base map: Topographic base map of the site
which extends a minimum of 100 feet beyond the limits of the proposed
development and indicates:

(d) Compliance order. When the director finds that any person
has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or order
issued thereunder, he may issue an order to the violator directing that,
following a specific time period, adequate structures, devices, be installed
or procedures implemented and properly operated. Orders may also
contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the construction of
appropriate structures, installation of devices, self-monitoring, and
management practices.
(e) Cease and desist orders. When the director finds that any
person has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:

preserve and promote the health, safety, and the general welfare of the public;
to facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community;
to conserve properties and their values; and to preserve the character of an area
by preventing the harmful effects of prejudicial land uses. More specifically,
this section is intended to require the landscaping of parking lots in order to
reduce the harmful effects of wind and air turbulence, heat and noise, the glare
of motor vehicle lights, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and soil
erosion, while providing shade, and enhancing the blighted appearance of
parking lots. (as added by Ord. #895, April 2002)
14-603. Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to:
(1) All new public/private development.
(2) Existing public/private developments. For existing developments
and parking facilities, expansions in gross floor area (GFA) or parking spaces
shall trigger landscape requirements based on the scope of work proposed as
established below. Where both the building expansion and parking lot
expansion requirements are applicable, the building expansion requirements
shall supercede:
(a) Building expansions: (i) If an existing building, structure,
or development is expanded by fifty (50%) percent or more in gross
floor area, then the entire building, structure, or development shall
comply with the provisions of this chapter.
(ii) If an existing building, structure, or development is
expanded by forty-nine (49%) percent or less in gross floor area,
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-33
then the entire building, structure, or development shall be exempt
from complying with the provisions of this chapter.

existing building, structure or development is expanded by fifty
(50%) percent or more, then the entire parking lot shall comply
with the provisions of this chapter.
(3) Exemptions: One-family detached and two-family residential
dwellings are exempt from landscaping requirements. (as added by Ord. #895,
April 2002, and replaced by Ord. #920, Aug. 2004)
14-604. Landscape plan submittal. Proposed developments subject to the
provisions of this section shall submit a landscape site plan to the building
inspections office. A licensed landscape architect, architect, or engineer may be
required to design the landscape plan. Such requirements will be based on the
complexity of the conditions, the adjacent properties, and the site itself. This
determination will be made by the city manager, public works director,
community development director, or their designee. This plan may be
incorporated into a site plan or parking/paving plan, provided the scale is not
less than one (1) inch equals forty (40) feet. The following elements shall be
shown on the landscape site plan:
(1) Zoning of site and adjoining properties;
(2) Existing and proposed contours at 5 feet intervals or less;
(3) Boundary lines and lot dimensions;
(4) Date, graphic scale, north arrow, title and name of owner, and the
phone number of the person or firm responsible for the landscape plan;
(5) Location of all proposed structures and storage areas;
(6) Existing and proposed drainage features and 100-year floodplain,
if applicable;
(7) Parking lot layout including parking stalls, bays, and driving lanes;

peninsulas, landscaped islands, and screening buffers). (as added by Ord. #895,
April 2002)
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-34
14-605. Plant installation detail plan. Prior to receiving a certificate of
occupancy, a plant installation plan shall be submitted to the building
inspections office and approved containing the following information:
(1) Location, installation size, quantity, and scientific and common
names of landscaping to be installed; and
(2) Spacing between trees and shrubs used for screening.
The applicant has the option of submitting both the landscape plan and
the plant installation detail plan at the same time. (as added by Ord. #895,
April 2002)
14-606. Hardships. (1) Intent. This section does not intend to create
undue hardship on affected properties. The required landscaping should not
exceed 15% of the total lot area. For existing developments, where the GFA or
parking areas are being increased, the loss of off-street parking spaces (required
by zoning ordinance) as a result of compliance with the landscaping provisions
should not exceed 10%.
(2) Special administrative remedies. Lots with a depth of 150 feet or
less, or an area of 15,000 square feet or less, have the following special
exceptions:
(a) An automatic fifty percent (50%) reduction in landscape yard
depth requirements for screening, street yard, and parking lot
landscaping sections; and
(b) A twenty-five percent (25%) reduction in planting
requirements for all sections except for the required evergreen plantings
for screening.
Lots, which front on more than one street, have the following
special exception: all street frontages other than the primary street
frontage may have a street yard with a minimum depth of four (4) feet.
In situations where the landscape requirements would result in the
demolition of an existing building, a loss of more than ten percent (10%)
of the gross required off-street parking for an existing development; or a
loss greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the lot area for development, the
following administrative remedies may be applied:
(i) Reduce the required minimum landscaped area
widths up to fifty percent (50%); and
(ii) Reduce the tree planting requirements by up to
twenty-five percent (25%).
(3) Administrative guidelines. (a) Where possible, reduction of
landscaping requirements in one area should be offset by an increase of
landscaping requirements in other portions of the site.
(b) The first priority is to provide trees along the street
frontage.
(c) The second priority is to provide trees within portions of the
parking lot that are highly visible from the street.
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-35
(d) A screen should always be provided if it is required by this
section. Where there are space limitations or potential sight distance
problems, reduce the landscape yard as necessary. If the planting area
is less than five (5) feet in width, require a minimum six (6) feet tall wood
or composite fence or masonry wall. (as added by Ord. #895, April 2002)
14-607. Conflict with other articles in the zoning ordinance and existing
zoning conditions. Where any requirement of this section conflicts with the
requirement of another article or existing zoning conditions in the zoning
ordinance, the provisions of this landscaping section shall override. (as added
by Ord. #895, April 2002)

accordance with title 16 entitled "Streets and Sidewalks, etc." of the Athens
Muncipal Code, it shall be unlawful for any property owner or occupant to allow
any limbs of trees on his/her property to project out and/or over any street, alley
or sidewalk at a height of less than fourteen (14) feet. (as added by Ord. #895,
April 2002)
14-609. Trees, etc., obstructing view at intersections prohibited. In
accordance with title 16 entitled "Streets and Sidewalks, etc." of the Athens
Muncipal Code, it shall be unlawful for any property owner or occupant to have
or maintain on his property any fence, tree, hedge or billboard which prevents
persons driving vehicles on public streets or alleys from obtaining a clear view
of traffic when approaching an intersection. The above mentioned obstructions
shall not be above two (2) feet in height and shall not be allowed within fifty (50)
feet from the centerline of any street. The aforementioned is not applicable to
buildings or their appendages or retaining walls. (as added by Ord. #895, April
2002)
14-610. Street yard requirements. (1) Intent. The intent of this section
is to add quality and definition to the street by planting trees within a
landscaped area along the edges of the right-of-way.
(2) Dimensions. Except for points of access, a street yard shall be
provided where the proposed development site adjoins the public street
right-of-way. Alleys are exempt from this requirement. The street yard shall
have a minimum depth of eight (8) feet as measured from the edge of the public
street right-of-way towards the interior of the property. The yard shall consist
of sod grass or other natural living ground cover material. No impervious
surfaces are permitted in the street yard area. If the area between the street
right-of-way and/or property line and the edge of pavement or back of curb is

trees referred to in this section shall have a minimum expected maturity height
of at least twenty-five (25) feet and should be of a species common to southeast
Tennessee.
(4) Existing woodlands. Existing woodlands along the street
right-of-way frontage can be substituted for the street yard requirements subject
to the following:
(a) Existing woodlands to be set aside shall have a minimum
depth of 25 feet as measured from the public street right-of-way;
(b) Number of woodland trees (not including prohibited trees)
having a minimum caliper of 6 inches shall equal or exceed the minimum
street tree planting ratio of 1 tree per 35 linear feet;
(c) No impervious surfaces are permitted within the protected
woodlands area except for approved access points to the site or as a part
of the stormwater plan; and
(d) No cutting/filling activities or storage of
materials/equipment are permitted within the protected woodlands.
(5) Exemptions/special situations. Properties adjoining rights-of-way
that encroach into established parking areas more than twenty feet have the
following street yard options:
(a) Plant street trees within the right-of-way provided written
permission is obtained from the owner of the public right-of-way;
(b) If permission cannot be obtained to plant in the right-of-way,
no street yard will be required. However, the street trees will be
relocated somewhere within the site in an area highly visible from the
street. These trees cannot be used to meet requirements in other
sections.
Existing street trees planted within the right-of-way (not including
the center median or opposite side of the street) can be used to meet the
street yard requirements.
Where overhead powerlines encroach into the street yard, smaller
shade trees may be substituted for larger shade trees.
Stormwater facilities may be located within the street yard subject
to the following conditions:
(i) Trees and other living organic materials can be
planted along the stormwater facility; however, the facility must
be maintained in accordance with the stormwater management
policy;
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-37
(ii) The stormwater facility must meet all requirements
of the City of Athens.
With the written approval of the right-of-way owner,
portions of the public right-of-way may be used to meet the street
yard requirements. (as added by Ord. #895, April 2002)
14-611. Parking lot requirements. (1) Intent. The intent of this section
is to breakup the expanse of asphalt, to provide shade, and to reduce the glare
from parked cars and loading docks.
(2) Design criteria. (a) No parking space shall be more than
sixty (60) feet from a tree;
(b) Ends of all interior parking bays that contain a minimum of
ten (10) contiguous parking spaces shall be bordered on both sides by a

(8) feet and a minimum landscaped area of two hundred (200) square feet.
Landscaped islands and peninsulas used to meet the landscaping requirements
shall be planted with at least one tree. The trees referred to in this parking
section shall be of a species common to southeast Tennessee. In the special
situations specified below, smaller shade trees may be substituted for larger
shade trees:
(a) An overhead obstacle such as a canopy or powerline limits
the tree height; or
(b) The tree is located within twenty (20) feet of a building. All
landscaped islands, and peninsulas shall be bordered by a curb or a wheel

eight (8) feet for the planted screen. (as added by Ord. #895, April
2002)
14-612. Screening requirements. (1) Intent. To provide a transition
between incompatible land uses and to protect the integrity of less-intensive
uses from more intensive uses, screening and buffering will be required. The
purpose of the screen is to provide a year-round visual obstruction. The buffer
Change 10, January 18, 2005 14-38
provides transition between the incompatible uses by requiring a landscape yard
of a minimum specified depth along the shared property line.
(2) Procedure. Refer to the matrix below to determine any screening
requirements for the proposed development. First, identify the type of zoning
for the proposed development (along the left side of the matrix) and each
adjoining property (along the top of the matrix). Find where the zoning of the
proposed development and each adjoining property intersect on the matrix. If
a screen is required, a capital letter will indicate the type of screen to be applied.
A description of each screen type is provided below.

curb, sidewalk, alley, or public rights-of-way shall be permitted to obstruct the
flow of traffic unless the permit holder coordinates with the city public works
department and police department and provides a plan to address the impact
on traffic flow. In the event final resurfacing cannot be completed immediately
after backfilling, the entity shall use temporary resurfacing materials such as
coldmix or steel plate or an approved detour around such opening or excavation
which would aid the flow of traffic. The detour must be approved by the public
works director or his designee prior to establishing any such detour. Such detour
routes must be adequately signed and marked according to the manual on

or equitable relief arising out of the installation, construction, maintenance, or
operation of facilities by the rights-of-way occupant or permittee; the conduct of
the rights-of-way occupant's business in the city; or in any way arising out of the

of the acts, errors, or omissions of the rights-of-way occupant or permittee, or its
agents, independent contractors, or employees related to or in any way arising
out of the construction, operation or repair of the facilities in question.
The indemnity provision of this section includes, but is not limited to, the
city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such action,
claim, suit (whether frivolous or otherwise), or proceeding, as well as the
reasonable value of any services rendered by the city attorney, or city staff or
employees.
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to waive any immunity the city
enjoys under applicable law, or the Tennessee Constitution.
Acceptance of the provisions of this section shall be a condition of all
rights to occupy city rights-of-way or to obtain a rights-of-way construction
permit. (as added by Ord. #906, Feb. 2003)
16-215. Time limits. Each application for a permit shall state the length
of time it is estimated will elapse from the commencement of the work until the
Change 8, April 15, 2003 16-10
restoration of the surface of the ground or pavement, or until the refill is made
ready for the pavement to be put on by the city if the city restores such surface
pavement. It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with this time limitation unless
permission for an extension of time is granted by the city manager. (as added
by Ord. #906, Feb. 2003)
16-216. Supervision. The city manager or his designee shall monitor all
excavations and tunnels being made in or under any public street, curb,

under any street, curb, alley, or public rights-of-way in the city and it is
determined by the city manager or his designee that the work being performed
is not in compliance with the citys regulations, state or federal regulations or
recognized construction and/or safety practices, the city manager or his designee
shall issue a stop work order and the person, firm, corporation, public or private
utility, association, or others that is making the cut or excavation in any street,
sidewalk, curb, alley, or public rights-of-way, or is tunneling under any street,
sidewalk, curb, alley, or public rights-of-way shall cease work in the citys

relocate, protect, or modify any part of its facility when required by the city by
reason of traffic safety, public safety, road construction, change of street grade,
installation of water, stormwater, or sanitary pipes, traffic signal devices, or any
other types of city improvement projects. The city manager may recommend
such actions in order to prevent interference by the rights-of-way occupant's
facilities with: a present or future city use of the citys rights-of-way; or a capital
improvement project funded and scheduled to be undertaken by the city; or an
economic development project in which the city has an interest or investment.
The city manager may also recommend such actions: when the public health,
safety and welfare require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of-way, both vehicular
and pedestrian; or when aboveground equipment is located in such a manner as
to create an obstruction to a driver's line of sight. The rights-of-way occupant
Change 8, April 15, 2003 16-11
may for due cause make application to the public works director for an extension
to complete such relocation as required by this section.
Failure by the rights-of-way occupant to relocate its facilities within the
three (3) months from date of notification shall result in the rights-of-way
occupant being assessed liquidated damages for each day of the delay. The daily
amount of liquidated damages shall be determined by the liquidated damages
contained in any construction contract(s) the city may have entered into in
conjunction with infrastructure improvements that necessitate the need for the
rights-of-way occupant to relocate its facilities. In those cases where the city is
performing the infrastructure improvements with city forces, the amount of the
daily liquidated damages shall be the average of the daily liquidated damages
amounts found in all city contracts for the past two years commencing with the
date of notification referenced above. If the rights-of-way occupant fails to pay
the city for the liquidated damages as charged, the total amount of liquidated
damages (daily amount x the number of days delayed) shall be attached to the
cost of any future permit the rights-of-way owner may apply for to install,
extend or improve their facilities within the citys rights-of-way and no permit
shall be issued until the total costs are paid. (as added by Ord. #906, Feb. 2003)
16-219. Violation and penalty. In addition to any other action the city
may take against a permit holder in violation of this chapter, such violation
shall be punishable under the general penalty provision of this code. Each day
a violation occurs shall constitute a separate offense. (as added by Ord. #906,

be one hundred dollars ($100.00). These fees shall be used to defray the
administrative cost incurred in processing the petition and publishing, posting
and mailing notices, plus any consulting costs incurred by the city during the
review process. (as added by Ord. #996, June 2011)
16-606. Submittals required with abandonment requests. Every request

may or may not approve the closure and/or abandonment of a street or right-ofway,
or any part thereof, with such conditions or limitations as the council
deems necessary and proper to preserve any public use or benefit. Council

easements for construction, repair and maintenance of existing and future
utilities and services. (as added by Ord. #996, June 2011)
16-610. Compensation for closure. Where a street closure has been
initiated by request, the owners of property signing the petition shall pay to the
city, prior to the effective date of the closure of the street, a sum equal to the
cost of physical closure as required by the department of public works. If the
street closure has been initiated by the city the payment of such sum shall not
be required. Upon determination by the department of public works of the cost
of physical closure of the street, the city manager or designee shall notify the
representatives of the petitioners of the amount of required compensation. The
payment shall be delivered to the city manager or designee who, upon receipt
of payment, shall transmit it to the finance department for deposit in the city's
general fund. (as added by Ord. #996, June 2011)
16-611. Compensation for abandonment. The following provisions shall
apply for compensation to the city for the abandonment of a street or right-ofway,
or any part thereof:
(1) Determination of payment amount. Where an abandonment has
been initiated by request, the owners of the property abutting the area vacated
shall pay to the city, prior to the effective date of the abandonment of the area,
a sum equal to the appraised value of the area vacated plus the full cost of
physical closure and street repairs as required by the department of public
works. Where the abandonment has been initiated by the city the payment of
such sum shall not be required.
Change 14, October 16, 2012 16-22
(2) Conveyance of other property. Conveyance of other property
acceptable to the city may be made in lieu of the required payment, whether
required to mitigate the adverse impacts of the abandonment or otherwise.
(3) Appraisals. The city manager or designee shall determine the
appraised value of the area vacated based on an appraisal from a state-certified
real estate appraiser. The petitioner shall pay for the appraisal. If the city
manager or designee is not satisfied with the appraisal, the city manager or
designee may order a second appraisal from a state-certified appraiser. The city
shall pay for the second appraisal. The city manager or designee shall use the
appraisal having the highest value for the area vacated.
(4) Payment of compensation or conveyance. After determining the
appraisal for the value of the street or alley to be vacated, the city manager or
designee shall notify the representatives of the petitioners of the amount of
required compensation. The payment shall be delivered to the city manager or
designee who, upon receipt of payment, shall transmit it to the finance
department for deposit in the city's general fund. If the petitioner has been
authorized to deliver an instrument dedicating to the city a parcel or parcels of
land in lieu of cash payment, as contemplated in § 16-611(2), the city manager
or designee, at the petitioner's expense, may either obtain a policy of title
insurance insuring title of the property to the city, or a certificate of title as to
the title insurance insuring title of the property to the city. (as added by

container from the street, curb side, sidewalk, and/or alley within twenty-four
(24) hours of collection, the resident will be responsible for the costs to replace
the container for failure to timely remove the container from the street, curb

requirements for users of the City of Athens, Tennessee, wastewater treatment
system and enables the city to comply with the Federal Clean Water Act and the
state Water Quality Control Act and rules adopted pursuant to these acts. The
objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To protect public health;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater treatment facility which will interfere with the system's operation;
(3) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater treatment facility that will pass through the facility, inadequately
treated, into the receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the
treatment facility;
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-2
(4) To protect facility personnel who may be affected by wastewater
and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
(5) To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the facility;
(6) To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the facility; and
(7) To enable the city and municipal wastewater treatment facility to
comply with National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit
conditions, sludge and biosolids use and disposal requirements, and any other
federal or state industrial pretreatment rules to which the city and facility is
subject.
In meeting these objectives, this chapter provides that all persons in the
City of Athens must have adequate wastewater treatment either in the form of
a connection to the municipal wastewater treatment system or, where the
system is not available, an appropriate private disposal system.
This chapter shall apply to all users inside or outside the city who are, by
implied contract or written agreement with the city, through the Athens
Utilities Board, dischargers of applicable wastewater to the wastewater
treatment facility. Chapter 2 provides for the regulation of the wastewater
system by the Athens Utilities Board. Chapter 3 provides for the issuance of
permits to system users, for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities;
and establishes administrative review procedures for industrial users or other

18-201. Purpose and policy. This chapter sets forth uniform
requirements for users of the Athens Utilities Board (AUB) wastewater
treatment system and enables AUB to comply with the Federal Clean Water Act
and the state Water Quality Control Act and rules adopted pursuant to these
acts. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To protect public health;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into AUB's wastewater
treatment facility which will interfere with the system's operation;
(3) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into AUB's wastewater
treatment facility that will pass through the facility, inadequately treated, into
the receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the treatment facility;
(4) To protect facility personnel who may be affected by wastewater
and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
(5) To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the facility;
(6) To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the facility; and
(7) To enable AUB to comply with National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, sludge and biosolids use and
disposal requirements, and any other federal or state industrial pretreatment
rules to which the facility is subject.
This chapter shall apply to all users inside or outside the city who are, by
implied contract or written agreement with AUB, dischargers of applicable
wastewater to the wastewater treatment facility. Chapter 2 provides for the
regulation of the wastewater system by the Athens Utilities Board. Chapter 3
provides for the issuance of permits to system users, for monitoring, compliance,
and enforcement activities; and establishes administrative review procedures
for industrial users or other users whose discharge can interfere with or cause
violations to occur at the wastewater treatment facility. (as added by Ord. #972,
Nov. 2008)

directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any such connections which
already exist on the effective date of the ordinance creating this chapter shall
be completely and permanently disconnected within sixty (60) days of the
effective day of the ordinance creating this chapter. The owners of any building
sewer having such connections, leaks or defects shall bear all of the costs
incidental to removal of such sources. Pipes, sumps and pumps for such sources
of ground water shall be separate from the sanitary sewer.
(3) Physical connection to public sewer. No person shall uncover,
make any connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public
sewer or appurtenance thereof, without approval from the Athens Utilities
Board. Connections will be made in accordance with Athens Utilities Board's
established policies and procedures.

No person, firm, association or corporation shall haul in or truck in to the WWF
any type of domestic, commercial or industrial waste unless such person, firm,
association, or corporation obtains written approval from the Athens Utilities
Board to perform such acts or services. Approval and acceptance of holding tank
or hauled waste will be done in accordance with Athens Utilities Board's
established policies and procedures. (as added by Ord. #972, Nov. 2008)
18-206. Discharge regulations. (1) General prohibitions. No person or
user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the WWF any pollutant or
wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general
prohibitions apply to all persons and users of the WWF whether or not they are
subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or
local pretreatment standards or requirements. Violations of these general and
specific prohibitions or the provisions of this section may result in the issuance
of an industrial pretreatment permit, surcharges, discontinuance of water
and/or sewer service and other fines and provisions of § 18-207. No person or
user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the WWF the following
pollutants, substances, or wastewater:

perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides.
(q) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure
or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the
WWF, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment
standard. A toxic pollutant shall include but not be limited to any
pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act.
(r) Any waste containing microbiological organisms, including
filamentous bacteria, in such quantity that will interfere with the normal
operation of the WWF.
(s) Any waste that, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Pollutants, substances, or
wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in
such a manner that they could be discharged to the WWF.
(t) Any substances which will cause the WWF to violate its
NPDES permit or the receiving water quality standards, or cause any
other product of the WWF such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation
process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the WWF cause the
WWF to be in non-compliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, 40
CFR 503, guidelines, or regulations developed under section 405 of the
Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or
disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean
Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to
the sludge management method being used.
(2) Local limits. In addition to the general and specific prohibitions
listed in this section, users permitted according to chapters 2 and 3 may be
subject to numeric and best management practices as additional restrictions to
their wastewater discharge in order to protect the WWF from interference or
protect the receiving waters from pass through contamination.

be required for residential users. All interception units or traps shall be
of a type and capacity approved by AUB, shall comply with AUB's Fats,
Oil, and Grease (FOG) control policy, and shall be so located to be easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be
inspected, cleaned, and repaired in accordance with AUB's FOG control
policy by the user at their expense. Failure to maintain any grease control
device in accordance with AUB's FOG control policy shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. If AUB is required to clean out, repair, or
replace a sewer line as a result of a stoppage due to, in part or in whole,
a user's failure to install or properly maintain a grease control device,
then the user shall be required to pay the costs of labor and materials
required to clean out, replace, or repair the sewer line.
(b) Solvents prohibited. The use of degreasing or line cleaning
products containing petroleum based solvents is prohibited. The use of
other products for the purpose of keeping FOG dissolved or suspended
until it has traveled into the WWF is prohibited.

regulations may be cited to city court, general sessions court, chancery court, or
other court of competent jurisdiction, face fines, have sewer service terminated
or the AUB may seek further remedies as needed to protect the collection
system, treatment plant, receiving stream and public health including the
issuance of discharge permits according to chapter 3. Repeated or continuous
violation of this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance and may result in
legal action against the property owner and/or occupant and the service line
disconnected from sewer main. Upon notice by the superintendent that a
violation has or is occurring, the user shall immediately take steps to stop or
correct the violation. AUB may take any or all the following remedies:
(1) Cite the user to city or general sessions court, where each day of
violation shall constitute a separate offense.

(3) Confidential information. All information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspection shall be available to the public or any
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests
and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator
that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the users.
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to
governmental agencies for use; related to this chapter or AUB's or user's NPDES
permit. Provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for
use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
Information accepted by the pretreatment coordinator as confidential
shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by
the pretreatment coordinator until and unless prior and adequate notification
is given to the user. (as added by Ord. #972, Nov. 2008)
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-29
18-303. Industrial user additional requirements. (1) Monitoring
facilities. The installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all
industrial users. A monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable
facility approved by the pretreatment coordinator.
When in the judgment of the pretreatment coordinator, there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced
by different operations of a single user the pretreatment coordinator may
require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate source
of discharge.
Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.
If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the pretreatment
coordinator, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense.
The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The pretreatment coordinator may,
however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right of way
with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right of way
and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expenses of the user.
(2) Sample methods. All samples collected and analyzed pursuant to
this regulation shall be conducted using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in the current edition of 40 CFR 136 and appropriate
EPA guidance. Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour
period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenol, and sulfide the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in
the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate.
(3) Representative sampling and housekeeping. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring
and flow measuring facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and in good
working order at all times. The failure of the user to keep its monitoring
facilities in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(4) Proper operation and maintenance. The user shall at all times
properly operate and maintain the equipment and facilities associated with spill
control, wastewater collection, treatment, sampling and discharge. Proper
operation and maintenance includes adequate process control as well as
adequate testing and monitoring quality assurance.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-30
(5) Inspection and sampling. AUB may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow AUB or its representative ready
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of
inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of
any of its duties. AUB, the approval authority and EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. AUB will utilize
qualified personnel or a private laboratory to conduct compliance monitoring.
Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from AUB, the approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibility.
(6) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,
the pretreatment coordinator or duly authorized employees of AUB shall observe
all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company and the
company shall be held harmless for injury or death to AUB employees and AUB
shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property by AUB
employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury or
property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the
monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence
or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
(7) New sources. New sources of discharges to the WWF shall have in
full operation all pollution control equipment at start up of the industrial
process and be in full compliance of effluent standards within ninety (90) days
of start up of the industrial process.
(8) Slug discharge evaluations. Evaluations will be conducted of each
significant industrial user according to the state and federal regulations. Where
it is determined that a slug discharge control plan is needed, the user shall
prepare that plan according to the appropriate regulatory guidance
(9) Accidental discharges or slug discharges. (a) Protection from
accidental or slug discharge. All industrial users shall provide such
facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to
prevent or minimize the potential for accidental or slug discharge into the
WWF of waste regulated by this chapter from liquid or raw material
storage areas, from truck and rail car loading and unloading areas, from
in plant transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and from
diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this chapter.
Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the pretreatment coordinator before the facility is
constructed.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-31
The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the
facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the requirements of
this chapter.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge or slug discharge. Any
person causing or suffering from any accidental discharge or slug
discharge shall immediately notify the pretreatment coordinator or the
chief operator of AUB's wastewater treatment facilities in person, or by
the telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken to minimize damage
to the WWF, the health and welfare of the public, and the environment.
This notification shall be followed, within five (5) days of the date
of occurrence, by a detailed written statement describing the cause of the
accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future
occurrence.
Such notification shall not relieve the user of liability for any
expense, loss, or damage to the WWF, fish kills, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any
fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
chapter or state or federal law.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(as added by Ord. #972, Nov. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #985, March
2010)
18-304. Reporting requirements. Users, whether permitted or
non-permitted may be required to submit reports detailing the nature and
characteristics of their discharges according to the following subsections. Failure
to make a requested report in the specified time is a violation subject to
enforcement actions under § 18-306.
(1) Baseline monitoring report. (a) Within either one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard,
or the final administrative decision on a category determination under
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the WWF shall submit to the superintendent a report which
contains the information listed in paragraph (b), below. At least ninety
(90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and
sources that become categorical industrial users subsequent to the
promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the
superintendent a report which contains the information listed in
paragraph (b), below. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-32
A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity
of pollutants to be discharged.

the facility including the name of operators and owners.
(ii) Permit information. A listing of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.
(iii) Description of operations. A brief description of the
nature, average rate of production (including each product
produced by type, amount, processes, and rate of production), and
standard industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out
by such user. This description should include a schematic process
diagram, which indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the
regulated processes.
(iv) Flow measurement. Information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula.
(v) Measurement of pollutants. (A) The categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process
and any new categorically regulated processes for existing
sources;
(B) The results of sampling and analysis
identifying the nature and concentration, and/or mass,
where required by the standard or by the superintendent, of
regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated
process;
(C) Instantaneous, daily maximum and long-term
average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be
reported;
(D) The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in 40 CFR 136 and amendments, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical standard.
Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the superintendent or the
applicable standards to determine compliance with the
standard;
(E) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile that data necessary to
comply with the requirements of this paragraph;
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-33
(F) Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with
the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user
should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to
allow use of the combined wastestream formula to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards;
(G) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR 136 or other approved methods;
(H) The superintendent may allow the submission
of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so
long as the data provides information sufficient to
determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(I) The baseline report shall indicate the time,
date and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and
shall certify that such sampling and analysis is
representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the WWF.
(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the
user's duly authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met
on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet
the pretreatment standards and requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment
and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule
shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section
must meet the requirements set out in § 18-304(2).
(e) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with § 18-304(14) and signed by
the duly authorized representative.
(2) Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by § 18-304(1)(d):
(a) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading
to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for
the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events
include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting
routine operation);
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-34
(b) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(c) The user shall submit a progress report to the
superintendent no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the

whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for
any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return
to the established schedule;
(d) In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between
such progress reports to the superintendent.
(3) Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the superintendent a report containing the information described in
§§ 18-304(1)(b)(iv) and (v). For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (14) of this
section. All sampling will be done in conformance with subsection (11).
(4) Periodic compliance reports. (a) All significant industrial users
must, at a frequency determined by the superintendent submit no less
than twice per year (April 10 and October 10) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(b) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified
in accordance with this ordinance.
(c) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(d) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the
procedures prescribed in subsection (11) of this section, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-35
(5) Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
superintendent of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least sixty
(60) days before the change.
(a) The superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 18-302.
(b) The superintendent may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under § 18-302 or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under § 18-302 in response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.
(6) Report of potential problems. (a) In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a
nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the
POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location
of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
(b) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
might be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources,
or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the
event of a discharge described in paragraph (a), above. Employers shall
ensure that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(d) Significant industrial users are required to notify the
superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
(7) Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain
an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to
the superintendent as the superintendent may require to determine users status
as non-permitted.
(8) Notice of violations/repeat sampling and reporting. Where a
violation has occurred, another sample shall be conducted within thirty (30)
days of becoming aware of the violation, either a repeat sample or a regularly
scheduled sample that falls within the required time frame. If sampling
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-36
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
superintendent within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the superintendent within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if AUB
performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if AUB
performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the
results of this sampling, or if AUB has performed the sampling and analysis in
lieu of the industrial user.
(9) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. (a) Section
18-206(1)(s) prohibits the disposal of "any waste that, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261."
(10) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question,
or where the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested
by the superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
(11) Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(a) Except as indicated in sections (b) and (c) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow
proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
superintendent. Where time proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by AUB, the samples must be representative of
the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple
grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be
composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by AUB as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous
limits
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-37
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using
grab collection techniques.
(c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety (90) day compliance reports required in subsections (1) and (3) of
this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist;
for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required
by subsection (4) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(12) Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13) Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established under
this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or
the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the superintendent.
(14) Certification statements. Signature and certification. All reports
associated with compliance with the pretreatment program shall be signed by
the duly authorized representative and shall have the following certification
statement attached:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel
properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my
inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons
directly responsible for gathering the information, the information
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting
false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-38
Reports required to have signatures and certification statement include,
permit applications, periodic reports, compliance schedules, baseline monitoring,
reports of accidental or slug discharges, and any other written report that may
be used to determine water quality and compliance with local, state, and federal
requirements. (as added by Ord. #972, Nov. 2008, and replaced by Ord. #985,
March 2010)
18-305. Enforcement response plan. Under the authority of Tennessee
Code Annotated, § 69-3-123, et seq.
(1) Complaints; notification of violation; orders.
(a) (i) Whenever the local administrative officer has reason
to believe that a violation of any provision of the Athens Utilities
Board's Wastewater Regulations, pretreatment program, or of
orders of the local hearing authority issued under it has occurred,
is occurring, or is about to occur, the local administrative officer
may cause a written complaint to be served upon the alleged
violator or violators.
(ii) The complaint shall specify the provision or
provisions of the pretreatment program or order alleged to be
violated or about to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute
a violation, may order that necessary corrective action be taken
within a reasonable time to be prescribed in the order, and shall
inform the violators of the opportunity for a hearing before the
local hearing authority.
(iii) Any such order shall become final and not subject to
review unless the alleged violators request by written petition a
hearing before the local hearing authority as provided in
§ 18-305(2), no later than thirty (30) days after the date the order
is served; provided, that the local hearing authority may review
the final order as provided in Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-123(a)(3).
(iv) Notification of violation. Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (i) through (iii), whenever the
pretreatment coordinator finds that any user has violated or is
violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirements, AUB
or its agent may serve upon the user a written notice of violation.
Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, the user shall
submit to the pretreatment coordinator an explanation of the
violation and a plan for its satisfactory correction and prevention
including specific actions. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section limits
the authority of AUB to take any action, including emergency
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-39
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
(b) (i) When the local administrative officer finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue one of the
following orders. These orders are not prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
(A) Compliance order. An order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the specified time, sewer
service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may
also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring, and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
federal pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order release the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation.
(B) Cease and desist order. An order to the user
directing it to cease all such violations and directing it to
immediately comply with all requirements and take needed
remedial or preventive action to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(C) Consent order. Assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other documents establishing an agreement
with the user responsible for noncompliance, including
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order.
(D) Emergency order. (1) Whenever the local
administrative officer finds that an emergency exists
imperatively requiring immediate action to protect
the public health, safety, or welfare, the health of
animals, fish or aquatic life, a public water supply, or
the facilities of the WWF, the local administrative
officer may, without prior notice, issue an order
reciting the existence of such an emergency and
requiring that any action be taken as the local
administrative officer deems necessary to meet the
emergency.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-40
(2) If the violator fails to respond or is
unable to respond to the order, the local
administrative officer may take any emergency action
as the local administrative officer deems necessary,
or contract with a qualified person or persons to carry
out the emergency measures. The local
administrative officer may assess the person or
persons responsible for the emergency condition for
actual costs incurred by AUB in meeting the
emergency.
(ii) Appeals from orders of the local administrative
officer.
(A) Any user affected by any order of the local
administrative officer in interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this chapter may file with the local
administrative officer a written request for reconsideration
within thirty (30) days of the order, setting forth in detail
the facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration.
(B) If the ruling made by the local administrative
officer is unsatisfactory to the person requesting
reconsideration, he may, within thirty (30) days, file a
written petition with the local hearing authority as provided
in subsection (2). The local administrative officer's order
shall remain in effect during the period of reconsideration.
(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided, any notice,
complaint, order, or other instrument issued by or under authority of this
section may be served on any named person personally, by the local
administrative officer or any person designated by the local
administrative officer, or service may be made in accordance with
Tennessee statutes authorizing service of process in civil action. Proof of
service shall be filed in the office of the local administrative officer.
(2) Hearings. (a) Any hearing or rehearing brought before the local
hearing authority shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
(i) Upon receipt of a written petition from the alleged
violator pursuant to this subsection, the local administrative
officer shall give the petitioner thirty (30) days' written notice of
the time and place of the hearing, but in no case shall the hearing
be held more than sixty (60) days from the receipt of the written
petition, unless the local administrative officer and the petitioner
agree to a postponement;
(ii) The hearing may be conducted by the local hearing
authority at a regular or special meeting. A quorum of the local
hearing authority must be present at the regular or special
meeting to conduct the hearing;
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-41
(iii) A verbatim record of the proceedings of the hearings
shall be taken and filed with the local hearing authority, together
with the findings of fact and conclusions of law made under
subdivision (a)(vi). The recorded transcript shall be made available
to the petitioner or any party to a hearing upon payment of a
charge set by the local administrative officer to cover the costs of
preparation;
(iv) In connection with the hearing, the chair shall issue
subpoenas in response to any reasonable request by any party to
the hearing requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
the hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a notice of
hearing or subpoena issued under this section, the chancery court
of McMinn County has jurisdiction upon the application of the
local hearing authority or the local administrative officer to issue
an order requiring the person to appear and testify or produce
evidence as the case may require, and any failure to obey an order
of the court may be punished by such court as contempt;
(v) Any member of the local hearing authority may
administer oaths and examine witnesses;
(vi) On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing,
the local hearing authority shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law and enter decisions and orders that, in its
opinion, will best further the purposes of the pretreatment
program. It shall provide written notice of its decisions and orders
to the alleged violator. The order issued under this subsection shall
be issued by the person or persons designated by the chair no later
than thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing;
(vii) The decision of the local hearing authority becomes
final and binding on all parties unless appealed to the courts as
provided in subsection (b).
(viii) Any person to whom an emergency order is directed
under § 18-305(1)(b)(i)(D) shall comply immediately, but on
petition to the local hearing authority will be afforded a hearing as
soon as possible. In no case will the hearing be held later than
three (3) days from the receipt of the petition by the local hearing
authority.
(b) An appeal may be taken from any final order or other final
determination of the local hearing authority by any party who is or may
be adversely affected, including the pretreatment agency. Appeal must
be made to the chancery court under the common law writ of certiorari
set out in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 27-8-101, et seq. within sixty (60)
days from the date the order or determination is made.
(c) Show cause hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsections (a) or (b), the pretreatment coordinator may order any user
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-42
that causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirements, to appear before the local administrative
officer and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the
action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. The notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not the
user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement action may be pursued
following the hearing date. A show cause hearing shall not be
prerequisite for taking any other action against the user. A show cause
hearing may be requested by the discharger prior to revocation of a
discharge permit or termination of service.
(3) Violations, administrative civil penalty. Under the authority of
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-125.
(a) (i) Any person including, but not limited to, industrial
users, who does any of the following acts or omissions is subject to
a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day
for each day during which the act or omission continues or occurs:
(A) Unauthorized discharge, discharging without
a permit;
(B) Violates an effluent standard or
limitation;
(C) Violates the terms or conditions of a permit;
(D) Fails to complete a filing requirement;
(E) Fails to allow or perform an entry, inspection,
monitoring or reporting requirement;
(F) Fails to pay user or cost recovery charges; or
(G) Violates a final determination or order of the
local hearing authority or the local administrative officer.
(ii) Any administrative civil penalty must be assessed in
the following manner:
(A) The local administrative officer may issue an
assessment against any person or industrial user
responsible for the violation;
(B) Any person or industrial user against whom an
assessment has been issued may secure a review of the
assessment by filing with the local administrative officer a
written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for
the violator's objections and asking for a hearing in the
matter involved before the local hearing authority and, if a
petition for review of the assessment is not filed within
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-43
thirty (30) days after the date the assessment is served, the
violator is deemed to have consented to the assessment and
it becomes final;
(C) Whenever any assessment has become final
because of a person's failure to appeal the assessment, the
local administrative officer may apply to the appropriate
court for a judgment and seek execution of the judgment,
and the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to
appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in the
amount of the assessment;
(D) In assessing the civil penalty the local
administrative officer may consider the following factors:
(1) Whether the civil penalty imposed will
be a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal
activity;
(2) Damages to the pretreatment agency,
including compensation for the damage or
destruction of the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works, and also including any penalties,
costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the
pretreatment agency as the result of the illegal
activity, as well as the expenses involved in enforcing
this section and the costs involved in rectifying any
damages;
(3) Cause of the discharge or violation;
(4) The severity of the discharge and its
effect upon the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works and upon the quality and quantity
of the receiving waters;
(5) Effectiveness of action taken by the
violator to cease the violation;
(6) The technical and economic
reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the
discharge; and
(7) The economic benefit gained by the
violator.
(E) The local administrative officer may institute
proceedings for assessment in the chancery court of the
county in which all or part of the pollution or violation
occurred, in the name of the pretreatment agency.
(iii) The local hearing authority may establish by
regulation a schedule of the amount of civil penalty which can be
assessed by the local administrative officer for certain specific
violations or categories of violations.
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-44
(iv) Assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the local administrative officer
shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for
other service charges and fees.
(b) Any civil penalty assessed to a violator pursuant to this
section may be in addition to any civil penalty assessed by the
commissioner for violations of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-115(a)(1)(F). However, the sum of penalties imposed by this section
and by Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-115(a) shall not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for each day during which the act
or omission continues or occurs.
(4) Assessment for noncompliance with program permits or orders.
(a) The local administrative officer may assess the liability of
any polluter or violator for damages to AUB resulting from any person's
or industrial user's pollution or violation, failure, or neglect in complying
with any permits or orders issued pursuant to the provisions of the
pretreatment program or this section.
(b) If an appeal from such assessment is not made to the local
hearing authority by the polluter or violator within thirty (30) days of
notification of such assessment, the polluter or violator shall be deemed
to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final.
(c) Damages may include any expenses incurred in
investigating and enforcing the pretreatment program of this section, in
removing, correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also
compensation for any actual damages caused by the pollution or violation.
(d) Whenever any assessment has become final because of a
person's failure to appeal within the time provided, the local
administrative officer may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment,
and seek execution on the judgment. The court, in its proceedings, shall
treat the failure to appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in
the amount of the assessment.
(5) Judicial proceedings and relief. The local administrative officer
may initiate proceedings in the chancery court of the county in which the
activities occurred against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have
violated or is about to violate the pretreatment program, this section, or orders
of the local hearing authority or local administrative officer. In the action, the
local administrative officer may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief
and any other relief available in law or equity.
(6) Termination of discharge. In addition to the revocation of permit
provisions in § 18-302(2)(g), users are subject to termination of their wastewater
discharge for violations of wastewater discharge permits, or orders issued
hereunder, or for any of the following conditions:

requested by the pretreatment coordination superintendent.
The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause, as provided in
subsection (2)(c) above, why the proposed action should not be taken.
(7) Disposition of damage payments and penalties--special fund. All
damages and/or penalties assessed and collected under the provisions of this
section shall be placed in a special fund by the pretreatment agency and
allocated and appropriated for the administration of its wastewater fund or
combined water and wastewater fund.
(8) Levels of non-compliance. (a) Insignificant non-compliance: For
the purpose of this guide, insignificant non-compliance is considered a
relatively minor infrequent violation of pretreatment standards or
requirements. These will usually be responded to informally with a
phone call or site visit but may include a Notice of Violation (NOV).
(b) "Significant noncompliance." Per 1200-4-14-.08(6)(b)8.
(i) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of
all of the measurements taken for each parameter taken during a
six (6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limit.
(ii) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined
here as those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of all of
the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a six
(6) month period equal or exceed the product of the numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous
limits multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC=1.4 for BOD, TSS
fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).
TRC calculations for pH are not required.
(iii) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement (daily maximum of longer-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the WWF
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass through (including endangering
the health of POTW personnel or the general public).
(iv) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused
imminent endangerment to human health, welfare or to the
environment or has resulted in the WWF's exercise of its
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-46
emergency authority under § 18-305(1)(b)(i)(D), emergency order,
to halt or prevent such a discharge.

(vii) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(viii) Any other violation or group of violations, which may
include a violation of best management practices, which the WWF
determines will adversely affect the operation of implementation
of the local pretreatment program.
Any significant non-compliance violations will be responded
to according to AUB's enforcement response plan.
(9) Public notice of significant violations. The superintendent shall
publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides
meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the WWF, a list of
the users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in
significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all
significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
paragraphs (c), (d) or (g) of this section) and shall mean:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six
(6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits;
(b) Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as
those in which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater
measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month
period equals or exceeds the product of the numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, multiplied by
the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH), TRC calculations for pH are not required;

endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
Change 13, June 15, 2010 18-47
superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent
such a discharge;
(e) Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled
date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in an individual
wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting
construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
(f) Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
(g) Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
(10) Criminal penalties. In addition to civil penalties imposed by the
local administrative officer and the State of Tennessee, any person who willfully
and negligently violates permit conditions is subject to criminal penalties
imposed by the State of Tennessee and the United States. (as added by

Appointments to membership on the AHPC shall be arranged so that the term of no more than two members shall expire each year and his/her successor(s) shall be appointed in like manner in terms of five (5) years, and members shall serve a maximum of two consecutive terms. All members shall serve without compensation.
C. Powers of the AHPC
The AHPC shall have the following powers, which shall be limited to the H-1 Historic Overlay District and H-C Conservation Overlay District.
1. The AHPC may conduct or cause to be conducted a continuing study and survey of resources within the City after receiving a Petition from property owners; however, the AHPC is not authorized and shall not incur any financial obligation without the express authorization of the Athens City Council. The AHPC shall not initiate a study and survey of resources. A study and survey of resources will be conducted when an Application Petition is received requesting the study and survey from at least 51% of the affected property owners in an area or neighborhood. The Application Petition shall list each parcel within the area or neighborhood and indicate the owner or owners of the parcel. Each parcel as shown on the Athens City Tax Map in an area or
81
neighborhood under consideration for designation within an historic preservation zone shall be considered when reviewing the Application Petition to determine if 51% of the affected property owners consent to the zoning change. To evidence consent to the zoning change, if a parcel is owned by more than one individual, the signature of one owner shall be sufficient to evidence consent to the zoning change unless the AHPC receives a written objection from a co-owner to the change in zoning. If the parcel is owned by a corporation or limited liability company, to evidence consent to the zoning change, a Resolution of the entity must be attached to the Petition stating the shareholders or members have held a meeting and the necessary vote was cast by the shareholders or members to consent to the zoning change. The AHPC shall develop its own rules and procedures with respect to an inventory of the proposed area and for the establishment of design guidelines to maintain the historical or architectural integrity of the area or neighborhood.
2. After the AHPC has completed its study and survey of resources, established the specific proposed historic zone, and established design guidelines for the zone, the original Petitioners shall prepare a second Petition for review by the property owners in the proposed historic zone, which shall be referred to as a Designation Petition. The Designation Petition shall include all of the findings of the AHPC, including, but not limited to, the study and survey of resources, a map of the proposed historic zone, and the design guidelines for the proposed historic zone. The Designation Petition shall be presented to the property owners in the proposed historic zone for a vote as to whether to designate the proposed area as an historic preservation zone. The AHPC will not recommend to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission or the Athens City Council that the proposed historic zone be designated as such unless 70% of the affected property owners consent to the zoning change. The AHPC shall adopt rules and procedures for determining if 70% of the affected property owners consent to the zoning change.
3. The AHPC shall furnish in writing to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission its recommendations regarding the nomination of Local Historic Overlay Districts and Local Conservation Overlay Districts and Local Landmarks after receiving the Designation Petition meeting all of the above requirements. The Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission shall furnish in writing to the Athens City Council its recommendations regarding the nomination of Local Historic Overlay Districts and Local Conservation Overlay Districts and Local Landmarks after review and consideration of the recommendation from the AHPC. Alternatively, the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission may refer the matter back to the AHPC with its suggested additions or revisions to the recommendation from the AHPC. If the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission refers the matter back to the AHPC, the AHPC may either make the additions and revisions suggested by the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission and send the new recommendation to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission or indicate in writing to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission that it requests the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission to reconsider the AHPC original recommendation and
82
forward the recommendation of the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission to the Athens City Council.
4. The Athens City Council shall review the recommendations of the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission and may formally approve the recommendation through an Ordinance prior to the establishment of a Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District or Local Landmark.
5. The AHPC shall grant or deny Certificates of Appropriateness, and may grant Certificates of Appropriateness contingent upon the acceptance by the applicant of specified conditions.
6. The AHPC does not have jurisdiction over interior arrangements of buildings and structures, except where such change will affect the exterior of the building and structures.
7. Subject to the express approval of the Athens City Council, and subject to the requirements of the City of Athens, the AHPC is authorized to apply for, receive, hold, and spend funds from private and public sources. Administration of funds will be by the City of Athens Finance Department.
8. Within the limits of any appropriations or grant in a budget approved by the Athens City Council and subject to the approval of the City Manager, the AHPC is authorized to utilize such staff, technical experts or other persons as may be required for the performance of its duties and to request the equipment, supplies, and other materials necessary for its effective operation.
9. The AHPC is authorized, solely in the performance of its official duties and only at reasonable times, to enter upon private land or water for the examination or survey thereof. No member, employee, or agent of the AHPC shall enter any private dwelling or structure without the express consent of the owner of record or occupant thereof.
D. RULES OF ORDER (BY-LAWS)
In order to fulfill the purposes of this ordinance and carry out the provisions contained therein:
1. The AHPC shall develop and adopt rules of order (by-laws), which shall govern the conduct of its business, and shall conform to Roberts Rules of Order. Such rules of order (by-laws) shall be a matter of public record. All meetings are subject to the open meetings law. By-laws will be reviewed by the city attorney before adoption by AHPC.
2. The AHPC annually shall elect from its membership a Chairman and Vice-Chairman. It shall select a Secretary from its membership. If neither the Chairman nor the Vice-Chairman attends a particular meeting, the remaining members shall
83
select an acting chairman from the members in attendance at such meeting if a quorum of the membership is present at the meeting.
3. Prior to the establishment of any Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District, the AHPC shall develop and adopt with input and assistance from the petitioning property owners for each proposed district, area or neighborhood a set of design review guidelines which the AHPC will apply in ruling upon the granting or denial of a certificate of appropriateness as provided for in this Ordinance. Such review guidelines shall insofar as possible be consistent with local, state, and federal guidelines and regulations including, but not limited to, building safety and fire codes and with regulations and standards adopted by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, applicable to the construction, alteration, rehabilitation, relocation or demolition of any building, structure or other improvement situated within a historic district which has been certified by the Secretary of the Interior as a registered historic district. Reasonable public notice and opportunity for public comment, by public hearing or otherwise, shall be required before the AHPC adopts any such review guidelines.
4. The AHPC shall keep minutes and records of all meetings and proceedings including voting records, attendance, resolutions, findings, determinations, and decisions. All such material shall be a matter of public record.
5. The AHPC shall establish its own regular meeting time; however, the first meeting shall be held after the adoption of this ordinance and within thirty (30) days after the initial appointment of the AHPC members. Regular meetings shall be scheduled at least once every month, unless there is no business on the agenda. The Chairman or any two (2) members may call a special meeting to consider an urgent matter by giving five days notice in a local newspaper.
E. DESIGNATION OF LOCAL HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICTS AND LOCAL CONSERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICTS AND LOCAL LANDMARKS
The City may establish but shall not initiate Local Historic Overlay Districts and Local Conservation Overlay Districts (H-1 Historic Overlay District and H-C Conservation Overlay District) and Local Landmarks within the area of its jurisdiction. Such Local Historic Overlay Districts and Local Conservation Overlay Districts and Local Landmarks shall be designated following the criteria contained in this ordinance.
1. A Designation Petition signed by at least 70% of affected property owners for Historic Overlay District and Conservation Overlay District rezoning shall be filed with the AHPC. Said petition shall indicate the map, group and parcel numbers of all properties proposed for rezoning. The petition shall be signed by the owners of the affected properties as discussed in C 2. The applicant, which may be the individual property owners or one (1) person may act as a liaison for more than one (1) property owner, shall present the request to the AHPC. The
84
AHPC shall review the petition and determine if it should be approved and recommended to the Planning Commission.
2. The AHPC shall initiate a continuing and thorough investigation of the archaeological, architectural, cultural, and historic significance of the Citys resources.

The AHPC shall work toward providing complete documentation for previously designated Local Historic Overlay Districts and Local Conservation Overlay Districts, which would include:
a. A survey of all property within the boundary of the district, with photographs of each building.
b. A survey which would be in format consistent with the statewide inventory format of the Tennessee Historical Commission (or State Historic Preservation Office).
3. Prior to submitting a recommendation to the Planning Commission for the establishment of a Historic Overlay District or Conservation Overlay District rezoning, the AHPC shall determine that the Petition meets all requirements as stated in this Ordinance, develop with the petitioning property owners and adopt the design review guidelines mentioned in D 3, and determine the following criteria exists:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings and structures that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association; and
a.) That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of history; or
b.) That are associated with the lives of persons significant in the past; or

c. A written statement of significance for the proposed Local Historic Overlay District, Local Conservation Overlay District, or Local Landmark.
d. A copy of the written confirmation of the seventy percent approval of the affected property owners.
e. A copy of the design review guidelines.
F. CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS
No exterior feature of any resource which is a designated Local Landmark or which is within a designated Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay
86
District, shall be altered, added to, relocated, or demolished until after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness of such work has been approved by the AHPC. Likewise, no construction, which affects a resource, shall be undertaken without a Certificate of Appropriateness.
1. The AHPC shall serve as a review body with the power to approve and deny applications for Certificates of Appropriateness.
2. In approving and denying applications for Certificates of Appropriateness, the AHPC shall accomplish the purposes of this section (3.04.16).

c. The reasons for the decision to approve or deny the application for a Certificate of Appropriateness
4. Expiration of a Certificate of Appropriateness: A Certificate of Appropriateness shall expire eighteen (18) months after its issuance. If the proposed work has not been completed prior to the expiration of eighteen (18) months, the owner may petition the AHPC for a reasonable extension of the Certificate of Appropriateness.
5. Resubmitting of Applications: Twelve months after denial of an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness, the application may be resubmitted without change. An amended or changed application may be resubmitted at any time.
G. CRITERIA FOR ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS
The AHPC shall use the Secretary of the Interiors Standards for Rehabilitation as the basis for Design Guidelines created in cooperation with the petitioning property owners for each Local Historic Overlay District (H-1), Local Historic Conservation Overlay District (H-C), or Local Landmark and the following criteria in granting or denying Certificates of Appropriateness:
1. General Factors:
a. Architectural design of existing buildings, structure, or appurtenance and proposed alteration
b. Historical significance of the resource
c. Materials composing the resource
d. Size of the resource
87
e. The relationship of the above factors to, and their effect upon, the immediate surroundings, and, if within a designated Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District, upon the district as a whole and its architectural and historical character and integrity
2. New Construction
a. The following aspects of new construction shall be visually compatible with the buildings and environment with which the new construction is visually related, including but not limited to: the height, the gross volume, the proportion between the width and height of the façade(s), the proportions and relationship between doors and windows, the rhythm of solids to voids created by openings in the façade, the materials, the textures, the patterns, the trims, and the design of the roof.
b. The existing rhythm (height, setbacks) created by existing building masses and spaced between them shall be preserved.
c. The landscape plan shall be compatible with the resource, and it shall be visually compatible with the environment with which it is visually related. Landscaping shall also not prove detrimental to the appearance of a resource, or adjacent public or private improvements like sidewalks and walls. A sketch and/or written landscape plan will be sufficient. If no change in the existing landscaping is being made then a landscape plan is not required.
d. No specific architectural style shall be required.
3. Exterior alteration:
a. All exterior alterations to a building, structure, object, site, or landscape feature shall be compatible with the resource itself and other resources with which it is related, as is provided in Section G, 1 and 2, and the design, over time, of a building, structure, object, or landscape feature shall be considered in applying these standards.
b. Exterior alterations shall not adversely affect the architectural character or historic quality of a Local Landmark or a resource within a designated Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District.
4. In considering an application for the demolition of a Local Landmark or a resource within a designated Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District, the following shall be considered:

H. PROCEDURES FOR ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS, REVIEW PROCESS, AND FEES.
Anyone desiring to take any action requiring a building permit shall submit an application for such with the city building official. If the building official determines that the property is in the H-1 Historic Overlay District or H-C Historic Conservation Overlay District, then the applicant will be advised that a Certificate of Appropriateness is required from the AHPC. The city building official shall take the application when the applicant has completed it. No building permit, which affects a Local Landmark or resource within a designated Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District, shall be issued by the city building official without a Certificate of Appropriateness. Such application shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure:
1. When any such application is filed, the city building official shall notify the AHPC Chairman or, Vice-Chairman, or staff of the application having been filed.
2. The Chairman or Vice-Chairman shall set the agenda for the regular meeting date or set a time and date, which shall be no later than thirty (30) days after the filing of the application for a hearing by the AHPC, and the city building official shall be so informed.
3. The applicant shall, upon request, have the right to a preliminary hearing (work session) by the AHPC for the purpose of making any changes or adjustments, which might be more consistent with the AHPCs standards.
4. At least five days notice should be given for the hearing and the city official designated by the City Manager shall provide written or verbal notice thereof to the applicant and to all members of the AHPC.
89
5. Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the city at least seven (7) days before such hearing and by posting such notice in the Athens Municipal Building on the bulletin board in the Department of Community Development.
6. At such hearing, the applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall have the right to present any relevant evidence in support of the application. Likewise, the AHPC shall have the right to receive any additional relevant evidence to support or deny the application from designated City of Athens officials or any property owner within the Local Historic Overlay District or Local Conservation Overlay District.
7. The AHPC shall have the right to conditional approval.
8. Either at the meeting or within fifteen (15) days after the hearing on an application, the AHPC shall act upon it, either by approving or denying the application. Action can be deferred until the next meeting of the AHPC if there are conditions that the AHPC has required prior to taking action, giving consideration to the factors set forth in Section G hereof. Action can only be deferred twice and action to accept or deny should be taken by the AHPC by the third meeting following the deferral (approximately 90 days). Evidence of approval of the application shall be by Certificate of Appropriateness issued by the AHPC and, whatever its decision, notice in writing shall be given to the applicant and the city building official.
9. The issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall not relieve an applicant for a building permit, special use permit, variance, or other authorization from compliance with any other requirement or provision of the laws of the City concerning zoning, construction, repair, or demolition.
I. APPEALS
The AHPC shall have exclusive jurisdiction relating to historic matters. Anyone who may be aggrieved by any final order of judgment of the commission may have said order of judgment reviewed by the courts by procedures of certiorari as provided for in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 27-9-102 and 27-9-103.
J. MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT
In order to ensure the protective maintenance of resources, the exterior features of such properties shall be maintained to meet the requirements of the Citys minimum housing and building codes.
K. PUBLIC SAFETY EXCLUSION
None of the provisions of this ordinance shall be construed to prevent any action of construction, alteration, or demolition necessary to correct or abate the unsafe or
90
dangerous condition of any resource, or part thereof, where such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the city building official or the fire department and where the proposed actions have been declared necessary by such authorities to correct the said condition provided, however, that only such work as is necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition may be performed pursuant to this section. In the event that any resource designated as a Local Landmark or located within the designated Local Historic Overlay District shall be damaged by fire or other calamity to such an extent that it cannot be repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal permit procedures and applicable laws, provided that:
The city building official concurs with the property owner that the resource cannot be repaired and restored and so notifies the AHPC in writing.
L. APPROPRIATIONS
The Athens City Council may make appropriations on behalf of the AHPC as necessary for the expenses of the operation of the AHPC and may make additional amounts available as necessary for the acquisition, restoration, preservation, operation, and management of historic properties.
M. DISQUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS BY CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Because the City may possess relatively few residents with experience in the individual fields of history, architectural history, archaeology, urban planning, law, or real estate, and in order not to impair such residents from practicing their trade for hire, members of the AHPC are allowed to contract their services to an applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness, and, when doing so, must expressly disqualify themselves from the AHPC during all discussions and voting for that application. In such cases, the City shall, upon the request of the Chairman of the AHPC or the Vice-Chairman in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the same field as the disqualified member and who will serve for that particular case only. If no qualified resident of the city is able to substitute for the disqualified member, the City may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who is not a resident. If any member of the AHPC must be disqualified due to a conflict of interest on a regular and continuing basis, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman, in his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his AHPC seat. Failing this resignation, and if the AHPC member continues to enter into conflict of interest situations with the AHPC, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the AHPC shall encourage the City to replace the member. Likewise, any member of the AHPC who has an interest in the property in question or in property within three hundred feet of such a property, or who is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy, or personal interest in a matter to be considered by the AHPC, shall be disqualified from participating in the consideration of any request for a Certificate of Appropriateness involving such a property. In such cases, a qualified substitute shall be appointed as provided above.
91
N. H-1 HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT
The established district is roughly bounded by the properties along East Madison Avenue, Ingleside Avenue, Guille Street, and Atlantic Street.
The H-1 District is an overlay zone that is to be attached to the official zoning map in following the process for a zoning map amendment. The H-1 District is an overlay district, meaning that the underlying zoning designation of the property prior to the attachment of the overlay zone is unchanged by the attachment of the zoning overlay district. Permitted uses, conditional uses, setbacks, and other property development rights and requirements affected by zoning are not affected by the H-1 District except as provided within the authority of the Athens Historic Preservation Commission established by Section 3.04.16 (Ordinance 973).
92
CHAPTER 4: - SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS FOR ALL DISTRICTS
4.01. ACCESS CONTROL.
In order to expedite the movement of traffic, to promote the safety of the motorist and pedestrian, and to minimize traffic congestion and conflict, it is necessary to reduce the points of vehicular contact. Therefore, to effectively control vehicular access onto the streets of Athens, it is necessary to classify such streets as follows: arterial street; collector street; and minor street. The classification of each street shall be as shown on the Revised Major Route Plan of Athens, Tennessee dated October 1978 which is kept in the Municipal Building. (The provisions in this section for arterial streets shall apply to both major and minor arterials on the Major Route Plan; collector street provisions apply to the primary collectors on the Major Route Plan; and minor street provisions apply to local streets on the Major Route Plan.)
A. Development Requiring Access Control Plan:
Commercial and Industrial Establishments and Apartment complexes of three (3) or more dwelling units must file an access control plan meeting all requirements of this Section and must have such plan approved by the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission prior to obtaining a building permit. This access control plan is often part of a "Site Plan" as specified in Section 4.17 of this ordinance. However, in the event that such a site plan is not required, an access control plan must still be submitted and approved. Although access control plans are not required for single-family homes and duplexes, the provisions of Section 4.01.D1, 2, and 3 shall be adhered to for access to these land uses.
B. General Access Regulations Applying to All Classifications of Streets:
1. Maximum Width of All Access Points:
The maximum width of all access points shall be thirty (30) feet measured at the property line except when the development requiring access generates high overall or high peak traffic volumes, the Athens Municipal -Regional Planning Commission (AMRPC) may approve a wider channeled access point to allow various turning movements for greater traffic control and safety.
2. Temporary Access Ways:
Temporary access ways may be granted by the Planning Commission at locations other than those specified for permanent access where it is expedient for the purpose of staged development. Temporary access ways shall be closed when permanent access to the property is completed.
3. Off-Street Parking Lanes Entirely Independent of Certain Public Streets:
93
In non residential districts, no off-street vehicular storage or parking area shall be allowed where the arrangement requires that vehicles back directly into a public street right-of-way.
4. Access for Lots Fronting on More Than One Street:
In all commercial developments where a lot abuts more than one street, the Planning Commission may require that the access be from the street of lowest classification when necessary to lessen serious congestion on the major street. If access is allowed onto two or more streets, the number of access points shall conform to those allowed for each street classification (see Subsection C).
5. Gasoline Service Stations:
Gasoline service stations shall be allowed two (2) access points onto the same street to allow proper circulation past the gasoline pumps. This is regardless of lot width or street classification provided the required access plan is approved by the AMRPC.
C. Construction of Frontage Roads and Interior Circulation Drives:
In order to limit the number of individual access points to an arterial or collector street, the AMRPC shall encourage and may require the development of Frontage Roads and Inter-connecting Interior Circulation Drives.
1. Frontage Roads:
Frontage roads are those which parallel the existing street and extend across the entire frontage of a particular large property or group of properties. Frontage roads may be required to provide safe and efficient public access to individual properties eliminating the traffic congestion which would be caused if each parcel had its own access onto the arterial or collector street. Access points between the frontage road and the arterial street shall be no closer together than 500 feet and no closer together than 300 feet along collector streets. All frontage roads shall be built to the standards specified in the City of Athens Minimum Subdivision Regulations Article 7, Sections 125, 126, and 127 and shall be dedicated as public streets and then maintained by the City of Athens.
Access requirements for property served by a frontage road shall be the same as for property fronting a minor street (i.e., at least 100 feet apart) except that the Planning Commission may also allow a regrouping of access points onto the frontage road in accordance with an approved site plan which does not destroy the intent of these access control provisions.
94
2. Interior Circulation Drives:
Interior circulation drives are needed in large developments which require large parking areas. These drives interconnect all parking lot access points with all buildings and areas of vehicular parking, loading, and servicing. They are constructed to provide safe and efficient vehicular movement between specified access points of a development or a series of developments. The Planning Commission shall encourage and may require that the interior circulation drives of adjacent developments be connected to eliminate the need to use the public streets to drive from one to another. All circulation drives shall be clearly defined and marked appropriately with arrows, etc., to assist public circulation into and out of the property and its parking areas.
An area of land not less than ten (10) feet deep shall be provided between the public street right-of-way line and the edge of all proposed frontage roads or interior circulation drives. This area will separate the roadways with a minimum turning radius. Such area shall be landscaped and grassed.
The width, placement, and design of frontage roads and interior circulation drives shall be reviewed by the Director of Public Works and the planning staff and shall be approved by the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission.
D. Specific Number of Access Points Allowed for Each Street Classification:
Wherever topographical features, existing developmental patterns, or other factors make the construction of frontage roads unfeasible, the Planning Commission shall allow direct access to the existing streets according to the following minimum requirements for each street classification:
1. Access Points for Arterial Streets (includes major and minor arterials):
In the absence of a frontage road, all lots having between 100 and 500 feet of frontage shall have no more than one (1) point of access to the public arterial. For lots with over 500 feet of frontage, additional access points shall be allowed provided they are spaced at least 500 feet apart from each other and from the first access point. For development generating high overall or high peak traffic volumes, the AMRPC may lessen the distance between access points to allow improved access provided a carefully planned pattern of internal and external channelization is prepared and approved.
When a lot of record fronting an arterial street has less than 100 feet of frontage, the AMRPC shall ask the landowner to first attempt to obtain joint
95
access with either adjacent property or access onto a frontage road. If this is not feasible, one single access point may be allowed.
2. Access Points for Collector Streets (also called primary collector streets):
In the absence of a frontage road, all lots less than 300 feet in width shall have no more than one (1) point of access to any one public street. For lots with over 300 feet of frontage, additional access points shall be allowed provided they are spaced at least 300 feet apart from each other and from the first access point.
3. Access Points for Minor Streets (also called local streets):
All lots of less than 100 feet shall have no more than one (1) point of access to the minor street. For lots with over 100 feet of frontage, additional access points shall be allowed provided they are spaced at least 100 feet apart from each other and from the first access point. (Frontage Roads shall also be considered Minor Streets in order to provide the most lenient access provisions to developers who construct these beneficial facilities.)
4.02. ACCESSORY USE REGULATIONS
The uses of land, buildings, and other structures permitted in each of the districts established by this ordinance are designated by listing the principal uses. In addition to such principal uses, accessory uses are also permitted in each district. Each accessory use shall:
1. Be customarily incidental to the principal use established on the same lot.
2. Be subordinate to and serve such principal use.
3. Be subordinate in area, intent, and purpose of such principal use.
4. Contribute to the comfort, convenience, or necessity of users of such principal use.
4.03. OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
Off-street automobile storage or standing space shall be provided on each lot upon which any of the following uses are hereinafter established. One (1) passenger vehicle space, regardless of parking lot design, shall be determined as two hundred (200) square feet of parking space (dimensions of 10 x 20) and such space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley. The number of parking spaces provided shall meet the minimum requirements and shall not exceed the maximum requirements for the specific uses as set forth below:
96
4.03.01 Residential Land Uses (MINIMUM):

134
Applicant means a landowner or developer or any party, representative, agent, successor, or heirs of the landowner of developer.
Construction means the erection of construction materials in a permanent manner, and includes excavation, demolition, or removal of an existing building.
Development plan means both a preliminary development plan and a final development plan.
Development standards means all locally adopted or enforced standards applicable to the development of property including, but not limited to planning: storm water requirements; layout; design; local infrastructure construction standards, off-site improvements, lot size, configuration, and dimensions. NOT included are standards required by federal or state law, or building construction safety codes.

Such plan may be in the form of, but not limited to, a planned unit development plan; subdivision plat; general development plan; subdivision infrastructure construction plan; final engineered site plan; or any other land-use approval designated utilized. UNLESS otherwise expressly provided by the City of Athens, such a plan shall include the boundaries of the site; significant topographical features affecting the development of the site; locations of improvements; building dimensions; and the location of all existing and proposed infrastructure on the site. Neither a sketch plan nor other document that fails to describe with reasonable certainty the use and development scheme may constitute a final development plan.
Preliminary development plan means a plan submitted to facilitate initial public feedback, and secure preliminary approvals from local government. It serves as a guide for all future improvements.
Site preparation means excavation, grading, demolition, drainage, and physical improvements such as water and sewer lines, footings, and foundations.
Vesting Rights and Periods
Vested property rights are established for any preliminary development plan, final development plan (where no preliminary development plan is required), or building permit issued to allow construction of a building to commence where there is no local requirement for prior approval of a preliminary development plan.
During the vesting period, the locally adopted development standards in effect on the date of approval remain the development standards applicable to that property or building during the vesting period as follows:
 Building permit projects (no preliminary plan approval) - The vesting period commences on the date of building permit issuance and remains in effect for the period authorized by the building permit.
135
 Development plan project - The vesting period applicable to a development plan is three years, beginning on the date of approval of the preliminary development plan; provided the applicant obtains final development plan approval, secure permits, and commences site preparation within the 3-year vesting period.
 If the applicant obtains approval of a final development plan, secures permits, and commences site preparation within the 3-year vesting period, then the vesting period is extended an additional two years (to a total of five years) to commence construction from the date of preliminary plan approval. During the two year period, the applicant shall commence construction and maintain any necessary permits to remain vested.
 If construction commences within the 5-year vesting period following preliminary development plan approval, the development standards in effect on the date of approval remain in effect until final completion of the project, provided however, that the vesting period shall not exceed ten (10) years unless the City of Athens grants an extension through an ordinance or resolution; and provided further that the applicant maintain all necessary permits during the 10-year period.
 Multi-phase projects  A separate vesting period applies for projects proceeding in two or more sections or phases (as set forth in the development plan).The development standards in effect on the date of approval of the preliminary development plan for the first section or phase remain in effect for all subsequent sections or phases; provided the total vesting period does not exceed fifteen (15) years unless the City of Athens grants an extension through an ordinance or resolution; and provided that the applicant maintain all necessary permits during the 15-year period.
A vested property right attaches to and runs with the applicable property and confers upon the applicant the right to undertake and complete the development
136
and use such property under the terms and conditions of a development plan, including any amendments thereto or under the terms and conditions of any building permit that has been issued with respect to the property.
Development plans
"Preliminary development plan" means a plan which has been submitted by an applicant and that depicts a single-phased or multi-phased planned development typically used to facilitate initial public feedback and secure preliminary approvals from local governments. Examples of information found on development plans include proposed land uses, density and intensity of development, public utilities, road networks, general location of off-street parking, building location, number of buildable lots, emergency access, open space, and other environmentally sensitive areas such as lakes, streams, hillsides, and view sheds. An approved preliminary development plan serves as a guide for all future improvements within defined boundaries.
"Final development plan" means a plan which has been submitted by an applicant and approved by a local government describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property. Such plan may be in the form of, but not be limited to, any of the following plans or approvals:
(i) A planned unit development plan;
(ii) A subdivision plat;
(iii) General development plan;
(iv) Subdivision infrastructure construction plan;
(v) Final engineered site plan; or
(vi) Any other land-use approval designation as may be utilized by the City of Athens

A variance shall not constitute a final development plan, and approval of a final development plan with the condition that a variance be obtained shall not confer a vested property right unless and until the necessary variance is obtained. Neither a sketch plan nor any other document which fails to describe with reasonable certainty the type of use, the intensity of use, and the ability to be served with essential utilities and road infrastructure for a specified parcel or parcels of property may constitute a final development plan.
Approval of a Development Plan
Approval of a development plan, regardless of type described above under the Development Plan section, shall occur when the development plan submitted
137
shall be determined by the City of Athens to meet all local, state and federal regulations governing the development.
Termination of Vesting Rights
During the vesting period, the locally adopted development standards which are in effect on the date of approval of a preliminary development plan or the issuance of a building permit, whichever applies, remain the development standards applicable to the property described in such preliminary development plan or permit, except such vested property rights terminate upon a written determination by the City of Athens under the following circumstances:
 When the applicant violates the terms and conditions specified in the approved development plan or building permit; provided, the applicant is given ninety (90) days from the date of notification to cure the violation; provided further, that the City of Athens may, upon a determination that such is in the best interest of the community, grant, in writing, an additional time period to cure the violation;
 When the applicant violates any of the terms and conditions specified in the local ordinance or resolution; provided, the applicant is given ninety (90) days from the date of notification to cure the violation; provided further, that the City of Athens may, upon a determination that such is in the best interest of the community, grant, in writing, an additional time period to cure the violation;]
 Upon a finding by the City of Athens that the applicant intentionally supplied inaccurate information or knowingly made misrepresentations material to the issuance of a building permit or the approval of a development plan or intentionally and knowingly did not construct the development in accordance with the issued building permit or the approved development plan or an approved amendment for the building permit or the development plan; or
 Upon the enactment or promulgation of a state or federal law, regulation, rule, policy, corrective action or other governance, regardless of nomenclature, that is required to be enforced by the City of Athens and that precludes development as contemplated in the approved development plan or building permit, unless modifications to the development plan or building permit can be made by the applicant, within ninety (90) days of notification of the new requirement, which will allow the applicant to comply with the new requirement.
The City of Athens may allow a property right to remain vested despite such a determined occurrence when a written determination is made that such continuation is in the best interest of the community by the City of Athens.
Development Standards Enforcement
A vested development standard shall not preclude city enforcement of any development standard when:
 The City of Athens obtains the written consent of the applicant or owner;
138
 The City of Athens determines, in writing, that a compelling, countervailing interest exists relating specifically to the development plan or property which is the subject of the building permit that seriously threatens the public health, safety or welfare of the community and the threat cannot be mitigated within a reasonable period of time, as specified in writing by the City of Athens, by the applicant using vested property rights;
 Upon the written determination by the City of Athens of Athens of the existence of a natural or man-made hazard on or in the immediate vicinity of the subject property, not identified in the development plan or building permit, and which hazard, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare and the threat cannot be mitigated within a reasonable period of time, as specified in writing by the local government, by the applicant using vested property rights;
 A development standard is required by federal or state law, rule, regulation, policy, corrective action, order, or other type of governance that is required to be enforced by the City of Athens, regardless of nomenclature; or
 A City of Athens is undertaking an action initiated or measure instituted in order to comply with a newly enacted federal or state law, rule, regulation, policy, corrective action, permit, order, or other type of governance, regardless of nomenclature.
Development Plan Amendment
An amendment to an approved development plan by the applicant must be approved by the City of Athens to retain the protections of the vested property right. An amendment may be denied based upon a written finding by the City of Athens that the amendment:
 Alters the proposed use;
 Increases the overall area of the development;
 Alters the size of any nonresidential structures included in the development plan;
 Increases the density of the development so as to affect traffic, noise or other environmental impacts; or
 Increases any local government expenditure necessary to implement or sustain the proposed use.
If an amendment is denied by the City of Athens based upon such a written finding, then the applicant may either proceed under the prior approved plan with the associated vested property right or, alternatively, allow the vested property right to terminate and submit a new application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vested property right shall not terminate if the City of Athens determines, in writing, that it is in the best interest of the community to allow the development to proceed under the amended plan without terminating the vested property right.
Waiver Rights Prohibited
A City of Athens may not require an applicant to waive the applicant's vested
139
rights as a condition of approval, or as a consideration of approval, of a development plan or the issuance of a building permit.
Extension of Rights
The vesting period for an approved construction project may be extended as deemed advisable by the City of Athens.
Zoning with Vested Property Rights
A vested property right, once established, precludes the effect of any zoning action by a City of Athens which would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, or otherwise delay the development of the property, while vested, as described in an approved development plan or building permit. With said exception, nothing shall preclude, change, amend, alter or impair the authority of a City of Athens to exercise its zoning authority.
Development Moratorium
In the event a City of Athens enacts a moratorium on development or construction, the vesting period established by this act shall be tolled during the moratorium period.

4.20. RESIDENTIAL TOWNHOUSE AND PATIO HOME (RT-PH) REGULATIONS.
A. Purpose:
143
In certain Athens' zoning districts, fee-simple townhouses and patio homes are allowed to increase the variety of available housing choices. Within these districts, townhouse units and patio homes can be developed and sold as individually-deeded lots in fee-simple, provided the developer follows the specific regulations established in this section for "zero lot line" townhouse units or patio homes.
B. Definitions:
1. RESIDENTIAL TOWNHOUSES: A "townhouse" is defined as a single-family residential dwelling of one or more floors, having or appearing to have a common wall with an adjacent similar unit or units. The ownership of a townhouse shall include the walls inward and the ground underneath to include the front and rear yard, end units shall have one side yard, interior units shall be to the common walls.
2. PATIO HOMES: A "patio home" for the purposes of the Athens Municipal Zoning Ordinance shall be defined as a single-family residential dwelling of one or more floors, which does not have any common walls shared with an adjacent unit or units, but which is located to one side of a less than standard width lot. That is, these homes have a "zero foot" setback on one side to maximize the amount of usable outdoor lot area on the other side for a patio, landscaped garden, or other outdoor living area.
C. Regulations for Townhouses:
All townhouse complexes shall incorporate the following features, which have proved to provide the most attractive developments:
1. They shall contain between three (3) and six (6) units in each building;
2. Each townhouse shall have an architectural character that is individual yet compatible with its neighbors;
3. The front facades shall be off-set horizontally and the roof lines shall be off-set vertically from one another to avoid the appearance of an apartment building;
4. One story units, when used, shall be placed on the end of a building.
Since a townhouse complex involves common walls unlike the patio home, some separate requirements are necessary to each type of development. (Note: The regulations in Section E also apply to townhouses.)
5. Subdivision Plat Approval Procedure for Townhouse Construction:
144
Since it is intended that the land in a townhouse development be used for owner-occupied townhouses, each townhouse shall occupy a separate subdivision lot. Since the townhouses are joined or appear to be joined, they shall be built as entire units.
Therefore, to prevent the sale of individual un-built lots, no individual lots can be recorded until the following subdivision and development process shall have been followed by the developer:
a. Prepare a site plan and a preliminary subdivision plat for the proposed townhouse development.
b. Present the site plan to the Community Development Department for approval and the preliminary subdivision plat to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission for approval.
c. Proceed to construct the required streets, etc., and the building units according to these approved plans after obtaining needed building permits. (This may be done for the entire development or may be done in phases.)
d. Present final plat of the built-up phases to city staff for inspection and verification and then to the Athens Municipal-Regional Planning Commission for final subdivision approval. (The final plat shall show the individual lot lines exactly where the side walls of the individual units were built.)
e. If all the final subdivision requirements of the Athens Minimum Subdivision Regulations have been met, the planning commission shall grant final subdivision approval for the phases that have been constructed with townhouses.
f. The developer records this final plat and can then sell these townhouse units.

5.02. NONCONFORMING USES.
It is the intent of this ordinance to recognize that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of the existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance.

Such lot may be used as a building site, provided, however, that the yard and other requirements of the district are compiled with as closely as, in the opinion of the Board of Zoning Appeals, is possible.
B. No lot which is now or hereafter built upon shall be so reduced in area that the yards and open space will be smaller than prescribed by this ordinance, and no yard, court, or open space provided around any building for the purpose of complying with the provisions hereof, shall again be considered as a yard, court, or other open space for another building.

For reasons fully set forth in the findings of the Board, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land. Mere loss in value shall not justify a variance. There must be a deprivation of any beneficial use of land;

MINIMUM SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
FOR
ATHENS, TENNESSEE
TITLE
REGULATIONS CONTROLLING THE SUBDIVISION OF LAND IN ATHENS, TENNESSEE, AND ITS PLANNING REGION: REQUIRING AND REGULATING THE PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF PRELIMINARY AND FINAL DESIGN STANDARDS: REQUIRING MINIMUM IMPROVEMENTS TO BE MADE OR GUARANTEED TO BE MADE BY THE SUBDIVIDER: SETTING FORTH THE PROCEDURE TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN APPLYING THESE RULES, REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS: AND PRESCRIBING PENALTIES FOR THE VIOLATION OF ITS PROVISIONS.
PURPOSE
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult. Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore in the interest of the public, the developer and the future owner that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and the proper minimum standards set forth in this document.
8
ARTICLE 1: - PREAMBLE AND ENACTMENT CLAUSE
In pursuance of authority set forth in Sections 13-3-401 through 13-3-413, Tennessee Code Annotated, and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of the city; to encourage economically sound and stable land development; to assure the provision of required streets, utilities and other facilities and services to land developments; to assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in land development; to assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational and other public purposes; and to assure that land is developed in conformity with the Comprehensive Plan of Athens, the Planning Commission of Athens, Tennessee, does ordain and enact the following articles and sections:
9
ARTICLE 2: - SHORT TITLE
This document shall be known and may be cited as the "Minimum Subdivision Regulations of Athens, Tennessee."
10
ARTICLE 3: - DEFINITION OF CERTAIN TERMS USED HEREIN
Except as specifically defined herein, all words used in these regulations have their customary dictionary definitions where not inconsistent with the context. For the purpose of these regulations, certain words or terms are defined as follows:
The term "shall" is mandatory. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the singular include the plural and those used in the plural number include the singular. Words used in the present tense include the future.
Block - A tract of land bounded by streets or by a combination of streets and public lands, cemeteries, railroad rights-of-way, shorelines of waterways or any other barrier to the continuity of development.
Building - Any structure built for the support, shelter or enclosure of persons, animals, or movable property of any kind and includes any structure.
Building Setback Line - A line in the interior of a lot which is generally parallel to and a specified distance from the exterior property lines set forth in the City of Athens Zoning Ordinance; which creates a space between such lines in which no primary use structure allowed in each zoning district shall be placed.
Buildable Area of a Lot - That portion of a lot bounded by the required front, rear, and side yards where the primary structure/s can be constructed upon a lot.
Collector Street or Road - A major public way intended to move traffic from local ways to arterial routes. Collector routes serve a neighborhood or large subdivision(s) and normally have an average daily traffic count ranging from one thousand and one (1,001) to three thousand (3,000).
Comprehensive Plan - A comprehensive long-range plan is intended to guide the growth and development of a community or region and one that includes analysis, recommendations and proposals for the community's population, economy, housing, transportation, community facilities and land use.
Condominium - A form of ownership of less than the whole of a building or system of buildings under the provisions of Title 66, Chapter 27, Tennessee Code Annotated, which provides the mechanics and facilities for formal filing and re-coordination of divided interests in real property, whether the division is vertical or horizontal.
Condominium Subdivision - The subdivision of property through the establishment of a condominium or horizontal property regime.
Horizontal Condominium Subdivision - A subdivision where each unit occupies some ground space.
11
Vertical Condominium Subdivision - A subdivision of a multi-story building in which one (1) or more units do not occupy ground space.
Condominium Unit - A space conveyed by separate title and located within a condominium structure.
Conservation Easement - The grant of a property right or interest from the property owner to a unit of government or nonprofit conservation organization stipulating that the described land shall remain in perpetuity in it its natural, scenic, open or wooded state, precluding future or additional development. The land may contain historic structures and archaeological sites.
Conservation Land - The portion of undeveloped land within a conservation subdivision that has been designated, dedicated, reserved or restricted in perpetuity from further development and is set aside under a conservation easement. Conservation Lands are divided into Primary and Secondary Conservation areas. Land to accommodate required subdivision infrastructure, including green infrastructure such as planting strips, street medians/islands, drainage fields for individual sewage disposal systems, and conventional stormwater management devices, is excluded from Conservation Land calculations. Conventional stormwater management devices are those designed to hold water for an extended period of time and require disturbance of the land in order to meet detention requirements.
Conservation Subdivision - A residential development where at least 50 percent or more of the land area is designated as undivided, permanent open space or farmland, thereby permanently protecting agriculturally, environmentally, culturally or historically significant areas within the tract. The subdivision is characterized by compact lots, common open space, and the preservation maintenance of natural, historical, and cultural resources. Conservation Subdivisions are an alternative approach to the conventional lot-by-lot division of land in rural areas that spreads development evenly throughout a parcel with little regard to impacts on the natural and cultural features of the area.
Construction (Engineering) Plans - The professional engineered stamped design drawings of a subdivision showing the specific location and design of improvements to be installed in the subdivision in accordance with these regulations submitted to the Planning Commission for approval.
Conventional Subdivision.- A lot-by-lot division of land that spreads development throughout a parcel utilizing all lands for proposed lots, drainage structures and roads without placing any lands into common ownership or preserving lands that will never be developed. The minimum lot sizes are determined by underlying zoning or the McMinn County Health Environmentalist.
Culvert - A culvert is a covered structure that conveys a flow of water under a road, railroad or other obstruction. Culverts are mainly used to divert stream or rainfall runoff to prevent erosion or flooding on highways.
12
Design Plat - A map of a proposed subdivision showing the lot sizes and layout, location and sizes of streets and used as an aid in discussing the design of the proposed subdivision.
Developer - The legal or beneficial owner of a lot or of any land included in a proposed development including the holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other persons having enforceable proprietary interests in such land, and which undertakes the activities covered by these regulations. In as much as the subdivision plan drawings are merely a necessary means to the end of assuring satisfactory development, the term "developer" includes "subdivider", "owner" or "builder" even though the persons and their precise interests may vary at different project stages.
Drainage - (1) Surface water runoff; (2) the removal of surface water or ground water from land by drains, grading or other means which include runoff controls to minimize erosion and sedimentation during and after construction or development, the means for preserving the water supply and the prevention or alleviation of flooding.
Dwelling Unit - A room, or rooms connected together constituting a separate, independent housekeeping establishment for owner occupancy, rental or lease on a daily, weekly, monthly, or longer basis; physically separated from any other room(s) or dwelling units which may be in the same structure; and containing independent cooking and sleeping facilities.
Easement - Authorization by a property owner for the use by another, for a specified purpose, of any designated part of their property.
Easement Vehicular - the right granted by the owner of land to another party by deed or prescription to allow vehicular access across one parcel of land to another.
Easement, Utility - the right granted by the owner of land to allow utility facilities to be constructed, maintained or preserved. Utility easements shall include, but are not limited to, easements for storm drainage, water lines, sewer lines, electric power lines, and pipe lines.
Easement, Drainage - A perpetual, unobstructed easement across property reserved to carry water drainage along specified routes to natural water courses. Drainage easements shall not be filled or built upon in any way that will impede the flow of surface water.
Final Plat - The final map or drawing and accompanying materials, with all required signatures/approvals of every public utility and entity required and described in these regulations, on which the subdivider's plan of the subdivision is presented to the Planning Commission for approval and which, if approved by the Commission, is recorded with the County Register of Deeds.
Flag Lot - An interior lot located to the rear of another lot but with a narrow portion of the lot extending to the street. The narrow portion of the lot that extends to the street shall be
13
the minimum required width per these regulations and must be suitable for ingress and egress to the parcel.
Flood - A general overflow of a stream which results in inundation of lands not normally covered by water.
Floodway Encroachment Limits - The lines marking the limits of floodways on official federal, state and local floodplain maps.
Floodway Fringe - The area adjoining a watercourse which, although not lying within a floodway, has been or may hereafter be covered by a one hundred (100) year flood event.
Grading - Any stripping, cutting, filling, compacting, stockpiling of earth or land, including the land in its cut or filled condition.
Health Authority - The director of the county or district health department having jurisdiction over the county health, or their duly authorized representative.
Highway, Limited Access - A freeway or expressway providing a traffic way for through traffic, in respect to which owners or occupants of abutting property(s) or lands and other persons have no legal right of access to or from the traffic way, except at such points and in such manner as may be determined by the public authority having jurisdiction over such traffic way.
Homeowners Association - A community association that can apply to any type of residential development, which is organized in the development of which individual owners share common interests in open space, structures or facilities.
Improvements - Physical changes made to raw land and structures on or under the land surface in order to make the land more usable for man's activities. Typical improvements in these regulations would include but not be limited to grading, street pavement, curbs, gutters, drainage ditches, storm and sanitary sewers, street name signs and street trees.
Individual Sewage Disposal System - A septic tank, seepage title sewage disposal system, or any other sewage treatment device other than a public treatment system approved by the appropriate governmental representative.
Land Subject to Flood. Anything which can be expected to be reached by floodwater because of its proximity to a stream and/or because it is below a designated elevation shall be considered to be subject to flood.
Land Use Plan - A plan showing the existing and proposed location, extent and intensity of development of land to be used in the future for varying types of residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, educational and other public and private purposes or combination of purposes.
14
Lot. A portion or parcel of land separated from other portions or parcels by description as on a subdivision plat or record of survey map or as described by metes and bounds, and intended for transfer of ownership or for building development. For the purpose of these regulations, the term does not include any portion of a dedicated right-of-way.
Lot, Corner - A lot situated at the intersection of two (2) or more streets.
Lot Depth - The average distance from the street line of the lot to its rear line measured in the general direction of the side lines of the lot.
Lot, Double Frontage - Double frontage lot means a lot with street frontage along two opposite boundaries. On a double frontage lot both street lines shall be deemed front lot lines unless Zoning Code District states otherwise. (See Types of Lots Figure on page 39)
Lot Frontage - That dimension of a lot or portion of a lot abutting on a street excluding the side dimension of a corner lot.
Lot, Reverse Frontage - A reverse frontage lot is a double frontage lot for which the boundary along one of the streets is established as the rear lot line, and over the rear of which is a utility easement. The rear lot line of the lot shall be that boundary abutting a primary arterial, railroad right-of-way or other disadvantageous use.

The enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the unapproved recordation or transfers of land are provided by state law in the authority granted by public acts of the State of Tennessee.
Section 41. Platting Authority. From and after the passage of these regulations, the Planning Commission shall be the official platting authority, and no plat of a land subdivision shall be entitled to record in the office of the McMinn County Register of Deeds unless it shall have the approval of the Planning Commission inscribed thereon. The filing or recording of a plat of a subdivision without the approval of the Planning Commission, as required by these regulations, is declared to be a misdemeanor, punishable by law, with each day of noncompliance being a separate offense.
Section 42. Use of Plat. The transfer of, agreement to sell, or negotiation to sell land by reference to or exhibition of, or other use of a subdivision plat that has not been given final approval by the Planning Commission and recorded in the office of the McMinn County Register of Deeds is prohibited, and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties.
Section 43. Enforcement. No plat or plan of a subdivision located within the area of planning jurisdiction shall be filed or recorded by the McMinn County Register of Deeds until said plat or plan has received final approval in writing by the Planning Commission as provided in Section 13-3-402, Tennessee Code Annotated.
Section 44. Opening and Improving Public Streets (Roads). No public officer, authority or county governing body shall accept, layout, open, improve, grade, pave, or light any street, lay or authorize the laying of water mains or sewers, or the construction of other facilities or utilities in any street located within the area of planning jurisdiction unless such street shall have been accepted, opened or otherwise received the legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of these regulations, or unless such street corresponds in its location and lines to a street shown on a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Commission, or on a street plan made and adopted by the Commission as provided in Section 13-3-406, Tennessee Code Annotated.
Section 45. Erection of Buildings. No building permit shall be issued and no building shall be erected on any lot in a proposed subdivision within the area of jurisdiction of the Planning Commission unless final plat approval is granted and the plat recorded at the Resister of Deeds office.
Within the corporate limits of the City of Athens, any building or structure erected in violation of this section shall be deemed an unlawful building or structure, and the building inspector or the city attorney may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or removed.
Section 46. Penalties. No county register shall receive, file or record a plat of a subdivision within the planning region without the approval of the Planning Commission as required in Section
21
13-3-402, Tennessee Code Annotated, and any county recorder so doing shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law.
Section 13-3-410, Tennessee Code Annotated, provides that whoever being the owner or agent of the owner of any land, transfers or sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land without having submitted a plat of such subdivision to the Planning Commission and obtained its approval as required before such plat be recorded in the office of the appropriate county register, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law; and the description by metes and bounds in the instrument or other document used in the process of selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties. The city, through its attorney or other official, designated by its chief legislative body, may enjoin such transfer or sale of agreement by action or injunction.

23
ARTICLE 5: - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
Section 51. Name of Subdivision. The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the Planning Commission. The name shall not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision.
Section 52. Access. Access to every subdivision lot shall be provided over a public street or a private street built to City Standards.
Section 53. Public Use Areas. When features of other plans adopted by the Planning Commission (such as schools or other public building sites, parks or other land for public use) are located in whole or in part in a land subdivision, land for such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within one (1) year by the appropriate public agency.
Whenever a plat proposes the dedication of land to public uses that the Planning Commission finds not required or not suitable for such use, the Planning Commission shall refuse to approve the plat, and shall notify the governing body of the reasons for such action.
Where public use is to be made of the property and where the residents of the subdivision will receive primary benefit, the dedication of the property should be encouraged. Where the public use is for the public as a whole, the community should pay proportionately for the acquisition of reserved areas within a reasonable time. A reasonable time is to be determined according to the circumstances, because the subdivider should not be required to hold their land idle for a lengthy and indefinite period.
Section 54. Suitability of the Land. The Planning Commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if, from adequate investigations conducted by all public agencies concerned, it has been determined that in the best interest of the public the site is not suitable for planning and development purposes of the kind proposed. This includes land which is:
a. Physically unsuitable because of flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock formations, unsuitable soil, and other features which may endanger health, life, or property, aggravate erosion, increase the flood hazard, or necessitate expenditure of public funds for supply and maintenance of services and/or which other public agencies have investigated and found to be not in the best interest of the public.
b. Unsuitably located by reason of being scattered or premature subdivision of land which would involve danger or injury to the health, safety, property, or economic utilization because of lack of or adverse effect on water supply, schools, proper drainage, good transportation, or other public services or facilities that would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for supply or maintenance of such services or elimination of danger.
24
Section 55. Individual Mobile Home Parks and Subdivisions. The requirements and regulations of the City of Athens Zoning Code Section 3.04.05 R-4 MOBILE HOME PARK DISTRICT shall be satisfied and the approval of the local health authority must be secured prior to approval by the Planning Commission of any mobile home or travel trailer park.
A mobile home subdivision shall meet the general requirements of these regulations prior to the approval of any plat and before the sale or lease of any individual mobile home lots.

Street parking must, of course, be considered in the pavement widths. Where no street parking is permitted or none is anticipated, allowances may be made. A parallel parking lane normally requires eight (8) feet. On minor streets a moving traffic lane should have a minimum of ten (10) feet. On neighborhood streets where the abutting property has adequate off-street parking and traffic moves slower, provision for one (1) lane of parking and two (2) nine (9) foot traffic lanes may be adequate. (Pavement widths for major streets are normally a responsibility of the governing body.)
Section 74. Street Grades. Maximum and minimum street grades shall be fourteen (14) percent and one percent (1 %) respectively.

Reverse frontage lots shall have a depth of not less than one hundred fifty (150) feet. A planted evergreen screen easement at least ten (10) feet wide, across which there shall be no right-of-access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting a traffic artery or other incompatible land use.
Section 88. Flag Lots. In the Athens Planning Region, flag lots shall be allowed only if they meet these requirements:
a. For flag lots of one (1) acre or less, the access strip shall be a maximum of 300 feet in length and a minimum of 25 feet in width;
37
b. For flag lots of more than one (1) acre, the access strip shall be a maximum of 500 feet in length and a minimum of 50 feet in width. (This wider access strip will allow room for a public street when and if the flag lot is ever re-subdivided.)
c. The overall subdivision shall be designed so that the point where the access strip of the flag lot abuts the public street shall be safe for vehicular ingress and egress as far as visibility and grade are concerned since, unlike the purchaser of a conventional lot, the owner of a flag lot will have no other choice as to driveway location. (The safety of this intersection is even more important if the flag lot is ever made into a subdivision housing a number of families.
d. Whenever 50 foot wide access strip is required, the developer shall locate it on land which affords a grade which would meet Section 74 so that if the flag lot is subdivided, the planning commission will be able to approve the grade of the new public road built on the right-of-way necessary to construct a street meeting the requirements of Section 74. (This requirement is needed so that the city does not, at a future date, have a dangerous road which is difficult to maintain and to serve public vehicles such as buses, fire trucks, etc.)
e. Within the portion of the flag lot which doesn't include the access strip, the various building setbacks for front, side and rear shall still apply and be measured from the boundaries of the portion excluding the access strip.
f. Minimum lot sizes shall be calculated, excluding the access strip.
g. No more than two flag lot access strips shall be located side-by-side.

The provisions of this section shall apply to all major subdivisions and may apply to minor subdivisions if deemed appropriate by the Athens Regional Planning Commission.
Section 1213. Sewage Disposal. When any portion of a proposed subdivision is located within five hundred (500) feet of an existing public sanitary sewer line, sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve all the lots within the subdivision. Should the subdivision have elevations which are below those of the nearest public sanitary sewer, a lift station shall be installed by the subdivider provided the public sanitary sewer is within a reasonable distance of all portion of the subdivision. Alternative designs utilizing grinder pumps may be used upon approval by the local district authority. All sanitary sewer construction shall be built in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Tennessee Department of Public Health. All construction of sanitary sewers and appurtenances shall be by an appropriate utility district, either with their own forces or by contract, upon the subdivider making proper bond or financial arrangements with said district.

The end of each house service shall be properly marked.
The entire cost and expense of installing the required sanitary sewage system including the connection to the existing public sanitary sewer line and including but not limited to the cost of pipe, manholes, lift stations, force mains, trenching, excavation, backfill and services shall be borne by the subdivider including the stipulated payment for tapping the system to serve each lot.
Where a subdivision is located beyond the service limits as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider may elect to have the lots served by individual sewage disposal systems. Should individual sewage disposal systems be proposed, satisfactory evidence of acceptability in the form of certified approved percolation tests shall be required. Subdivisions
51
shall also have lot sizes which are adequate for the installation of the proposed individual system and all such subdivisions shall be approved by the McMinn County Health Authority, in writing.
The provisions of this section shall apply to all major subdivisions and may apply to minor subdivisions if deemed appropriate by the Athens Regional Planning Commission.
NOTE: Upon receipt of a preliminary plat, the Health Authority reviews the data and a field investigation of each lot is made. If percolation rates are acceptable, other topographic features including lot sizes are considered. In addition to unsatisfactory percolation test results, lots may be deemed unacceptable because of rock outcroppings, gullies, natural storm drains, excessive slope and the like. In view of topographic features and percolation test results, the maximum amount of available unusable area for subsurface disposal is determined for each lot. By using the Recommended Guide for the Location, Design, and Construction of Septic Tanks and Disposal Fields, 1967, Tennessee Department of Public Health, calculations are made to determine the maximum number of bedrooms for a home and/or the maximum daily flow of sewage from establishments or institutions allowable for each lot. These data limitations and restrictions will be entered on the preliminary plat by the Health Authority and shall be shown on the final plat. This does not preclude the developer from enlarging lot sizes, combining unsuitable lots with acceptable ones, or designating certain lots for uses not requiring sewage disposal facilities as long as other requirements of the Planning Commission and other agencies are satisfied and provided that the above named alternatives are reviewed and approved prior to the preparation of the final plat.
Section 1214. Sidewalks. For the safety of pedestrians and of children at play or on approaches to community facilities (schools, parks, etc) installation of sidewalks on one side of the streets shall be required with adequate crosswalks that are in accordance with the MUTCD standards.

In single-family residential areas concrete sidewalks shall be four (4) feet wide and four (4) inches thick. In multi-family or group housing development sidewalks shall be five (5) feet wide and four (4) inches thick. In commercial areas, sidewalks shall be eight (8) feet wide and four (4) inches thick.
Section 1215. Guarantee in Lieu of Completed Improvements. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or accepted for record by the County Register of Deeds, until one (1) of the following conditions has been met:
a. All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the Planning Commission; or
52
b. The Planning Commission has accepted a surety bond or certified check in an amount equal to the estimated cost of installation plus 25% of the required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to the city, county, or other reasonable utility system in the event of default by the subdivider.
NOTE: The Planning Commission shall set the amount of the bond based upon the cost of improvements estimated by the Public Works Department or other responsible utility district or official designated by the Planning Commission.
Section 1216. Maintenance Bond
a. All improvements, whether constructed by the developer or by the city using the developer's bond, shall have a maintenance bond to pay for any repairs during the first eighteen (18) months after construction.

ARTICLE 16: - REVIEW PROCEDURE FOR CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION PLATS
Section 161 Purpose- Conservation Subdivisions enable a development that groups units on the
more buildable portion of a tract, while preserving at least 50 percent of the tract including natural
drainage systems, open space, and environmentally and culturally sensitive areas. The purpose of
Conservation Subdivisions is to:
a. Provide for the preservation of open space as a watershed protection measure.
b. Permit flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient use
of the land
c. Preserve in perpetuity:
1) Unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains and floodways,
wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife corridors and habitat.
2) Scenic views.
3) Historic and archaeological sites.
d. Permit grouping of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils that will
reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements,
necessary for residential development.
e. Minimize land disturbance and removal of vegetation during construction resulting in
reduced erosion and sedimentation.
f. Promote interconnected greenways and wildlife and other natural corridors through the
community.
Figure 16-1: Subdivision Types
Section 162 Applicability Conservation Subdivisions shall be permitted in all residential zones
within the City of Athens and anywhere inside the growth boundary in rural McMinn County. All
Conservation Subdivisions inside the municipal boundary of the City of Athens are subject to the
requirements of the City of Athens Zoning Code.
Section 163 Minimum Area of Subdivision The minimum area of the subdivision shall be no less
than 2 acres inside the City of Athens municipal boundary. Inside the growth boundary, the
minimum subdivision size will be determined by adequacy of a sewage disposal system.
The Planning Commission may consider a smaller area inside the city of Athens less than 2 acres if
the applicant can demonstrate one of the following:
63
a. The proposed Conservation Lands provide a connection between unconnected, existing areas of open space or other protected areas and shall not result in providing only narrow or isolated fragments of Conservation Lands.
b. The Conservation Subdivision would ensure a unique natural, cultural or historical area will be protected.
Section 164 Approval Procedures
1. Approval of Conservation Subdivisions shall follow the Procedures for Major Plat Approval set out in Article 14 of these regulations and also a Concept Plan, Development Plan and Final Conservation Ownership and Management Plan will be required for approval.

All such alleys shall meet the requirements of the Public Works Department and the Fire Marshal.
Figure 16-2: Lot Frontage on Open Space
Section 167 Conservation Lands
1. Conservation Lands. Conservation Lands are the undisturbed areas of at least 50 percent of the tract to be set aside. Conservation lands are made up of Primary and Secondary Conservation areas. All lands identified as Primary Conservation areas shall be Conservation Lands. If the Primary Conservation area makes up less than 50 percent of the tract, the balance of the required Conservation Lands shall be made up of Secondary Conservation Areas.
65
2. Primary Conservation Areas. The following shall be considered Primary Conservation areas and shall be included as Conservation Lands, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would be counter to the purposes of a Conservation Subdivision:
a. The 100-year floodplain.
b. All perennial and intermittent streams and associated floodways with a 75-foot corridor measured from the outer edge of the floodway.
c. Contiguous slopes over 20 percent.
d. Wetlands.
e. Known habitat for rare, threatened, or endangered species.
f. Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
3. Secondary Conservation Areas. Secondary Conservation areas shall be prioritized on the tract in terms of their highest to least suitability for inclusion in the Conservation Lands. The following shall be considered Secondary Conservation areas and shall be included in the Conservation Lands to meet at least minimum area percentage requirements for conservation lands:
a. Existing healthy, native forests (containing species defined by the Athens Landscape Ordinance or species approved by the director of Public Works) of a least one-acre contiguous area.
b. Prime farmland soils and land in agricultural use.

Land that is dedicated for use for a sanitary sewer disposal, whether for a public system or an individual sewage disposal system or other sewage disposal system approved by Athens Utility Board, or land that is dedicated for conventional stormwater management devices, that require a disturbance to the land, shall be set aside for such purposes and not included as Conservation Lands.
Section 168 Lot Arrangement
1. Four Step Design Process for Conservation Subdivisions. All concept plans for
Conservation Subdivisions shall include documentation of a four-step design process in determining the layout of proposed conservation lands, house sites, streets and lot lines as described below and illustrated in Figure 16-3.
2. Step 1: Delineation of Conservation Lands
a. The percentage and acreage of required Conservation Lands shall be calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the concept plan. Road rights-of-way shall not be counted towards the required minimum open space.
b. Lands to be included as Conservation lands shall be determined in the following manner:
1. All Primary Conservation areas, unless the applicant demonstrates that this provision would be counter to the purposes of a Conservation Subdivision.
66
2. If the Primary Conservation areas do not make up at least 50 percent of the tract,
Secondary Conservation areas which shall be delineated to meet at least the minimum area
percentage requirements. Secondary Conservations areas shall be chosen for inclusion
based on the priorities determined in Section 167, the configuration of the tract, the tracts
context to adjacent resource areas, and the applicant's subdivision objectives.
c. Conservation Lands shall be delineated outside of individual development lots in a manner
clearly indicating their boundaries as well as types of resources included within them.
Figure 16-3: Four-Step Design Process for Conservation Subdivisions
3. Step 2: Location of Building Areas. Potential building areas shall be tentatively located using the
map delineating Conservation Lands, supplemented by existing conditions data required for
concept plan approval. Building areas should generally be located not closer than 100 feet from
Primary Conservation areas and 50 feet from Secondary Conservation areas, taking into
consideration the potential negative impacts of residential development on such areas as well as the
potential positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and visual settings for
residences. Locating building areas on ridges, hilltops, along peripheral public roads or in other
visually prominent areas should be minimized.
4. Step 3: Alignment of Streets and Trails. After designating the building areas, a street plan shall
be designed to provide vehicular access to each building area, complying with the standards in
these Subdivision Regulations and bearing a logical relationship to the topography of the property.
Impacts of the street plan on proposed Conservation Lands shall be minimized, particularly with
respect to crossing environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, streams, and slopes exceeding
15 percent. Street connections shall minimize the number of cul-de-sacs and facilitate access to
and from building areas in different parts of the property and adjoining properties.
67
5. Step 4: Drawing in the Lot Lines. Upon completion of the preceding three steps, lot lines shall
be drawn as required to delineate the boundaries of individual residential lots, using the City of
Athens Zoning Code to determine minimum lot sizes.

82
ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS OFTEN ASKED ABOUT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
l. ARE SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS FAIR TO EVERYONE?
Yes. The written regulations provide the local planning commission with uniform procedures and standards of design and construction by which to appraise equally and fairly all plans for land subdivision.
2. WHO IS AFFECTED BY THE REGULATIONS?
Every owner of land within the planning region who divides land into smaller parcels, or changes the size or shape of existing lots.
3. AM I AFFECTED IF I RE-SUBDIVIDE MY TRACT INTO TWO PARCELS?
Yes. "Subdivision" means the division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, sites or divisions for immediate or future sale or building development and includes re-subdivision (See Article 3 for definition of subdivision).
4. WHAT IS TO PREVENT ME FROM RECORDING A SUBDIVISION PLAT WITHOUT APPROVAL?
The County Register of Deeds is prevented by law from recording land subdivisions lying within planning regions without final approval in writing.
5. CAN I SELL AN UNAPPROVED PLAT AND THEN RECORD MY LOTS BY METES AND BOUNDS?
No. State law makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by law, to use an unapproved subdivision plat even if metes and bounds description is used in the instrument of transfer or sale.
6. WHAT HAPPENS IF I SELL UNAPPROVED AND UNRECORDED LOTS FROM MY SUBDIVISION?
a. A state law has been broken (TCA 13-3-410).
b. Some cloud would exist on the title to the lot.
c. Most lending agencies will not approve or guarantee loans.
d. State law requires that public bodies shall not extend sewers, water mains, lighting, or other utilities in unauthorized roads.
e. Where zoning is in effect, a building permit to construct any building will be withheld.
f. Any building or structure erected in violation may be forced to be vacated or removed.
83
g. The legislative body of a county or municipality may stop sales by injunction or other legal action.
7. WHAT IMPROVEMENTS WILL I NEED TO INSTALL IN MY SUBDIVISION?
Most subdivision regulations will require the developer to grade and improve streets, install curbs and sidewalks, monuments, sewers, and water mains in accordance with adopted specifications.
8. WHY DOESN'T THE LOT BUYER INSTEAD OF THE DEVELOPER PAY FOR IMPROVEMENTS?
The lot buyer does--at the time they purchase their property. If lots are sold before improvements are in, the community bears the expense of providing needed improvements that should have been originally planned for and installed by the developer.
9. WON'T SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS CAUSE EXPENSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND COST ME A LOT OF MONEY?
Quite the contrary! Properly planned subdivisions make the most of land with a minimum of construction and operating cost. Good design takes advantage of all capabilities of the site and results in a minimum amount of streets and utilities with a maximum number of well-arranged and easier sold lots. Good land subdivision affects the value of the land and the immediate return to the investor, while saving the developer money.
10. HOW DO I GO ABOUT HAVING A SUBDIVISION APPROVED?
Your local planning commission's printed set of regulations include the procedure for having a plat approved. The planning commission meets at regular intervals, and your preliminary sketch is submitted in advance of the meeting at which it is to be considered. It is suggested that you consult your planning commission early so as to become familiar with the official plans that might affect your area.
11. WHAT IF I WISH TO LAY OUT A COMMERCIAL OR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISION?
The provisions of subdivision regulations apply to all subdivisions of land, including that for use of business and industry. Since space, parking, and service requirements will vary greatly, it is impossible to establish standards for all types of uses. For that reason, specific requirements for lot sizes and area are set forth only for residential areas.
84
12. WHERE CAN I GET TECHNICAL SITE PLANNING ASSISTANCE?
Your planning commission will help by recommending several competent subdivision designers who can contribute much to the financial success of your subdivision.
STEPS FOR A SUBDIVISION DEVELOPER IN THE ATHENS PLANNING REGION
1. Confer with the Planning Commission and its staff representative to become thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, the major street plan, and other public improvements which might affect the area to be subdivided.
2. Subdivider may submit sketch plans and data prior to preparing plat.
3. Have preliminary plat prepared by a licensed engineer or surveyor (This plat shall include the information listed in Article 9).
4. Discuss preliminary plat with staff representative.
5. Submit required copies of the preliminary plat to the Planning Commission for preliminary approval.
WHEN PRELIMINARY APPROVAL IS GIVEN

8. Present drawings to the City of Athens, Local Utilities Board and appropriate State Agency for approval.
9. When written approval is granted - obtain permit for construction. (No charge.)
10. Develop subdivision according to approved plans and specifications.
(A performance bond may be posted with the City Manager in sufficient amount to cover the total cost of improvements prior to improvements being installed. The City Manager and City Staff will determine the amount of the bond. Final plat approval may be given and permits issued. However, the bond will not be released until all improvements are made, certifications issued, and the streets and utilities accepted by the Athens City Council.)

designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the
Athens, Tennessee Board of Mayor and Council, does ordain as follows:
Section B. Findings of Fact
1. The City of Athens, Tennessee, Mayor and its Legislative Body wishes to
maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and in order
to do so must meet the NFIP regulations found in Title 44 of the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), Ch. 1, Section 60.3.
2. Areas of the City of Athens, Tennessee are subject to periodic inundation which
could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains,
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas
which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated,
floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section C. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and
to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This Ordinance
is designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards, or
which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
flood damage or erosion;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Section D. Objectives
The objectives of this Ordinance are:
1. To protect human life, health, safety and property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Ordinance No. 1007
Page 3 of 18
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodprone
areas;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in flood areas;
7. To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone
area;
8. To maintain eligibility for participation in the NFIP.

the lesser, include within such proposals Base Flood Elevation data (See
Article V, Section E).
Standards for Special Flood Hazard Areas with Established Base Flood
Elevations and With Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas
designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment
in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights and
velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill material, new construction,
substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway.
Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface elevation of
the Base Flood Elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during the occurrence of
a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A Tennessee
registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data, using the
same methodologies as in the effective Flood Insurance Study for the City of
Athens, Tennessee and certification, thereof.
2. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted,
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V,
Sections A and B.
Ordinance No. 1007

Section D. Standards for Areas of Special Flood Hazard Zones AE with Established
Base Flood Elevations but Without Floodways Designated
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where
streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been designated
(Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
1.
2.
Section E.
No encroachments, including fill material, new construction and substantial
improvements shall be located within areas of special flood hazard, unless
certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (l) foot at any point
within the community. The engineering certification should be supported by
technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted,
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V,
Sections A and B.
Standards for Streams without Established Base Flood Elevations and
Floodways (A Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, where
streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided and where a Floodway has not been
delineated, the following provisions shall apply:
1. The Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any Base Flood
Elevation and floodway data available from any Federal, State, or other sources,
including data developed as a result of these regulations (see 2 below), as criteria
for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development in approximate A Zones meet the requirements of Article V,
Sections A and B.
2. Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than
50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals Base
Flood Elevation data.
3. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, require the
lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least
three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in Article II). All
applicable data including elevations or floodproofing certifications shall be
recorded as set forth in Article IV, Section B. Openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be
provided in accordance with the standards of Article V, Section B.
4. Within approximate A Zones, where Base Flood Elevations have not been
established and where such data is not available from other sources, no
encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an
area equal to three (3) times the width of the stream or sixty feet (60), whichever
is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a
Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one (l) foot at any point within the City of
Athens, Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by
technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
5. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted,
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V,
Sections A and B. Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections
of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured homes
provisions are complied with as required.
Ordinance No. 1007
Page 15 of 18
Section F. Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones)
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas
designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with
base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following
provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B, apply:
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential
buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement and any
mechanical units (including duct work), elevated to at least one (1) foot above as
many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM's, in feet, above the
highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above
the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic
equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in
accordance with standards of Article V, Section B.
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings
may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure and any mechanical units
(including duct work),together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must
be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least
one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure
and any mechanical units (including duct work), shall be floodproofed to at least
three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting
the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide such certification to the
Administrator as set forth above and as required in accordance with Article IV,

Section A.
Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and sufficient cause, a
determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship; or a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public

with existing local laws or Ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the
issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the Base Flood Elevation
will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance (as high as $25 for

increases risks to life and property.
The Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any
variances to FEMA upon request.
