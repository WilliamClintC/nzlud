§ 4-1. Agreement approved.
The Board of Supervisors hereby approves the Joint Articles of Agreement
of the Centre Regional Planning Commission, as recommended by the
General Forum of the Centre Region Council of Governments, August 19,
1985, and included herein by reference.
§ 4-2. Execution of agreement.
The Chair of the Board of Supervisors is hereby authorized to execute said
Articles of Agreement on behalf of the Township of Patton.
§ 4-3. Joint Articles of Agreement of the Centre Regional Planning
Commission.
This agreement is entered into this 24th day of January 1986, by and among
the Townships of College, Ferguson, Halfmoon, Harris and Patton and the
Borough of State College (hereinafter called the "municipalities"), County
of Centre, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, repealing and superseding the
Articles of Agreement of the Centre Regional Planning Commission, dated
September 1, 1960, as amended.
A. Background of this agreement.
(1) On September 1, 1960, the Townships of College and Patton and
the Borough of State College joined together to form the Centre
Regional Planning Commission, which included representatives
from each of the aforesaid municipalities and the Pennsylvania
State University. The Commission was organized under the
Pennsylvania Regional Planning Law, Act of May 29, 1956, P.L.
1845 (53 P.S. § 491 et seq.).2
(2) Commission membership was later expanded to include
representatives of the Townships of Ferguson and Harris on
November 2, 1961, and the Township of Halfmoon on December 6,
1965.
(3) The Pennsylvania State University is a member of the Centre
Regional Planning Commission for purposes of planning
cooperation and communication, though it does not approve the
Centre Regional Planning Commission annual work program and is
under no obligation to financially contribute to the program
budget.
2. Editor's Note: 53 P.S. § 491 et seq. was repealed 12-19-1996 by P.L. 1158. See now 53

(4) On December 2, 1969, the municipalities joined together in a
voluntary organization known as the "Centre Region Council of
Governments" through adoption of the Council of Government
Articles of Agreement. The Centre Regional Planning Commission
became an agency of the Council of Government. The Council of
Government Articles of Agreement require that each regional
agency be established by separate joint municipal agreement
which shall be enacted by local ordinance and filed together with a
Joint Agreement with the Council of Governments.

by death, resignation or other reason, such vacancy shall be
filled for the unexpired term by the university or participating
municipality for which the vacancy exists. Each representative
shall hold no elected municipal office.
(b) The Commission shall elect a Chair whose term shall not
exceed one year and who shall be eligible for reelection. The
Commission may also create and fill other offices as it may
determine.

RECORDS MANAGEMENT
§ 42-1. Findings.
The retention and maintenance of true and exact copies of public records
relating to the construction, alteration, maintenance and occupancy of
buildings and structures is essential to the proper administration of
government and the protection of public health, safety and welfare. The
storage of such records in original format has become an onerous obligation
requiring the dedication of much office space, has made retrieval of
information time consuming and difficult and provides for no security of
records from destruction by fire or atmospheric conditions and age. The
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in recognition of these serious problems
has authorized local governments to maintain quality microfilm copies of
essential public records and to subsequently destroy the originals or
transfer them to a secure storage at the direction of the Pennsylvania Local
Government Records Committee.
§ 42-2. Microfilm retention of records.
In accord with the provisions of the Municipal Records Act of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (53 P.S. §§ 9000 through 9010) all essential
public records relating to the construction, alteration, maintenance and
occupancy of buildings and structures in the Township of Patton shall be
maintained by true and exact microfilm copy.
§ 37-2 PENSIONS § 42-3
31:97
§ 42-3. Destruction of records.
After the microfilming of the public records and the creation of a microfilm
duplicate, the Director of Centre Region Code Administration shall
authorize the destruction or the transfer to a secure storage area provided
by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in accord with the Laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, of the records so copied.

A. Statement of intent and purpose. The Grantor intends, by the adoption
of this chapter, to facilitate the development and operation of cable
systems to provide cable service. This development can contribute
significantly to meeting the cable-related needs and desires of many
individuals, associations, and institutions. Therefore, the following are
statements of the Grantor's intent when granting or renewing a
franchise:
(1) Provide for the installation and operation of cable systems with
features meeting the current and future cable-related needs and
interests of the community considering the costs to subscribers and
to any operator of cable systems.
(2) To act expeditiously on any requests for a franchise so as to allow
the prompt provision of cable service while ensuring that the public
interest is met and that residents are not discriminated against
based on race, ethnicity, income, or other unfair basis.
(3) Encourage the offering of the widest feasible scope and diversity of
programming and other services to all Grantor residents that are
consistent with community needs and interests and as measured
against the cost of providing such programming and other services.
(4) Encourage implementation of technical advances in cable
programming technology, and to make available to residents cable
services of all kinds in the Grantor.

endanger the health, safety and welfare of its citizenry, public
property or other uses of the rights-of-way.

such person additional to those included in such franchise agreement
only to the extent permitted by law and to the extent not inconsistent
with such franchise agreement; provided that the failure of the Grantor
to enforce any provision herein or in a franchise agreement or the
failure of any person to comply with any provision herein or in a
franchise agreement shall not be a waiver of the Grantor's right to
enforce such provisions, nor shall it in any way constitute evidence

Law").73 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, a
Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it
reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. The
Grantor agrees to treat any information disclosed by a Grantee as
confidential and only to disclose it to those employees, representatives,

§ 60-4. Franchise general provisions.
A. Franchise required. It shall be unlawful for any person to construct,
operate or maintain a cable system or other competing cable services,
including OVS, in the Grantor without a franchise in the form of a
franchise agreement authorizing the same, unless valid applicable
federal or state law prohibits the Grantor's enforcement of such a
requirement. Such franchise agreement shall comply with all of the
specifications of this chapter unless otherwise specified by the Grantor.
B. Franchise not exclusive.
(1) Any franchise granted by the Grantor shall be nonexclusive. The
Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such
additional franchises for a cable system or any component thereof,
to any other person including itself, as it deems appropriate,
subject to this chapter and valid applicable state and federal law.
(2) The terms and conditions of any franchise granted or renewed after
the effective date of this chapter shall be, when taken as a whole,
no less burdensome or more beneficial than any other franchise
granted or renewed subject to this chapter when taking into
consideration, where reasonably warranted, the situation that
existed at the time in which the earlier terms were adopted;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed as
requiring the use of identical terms or conditions or limit the
enforceability of conditions that are freely negotiated.
C. Authority for use of rights-of-way. For the purpose of constructing,
operating, and maintaining a cable system in the Grantor, Grantee may
erect, install, construct, repair, replace, relocate, reconstruct and retain
in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the rights-of-way accessible
for construction of a cable system within the Grantor such lines, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are
necessary and appurtenant to the operation of the cable system, subject
to the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable Grantor
codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the Grantee
to construct, operate, or maintain underground any ground-mounted
appurtenances such as customer taps, line extenders, system passive
§ 60-3 PATTON CODE § 60-4
58:132
devices, amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related
equipment.
D. Franchise term. A franchise shall commence upon acceptance by
Grantee as defined in § 60-15 herein and as may continue for up to 15
years from the date of acceptance, unless renewed, revoked or
terminated sooner as herein provided.
E. Area of cable service. Every franchise shall apply to the area designated
by the franchise agreement approved by the Grantor.
F. Application for grant of initial franchise. In conformance with the Cable
Act and FCC rules, an application for an initial franchise for a cable
system to provide cable service shall at a minimum be subject to
additional information needed by the Grantor, to understand the
application, including the following:
(1) The applicant's name.
(2) The names of the applicant's officers and directors.
(3) The business address of the applicant.
(4) The name and contact information of a designated contact for the
applicant.
(5) A description of a geographic area of the Grantor that the applicant
proposes to serve.
(6) The public access or EG access channel capacity and capital
support proposed by the applicant.
(7) The term of the agreement proposed by the applicant.
(8) Whether the applicant holds an existing authorization to access the
public rights-of-way in the Grantor franchise.
(9) The amount of franchise fee the applicant offers to pay.
(10) Information necessary for Grantor to evaluate a Grantee's legal,
technical, and financial qualifications to construct, own, and
operate a cable system.
(11) Any additional information required by applicable state laws or
Grantor ordinances.
G. Consideration of initial franchise application. Applicants may be
evaluated according to the information included in an application as
required by § 60-4F and within a maximum time, after 90 days for
persons with existing authority to access rights-of-way and 180 days for
persons that do not have authority to access rights-of-way. The times
start on the date an applicant files an application or other writing
including certain minimum information which is set forth in § 60-4F and
deemed complete by the Grantor. The Grantor and an applicant may
§ 60-4 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-4
58:133
agree, in writing, to extend the ninety-day/one-hundred-eighty-day time
period for negotiations. It may then be adopted at the date as permitted
by this § 60-4G. If the ninety-day/one-hundred-eighty-day time elapses
without action by the Grantor, the applicant is automatically granted
an interim franchise based on the application submitted. Thereafter,
the Grantor and applicant may continue to negotiate the terms of a
franchise in an attempt to reach a negotiated franchise. The ninetyday/
one-hundred-eighty-day time may be tolled by the Grantor if it has
requested and not received information from the applicant.
H. Grant of additional franchise and competing service. Since competing
or overlapping franchises may encourage the introduction of better
cable services and quality at lower prices, the Grantor will at all times
attempt to accommodate additional entrants. At the same time, it is
recognized that the introduction of overlapping cable systems could
have a potential adverse impact on the rights-of-way and on the quality
and availability of existing cable services to the public. Accordingly, the
Grantor shall issue a franchise in an area where another Grantee is
operating only following a public hearing to consider the potential
impact which the grant of an additional franchise may have on the
community and the rights-of-way. In considering whether to grant one
or more additional franchises, the Grantor shall specifically consider,
and address in a written report, the following issues:
(1) Whether or not applicant has provided, at a minimum, information
with its application as required by § 60-4F and consideration
described in § 60-4G.
(2) The legal, technical, and financial qualifications of the applicant
and agreement by a Grantee to comply with such requirements of
the Grantor as may be determined by it to be applicable to a
Grantee in conformance with applicable law.
(3) Acceptance of a franchise and the terms therein.
(4) The capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate one or more
additional cable systems and the potential disruption of rights-ofway
and private property that may occur if one or more additional
franchises are granted.
(5) Such other information as the Grantor may deem appropriate to be
considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping
franchise.
I. Application for franchise renewal. Renewals will be according to valid
applicable law, as amended. A Grantor and a Grantee, by mutual
consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the
franchise term of a franchise agreement. According to applicable law,
Grantor will review and evaluate the past performance of a Grantee,
including compliance with an existing franchise. Also, review and
determination by Grantor of current and future community needs and
the technical, financial, and legal capabilities of a Grantee to meet the
§ 60-4 PATTON CODE § 60-4
58:134
current and future cable-service-related needs in a new franchise
considering the reasonable cost to do so.
J. Permits for nonfranchised entities. The Grantor may issue a license,
easement, or other permit to a person other than the Grantee to permit
that person to traverse any portion of the rights-of-way for purposes
other than providing cable service. Such license or easement, absent a
grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize
nor permit said person to provide cable service of any type to any home
or place of business within the Grantor nor render any other service
within the Grantor except as specifically authorized by Grantee.
K. Franchise provisions.
(1) All franchises granted pursuant to this chapter are subject to this
chapter, including at least the following provisions:
(a) The continuing authority of Grantor to impose such other
regulations of general applicability through lawful exercises of
the Grantor's police powers as may be determined by the
Grantor to be conducive to the health, safety, and welfare of
the public.
(b) The continuing authority of Grantor to control and regulate the
use of rights-of-way.
(c) The authority of Grantor or its designees upon reasonable
notice to inspect all construction or installation work
performed by a Grantee in Grantor subject to the provisions of
the franchise and this chapter and to make such inspections as
it will find necessary during regular business hours to insure
compliance with the terms of the franchise, this chapter, and
applicable law.
(d) The authority of Grantor or its designees to inspect the
financial records related to franchise fees, maps, plans, and
other like materials of the Grantee upon reasonable notice to
insure compliance with the terms of the franchise, this chapter,
and applicable law.
(e) The authority of a Grantor, upon the revocation or denial of
renewal as provided therein, to require a Grantee to remove at
Grantee's own expense any and all portions of a cable system
from the rights-of-way within the Grantor; provided, however,
Grantee shall not be required to remove its cable system, or to
relocate the system, or to sell the system, or any portion
thereof as a result of revocation, denial of renewal, or any
other action to forbid or disallow Grantee from providing cable
services if the system is actively being used to provide
noncable services or other services not regulated under the
Cable Act.
§ 60-4 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-4
58:135
(f) The authority of a Grantor to require a franchise fee.
(2) Federal, state, and grantor jurisdiction.
(a) This chapter and any franchise agreement will be construed in
a manner consistent with all applicable law.
(b) In the event that the state or federal government discontinues
preemption in any area of cable service over which it currently
exercises jurisdiction in such a manner as to expand rather
than limit municipal regulatory authority, the Grantor and a
Grantee shall in good faith negotiate applicable change to
modify a franchise agreement to comply with the changed law
to ensure competitive equity between a Grantee and other
cable operators, taking into account the conditions under
which other cable operators are permitted to provide cable
services to subscribers in the Grantor.
(c) This chapter will apply to all franchises granted or renewed
from and after the effective date of this chapter.
(d) Grantee will not be relieved of Grantee's obligation to comply
with any of the provisions of this chapter or any franchise
agreement granted pursuant to this chapter by reason of any
failure of the Grantor to enforce prompt compliance.
(e) In the event of a change in applicable law affecting this
chapter, the Grantor may amend this chapter to comply with
such change in applicable law.
(3) Franchise agreement.
(a) By acceptance of a franchise, a Grantee acknowledges and
agrees, unless otherwise provided in the franchise, that this
chapter in whole and its exhibits76 are incorporated and made
part of a franchise agreement and shall be a binding contract.
In addition, the franchise agreement accepted by a Grantee is
deemed to include the following representations:
[1] Grantee accepts and agrees to all of the provisions of this
chapter, as to construction, operation, or maintenance of
the cable system, which the Grantor may include in the
franchise agreement subject to applicable law.
[2] Grantee has examined all of the provisions of this chapter
and agrees that the provisions thereof are valid and
binding and enforceable as of the effective date of the
franchise agreement.
[3] Grantee recognizes the right of the Grantor to adopt such
additional regulations of general applicability as it will find
76.Editor's Note: Said exhibits are on file in the Township offices.
§ 60-4 PATTON CODE § 60-4
58:136
§ 60-5. Design, services, and capabilities.
necessary in the exercise of the Grantor's police power.
Any amendment to the Grantor Code binding on Grantee
shall be confined to changes which do not materially alter
the rights and obligations of Grantee granted under a
franchise agreement.
(b) The franchise agreement will contain such further conditions
or provisions as may be included in the proposal of a Grantee
and negotiated between the Grantor and a Grantee. In case of
such conflict or ambiguity between any terms or provisions of a
franchise agreement and this chapter, the franchise agreement
will control.
A. Cable system design. Every Grantee shall offer cable service that meets
the cable related needs of the Grantor in accordance with applicable
law. The franchise shall include a description of the Grantee's cable
system, including the general design and capabilities of the cable
system to identify how the cable system will meet the current and
future cable needs of the Grantor and the schedule for commencement
and completion of construction. Every Grantee shall have responsibility
for the design and maintenance of a cable system, including subscriber
premises equipment, unless the equipment is owned by the subscriber.
Every Grantee will provide notices regarding the use and operation of
any equipment to be operated by subscribers in accordance with
federal law.
B. System description and maps. A Grantee shall provide the Grantor,
upon written request, a complete set of cable system location maps of
the service area, on which will be shown those areas within the Grantor
which its cable system exists and the description and location of all
rights-of-way within which the cable system has been constructed.
These maps shall be provided to the Grantor in hardcopy and, if
available, electronic format. Updated maps shall be delivered to the
Grantor within 30 days after a request is made.
C. Biannual technology review. It is recognized that technology is rapidly
changing and that, subsequent to its initial construction, further
modifications to incorporate increased channel capacity with
compression technology, fiber optics and other unidentified
technologies which materially affect the capability of the system to offer
new and additional services such as interactive television, video on
demand and similar services, will be desirable. No more than once
every two years, the Grantor or its representatives, with the
cooperation and assistance of a Grantee, may conduct a full compliance
review, including possible public hearing, with respect to whether
Grantee has complied with the material terms of the franchise
agreement, so long as it provides Grantee with 90 days' written notice
in advance of the commencement of any such review or public hearing.
§ 60-4 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-5
58:137
D. Grantor, installation and general line extension policy.
(1) A Grantee providing initial cable service within a Grantor shall
serve all residential areas as described in the franchise agreement
and shall extend cable system and cable service to contiguous
areas upon request of the Grantor when a density of 30 homes per
cable mile is reached. In a renewed franchise, the franchise
agreement will provide a description of the Grantee's current
service area. Grantee will extend cable service to contiguous areas
which have 30 homes per cable mile. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prevent a Grantee from serving areas not covered
under this section upon agreement with developers, property
owners, commercial and business establishments, or residents.
(2) Subscribers who request installation or maintenance or repairs
shall be given an "appointment window" for installations, service
calls, and other installation activities at a specific time or, at a
maximum, a four-hour time block during normal business hours.
(The Grantee may schedule service calls and other installation
activities outside of normal business hours for the convenience of
the customer.) Persons requesting installation of residential cable
service shall be afforded a right of rescission between the time
cable service is requested and the time service is actually installed.
All standard installations, reconnects, service upgrades or
downgrades shall be performed within seven working days of the
date the order was placed by the subscriber unless a line extension
is required, in which event cable service shall be extended in
accordance with § 60-5D(4). Standard installations are those that
are located up to 125 feet from the existing distribution system or
the distribution system to be built in compliance with this § 60-5D.
(3) Only those homes which require drops in excess of 125 feet shall be
required to pay for Grantee's materials and labor costs, at the rate
per foot. All other installations shall be performed at no more than
the advertised normal installation rate.
(4) Grantee shall extend cable service to any residence(s) upon the
written request of one or more residents who shall reside within
the requested extension area and who shall agree to subscribe to
Grantee's cable service where the number of occupied homes, and
homes for which certificates of occupancy have been issued, which
would be served by the requested extension equals seven homes
per 1/4 cable mile or more, with the measurement starting from the
closest existing usable point of connection to the system. Unless
additional time has been agreed to by the Grantor, such extensions
shall be completed within 90 days of submittal of a request
(weather permitting) where the above density standard is met and
all additional utility permits or other right-of-way permits have
been obtained. The Grantor and Grantee may agree to a different
time for extension in particular instances.
§ 60-5 PATTON CODE § 60-5
58:138
(5) If the number of homes per 1/4 cable mile is less than seven, the
requesting subscriber(s) may obtain service by paying a share of
the incremental cost of the extension as follows:
(a) Grantee shall pay a share of costs calculated as the fraction
derived from the existing density as calculated above divided
by seven homes per 1/4 mile; requesting subscriber(s) share
shall equal the remainder. For example, if the existing density
is three homes per 1/4 mile, Grantee shall pay 40% of the
extension cost, and the requesting subscriber(s) shall pay the
remaining 60%.
(b) When Grantee receives a request for an extension, the Grantee
shall, within 30 days, respond in writing with its calculation of
the density and such other terms as may be needed to fully
inform subscriber(s), including cost sharing and
reimbursement procedures. If the density is less than seven
homes per 1/4 mile, Grantee shall also provide a firm price
good for 90 days reflecting the proportional share which the
requesting subscriber(s) must pay on a cost-sharing basis to
obtain cable service. Within 90 days from payment of the cost
share by prospective subscriber(s) and receipt of all necessary
utility permits or other right-of-way permits, Grantee shall
complete the extension of service. A franchise may include a
description of the cost-sharing policy in place if different from
what is described in this section.
(6) Nothing in this § 60-5D shall prohibit the Grantor, the Grantee, or
real estate developers from entering into an agreement whereby
entire new housing developments in the Grantor shall be prewired
for efficient future expansion of cable service.
E. Interconnection. In accordance with applicable law, including FCC
rules, and the purposes of allowing for public access and EG access
programming telecasts on cable systems serving subscribers in the
Grantor and adjoining communities, a Grantee will not interfere with
additional connections by other cable operators at studio or
transmission source for public access and/or EG access programming
telecasts in the Grantor. Such connections shall be made by direct
return line connection or other appropriate methods independent of a
Grantee's cable system.
F. Provision of service.
(1) After cable service has been established by activating trunk and
distribution cable for any area, Grantee shall make a standard
installation to any requesting subscriber within that area seven
days from the date of request.
(2) A Grantee, upon written request of Grantor, shall install and
provide basic service as described in a franchise agreement,
(excluding pay-per-view television and nonvideo services) to all
§ 60-5 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-5
58:139
public buildings designated by Grantor in a franchise at no charge
for either the initial normal installation or for monthly service
provided at each location. Each of these installations should
include one signal drop, one outlet, and one converter (or such
other terminal equipment as may be necessary to provide an
electronic interface with a television receiver). The public buildings
to be provided this complimentary service shall include public
buildings currently connected to and receiving complimentary
basic service; public buildings as described in a franchise; or any
such newly constructed public buildings.
(3) If more than one outlet is required at any public building as
described in a franchise, Grantee shall install such other outlets at
the cost charged to other institutional facilities for installation and
ongoing service. The distribution of the cable system inside such
buildings shall be the responsibility of the user.
(4) If required by Grantor under the franchise, Grantee will make
available, without charge, one free cable modem service outlet to
all School buildings and public libraries. The specific locations shall
be identified in the franchise agreement. For the purposes of this
section, the term "school" means an educational institution that
receives funding pursuant to Title I of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., as
amended, and does not mean "home schools."
G. Technical standards. A cable system of a Grantee shall be designed,
constructed and operated so as to meet those technical standards
promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission relating to
cable systems contained in Part 76 of the Federal Communications
Commission's rules and regulations relating to cable systems and found
in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Sections 76.601 to 76.617,
as amended, or as may, from time to time, be amended. The results of
tests required by the Federal Communications Commission must be
filed with the Grantor within 10 business days of written request.
H. Special testing.
(1) At any time after commencement of service to subscribers upon 30
days' written notice, and in the presence of a representative of the
Grantee, the Grantor may require or may retain an independent
engineer to perform additional tests, full or partial repeat tests, or
tests involving a specific subscriber's drop. Such additional tests
will be made on the basis of complaints received or other evidence
indicating an unresolved controversy or significant noncompliance,
and such tests will be limited to the particular matter in
controversy.
(2) The Grantor shall endeavor to so arrange its requests for such
special tests during regular business hours so as to minimize
hardship or inconvenience to Grantee or to the subscriber. The
§ 60-5 PATTON CODE § 60-5
58:140
§ 60-6. Conditions for use of rights-of-way and construction.
rights and obligations of the Grantor and Grantee under this
section shall at all times be subject to applicable law and FCC
regulation.
A. Construction. Grantee shall comply with all generally applicable codes
and ordinances with respect to construction within rights-of-way, and
shall obtain all necessary permits and licenses required by federal,
state and local law, ordinances and rules as required of other like users
of the rights-of-way, before commencing construction in Grantor rightsof-
way. A Grantee shall furnish to Grantor a written description of its
system, including the size, appearance, and location of aboveground
facilities, boxes, pedestals, and equipment being installed under its
permit. The Grantor may review the submittal for compliance with the
Grantor ordinances and include this as an exhibit in a franchise. This
requirement shall not be interpreted or construed in any way to require
a Grantee to obtain from Grantor prior approval, authorization, permits,
or licenses to repair aboveground appurtenances, pedestals, and
similar equipment or replace with facilities of the same or comparable
size, or to perform maintenance or repairs on any part of the system
where the right-of-way is not being disturbed.
B. Compliance with laws. As a minimum, and without limitation, Grantee
shall adhere to the Grantor's generally applicable ordinances relating
to rights-of-way construction and use safety standards and all building
and zoning codes currently or hereafter in force in the Grantor. The
construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable system shall be
effectuated by Grantee in a manner that is consistent with the laws,
ordinances and construction standards of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, all applicable industry standards, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, FCC, and the Standards of Good
Engineering Practices for Measurement of cable systems of the
National Cable Television Association to the extent applicable, as well
as all other valid generally applicable laws, rules, regulations and
ordinances, federal, state and local, as the same may be modified or
amended from time to time, pursuant to the Grantor's legitimate
exercise of its police powers.
C. Minimum interference. A Grantee shall construct and maintain its cable
system so as to minimize any adverse impact on public improvements or
facilities of others in a right-of-way and which will not unnecessarily
interfere with the usual and customary uses in the rights-of-way.
D. Erection of poles prohibited without approval.
(1) A Grantee shall not erect, for any reason, any pole on or along any
rights-of-way or in an existing aerial utility system without the prior
approval of the Grantor or owner of the facilities proposed to be
attached to. A Grantee shall negotiate with the Grantor or, as
applicable, any private utility and furnish Grantor with a copy of a
§ 60-5 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-6
58:141
current pole attachment agreement or agreement for conduit use,
or both, before commencement of construction.
(2) Aboveground location of cable system and related facilities shall
generally be located where reasonable and safe and in a manner
that will not adversely affect the Grantor or other public or private
property.
E. Reservations of rights-of-way. Nothing herein or in a franchise shall be
construed to prevent the Grantor from constructing sewers, grading,
paving, repairing or altering any rights-of-way, or laying down,
repairing or removing water mains or constructing or establishing any
other public work. All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in
such manner as not to obstruct, injure or prevent the free use and
operation of poles, wires, conduits, conductors, pipes or appurtenances
of Grantee. If any such facilities of Grantee shall interfere with the
construction or repair of any rights-of-way or public improvement, then
upon 30 days' written notice all such property of the Grantee shall be
removed or replaced in such manner as shall be directed by the Grantor
so that the same shall not interfere with the public works of the Grantor.
Such removal or replacement shall be at the expense of Grantee. The
Grantee shall at all times have the right to abandon its property.
However, any such abandonment shall be in accordance with pole
attachment agreements, a franchise, and valid applicable state, federal
and local law.
F. Underground installation. In those areas within the Grantor where
cable system facilities and other utilities are currently placed
underground, all cable system facilities shall remain or be placed
underground. In areas where telephone and electric utility facilities are
above the ground at the time of a Grantee's installation, Grantee may
install its cable system facilities above the ground, provided that at
such time as both electric and telephone utility facilities are placed
underground, Grantee shall likewise place its cable system facilities
underground without cost to the Grantor. Nothing contained in this
section shall require Grantee to construct, operate and maintain
underground any ground-mounted appurtenances.
G. New subdivision.
(1) A Grantee shall offer cable services to residential development
constructed or erected after the effective date of the enacting
ordinance for this chapter, provided that the dwelling units meet
the density requirement, specified herein. The developer or
subdivider developing any residential development within the
Grantor shall give advance written notice to Grantee of the
beginning of excavation for or construction of off site
improvements in any residential development to enable installation
of such conduit, pedestals, substructures and other equipment as
may be necessary to provide cable service to the residential units in
such a development so as to provide minimal interference with
§ 60-6 PATTON CODE § 60-6
58:142
surface improvements. The same density requirements shall apply
as defined in this chapter. If the developer gives the Grantee
adequate notice (as defined below), then Grantee shall be obligated
to install all cable lines underground at the time the subdivision
is constructed rather than when the individual lots are actually
occupied.
(2) In cases of new construction or property development where
utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or property
owner shall give the Grantee at least 10 days' written notice of such
construction or development and of the particular date on which
open trenching will be available for the Grantee's installation of
conduit and/or cable. The Grantee shall provide specifications as
needed for trenching.
(3) Cost of trenching and easements required to bring cable service to
the development shall be borne by the developer or property
owner; provided, however, if the Grantee fails to install its conduit
and/or cable within 10 working days of the date the trenches are
available, as designed in the notice given by the developer or
property owner, and the trenches are closed after the five-day
period, the cost of new trenching shall be borne by the Grantee.
H. Property damage and repair.
(1) Grantee shall endeavor to minimize the occurrence of damage to
improvements in the rights-of-way and all public and private
property. If damage occurs, Grantee shall promptly notify the
property owner within seven days in writing. Whenever the
Grantee disturbs or damages any rights-of-way, other public
property or any private property, the Grantee shall promptly
restore the property to a condition reasonably comparable to that
existing immediately prior to the disturbance. In addition, if
Grantee is restoring rights-of-way, it shall do so in accordance with
all applicable requirements. If restoration is not satisfactorily
performed by the Grantee within a reasonable time, the Grantor
may, after prior written notice to the Grantee, or without notice
where the disturbance or damage may create a risk to public health
or safety, cause the repairs to be made and recover the costs of
those repairs from Grantee. Within 30 days of receipt of an
itemized proof of payment of those costs, including the cost of
labor, materials and equipment, the Grantee shall pay the Grantor.
(2) Upon completion of work which caused any disturbance or damage
to private property, Grantee shall promptly commence restoration
and will use its best efforts to commence the restoration within 72
hours of written notice from Grantor, weather permitting and
considering the nature of the work that must be performed.
Grantee shall also perform such restoration in accordance with any
customer service standards required by a franchise.
§ 60-6 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-6
58:143
(3) When Grantee excavates the surface of any rights-of-way, Grantee
shall be responsible for restoration of such excavation in
accordance with all Grantor general ordinances, rules, regulations
and standards. Throughout the term of its franchise, Grantee's
cable system and related facilities, including aboveground
pedestals, vaults, boxes, generators, power supplies or structures
of any kind, shall be maintained in proper order and repair.
(4) Upon completion of restoration in any area, Grantee will notify the
Grantor.
(5) If Grantee enters private property for the purposes of construction
where there is no dedicated public easement, Grantee shall first
secure the private property owner's consent.
I. Permit requirements.
(1) Subject to the generally applicable ordinances of Grantor, a
franchise and this chapter establishes the general rules and scope
of authority for Grantee to construct and maintain and operate its
cable system within the rights-of-way of the Grantor. Grantee shall
designate a responsible contact person, including a telephone
number available seven days a week, twenty four hours a day, with
whom representatives of the Grantor can communicate on all
matters relating to cable system installation, construction,
operation, and maintenance.
(2) Prior to any excavation within the rights-of-way, a Grantee shall
obtain a permit, pay all applicable fees, and perform such work in
accordance with applicable provisions of a franchise and/or other
applicable ordinances or regulations with respect to excavation
work. Notwithstanding the above, no permit shall be required for
cable service drops for individual subscribers, servicing of
pedestals, or other routine maintenance of the cable system that
does not result in surface disturbance of the public right-of-way as
outlined in § 60-6A.
(3) A Grantee must be current with all requirements of this chapter
and all franchise requirements, including payment of required fees
and charges and insurance, before a permit is issued by Grantor.
J. Cable system drawings. Grantee shall keep and maintain accurate
records and as built drawings of its cable system constructed,
reconstructed, or relocated within the Grantor's rights-of-way in
accordance with § 60-5B. Grantee shall cooperate promptly and fully
with the Grantor and take all reasonable measures necessary to provide
accurate and complete information regarding the nature and location of
its cable system located within the rights-of-way when requested by the
Grantor to facilitate public improvements. Such location maps and
information shall be at the sole expense of Grantee without expense to a
Grantor, its employees, agents, or authorized contractors.
§ 60-6 PATTON CODE § 60-6
58:144
§ 60-7. Service provisions.
K. Grantee responsible for costs. All earth, materials, sidewalks, pavings,
crossings, utilities, public improvements, or improvements of any kind
disturbed or removed by a Grantee in its activities under its franchise
shall be fully repaired or replaced promptly by a Grantee and as
required elsewhere in this chapter and the franchise agreement and as
may be required in accordance with applicable Grantor's streets and
sidewalks design standards and state law. Any such repair or
replacement shall be at Grantee's sole expense and to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Grantor or owner thereof.
L. Procedure for enforcement and administration relating to construction.
The Grantor has the responsibility to manage and control use of the
rights-of-way or utility easements within the Grantor's jurisdictional
boundaries. In accordance with applicable law, including ordinances of
general application, the Grantor has the authority to administer and
enforce rights-of-way construction standards for Grantee's cable
system on a nondiscriminatory basis, including the authority to collect
permit fees, review plans, and enforce the provisions of a franchise, and
may utilize the assistance of qualified independent third parties.
(1) Upon reasonable notice, the Grantor has the right to inspect all
construction or installation work performed subject to the
provisions of this chapter and applicable franchises of the Grantor,
and to make such tests as it shall find necessary to ensure
compliance with the terms of a franchise and applicable
requirements of the Grantor; provided, however, a representative
of Grantee is present for all such testing, which shall occur during
normal business hours (generally between the hours of 9:00 a.m.
and 5:00 p.m.).
(2) Nothing in this chapter or a franchise granted pursuant to it gives
permission to use the poles, conduit or other facilities of the
Grantor or others. A separate agreement for such use or
connection shall be the responsibility of Grantee.
M. Work performed by others.
(1) A Grantee shall make available, upon request, to the Grantor the
names and addresses of any person, contractor, subcontractor,
agent, representative or entity other than the Grantee, which
performs services pursuant to a franchise; provided, however, that
all provisions of this chapter and a franchise remain the
responsibility of a Grantee.
(2) All provisions of a franchise shall apply to any of a Grantee's
subcontractors or others performing any work or services pursuant
to the provisions of a franchise.
§ 60-6 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-7
58:145
A. Parental control device. Upon request by any subscriber, Grantee shall
make available at Grantee's actual cost a parental control or lockout
device compatible with the subscriber's equipment that will enable the
subscriber to block access to any or all channels in accordance with
Sections 640 and 641 of the Cable Act.
B. Leased access channels. Leased access channels shall be provided in
accordance with Section 612 of the Cable Act. A leased access channel
need not be activated or otherwise made available for any particular
user until such time as an agreement with respect to charges for said
channel has been reached between Grantee and said user. Grantee shall
charge no more for said channel use than that amount allowed under
federal or state law.
C. Emergency use and safety alert. The Grantee shall comply with all
emergency or disaster notification requirements in accordance with
and at the time required by the provisions of the then applicable valid
law, including FCC Regulations [47 C.F.R. Part 11, FCC Rules and
Regulations, Emergency Alert System (EAS)] and provisions relating to
the Grantor's Emergency Operations Plan [35 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 7101 to
7707] and the Pennsylvania Amber Alert System [35 P.S. § 7025.1 et
seq.].
D. Institutional network.
(1) A Grantee shall, if required in the franchise agreement, construct,
activate, and thereafter maintain an institutional network capable
of transmitting two way voice, data and video signals. A specific
plan shall be made part of a franchise agreement.
(2) The institutional network shall be designed and constructed so as
to interconnect public buildings, including educational institutions,
Grantor facilities, libraries, police and fire departments and other
institutions as designated by Grantor.
E. Access channels.
(1) If required in the franchise agreement, the Grantee shall make
bandwidth on its cable system available for up to two downstream
channels for noncommercial access programming use. Channel
capacity for public access shall be provided if required in a
franchise and approved unanimously by the CACC. Additional PEG
channel capacity shall be made available when, over a period of six
consecutive months, 60% of the prime time (7:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.
each evening) on the existing access channel(s) on average are
fully occupied with locally produced access channel programming.
Such additional channel availability will be provided within 180
days of the Grantor's certification of such use and written request
for additional channel(s). Grantee shall offer to each of its
subscribers who receive all or any part of the cable services offered
on the system, reception of the access channels. No charges shall
be made for channel time or playback of prerecorded
§ 60-7 PATTON CODE § 60-7
58:146
programming. Management of the access channels' programming
shall be the responsibility of the Grantor and not the responsibility
of the Grantee.
(2) It shall be the Grantee's sole responsibility to provide the cable,
wire, lines and/or other necessary signal distribution equipment
such that live or playbacks of access channel programming can be
received from the selected production location and be distributed
via the cable system to subscribers in the Grantor. These cables,
wires, lines and other signal distribution equipment shall be
collectively known as the "return line."
(3) Access channels may also be used by Grantee when such channel
or channels are not being used by Grantor for access programming
and provided that such channel usage is subject to Grantor
approval and displacement by Grantor upon 180 days' prior written
notice to the Grantee if there is demand to use the access channel.
(4) The Grantee shall be responsible for the technical maintenance and
signal quality of such channels. Signal quality on such channels
shall be commensurate with those which apply to the Grantee's
regular commercial channels, and the Grantee shall, upon request,
provide copies of FCC signal quality proofs of performance with
respect to those channels.
F. Access channel funding, facilities, and equipment.
(1) The Grantee shall provide financial support permissible under
applicable law as an equipment replacement and facilities capital
grant payable by Grantee to Grantor to support the cost of facilities
and equipment for development of programming for playback on
access channels in the amount and payable in a manner described
in a franchise, and may be itemized and passed through to the
subscribers. The Grantor shall own and maintain all equipment
purchased with equipment funding.
(2) The Grantee will provide access channel support as specifically
agreed to in the franchise agreement, and to periodically inspect
and maintain the return line to ensure that the technical quality of
the retransmitted access programming signal meets FCC
regulations. The Grantee will not engage in any editorial control of
the content of programming on an access channel on the cable
system, except as otherwise required or permitted by law. The
Grantor shall be solely responsible for the use of the access
channels and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Grantee from
any and all claims, demands, actions and damages (including
attorney fees) arising from the use or operation of the access
channels.
(3) Use of a channel position for public, educational, and/or
governmental (PEG) access shall be provided on the most basic tier
§ 60-7 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-7
58:147
§ 60-8. Operation and reporting provisions.
of service offered by Grantee in accordance with the Cable Act and
a franchise agreement.
(4) Grantee shall insure that all access channels meet the technical
standards of the FCC; provided, however, Grantee shall not be
responsible for defects, flaws or other impairments in the access
channel programming delivered to Grantee and shall only be
responsible for maintenance for facilities and equipment under its
control applicable to the playback of programming on access
channels of a Grantee's system.
(5) If Grantee makes changes to its cable system that necessitate
modifications to access channel(s) signal transmission facilities and
equipment (including but not limited to the upstream paths),
Grantee shall provide reasonable advance notice of such changes
to the Grantor and shall provide, at Grantee's expense, any
additional or modified headend facilities necessary to implement
such modifications within a reasonable period of time prior to the
date that the system changes are to be made.
(6) Upon request by the Grantor, the access channels shall be made
available in digital formats comparable to commercial offerings at
the time Grantee converts 60% of its system to digital transmission.
A. Open books and records. The Grantor shall have the right to inspect,
upon 30 days' written notice, at any time during normal business hours
at the system office, all books, records, maps, plans, financial
statements that directly relate to the franchise, cable service complaint
logs ("trouble calls" that have generated a work order and/or
necessitated a response originating from the Grantor received during
the prior twelve-month period), performance test results, and other like
materials of Grantee that relate directly to the terms and conditions of
the franchise. Said books and records shall be made available for
inspection at the local business office of Grantee. Upon proper request
by a Grantee and pursuant to § 60-2E herein, information obtained
during such an inspection shall be treated as confidential, making it
available only to those persons who must have access to perform their
duties on behalf of the Grantor, including but not limited to financial
personnel, solicitor's office, and members of the governing body, if it is
proprietary in nature or within the definitions of closed records
contained within the Pennsylvania Open Meetings Act, § 610.010 et
seq.,77 as amended from time to time. To the extent any federal
requirement for privacy applies to the information to be submitted, said
law shall control.
77.Editor's Note: The Public Agency Open Meeting Law was repealed 7-3-1986 by P.L. 388,
No. 84, § 17. For the Sunshine Act, see 65 Pa.C.S.A. § 701 et seq.
§ 60-7 PATTON CODE § 60-8
58:148
B. Communications with regulatory agencies. Copies of all petitions,
applications, communications and reports submitted by a Grantee or on
behalf of or relating to Grantee to the FCC or any other federal or state
regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any
matters affecting the system authorized pursuant to this franchise shall
also be submitted to the Grantor upon written request. Copies of
responses from the regulatory agencies to Grantee shall likewise be

fiscal year, including an income statement, statement of
operating expenses in detail, a cash flow statement and a
balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and certified by a financial officer of
Grantee. Submission of the most recent U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission Annual Report Form 10-K prepared by
Grantee shall be deemed as a satisfactory compliance with this
section.
(b) A description of all tiers or levels of service being offered,
together with a description of any changes made in any service
during the reporting year.
(c) A current copy of the subscriber service information required
in this chapter.

§ 60-8 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-8
58:149
D. Additional reports. Grantee shall prepare and furnish to the Grantor, at
the times and in the form prescribed, such additional reports which are
deemed by the parties as reasonably necessary for the administration
and enforcement of this chapter and a franchise.
E. Maps. Grantee shall maintain on file with the Grantor at all times a
current map or set of maps, either via paper or electronic format, drawn
to scale showing the location of the system and all equipment installed
or in place in rights-of-way and other public places. The maps shall be
updated and made available in accordance with § 60-5B, hereinabove.
F. Audit. The Grantor and its agents and representatives shall have the
authority, during normal business hours, to arrange for and conduct an
inspection of the books and records of Grantee related to the payment
of the franchise fee. Grantee shall first be given 30 days' written notice
of the audit request, the description of and purpose for the inspection
and description, to the best of the Grantor's ability. To the extent such
books, records or documents contain confidential information as
defined in § 60-8A, such confidential information may not be disclosed,
as described in § 60-8A.
G. Periodic evaluation, review and modification. The field of cable service
and technology is a relatively new and rapidly changing one which may
see many regulatory, technical, financial, marketing and legal changes
during the term of a franchise agreement. Therefore, in order to
provide for a maximum degree of flexibility in a franchise, and to help
achieve a continued advanced and modern cable system, the following
evaluation provisions will apply:
(1) The Grantor may require, at its sole discretion upon 45 days'
written notice, evaluation sessions at any time during the term of a
franchise; provided, however, there shall not be more than one
evaluation session during any three calendar years.
(2) Topics which may be discussed at any evaluation session include,
but are not limited to, Grantee's ability to comply with the legal,
financial, and technical requirements of the franchise and meet the
cable-related needs of the community and any other cable-related
topics the Grantor or a Grantee deem relevant.
(3) During an evaluation session, a Grantee shall fully cooperate with
the Grantor and shall provide, without cost, such information and
documents as the Grantor may request to perform the evaluation.
To the extent such information or documents contain confidential
information as defined in § 60-8A, such confidential information
may not be disclosed.
(4) If at any time during its evaluation, the Grantor determines that a
historical record of evidence exists of cable system performance
which fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, the Grantor
may require a Grantee to perform tests and analysis directed
toward such suspected inadequacies at a Grantee's expense. A
§ 60-8 PATTON CODE § 60-8
58:150
§ 60-9. Consumer protection provisions.
Grantee shall fully cooperate with the Grantor in performing such
testing, and any report prepared by a Grantee shall include at least:
(a) A description of the problem in the cable system performance
which precipitated the special tests.
(b) The cable system component tested.
(c) The equipment used and procedures employed in testing.
(d) The method, if any, by which the cable system performance
problem was resolved.
(e) If, after receiving a Grantee's report, the Grantor determines
that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate cable system
performance, the Grantor may enlist an independent engineer
to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected
failures to meet the requirements of this franchise. A Grantee
shall be a witness to and cooperate and permit said testing.
(5) As a result of a periodic review and evaluation session, the Grantor
or a Grantee may determine that a change in the terms of the
franchise should be required to meet the cable-related needs of the
community, as determined by the Grantor's governing body, that
the cable system or franchise requirements should be updated,
changed, revised or that additional cable service should be
provided and that to provide same would be technically and
economically feasible. If the change is consistent with the terms of
this chapter or the franchise, the needs of the Grantor, and is
technically and economically feasible as determined following an
evaluation of a Grantee's financial condition, length of term
remaining on the franchise, economic waste, if any, that would
occur should the terms be changed, and rate of return on the
investment within the community, the parties will, in good faith,
review the terms of the proposed change and any amendment to
this chapter or a franchise. Based on this review, and upon adoption
of such a change or new requirement through a mutually agreed
upon and acceptable amendment, the change will become effective.
A. Approval of changes. The Grantor reserves the right to regulate rates
for basic service and any other services offered over the cable system,
to the extent provided by federal or state law. In accordance with the
Cable Act, Grantee shall maintain on file with the Grantor at all times a
current schedule of all rates and charges.
B. Subscriber complaint practices. At all times, a Grantee shall meet the
requirements of the Federal Communications Commission regulations
on Consumer Complaints and Protection. However, at a minimum and
in accordance with 47 CFR 76.309, as amended, a Grantee shall comply
with the following:
§ 60-8 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-9
58:151
(1) A Grantee shall maintain a conveniently located local office within
the CACC service area which shall be open during normal business
hours. This office shall accept payments, handle adjustments to
subscriber bills, respond to installation, repair, and/or maintenance
requests and other service calls. A Grantee shall have a toll-free
telephone number available at all times (an access line which will
be available to its subscribers twenty-four hours a day, seven days a
week). Trained company representatives shall be available to
respond to customer telephone inquiries during normal business
hours. Except in situations beyond its control, the Grantee must
begin working on a service interruption or other service problems
no later than 24 hours after being notified of the problem. If the
problem cannot be resolved within 24 hours, the customer shall be
entitled upon request to a credit for one day's service for each day
of the outage. Under normal operating conditions, telephone
answer time by a customer representative, including wait time,
shall not exceed 30 seconds when the connection is made, and the
customer will receive a busy signal less than 3% of the time. If the
call needs to be transferred, transfer time shall not exceed 30
seconds. These standards shall be met no less than 90% of the time
under normal operating conditions, measured on a quarterly basis.
A Grantee shall not be required to acquire equipment or perform
surveys to measure compliance with these standards unless an
historical record of complaints indicates a clear failure to comply.
After normal business hours, the access line may be answered by a
service or an automated response system.
(2) A Grantee may impose a charge reasonably related to a Grantee's
actual cost incurred for a downgrade of service, except that no
such charge may be imposed when:
(a) A subscriber requests total disconnection from the cable
system; or
(b) A subscriber requests the downgrade within a thirty-day
period following any rate increase relative to the service in
question.
(3) A Grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly and
interrupt cable service only for good cause and for the shortest
time possible. Such interruptions shall occur during periods of
minimum use of the cable system.
(4) A Grantee shall maintain adequate telephone lines and personnel
to respond in a timely manner to schedule service calls and answer
subscriber complaints or inquiries as required by this§ 60-9B.
(5) Subscriber requests for repairs of service interruptions shall be
responded to by a trained customer service representative on the
next business day. A Grantee shall use best efforts to begin working
on service interruptions promptly and in no event later than 24
§ 60-9 PATTON CODE § 60-9
58:152
hours after the interruption becomes known. A Grantee shall begin
actions to correct other service problems the next business day
after notification of the service problem.
(6) Subscriber requests for maintenance or repairs received on
Saturdays or Sundays shall be responded to by a customer service
representative on the next business day. A Grantee shall use its
best efforts to begin working on service interruptions promptly and
in no event later than 24 hours after the interruption becomes
known. Grantee shall begin actions to correct other service
problems the next business day after notification of the service
problem.
(7) Service calls for maintenance or repair shall be performed in
accordance with the standards established by the FCC.
(8) A Grantee shall maintain an "appointment window" alternative for
installations, service calls and other installation activities that will
be either a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block
during normal business hours. A Grantee shall not cancel an
appointment with a customer after the close of business on the
business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a customer
service representative is running late for an appointment with a
customer and will not be able to keep the appointment as
scheduled, the customer shall be contacted. The appointment shall
be rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the
customer.
C. Installation. A Grantee shall make service available to all Grantor
residents based on the terms and conditions outlined in § 60-5.
D. Subscriber information.
(1) A Grantee shall provide to all new subscribers and, at least once a
year, to existing subscribers, and upon request of a subscriber,
written subscriber service information which shall include, but not
be limited to, the following:
(a) Products and services offered by Grantee;
(b) Prices and options for programming services, including

converters.
(2) A Grantee shall notify subscribers and the Grantor no less than 30
days in advance of any changes in rates, programming services, or
channel positions, provided that such change is within the control
of the Grantee. Grantee shall not be required to provide prior
notice to subscribers of any rate change that is the result of a
regulatory fee, franchise fee or any other fee, tax, assessment or
charge of any kind imposed by any federal agency, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Grantor on the transaction
between the Grantee and the subscriber.
E. Subscriber billing practices.
(1) As mentioned hereinabove, Grantee shall notify each of its existing
subscribers at least once a year, all new subscribers, and upon
request of a subscriber, of its billing practices in accordance with
FCC rules. Bills shall be clear, concise and understandable. Bills
must be fully itemized, with itemizations including, but not limited
to, basic service and premium tier service charges, if applicable,
equipment charges and any installation or repair charges. Bills
shall state the billing period, including an effective due date, the
amount of current billing and any relevant credits or past due
balances. Grantee shall not assess late fees for nonpayment of a
current bill until at least 30 days have elapsed since the mailing of
the bill by Grantee.
(2) As mentioned hereinabove, subscribers shall be notified of any
changes in rates, programming services or channel positions as
soon as possible through announcements on the cable system and/
or in writing. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of 30
days in advance of such changes if the change is within the
Grantee's control.
(3) The subscriber bill shall contain the following information
presented in plain language and format:
(a) Name and address of Grantee;
(b) The period of time over which each chargeable service is
billed, including prorated periods as a result of the
establishment and termination of service;
(c) A fully itemized list of charges levied for programming
services, equipment provided, and other services or items

complaint from a subscriber within 30 days. Refund checks shall be
issued promptly, but no later than either the customer's next billing
cycle following resolution of the request or 30 days, whichever is
earlier, or the return of the equipment supplied by the cable
operator if service is terminated. Credits for service shall be issued
no later than the customer's next billing cycle following the
determination that a credit is warranted.
F. Mobility-limited subscribers. Unless otherwise agreed in a franchise
agreement, upon the request of mobility-limited subscribers, a Grantee
shall make a good faith effort to arrange for delivery, pickup or
exchange or replacement of converters or other equipment at the
subscriber's address or by the use of a satisfactory equivalent means
such as provision of a prepaid postage mailer.
G. Dispute resolution.
(1) Every Grantee shall establish procedures for receiving, acting
upon, and resolving customer complaints, and crediting customer
accounts, without intervention by the Grantor.
(2) The Grantee's complaint procedure shall be filed with the Grantor
prior to its acceptance of a new or renewed franchise.
(3) The Grantee's investigation of a subscriber complaint shall be
concluded in no more than 30 days after receiving a written
complaint, at which time the Grantee shall notify the subscriber of
the results of its investigation and its proposed action or credit.
§ 60-9 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-9
58:155
§ 60-10. General financial and insurance provisions.
(4) In the event of a billing dispute, Grantee shall notify the subscriber
in full accordance with FCC customer service regulations
regarding billing and complaint procedures and provide the
address and telephone number of Grantor's cable office.
H. Scrambling of cable channels. In accordance with Sections 640 and 641
of the Cable Act, Grantee shall fully scramble or block the audio and
video programming of a channel upon request by a cable service
subscriber without charge.
I. Programming.
(1) Programming decisions. All programming decisions shall be at the
sole discretion of Grantee; provided, however, that the Grantor
shall be notified of any changes in rates, channel positions or
programming service as required by FCC customer service
regulations.
A. Payment to grantor.
(1) As compensation for any franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter, a Grantee for a cable system located in the rights-of-way,
unless negotiated in a franchise agreement, shall have the
following obligations:
(a) Application fee for initial franchise. In addition to all other
fees, permits or charges required by the Grantor, an applicant
for an initial franchise shall pay to Grantor at the time of
application, or amendment to its application, $1,000 as a
deposit on the application fee. An applicant will be assessed an
additional application fee at the end of the review process
should the Grantor's actual costs of reviewing the application
exceed the deposit. This fee will be equal to 100% of Grantor's
costs (including administration overhead, legal, consulting,
etc.) for administrating the application and granting a
franchise. Any unused portion of the deposit shall be returned
to the applicant.
(b) Franchise fees. Any Grantee subject to the terms of this
chapter and a franchise agreement shall, in addition to any
other fees, permits, or charges by Grantor, commence making
payment of franchise fees on the effective date of a cable
services franchise agreement or, if such Grantee is already
providing cable services over the cable system, on the date of
the passage of the enacting ordinance. Commencing on the
specified date, a Grantee subject to the terms of this chapter
shall pay to Grantor an amount equal to 5% of its gross
revenues for the provision of cable services as defined in this
§ 60-9 PATTON CODE § 60-10
58:156
chapter and generally in the form as illustrated in Exhibit A,
attached and made part of this chapter by reference.78
(2) Payments due the Grantor under this provision shall be computed
at the end of each calendar year quarter. Payments shall be due and
payable for each quarter not later than 45 days from the last day of
the three-month period. Specifically, payments shall be due and
payable on or before May 15 (for the first quarter), August 15 (for
the second quarter), November 15 (for the third quarter), and
February 15 for the fourth quarter). Each payment shall be
accompanied by a brief report showing the basis for the
computation and such other relevant facts related to the payment
of the franchise fee as may be required by the Grantor. At request
of Grantor, and if agreed to by Grantee, payments will be made
electronically.
(3) No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that
the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such
acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the
Grantor may have for further or additional sums payable under the
provisions of this franchise. All amounts paid shall be subject to
audit and recomputation by the Grantor.
(4) In the event any payment is not made on the due date, interest on
the amount due shall accrue from such date at the annual rate of
6%.
(5) Bundled, tied or combined services.
(a) If a Grantee offers bundled, tied, or combined cable services
(which are subject to the franchise fee) with noncable services
(which are not subject to the franchise fee) to individual
subscribers, the combined revenues from such bundled
services shall be allocated consistent with the rates or prices
advertised by the Grantee through its marketing materials or
on its published rate card.
(b) If the Grantee does not advertise or publish separate prices for
the combined services, the percentage that the price for the
combined services is discounted from the regular retail rates of
the individual services shall be prorated across all the services
in the bundled package.
(c) As an example, a Grantee may offer a "bundle" of video, data,
and voice services for a flat fee of $75, where the retail rate for
the services purchased on an individual basis would equal
$100. The Grantee would apply a twenty-five-percent discount
to the revenue derived from each service. Thus, if the retail
rate for the cable service in the bundle were $50, Grantee
78.Editor's Note: Said form is on file and available in the Township offices.
§ 60-10 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-10
58:157
would recognize cable service revenue in the amount of $37.50
and pay a franchise fee on that revenue.
(d) In no event shall Grantee be permitted to evade or reduce
applicable franchise fee payments required to be made to
Grantor due to discounted bundled services.
B. Application of franchise fees and other fees and charges.
(1) Grantee acknowledges and agrees that the franchise fees payable
by Grantee to Grantor shall not be deemed to be in the nature of a
tax and shall be in addition to any and all taxes of general
applicability and other generally applicable fees and charges which
Grantee may be required to pay to Grantor and/or to any other
governmental authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct
obligations of Grantee.
(2) Grantee shall not deduct all or any part of the franchise fees or
other payments or in-kind contributions to be made by Grantee to
Grantor pursuant to this chapter and/or a franchise from the
franchise fees paid thereunder unless specifically agreed to in a
franchise agreement.
C. Performance bond.
(1) Except as may be described in a franchise, at the time a franchise is
accepted, a Grantee shall furnish and file with the Grantor a
performance bond. The performance bond shall run to the Grantor
in the sum of as then determined in the franchise agreement. The
performance bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful
performance of Grantee of all terms and conditions of this chapter
and a franchise. The rights reserved to the Grantor with respect to
the performance bond or other security are in addition to all other
rights the Grantor may have under a franchise or any other
applicable law. The company providing such performance bond
must be licensed to do business in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
(2) The rights reserved by the Grantor with respect to the performance
bond are in addition to all other rights the Grantor may have under
a franchise or other applicable law.
(3) The performance bond shall be subject to the approval of the
Grantor.
D. Security fund.
(1) Except as otherwise described in a franchise, at the time a
franchise is accepted and in lieu of a performance bond as required
hereinabove, a Grantee shall deposit into a bank account,
established by the Grantor, and maintain on deposit through the
term of this franchise, the sum of $10,000, unless otherwise
§ 60-10 PATTON CODE § 60-10
58:158
provided in a franchise agreement, as a common security fund for
the faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this chapter,
the franchise and compliance with all orders, permits and
directions of the Grantor and the payment by a Grantee of any
claim, liens, costs, expenses and taxes due the Grantor which arise
by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the
cable system. Interest on this deposit shall be paid to Grantee by
the bank on an annual basis.
(2) Provision shall be made to permit the Grantor to withdraw funds
from the security fund. Grantee shall not use the security fund for
other purposes and shall not assign, pledge or otherwise use this
security fund as security for any purpose. The Grantor reserves the
right to increase the required amount of the security fund to match
changes in the Consumer Price Index for All Items and All Urban
Consumers.
(3) If a Grantee fails to pay to the Grantor any amounts due and unpaid
to Grantor or fails to pay to the Grantor any liquidated damages,
costs or expenses which the Grantor shall be compelled to pay by
reason of any act or default of a Grantee in connection with this
chapter and a franchise, the Grantor may then withdraw such funds
from the security fund. Payments are not franchise fees as required
in § 60-10A or as otherwise described in a franchise agreement.
E. Procedure for imposition of penalties.
(1) If the Grantor is able to demonstrate that Grantee violated any
provision of this chapter or franchise agreement, it shall promptly
notify Grantee in writing of the nature of such violation and the
section of this chapter or franchise agreement that it believes has
been violated. If the Grantor does not notify Grantee of any
violation of this chapter or franchise agreement, it shall not operate
as a waiver of any rights of the Grantor hereunder or pursuant to
applicable law.
(2) Grantee shall have 45 days to cure such violation after written
notice is received by taking appropriate steps to comply with the
terms of this chapter or franchise agreement. If the nature of the
violation is such that, in the Grantor's reasonable judgment, it
cannot be fully cured within 45 days due to circumstances outside
of Grantee's control, the period of time in which Grantee must cure
the violation may be extended by the Grantor in writing for such
additional time necessary to complete the cure, provided that
Grantee shall have promptly commenced to cure and is diligently
pursuing its efforts to cure in the reasonable judgment of the
Grantor.
(3) If the violation has not been cured within the time allowed under
§ 60-10E(2), then Grantee shall be liable for liquidated damages in
accordance with § 60-10F.
§ 60-10 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-10
58:159
F. Liquidated damages and opportunity to cure.
(1) Because Grantee's failure to comply with provisions of this chapter
or franchise agreement may result in harm to the Grantor, and
because it will be difficult to measure the extent of such harm, the
Grantor may assess liquidated damages against Grantee in the
following amounts, provided that Grantee has had an opportunity
to cure in accordance with § 60-10E(2). Such damages shall not be
a substitute for specific performance by Grantee but shall be in
addition to such performance.
(2) The first day for which liquidated damages may be assessed, if
there has been no cure after the end of the applicable cure period,
shall be the day after the end of the applicable cure period,
including any extension of the cure period granted by the Grantor.
Liquidated damages may not be assessed for a time period
exceeding 120 days, after which the Grantor may initiate an action
in law or equity in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) The Grantor may assess liquidated damages against Grantee in the
following amounts, provided that Grantee has had an opportunity
to cure in accordance with § 60-10E(2):
(a) For failure to provide and maintain cable service as required,
$200 per day for each day the violation continues;
(b) For failure to obtain and maintain permits as required, $200
per day for each day the violation continues;
(c) For failure to give notices required in this chapter or franchise
to Grantor as required, $200 per day for each day the violation
continues;
(d) For failure to comply with any customer service provisions as
required, $200 per day for each day the violation continues;
(e) For failure to submit reports in a timely fashion as required,
$150 per day for each day the violation continues; and
(f) For failure to comply with any material provision of the
franchise, $150 per day for each day the violation continues.
G. Liability insurance.
(1) A Grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of a franchise
agreement and as may be further described therein, liability
insurance with a company licensed to do business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with a rating by A.M. Best of not
less than "A minus VII," insuring Grantee and the Grantor with
regard to all damages mentioned in § 60-10F(1), in the minimum
amounts of:
(a) For bodily injury or death to any one person: $1,000,000.
§ 60-10 PATTON CODE § 60-10
58:160
(b) For bodily injury or death resulting from any one accident:
$1,000,000; and
(c) For all other types of liability in umbrella form: $2,000,000.
(2) At the time of acceptance of a franchise, and upon request, Grantee
shall furnish to the Grantor a certificate evidencing that a
satisfactory insurance policy has been obtained. Said certificate
shall be approved by the Grantor, and such insurance policy shall
require that the Grantor be notified 30 days prior to any expiration
or cancellation.
(3) All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this § 60-10G shall
contain the following or similar endorsement:
"Should any of the policies described herein be canceled before
the expiration date thereof, the insurer affording coverage will
endeavor to mail 30 days' written notice to the certificate holder
named herein, but failure to mail such notice shall impose no
obligation or liability of any kind upon the insurer affording
coverage, its agents, or representatives, or the insurer of this
certificate."
(4) A Grantee will replace such insurance to conform to this chapter by
promptly filing evidence of proof of insurance with Grantor before
termination of any existing insurance.
H. Grantor's right to revoke. In addition to all other rights which the
Grantor has pursuant to law or equity, the Grantor reserves the right to
initiate revocation proceedings, and all rights and privileges pertaining
thereto, in the event that:
(1) It is demonstrated that Grantee substantially and materially
violated any material provision of this franchise or state, federal or
local law applicable to Grantee's operation of a cable system within
Grantor.
(2) It is demonstrated that Grantee repeatedly violates, after notice
and opportunity to cure, any of the material provisions of the
franchise or provision of valid applicable state, federal or local law
and refuses to cure it.
(3) A Grantee is found to have practiced any fraud or deceit upon the
Grantor or subscriber.
(4) A Grantee is found to have knowingly misrepresented a material
fact in the application for, negotiation of, renegotiation of, or
renewal of the franchise.
I. Revocation procedures. In the event that the Grantor determines that a
Grantee has violated any material event as set forth in § 60-10H, or any
generally applicable material federal, state or local law, the Grantor
may make a written demand on a Grantee that it remedy such violation
§ 60-10 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-10
58:161
and that continued violation may be cause for revocation. If the
violation, breach, failure, refusal, or neglect is not remedied to the
satisfaction of the Grantor within 45 days following such demand, the
Grantor shall determine whether or not such violation, breach, failure,
refusal or neglect by Grantee is due to acts of God or other causes
which result from circumstances beyond Grantee's control.
(1) The Grantor may schedule a public hearing, and Grantee shall be
provided with an opportunity to be heard. This opportunity shall
include the ability to introduce evidence, to question witnesses and
to respond to any notice of grounds to terminate in accordance with
the standards of a fair hearing applicable to administrative
hearings in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The causes for
pending revocation and the reasons alleged to constitute such
cause shall be recited in a notice to a Grantee prior to the public
hearing. Said notice shall affirmatively recite the causes that need
to be shown by the Grantor to support a revocation. All notice
requirements shall be met by providing Grantee at least 45 days'
prior written notice (via certified mail, return receipt requested) of
any public hearing concerning the proposed revocation of a
franchise.
(2) If notice is given and after a public hearing is held, the Grantor
determines there is a violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect
by a Grantee, the Grantor shall state in writing the grounds for its
decision and give notice to a Grantee to correct or remedy the same
within such reasonable additional time, in such manner and upon
such reasonable terms and conditions as Grantor may direct.
(3) If, after a public hearing or hearing by a hearing officer, designated
by Grantor, it is determined that a Grantee's performance of any of
the terms, conditions, obligations, or requirements of franchise was
prevented or impaired due to any cause beyond its reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable, such inability to perform
shall be deemed to be excused and no penalties or sanctions shall
be imposed as a result thereof, provided that Grantee has notified
Grantor in writing within 30 days of its receipt of notice of the
breach of said cause. Such causes beyond a Grantee's reasonable
control or not reasonably foreseeable shall include, but shall not be
limited to, acts of God, civil emergencies and labor strikes.
(4) If, after notice is given and opportunity to cure, at a Grantee's
option, a public hearing is held, the Grantor determines there was a
violation, breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the Grantor may
declare, by formal resolution, a franchise revoked and canceled and
of no further force and effect unless there is compliance within
such period as Grantor may fix, such period not to be less than 30
days, provided that no opportunity for compliance need be granted
for fraud or misrepresentation.
§ 60-10 PATTON CODE § 60-10
58:162
§ 60-11. Foreclosure and abandonment.
§ 60-12. Removal, transfer and purchase.
(5) The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the
agenda of the Grantor's governing body at the expiration of the
time set by it for compliance. The Grantor then may terminate a
franchise forthwith upon finding that a Grantee has failed to
achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its
discretion.
(6) If the Grantor, after notice is given and, at a Grantee's option, a full
public proceeding is held and appeal is exhausted, declares a
franchise breached, the parties may pursue their remedies
pursuant to a franchise or any other remedy, legal or equitable.
A. Foreclosure. Upon the foreclosure or other judicial sale of the system,
Grantee shall notify the Grantor of such fact, and such notification shall
be treated as a notification that a change in control of Grantee has
taken place, and the provisions of this franchise governing the consent
to transfer or change in ownership shall apply without regard to how
such transfer or change in ownership occurred.
B. Abandonment. Grantee may not abandon any portion of the cable
system thereof without having first given three months' written notice
to the Grantor. Grantee may not abandon any portion of the cable
system without compensating the Grantor for damages resulting from
the abandonment.
A. Removal after revocation or denial of renewal.
(1) Upon denial of renewal of a franchise, or upon its revocation, as
provided for, the Grantor shall have the right to require a Grantee
to remove within two years, at a Grantee's expense, all or any
portion of the cable system from all rights-of-way and public
property within the Grantor. In so removing the cable system, a
Grantee shall refill and compact, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made and shall leave all rights-of-way, public property
and private property in as good a condition as that prevailing prior
to Grantee's removal of the cable system and without affecting,
altering or disturbing in any way electric, telephone or utility
cables, wires or attachments. The Grantor, or its delegation, shall
have the right to inspect and approve the condition of such rightsof-
way and public property after removal. Under no circumstance,
including, without limitation, revocation or denial of renewal of a
franchise or any other action to forbid or disallow Grantee from
providing cable services, shall Grantee or its assignees be required
to sell any right, title, interest, use or control of any portion of
Grantee's facilities, including, without limitation, the cable system
and any capacity used for cable service or otherwise, to the Grantor
or any third party. Grantee shall not be required to remove or to
§ 60-10 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-12
58:163
relocate the plant that facilitates Internet access, digital voice, or
other such services not governed by Title VI of the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, or any portion thereof as a result of
revocation, denial of renewal or any other action to forbid or
disallow Grantee from providing cable services.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection A of this section, if a
Grantee has failed to complete such removal within the time given
under § 160-12A(1), after written notice of the Grantor's demand
for removal is given, the Grantor shall have the right to exercise
one of the following options:
(a) Declare all right, title and interest to the cable system to be in
the Grantor or its delegator with all rights of ownership,
including, but not limited to, the right to operate the cable
system or transfer the cable system to another for operation by
it; or
(b) Declare the cable system abandoned and cause the cable
system, or such part thereof as the Grantor shall designate, to
be removed at no cost to the Grantor. The cost of said removal
shall be recoverable from the security fund, indemnity and/or
penalty section provided for in a franchise or from a Grantee
directly.
B. Sale or transfer of franchise.
(1) A franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred (including
through inheritance), either in whole or in part, used as collateral
for any loan or loans, or leased or sublet in any manner, nor shall
title thereto, either legal or equitable, or any right, interest or
property therein, pass to or vest in any person without full
compliance with the procedure set forth in this section.
(2) Neither Grantee nor its parent nor any affiliated entity shall
transfer, assign or otherwise encumber, through its own action or
by operation of law, its right, title or interest in the cable system or
in a franchise agreement without the prior written consent of the
Grantor. Neither Grantee nor its parent nor any affiliated entity
shall sell, convey, transfer, exchange or release more than 50% of
its equitable ownership in the cable system without the prior
written consent of the Grantor. No such consent shall be required
for i) a transfer in trust, by mortgage, hypothecation, or by
assignment to a financial institution of any rights, title or interest of
Grantee in the franchise or in the cable system in order to secure
indebtedness, or ii) a transfer to an entity owned and/or controlled
by Grantee.
(a) The parties to the sale or transfer shall make a written request
to the Grantor for its approval of a sale or transfer. The written
request shall not be deemed complete until all information
required by the Grantor in accordance with applicable FCC
§ 60-12 PATTON CODE § 60-12
58:164
§ 60-13. Rights of individuals protected.
regulations is provided to the Grantor. Upon receipt of a
complete written request with all application information,
including the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the
transferee, the Grantor shall have 120 days to grant or deny
such approval. Within 30 days of the request, in accordance
with FCC rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of
the additional information, if any, it requires to determine the
legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee or
new controlling party.
(b) The Grantor shall reply in writing within 30 days of the request
and shall exercise its determination that a public hearing is
necessary.
(c) If a public hearing is deemed necessary pursuant to Subsection
B(2)(b) above, such hearing shall be commenced within 30
days of such determination, and notice of any such hearing
shall be given 14 days prior to the hearing by publishing notice
thereof. The notice shall contain the date, time and place of the
public hearing and shall briefly state the substance of the
action to be considered by the Grantor.
(d) Within 30 days after the closing of the public hearing, the
Grantor shall approve or deny in writing the sale or transfer
request. If the Grantor has not taken final action on the
Grantee's request for consent within 120 days after receiving
such request, consent shall be deemed granted.
(e) Any consent by the Grantor for any transfer described above
shall not be effective until the proposed transferee or assignee
shall have executed a legally binding agreement stating that it
shall be bound by all the terms and conditions contained in the
franchise.
C. Purchase by grantor upon denial of renewal or revocation.
(1) Upon lawful denial of renewal or revocation of franchise, the
Grantor may, in lawful manner and upon the payment of fair market
value, mutually determined, Grantor and Grantee, lawfully obtain,
purchase, condemn, acquire, take over and hold the cable system.
(2) Upon the revocation of a franchise, the Grantor may in lawful
manner and upon the payment of an equitable price lawfully obtain,
purchase, and condemn, in accordance with such proceedings
governed by federal and/or state law, take over and hold the cable
system.
A. Unfair discriminatory practices prohibited. In the performance of a
franchise, a Grantee shall not discriminate unfairly against any person
on the ground of or because of race, creed, color, national origin or
§ 60-12 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 60-13
58:165
§ 60-14. Miscellaneous provisions.
ancestry, gender, religion or political opinion or affiliation, income of
residents in any area of the Grantor, or age. A Grantee shall comply at
all times with all other valid applicable federal, state and local laws,
and all federal and state executive and administrative orders relating to
nondiscrimination.
B. Subscriber privacy.
(1) Absent a court order or requirement of federal or state law, no
signal of a channel may be transmitted from a subscriber terminal
for purposes of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices
without the express written permission of the subscriber; provided,
however, that Grantee may conduct systemwide or individually
addressed "sweeps" solely for the purpose of verifying system
integrity, checking for illegal taps, controlling return-path
transmission, billing for pay services or monitoring channel usage
in a manner not inconsistent with the federal law. Grantee shall not
record or retain any information transmitted between a subscriber
and any third party, except as required for lawful business
purposes. The request for such permission shall be contained in a
separate document with a prominent statement that the subscriber
is authorizing the permission in full knowledge of its provisions.
Such written permission shall be for a limited period of time not to
exceed one year, which shall be renewed at the option of the
subscriber. No penalty shall be invoked for a subscriber's failure to
provide or renew such authorization. The authorization shall be
revocable at any time by the subscriber without penalty of any kind
whatsoever. Such permission shall be required for each type or
classification of cable communications activity planned for the
purpose of monitoring individual viewing patterns or practices.
(2) No information or data obtained by monitoring transmission of a
signal from a subscriber terminal, or any other means, including,
but not limited to, lists of the names and addresses of such
subscribers or any lists that identify the viewing habits of
subscribers, shall be sold or otherwise made available to any party
other than to a Grantee and its employees for internal business use,
and also to the subscriber subject of that information, unless a
Grantee has received specific written authorization from the
subscriber to make such data available.
(3) Compliance with the Cable Act, Section 631, shall be deemed
compliance with this § 60-13B.
A. Compliance with laws. A Grantee and the Grantor shall act reasonably
and in good faith, deal fairly, and cooperate with each other to enable
performance of all obligations under this chapter and achievements of
the expected benefits. A Grantee shall conform to all Grantor
ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations heretofore or hereafter
§ 60-13 PATTON CODE § 60-14
58:166
adopted or established during the entire term of a franchise agreement
which conform with generally applicable Grantor regulations.
B. Continuity of service mandatory. Upon revocation or lawful denial of
renewal of a franchise agreement, the Grantor may require a Grantee to
continue to operate the cable system for an extended period of time not
to exceed six months. A Grantee shall, as trustee for its successor in
interest, continue to operate the cable system under the terms and
conditions of a franchise agreement. In the event a Grantee does not so
operate the cable system, the Grantor may take such steps as it, in its
sole discretion, deems necessary to assure continued service to
subscribers.
C. Work performed by others.
(1) All provisions of this franchise shall remain the responsibility of a
Grantee, and a Grantee shall be responsible for and hold the
Grantor harmless for any claims or liability arising out of work
performed by persons other than a Grantee in accordance with
§ 60-2H. The Grantee shall further provide all emergency contact
information (name, address, phone number, etc.) for Grantee
employee responsible for said entity.
(2) All provisions of this chapter and a franchise shall apply to any
subcontractor or others performing any work or services pursuant

such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded,
amended or otherwise changed so that the provision which had

Grantee and the Grantor.
(3) In the event that any court or other authority of competent
jurisdiction declares any section, provision or clause of this chapter
and a franchise to be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, or is
preempted by federal or state laws or regulations, such section,
provision or clause shall be deemed to be severable from the
remaining portions of this agreement and shall not affect the
legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of this

obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter or a
franchise by reason of any failure of the Grantor to enforce prompt

and unless such franchise is in full force and effect.
(2) Unless permitted by law, from and after the acceptance of a
franchise, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct, install or
maintain within any rights-of-way in the Grantor, within any other

within the Grantor or which has not yet become a right-of-way but
§ 60-14 PATTON CODE § 60-14
58:168
is designated or delineated as a proposed right-of-way on any
tentative subdivision map approved by the Grantor, or the
Grantor's official map or the Grantor's major thoroughfare plan,

rights-of-way or property or areas has first been obtained.
H. Emergency use. The Grantee shall comply with the emergency alert
provisions set forth by the FCC, set forth under 47 CFR Part 11, FCC

working with the Centre County Office of Emergency Services and the
Centre Region Emergency Management Council in the establishment of
an emergency response plan.

enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania except to the extent the Supremacy Clause of the

noncompliance with, the provisions of the chapter or franchise, nor
suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default

where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused
by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain
or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature,

system, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or
other event that is reasonably beyond the Grantee's ability to anticipate

Homestead Farms
[Adopted 12-7-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-537]
§ 104-1. Legislative findings.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has adopted enabling legislation,
specifically the Neighborhood Improvement District Act, 73 P.S. § 831, Act
No. 2000-130, authorizing the creation of neighborhood improvement
districts to enable property owners in neighborhoods to make
improvements within the neighborhood or to provide services to their
neighborhoods that supplement municipal services otherwise provided. The
legislation provides for the assessment of property owners within the
neighborhood improvement district (NID) to pay for the improvements
or additional services. The Board of Supervisors may create an NID, by
ordinance pursuant to Act No. 2000-130, when the Board believes that
such a district is necessary and desirable to improve the quality of life for
residents and commercial occupants within an Improvement District.
§ 104-2. Homestead Farms Neighborhood Improvement District
established.
A. Establishment of district. At the behest of the Board of Directors of the
Homestead Farms Corporation (HFC), acting on behalf of the member
residents of the Homestead Farms Neighborhood, and as authorized by
Act 2000-130, 73 P.S. § 831 et seq., known as the "Neighborhood
Improvement District Act of 2000" (Act), the Homestead Farms
Neighborhood Improvement District (NID) is established with
boundaries depicted on 104 Attachment 1, appended to this chapter,94
generally encompassing the residential properties within Patton
Township with driveway access onto East Shadow Lane, Sandy Ridge
Road and Crandall Drive. A companion NID will also be established in
the Ferguson Township portion of Homestead Farms.
B. District plan and improvements. Special assessment revenues shall be
used solely for administrative services and roadway improvements as
detailed in the "Final Plan for Establishing Neighborhood Improvement
Districts for Homestead Farms in Patton Township and Ferguson
Township," on file with the Township Secretary, and not for essential
governmental services provided by Patton Township.
C. Levy of special assessment. There is hereby levied an assessment to pay
the cost of the improvements computed as follows:
(1) Amount of assessment. The total assessment for the combined
Patton Township and Ferguson Township shall be based on the total
proposed project costs of $212,245.00.

(2) Method of assessment. The special assessment fees on each
property shall be based on the total proposed project costs divided
evenly among each of the 48 properties, comprised of 43 properties
in Patton Township and five properties in Ferguson Township. The
special assessment fees on each property shall be $4,421.77
[equals ($212,245.00/48].
(3) Payment of assessment.
(a) On behalf of the property owners, the Homestead Farms
Corporation shall provide an initial installment payment of
$30,000 to the NID in January 2012 as a credit of $625.00 for
each property against the special assessment fee.
(b) The remainder of the special assessment ($4,421.77 less the
initial installment payment of $625.00) shall be payable in 12
annual installments. Annual installment payments shall be due
on March 1 of each year from 2012 through 2023. The annual
installment payment of the special assessment fee on each
property is $316.40 [equals ($4,421.77 - $625.00)/12].
(c) A ten-percent penalty shall be applied to payments made after
March 1.
(d) Any outstanding balance of the special assessment may be
satisfied at any time without penalty.
(4) Liens. Assessments shall constitute liens and encumbrances upon
the assessed property and shall be collectible in accordance with
the provisions of § 7(d) of Act 130, 73 P.S. § 837(d) and in general
may be collected in the same manner as municipal tax claims,
notwithstanding the provision of this section as to installment
payments.
D. Collection of assessment. The assessment shall be collected by the
Patton Township Treasurer. The Treasurer shall mail initial notices to
owners of the benefited properties no later than January 15 of each
installment year. The Treasurer shall mail delinquent notices in a
manner consistent with Township practices for collection of delinquent
tax and assessment accounts.
E. Management. The Homestead Farms Corporation (HFC), a nonprofit
corporation, shall be the NID Management Association (NIDMA) for
both NIDs. As provided for in the agreement between the Patton
Township Board of Supervisors (PTBoS), the Ferguson Township Board
of Supervisors (FTBoS) and the HFC, the NIDMA shall meet annually
with a designated representative of the Townships to review the project
implementation. The Public Works Department of Patton Township shall
administer the projects and shall utilize Patton Township resources or
qualified contractors to complete projects as scheduled in the plan.
Contracts shall be awarded by the Township to the lowest responsive
§ 104-2 PATTON CODE § 104-2
103:188
bidder. Projects may be included in contracts that also include work
outside the NIDs (i.e., annual street overlay contracts).
F. Sunset provision. The Homestead Farms Neighborhood Improvement
District shall automatically terminate on December 31, 2023, unless
continued or extended by subsequent action in accordance with the
provisions of Act 130, 73 P.S. § 830 et seq.

§ 105-5 PATTON CODE § 105-6
103:194
contractor's agreement to undertake certain mitigating actions.
Denials shall state the Manager's rationale for not approving the
request.
(5) The Manager may elect to send the request to the Board of
Supervisors for consideration. No special meetings of the Board
will be called to consider a request.
(6) The Manager's decision to deny or approve with conditions may be
appealed to the Board. The request for appeal must be in writing,
must provide the contractor's rationale for the appeal, and must
provide means to mitigate residents' disruption.
(7) All decisions by the Board for exceptions, modifications or waivers
will be in writing. Approvals may be conditioned on the contractor's
agreement to undertake certain mitigating actions. Denials shall
state the Board's rationale for not approving the request.
B. Emergencies. The Township recognizes that emergencies may occur,
both on public and private property, that would involve construction or
construction-like activities being utilized to address emerging issues
that can pose hazards to people and property. In such cases, as soon as
practicable, the Township shall be notified.
(1) Once an emerging issue has been stabilized, the Manager or his
designee will engage with the responsible party (owner, contractor,
or lead agency) to determine the remaining scope of the response
and recovery efforts. Based on the nature of the emergency and the
scope of the recovery, the Manager will offer guidance to the
responsible party to balance the recovery requirements and the
health, safety and welfare of the public.
(2) The Manager or his designee will continue to engage with the
responsible party until such time that the remaining activities enter
a nonemergency phase. After that point, the responsible party shall
comply with the policy or seek an exception, modification or waiver
(see above).
C. Exemptions.
(1) Construction activities within PennDOT's limited access rights-ofway.
(2) Work performed under an emergency declaration.
(3) Work performed as part of an emergency response under the
direction of an incident commander or a unified command.
(4) Certain seasonal activities wherein exposure to the elements can
be harmful to workers. For example, roofing work during hot
weather may commence prior to 7:00 a.m.

§ 105-9. Enforcement.
The provisions of this article shall be enforced by Township police officers,
Township Ordinance Enforcement Officers, and others designated by the
Township Manager.
(5) Specific construction activities that involve materials that are
temperature sensitive. For example, large concrete placements
during hot weather may commence prior to 7:00 a.m.
A. In reviewing a request for a waiver, the value of affording residents a
quiet night's sleep will always far outweigh an applicant's desires. In
almost all circumstances, a request for a waiver that would impact a
residential section or nearby lodgings and dwellings will be denied.
B. Written applications for a waiver to this article shall be submitted to the
Board of Supervisors at least 60 days prior to the event.
(1) No special meetings of the Board will be called to consider a
request.
C. The application must be submitted on the form provided by the
Township (Waiver Application95).
D. The Board may engage with a requestor to determine the least intrusive
method available to address the applicant's needs while still protecting
residents.
E. All decisions by the Board for a waiver will be in writing. Approvals may
be conditioned on the applicant's agreement to undertake certain
mitigating actions. Denials shall state the Board's rationale for not
approving the request.
A. Any person found guilty of violating provisions of this article shall be
fined not less than $100 for the first offense, and not less than $500 for
any subsequent offenses in any one-hundred-twenty-day period and,
upon failure to pay such fine, shall be sentenced to jail for a term not to
exceed 30 days for each offense.
B. A penalty provided for under this article may be imposed in addition to
any penalty that may be imposed for any other criminal offense arising
from the same conduct.
C. A separate and distinct offense shall be committed each day that a
violation of the terms of this article continues to exist.

existing disposal area, replacing a gravity distribution system with a
pressurized system or other alternatives as appropriate for the specific
site.
E. In lieu of, or in combination with, the remedies described in Subsection
D above, the municipal Sewage Enforcement Officer may require the
installation of water conservation equipment and the institution of
water conservation practices in structures served. Water using devices
and appliances in the structure may be required to be retrofitted with
water saving appurtenances or they may be required to be replaced by
water conserving devices and appliances. Wastewater generation in the
structure may also be reduced by requiring changes in water usage
patterns in the structure served.
F. In the event that the rehabilitation measures in Subsections A through
E are not feasible or do not prove effective, the municipality may
require the owner to apply to the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection for a permit to install a single residence
treatment and discharge system. Upon receipt of said permit the owner
shall complete construction of the system within 60 days.
G. Should none of the remedies described above prove totally effective in

intended to permit the erection or maintenance of signs that are
prohibited in § 140-7, (Signs prohibited in all areas).
B. In the event that any person wishes to retain, construct or install a sign
or signs other than as permitted in this chapter, that person shall be
entitled to a hearing before the Planning Commission for special
exceptions. Any person requesting a variance for hardship shall be

Board and shall approve applications for directional signs prior to
issuance of a sign permit by the Sign Inspector.
(a) The Planning Commission may recommend a special exception,
provided that all of the following findings are made where
relevant in a given case:
[1] The sign material, design or construction should be
nonstandard. Signs of substantially the same material,
§ 140-23 PATTON CODE § 140-24
123:270
§ 140-25. Variances.
design or construction as existing signs in the Township or
commonly used signs for a multisite business interest do
not demonstrate excellence in design.
[2] The sign shall include some unique element or elements,
other than the written message, related to the use, or the
sign shall provide a visual tie to other features on the site,
or the sign shall convey additional information.
[3] Evidence must be provided demonstrating that the sign
has been integrated into the site or building design in the
design phase of the project. "Excellence in planning" is
demonstrated by linking site, architectural, and signage
elements together early in the process.
[4] It must be demonstrated that due to the unique elements
of the sign it is not possible to comply with all aspects of
the Sign Ordinance, or it must be demonstrated that there
is a compelling reason related to other design features on
the site that lead to a design outside the Sign Ordinance,
and it must be demonstrated that the requested special
exception represents the minimum deviation that will
afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
(b) The Planning Commission may request sketches, drawings or
photographs showing the entire property and the proposed
sign or signs, and the applicant shall explain briefly in the
written request where the sign or signs vary from the
provisions of this chapter and why an exception is needed.
(3) After the meeting and hearing on any application, the Planning
Commission shall decide the application and make its
determination known to the applicant within 30 days of having
received such application. Subsequent to review of any application
for a special exception from the terms of this chapter, the Planning
Commission shall also make its determination known to the Zoning
Hearing Board within 30 days of having received such application.
This action will constitute a formal application to the Zoning
Hearing Board, provided that upon receipt of notice from the
Planning Commission the applicant submits such forms and fees as
required by the Zoning Hearing Board. The Zoning Hearing Board
shall determine that the Planning Commission has correctly
applied the express criteria stated in § 140-24C(5) and may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards it may deem necessary.
(4) In considering an application, the Planning Commission may not
consider reasons of hardship.

§ 140-26. Sign Inspector.
A. Variances, for hardship, to this chapter shall be granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board under the variance provisions of Chapter 175, Zoning,
and in accordance with the variance criteria established by the
Municipalities Planning Code.116 The Board shall hear requests for
variances where it is alleged that the provisions of the Sign Ordinance
inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The hearings shall be
convened and conducted in accordance with § 175-64, Hearings.
(1) The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the Sign Ordinance.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be signed in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Sign Ordinance and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this Act and the Zoning Ordinance.117
B. The Zoning Hearing Board shall have the power to hear and rule on
appeals from the decision of the Sign Inspector. Such appeals must be
filed with the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days of the Sign
Inspector's decision.

Specific methods and publications indicated in this chapter shall, in all
cases, refer to the latest available edition and include revisions or
amendments thereto.
§ 147-10. Exemptions.
A. Activities identified below are exempt from the requirement to submit a
stormwater management plan to the municipality for review. Exemption
shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such measures as are
necessary to protect health, safety, and property. These measures
include adequate and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as
it leaves the site. This exemption shall not relieve the developer or
owner from meeting the special requirements for water quality and
groundwater recharge for high quality (HQ) and exceptional value (EV)
watersheds (DEP Chapter 93 and antidegradation requirement), and
§ 147-15C and E of this chapter relative to recharge and water quality
volume requirements.
(1) All development activities having impervious coverage of less than
10% of the total site area up to a maximum impervious area of
5,000 square feet. However, adequate and safe conveyance of
stormwater from the site must be provided. For developments that
are to be constructed in phases, the sum of all final phases must be
considered in establishing exemption eligibility. Impervious cover
shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking or driveway
areas, and any new streets and sidewalks, or bikeways.
(2) Land disturbance associated with the construction or alteration of
one- and two-family dwellings, provided that the disturbance does
not alter any stormwater condition beyond the boundaries of the lot
or alter provisions of a previously approved stormwater
management plan for the lot or encompassing subdivision.
§ 147-7 (RESERVED) § 147-10
123:305
(3) Any site less than one acre in size that decreases the total site
impervious area following development, and:
(a) Is not located within a recognized sensitive area (as defined in
Article II, Definitions, of this chapter);
(b) Is not defined as a water quality sensitive (WQS) development
(as defined in Article II, Definitions, and Appendix B, Maps131);
and
(c) Is not located in an area where existing downstream
stormwater problems are known to occur (the Municipal
Engineer shall make the final determination as to preexisting
problems, but the municipality must have supporting
documentation of past problems).
(4) In addition, the Municipal Engineer may waive the requirement to
prepare a stormwater management plan for sites larger than 1.0
acre for which the overall site impervious area is being decreased,
and which meets the other conditions identified above.
B. The diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel or
the installation of stormwater management facilities or modifications
thereto cannot be exempted. These activities always require the
submission of a stormwater management plan. The exemptions in
Subsection A(1) and (2) cannot be combined for use with small
residential subdivisions. Multiple (greater than two) lot subdivisions
cannot be exempted.
C. In addition to the general exemptions identified above, exemptions for
specific technical criteria are identified where applicable in Article III.

ARTICLE IV
Stormwater Management
§ 147-12. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in the municipality which do not fall under the
exemption criteria shown in § 147-10 of this chapter shall submit a
stormwater management plan to the governing municipality for review.
This plan must be consistent with the Spring Creek Watershed
Stormwater Management Plan. These criteria shall apply to the total
proposed development even if development is to take place in phases.
Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof, parking
or driveway areas, and any new streets and sidewalks. Any areas
designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be assumed to be
impervious for the purposes of comparison to the waiver criteria. The
DEP stormwater BMP Manual, as amended and updated, shall be used
for design of stormwater management facilities. No disturbances may
be performed prior to approval of a stormwater management site plan.
B. Stormwater drainage system shall be provided in order to permit
unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as modified by
stormwater management facilities or open channels consistent with this
chapter.
(1) Stormwater management facilities and related installations also
shall be provided:
(a) To ensure adequate drainage of all low points along the
curbline of streets.
(b) To intercept stormwater runoff along streets at intervals
reasonably related to the extend and grade of the area drained,
and to prevent substantial flow of water across intersections or
flooded intersections during storms, in accordance with the
procedures contained in Design Manual Part 2 (DM-2),
Chapter 10, of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PA DOT).
(c) To ensure adequate and unimpeded flow of stormwater under
driveways in, near, or across natural watercourses or drainage
swales. Suitable pipes or other waterways shall be provided as
necessary.
(d) To property drain stormwater runoff from all land development
projects, except as required by recharge criteria. All lot and
open areas shall be designed to drain to the nearest practical
street or drainage system, existing or proposed, as defined by
the Municipal Engineer, with no impact on adjoining
properties, unless an area specifically designed for stormwater
detention is provided.
§ 147-12 (RESERVED) § 147-12
123:319
C. The existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of the
affected property owner(s) and shall be subject to any applicable
discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of existing
discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or maintained as
diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise provided by this chapter. If
diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and discharged onto
adjacent property, the developer must document that adequate
downstream conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the
concentrated discharge, or otherwise prove that no erosion,
sedimentation, flooding or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge. If, in the opinion of the Municipal Engineer, based upon the
analysis above, that there will be an impact on the downstream
adjacent property, the municipality may require that the developer
obtain a stormwater easement.
E. Where a development site is traversed by watercourses, drainage
easement shall be provided conforming to the line of such
watercourses. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the
placing of fill or structures, and any alterations that may adversely
affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement.
Developers are encouraged to allow stormwater easements to revert to
a natural condition. Mowing or similar types of vegetative control are
discouraged while removal of invasive species are encouraged.
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainageways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open
channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and
grade of such natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint permit
application process, or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP, through
the general permit process.
G. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located in or adjacent to waters of the commonwealth or
wetlands shall be subject to approval by PA DEP through the joint
permit application process or, where deemed appropriate by PA DEP,
the general permit process. When there is a question whether wetlands
may be involved, it is the responsibility of the developer or his agent to
show that the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands;
otherwise approval to work in the area must be obtained from PA DEP.
H. Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this chapter that
would be located on state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PA DOT).
I. Low-impact development (LID) is to be used to the maximum extent
practical. Minimization of impervious surfaces and infiltration of runoff
§ 147-12 PATTON CODE § 147-12
123:320
through seepage beds, recharge trenches, etc., are encouraged, where
soil conditions permit, to reduce the size or eliminate the need for
detention facilities.
J. To promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation of stormwater,
roof drains should not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm
sewers, or roadside ditches unless approved by the municipality on a
case-by-case basis.
K. Where deemed necessary by the Municipal Engineer, the applicant
shall submit an analysis of the impacts of detained stormwater flows on
downstream areas within the watershed. These impacts shall be
identified with concurrence from the Municipal Engineer. The analysis
shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to
determine the impact peak discharges from the proposed development
on critical locations such as dams, tributaries, existing developments,
undersized culverts, floodprone areas, etc.
L. When stormwater management facilities are proposed within 1,000 feet
of a downstream municipality, the analysis of downstream impacts shall
be submitted to the downstream municipality's engineer for review and
comment.
M. The applicant shall notify the owners of all adjacent properties.
Notification shall be via United States certified mail with copies of the
return receipts provided to the Township. Notification is to include the
following language: "A land development plan is being considered by
Patton Township for Tax Parcel (inserted parcel number) as shown on
the attached exhibit. Public comment for this land development will be
received at a meeting of the Patton Township Planning Commission on
(insert date). If you cannot attend this public meeting, comments may
be directed to Patton Township at 814-234-0271." A letter and location
map exhibit must be approved by the Township prior to distribution to
the owners of the adjacent properties.
N. Approved stormwater management site plans must be on site at all
times during construction.
O. Use of alternate and/or new stormwater management controls will be
considered by the Township. A description of the proposed alternate
controls must be submitted to the Township, the Centre County
Conservation District, and to DEP. The Township will coordinate any
approvals with the CCCD and/or DEP.
P. The stormwater management site plan must contain a proper long term
ownership, operation and maintenance plan in accordance with Article
VII of this chapter.
Q. Postconstruction runoff control requirements.
(1) No regulated earth disturbance activity (any earth disturbance of
one acre or more with a point source discharge to surface waters or
§ 147-12 (RESERVED) § 147-12
123:321
to the municipal storm sewer system or five acres or more
regardless of the planned runoff) within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements
after construction is complete.
(2) The BMPs must be designed to protect and maintain existing uses
(e.g., drinking water use; cold water fishery use) and maintain the
level of water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in "special protection"
streams, as required by statewide regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 (collectively referred to herein as "state water quality
requirements").
(3) To control post construction stormwater impacts from regulated
earth disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff
conditions, so that postconstruction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the
receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive
Stormwater Management Policy (#392-0300-002, September 28,
2002), this may be achieved by the following:
(a) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions.
(b) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure
filtering out of chemical and physical pollutants form the
stormwater runoff.
(c) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume
and rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent
physical degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring
and erosion).
(4) DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation, and maintenance of best management practices
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and
redevelopment (hereinafter "development") after regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete. These requirements include
the need to implement postconstruction stormwater BMPs with
assurance of long-term operations and maintenance of those BMPs.
(5) Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth
disturbance from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
conservation district must be provided to the municipality. The
issuance of an NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage
under the statewide general permit (PAG-2) satisfies the
requirements of Subsection N(1).

list shall be used as a guide in these determinations. Industrial
manufacturing site and hazardous material storage areas must
provide NPDES SIC codes.
A. General. Postdevelopment rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development
for the design storms specified.

illustrated in Appendix B135. The exact location of these boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined using
mapping at a scale which accurately defines the limits of the sensitive
area. If the project site is within the sensitive area (in whole or in part),
two-foot contour interval mapping shall be provided to define the limits
of the sensitive area. If the project site is not immediately adjacent to
but within 500 linear feet of a defined sensitive area, a five-foot contour
interval map defining the limits of the sensitive area shall be included
in the stormwater management plan to document the site's location
relative to the sensitive area.
C. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
which is traversed by a SAD boundary, the design criteria for sensitive
areas must be applied if postdevelopment runoff is directed towards the
sensitive area.
D. Off-site areas. Off-site areas that drain from sensitive areas through a
proposed development site that is located entirely in a nonsensitive
area are not required to use or apply the sensitive area criteria.
E. Site areas. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed
development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only
the proposed impact area.
F. Downstream hydraulic capacity analysis. Any downstream or off-site
hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with these
standards shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment runoff associated with a two-year return
period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall
be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the postdevelopment twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at a minimum, pass the posdevelopment twenty-five-year return
period runoff.
(4) It must be demonstrated that the downstream conveyance channel,
other stormwater facilities, roadways, or overland areas must be

§ 147-15. Calculation methodologies.
Design criteria and calculation methodologies have been classified by
functional group for presentation as follows: A. peak runoff rate discharge
requirements; B. stormwater pond capture volumes; C. recharge volumes;
D. storm drain design including conveyance, channel protection and
stability; and E. water quality standards. These criteria and calculation
methodologies have been developed to simplify stormwater management
designs, unify methods, remove model parameter subjectivity, remove
improperly used methods, and to ensure stormwater management decisions
are based more realistically on hydrologic processes. In addition, common
sense should always be used as a controlling criteria. Prior to stormwater
management and water quality design, applicants should consult with the
Municipal Engineer to verify stormwater quality criteria and present
proposed features and concepts for the treatment of stormwater runoff.
Following this meeting, the Municipal Engineer shall define any needed
support studies or documentation. These standards provide consistent and
process-oriented design procedures for application by land development
professionals. It is recognized that in an attempt to generalize the
computational procedures, assumptions have been made which on some
occasions may be violated. If such a violation is identified, alternate
standards and procedures may be applied. Both the violation and the
alternate procedures to be applied must be documented by a hydrologist
or hydrogeologist. Any request for use of exemptions, alternate standards
or procedures under this chapter must be agreed to in wiring by the
Municipal Engineer prior to formal submission of plans for consideration
by the municipality. A flow chart documenting the stormwater management
design process is provided as Exhibit 4 in Appendix B136 of this chapter.
capable of safely conveying the one-hundred-year design storm
without causing damage to buildings or other infrastructure.
(5) Where the downstream conveyance channel or other facility is
located within a floodway, it must be demonstrated that the limits
of said flood hazard area are not increased by the proposed activity.
(6) Stormwater management ponds that fall under the DEP Chapter
105 criteria of a "dam" must meet the criteria within Chapter 105.
A. Peak runoff rate control.
(1) Exemptions.
(a) Any site where the increase in postdevelopment peak runoff
rates is determined to be negligible by the Municipal Engineer
is exempt from the requirement to provide stormwater
detention.
136. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 147-14 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:325
[1] In support of this exemption, it must be shown that the
downstream conveyance systems have adequate capacity
to convey the additional discharge without adversely
affecting downstream properties. This does not exempt the
requirement for implementation of designs for water
quality, stormwater conveyance, and/or recharge as
required. A stormwater management plan and report
documenting these design elements is also required. The
Municipal Engineer shall use a five-percent increase as a
general benchmark for defining "negligible." The final
definition of "negligible" shall be at the Municipal
Engineer's discretion.
[2] Prior to using this exemption (and prior to any land
development plan submission), the design engineer must
provide written documentation and computations as to
why no peak runoff control should be required. The
Municipal Engineer has the right to reject any plan which
uses this assumption without prior approval of the
Municipal Engineer. The intent of this exemption is to
eliminate the need for multiple or "piggyback" detention
facilities as a result of minor changes in imperviousness or
land use upstream of existing stormwater control facilities.
(b) Small sites (less than one acre) located directly adjacent to the
main stem of creeks or within the floodplain are not required to
provide stormwater detention unless directed to do so by the
Municipal Engineer as a result of a documented drainage
problem. All other stormwater management standards must be
implemented, including water quality, adequate stormwater
conveyance, and/or recharge as required.
(2) Stormwater management analysis must be performed using the
following models. The size criteria are based on drainage area size
including site are and all off-site area draining across the
development.
Up to 100 acres in size NRCS's TR-55 or TR-20
Over 100 acres in size NRCS's TR-20 or HEC-1 (HECHMS)
(a) The modified rational method using the Gert Aron Curves may
be used for any site less than or equal to two acres in size
without prior authorization from the Municipal Engineer. The
modified rational method may also be used for sites between
two and five acres in size where the Municipal Engineer has
approved the method's use. In this case the design engineer
must make a written request to the Municipal Engineer
explaining why the use of the modified rational method is more
appropriate than the NRCS's methods for the site in question.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:326
The design engineer should keep in mind that the modified
rational methodology was not calibrated to account for the
karst nature of the Spring Creek Drainage Basin, and,
therefore, its use should be limited to the special cases
identified above. In addition, since the minimum discharge
criteria are based on a calibration of the NRCS runoff mode,
their use is not appropriate if the modified rational method is
used for runoff computations.
(b) The Municipal Engineer has the right to reject any SWM
design that uses hydrograph combinations with the modified
rational method where the designer has not validated that the
effects of the timing differences are negligible. In addition, the
Municipal Engineer has the right to reject any SWM design
that improperly uses the method for determining runoff
volumes or does not properly apply the method.
(c) More intensive physically based models may be used at the
discretion of the Municipal Engineer, but only for sites greater
than 100 acres in size.
(d) Commercial software packages that use the basic
computational methods of TR-55 or TR-20 are permitted.
(e) The NRCS models and methods recommended above are based
on data collected from actual watersheds. In contrast to this,
stormwater management analysis for land development
activities is often conducted using property lines to define
drainage boundaries. Drainage areas based on property
boundaries are not true watersheds and are referred to here as
"hypothetical" drainage areas. It is known that these
hypothetical drainage areas do not respond like natural
watersheds. Peak runoff rates from hypothetical drainage
areas are much smaller than comparable runoff rates from
natural watersheds of the same size. Therefore, wherever
possible, pre- and post-development stormwater analysis
should be conducted for watersheds that are as nearly natural
as possible. Also, conducting stormwater analysis for a lot-bylot
comparison, as such as within residential developments, is
not permitted. Partitioning drainage areas into different
subwatersheds for the postdevelopment scenarios is
acceptable.
(f) It is noted that natural watershed boundaries should not be
used where the relative size of the watershed compared to the
site size would inappropriately distort the pre-to postdevelopment
runoff comparison. In these cases, a hypothetical
drainage area defined by the property boundary should be
used because it will allow for a better estimate of runoff
changes directly downstream of the site. In addition, the
designer should recognize that, within the Spring Creek
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:327
Watershed, typical hypothetical drainage areas, in their
predevelopment or natural condition, do not produce surface
runoff during minor to moderate rainfall events. Available
hydrologic models do not accurately reflect this condition. This
often results in postdevelopment nuisance flooding since the
models overestimate the predevelopment runoff magnitude.
(3) Natural drainage divides may not be altered without the prior
consent of the Municipal Engineer.
(4) Pre- and post-development stormwater management analysis shall
be conducted using the following design storms: one-year; twoyear;
ten-year; one-hundred-year.
(5) The twenty-four-hour precipitation depths as obtained from NOAA
Atlas 14 shall be used for stormwater management analysis.
(6) The NRCS's Type II precipitation distribution is required for all
stormwater management analyses.
(7) The NRCS' dimensionless unit hydrograph "k" factor shall be 484
for both pre- and post-development stormwater analyses.
(8) All undeveloped areas are to be modeled as meadow or woods in
good hydrologic condition. Existing impervious areas may be
modeled as being impervious for predevelopment conditions. The
municipality may require a percentage of the existing impervious
(up to a 20% maximum) be modeled as meadow in areas where
there are known existing stormwater concerns downstream of the
project area or where the site being developed has either deficient
or non-existing stormwater management facilities. Developers of
sites with existing impervious are highly encouraged to set up a
meeting with the municipality prior to design so that any additional
requirements are identified prior to plan submission.
(9) The NRCS's curve number (CN) shall be used as the rainfall to
runoff transformation parameter for all stormwater management
analyses.
(10) Curve numbers should be rounded to tenths for use in prepackaged
hydrologic models. It should be recognized that the CN is only a
design tool with a large degree of statistical variability. For large
sites, CNs should be rounded to the nearest whole number.
(11) The NRCS's method to determine unconnected impervious area
adjustments for CN can be used for distinctly defined impervious
land areas that flow onto pervious areas in a dispersed manner. The
method may only be used to calculate runoff from site impervious
areas that actually flow across pervious areas. The method cannot
be applied to the entire site using average weighted CN values.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:328
(12) Soils underlain by carbonate geology (limestone or dolomite) shall
have a hydrologic soil group (HSG) B used for both pre- and postdevelopment
conditions regardless of the NRCS or soil survey's
description, except for the following two conditions:
(a) Compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of HSG C
for post development conditions regardless of the NRCS or soil
survey's description. For most developments, compacted
structural fill areas are under impervious surfaces, but may
include islands within parking areas, fringe land, etc. A HSG C
shall also be applied to large projects that clear and compact
building pad areas for later phases of development under an
initial phase. The Municipal Engineer shall make the final
determination as to what areas of a land development site
constitute compacted structural fill. The intent is to account for
large compacted areas and not minor grading within lawn
areas.
(b) Soils identified as "on floodplains" or "on terraces above
floodplains" in the Centre County Soil Survey will use the HSG
as designated in the soil survey. Refer to Appendix A, Table A-8,
for a list of the soils.137
(13) Soils not underlain by carbonate geology shall use the HSG as
specified by the NRCS or soil survey's description, except for the
following two conditions:
(a) Wooded areas on HSG C and D soils shall be treated as HSG B
for predevelopment conditions. Disturbed postdevelopment
wooded areas shall carry the NRCS or soil survey's defined
HSG with a minimum HSG of B.
(b) Highly compacted structural fill areas shall use a minimum of
HSG C for postdevelopment conditions regardless of the NRCS
or soil survey's description. For most developments these areas
are normally covered with impervious surfaces, but may
include islands within parking areas, fringe lands, etc. A HSG
of C shall also be used for large projects that clear and grade
land for later phases of development. The Municipal Engineer
shall make the final determination as to what areas of a land
development site constitute compacted structural fill. The
intent is to account for large compacted areas and not minor
grading within lawn areas or small areas around buildings, etc.
(14) Areas draining to closed depressions must be modeled by removing
the storage volume from the predevelopment condition. The
designer may assume that infiltration in the closed depression does
not occur during a design runoff event. Areas draining to closed
depressions may also be used to adjust peak runoff rates to
137. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:329
stormwater management ponds for the postdevelopment analysis.
This allowance has been developed to entice designers to
intentionally design or leave in place small closed depressions
that can reduce the total volume required from a stormwater
management pond. The site designer is responsible to document
downstream impacts if the closed depression were removed.
(15) Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes shall be excluded from the
modeled point-of-interest drainage areas defining predevelopment
peak flows. Assumptions that sinkholes spill over during some
storm events must be supported by acceptable documentation (as
determined by the Municipal Engineer). In addition, the design
professional must be aware that bypassing or sealing sinkholes will
frequently result in downstream flooding and should not be done if
existing downstream flooding already occurs. The site designer is
responsible to document downstream impacts if the sinkhole were
to stop taking stormwater runoff.
(16) Ponds or other permanent pools of water are to be modeled by the
methods established in the NRCS's TR-55 manual (1986). However,
more rigorous documented methods are acceptable (with approval
of the Municipal Engineer).
(17) The NRCS antecedent runoff condition II (ARC II, previously AMC
II) must be used for all simulations. The use of continuous
simulation models that vary the ARC are not permitted for
stormwater management purposes. In addition, prior to any
continuous simulation model being used in the spring Creek Basin
for any other purposes, the model unit hydrograph must be
modified for common events in additional to extreme events based
on in-depth analysis of historical data from the basin.
(18) The following time of concentration (Tc) computational
methodologies shall be used unless another method is preapproved
by the Municipal Engineer.
(a) Predevelopment: NRCS's Lag Equation.
(b) Postdevelopment; commercial, industrial, or other areas with
large impervious areas: (greater than 20% impervious area):
NRCS's Segmental Method.
(c) Postdevelopment; residential, cluster, or other low-impact
designs less than or equal to 20% impervious area: NCRS's Lag
Equation.
The time of concentration is to represent the average condition
that best reflects the hydrologic response of the area. For
example, large impervious areas bordered by small pervious
areas may not consider the effect of the pervious areas in the
Tc computation. If the designer wants to consider the effect
of the pervious area, runoff from the pervious and impervious
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:330
areas must be computed separately with the hydrographs
being combined to determine the total runoff from the area.
Under no circumstance will the postdevelopment Tc be greater
than the predevelopment Tc for any watershed or
subwatershed modeling purposes. This includes when the
designer has specifically used swales to reduce flow velocities.
In the event that the designer believes that the postdeveloment
Tc is greater, it will still be set by default equal to the
predevelopment Tc for modeling purposes.
Refer to § 147-15A(28) regarding impervious area flashing
(IAF).
(19) The following postdevelopment minimum discharges are permitted
for use with the NRCS (CN) runoff model:
1-year return period Qpmin = 0.018 (DA) + 0.2
2-year return period Qpmin = 0.03 (DA) + 0.4
10-year return period Qpmin = 0.09 (DA) + 1.0
Where: DA = the drainage area in acres
Qpmin = minimum allowable peak
runoff rate in cfs
(a) For return periods greater than 10 years, the minimum
discharge shall be equal to the computed predevelopment peak
runoff rate.
(b) The minimum discharge criteria above are not appropriate for
use with the rational method. This is because these values
were developed based on NRCS model corrections and do not
actually represent a true physical process or discharge.
However, common sense should be used by both the designer
and reviewer in the evaluation of acceptable minimum
discharges for use with the rational method.
(c) The intent of the minimum discharge is to allow reasonable
runoff release from a site when a hydrologic model has
produced a predevelopment runoff rate close to zero. The
method is NOT permitted for areas that previously drained
completely into sinkholes in order to bypass the sinkhole after
development.
(d) These minimum discharge values include the total of all
stormwater management facilities discharges and undetained
area discharges. Peak runoff rates for undetained fringe areas
(where the designer has made a realistic effort to control all
new impervious areas) will be computed using the
predevelopment time of concentration for the drainage areas
tributary to them. Undetained areas are those portions of the
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:331
site that cannot be routed to a stormwater management facility
due to topography and typically include lower pond berms or
small areas around entrance drives. The site drainage areas
used shall represent the predevelopment condition, even if
drainage areas are altered following development.
(20) All lined stormwater management ponds in carbonate and
noncarbonated areas must be considered impervious and may not
be used as pervious areas for stormwater management
computations. "Lined" here means lined with synthetic liners or
bentonite. All other compacted soil liners will be considered to be
HSG D for hydrologic computations.
(21) Stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the
purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume a
negligible discharge from these structures during design event
routing. Only discharges from the primary principal spillway or
emergency spillway need to be considered. Discharges from
subsurface drains that tie into a principal spillway should not be
considered during design event routing. All subsurface drains may
be required to be equipped with a restrictor plate with a one-inch
opening in order to prevent the subsurface drain from functioning
as a primary orifice. Consultation between the Township Engineer
and Design Engineer shall take place to determine the feasibility of
the application.
(22) Stormwater management ponds that have a capture depth for the
purposes of water quality or volume capture shall assume that the
pond water quality or capture volume is full at the beginning of
design event routing.
(23) Stormwater management ponds must provide safe passage of the
one-hundred-year return period peak runoff rate assuming that all
of the principal spillway orifices are fully clogged and the principal
spillway overflow is 50% clogged. A minimum of a six-inch
freeboard must also be maintained above the resulting maximum
water surface elevations. Any embankment emergency spillway can
be assumed to be unclogged. SWM ponds with embankments
completely made up of natural undisturbed soils (fully in "cut") or
where roadways act as the emergency spillway are permitted.
However, the design engineer must verify downstream stability and
control.
(24) All pre- and post-development comparisons of peak flows shall be
rounded to tenths of a cfs. The intent here is to recognize the
accuracy and precision limitations of hydrologic modeling
procedures. Again, small differences between pre- and postdevelopment
discharge rates should be permitted when no
negative downstream impacts will result.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:332
(25) The full Modified Puls routing method must be used for stormwater
management pond analyses. Simplified methods of determining
pond size requirements such as those in TR-55 (1986) can only be
used for preliminary pond size estimates.
(26) Prepackaged hydraulic programs are not approved for the analysis
of underground stormwater management facilities unless it can be
verified that the program rounding subroutines used for the stage/
storage data do not affect the results. This is because, for very
small storage volumes, the program may round off the volume to a
significant percentage.
(27) Full supporting documentation must be provided for all stormwater
management designs.
(28) Designs must be checked for impervious area flash (IAF). This
check is used to determine if flooding may occur due to poor
modeling choices specifically related to the time-of-concentration.
This analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be
modeled without the pervious areas. The time-of-concentration
should also be determined from the impervious areas only. If the
IAF analysis results in a higher peak runoff rate at a culvert or
discharge from a pond, this higher rate must be used for the final
design/comparison. The check will frequently yield higher values if
a watershed's impervious area is located primarily near the
watershed outlet or point of interest.
B. Pond capture volumes (Cv). Intent: To minimize nuisance flooding from
small precipitation events, a runoff capture volume is required for all
stormwater management ponds that do not discharge directly to
natural, well-defined (with bed and banks) perennial streams. In
general, natural well-defined streams in the Spring Creek Basin are
limited to those delineated as USGS perennial streams. This should be
treated as a guideline and not a steadfast rule. The final determination
is at the discretion of the Municipal Engineer. The pond capture volume
is a volume of runoff that will be retained in a pond below the elevation
of any free surface principal spillway orifice. No principal spillway
orifice (except those connected to subsurface drains), regardless of how
small, shall be below the pond elevation equivalent to this volume. The
Centre County Conservation District (CCCD) receives numerous
complaints regarding ponds that are located at the downslope edge of a
property that result in discharging runoff onto downstream properties
in an uncontrolled manner or where no existing defined outlet channel
exists. This is a very common problem in areas underlain by carbonate
rock. These discharges can cause erosion and flooding downstream.
While the pond capture volume is intended to minimize some of these
negative effects, it cannot deter or reduce the impacts form poor design
practices. Therefore, whenever possible, the CCCD recommends that
the designer consider the downstream morphological changes that may
occur and, when possible, consider constructing conveyance systems to
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:333
a stable natural channel. In some chases this may require cooperation
between landowners.
(1) The capture of volume is defined as a runoff depth of 0.25 inches
from all impervious areas tributary to the stormwater management
facility. This volume will be allowed to infiltrate, evaporate, or
dewater from a subsurface drain system connected directly to the
facility's principal spillway. Supporting computations that show
that 90% of the capture volume can dewater in a maximum of 72
hours must be provided. For surface ponds, the maximum depth of
ponding for the capture volume shall be three feet (a health and
safety precaution). However, in areas under karst influence, a
limiting maximum ponding depth of 18 inches is recommended.
Designers may always increase the capture volume to a value
greater than the minimum required as long as the maximum
ponding depth criteria is met.
(2) To simplify computational requirements for design event analysis,
designers do not need to calculate discharges from subsurface
drains related to the capture volumes if the filter media is sand, or
smaller than AASHTO 57 stone. The capture volume is to control
runoff rates from impervious areas and is not related to water
quality. However, pond designs that include a water quality volume
that is greater than the required capture volume are assumed to
have also met the required capture volume as long as it dewaters as
required.
(3) Designs that rely on the natural infiltration of in-situ soils must
provide documentation supporting the infiltration rates used for
analysis. Infiltration rates reported in the Soil Survey of Centre
County or other published rates may be used at the discretion of
the Municipal Engineer.
(4) The pond capture volume shall always be used when upslope areas
are developed where the pond's design creates a point discharge
that did not previously existing.
(5) Stormwater management detention facilities that connect directly
to storm drain pipe networks that discharge to natural well-defined
channels do not require a capture volume.
C. Recharge volumes (Rv). Intent: The purpose of the recharge portion of
the chapter is two-fold. First, the recharge requirement is to mitigate
the loss of groundwater recharge associated with the creation of
impervious surfaces. In addition, the recharge criteria is to mitigate the
increase in runoff volume associated with the creation of impervious
surfaces. This increase in runoff volume has significant impacts on
downstream landowners. These impacts are most often exhibited in the
form of increased nuisance flooding and channel or drainageway
erosion and instability. According to local municipal engineers and
representatives of the Centre County Conservation District, these
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:334
problems are of significant local concern. The magnitude of these
problems increases with the percentage of impervious coverage
created on a site.
(1) Recharge mitigation shall be provided for runoff from all proposed
impervious areas. The required recharge volume shall be computed
as 0.5 inches of runoff from all proposed impervious areas. It is
noted that lined detention ponds and compacted fill areas are
considered to be impervious when calculating site impervious area
for recharge considerations. In addition, land areas covered by
paver blocks, pervious pavement, and other structural surface
treatments which permit surface infiltration can be treated as
pervious areas when calculating the site impervious area for
recharge considerations as long as the structural infiltration
practice is supported by sound design and appropriate construction
specifications. The Municipal Engineer may require submission of
supporting documentation prior to approving structural infiltration
areas as pervious areas.
(2) The following design practices can be used as credits to reduce the
recharge volume requirement:
(a) Residential roof areas (detached, duplex, and townhome
dwellings) and commercial/industrial buildings with roof areas
less than 5,000 square feet can be removed from the computed
impervious area when these roof areas are sumped to dry wells
designed in accordance with the following minimum standard.
[1] Sump design criteria: To meet the recharge criteria, sump
storage or voids volume shall be equal to 0.04 cubic feet
per square foot of room area (0.5 inch rainfall depth). If
sump stone has a voids ratio of 40%, the total sump volume
will be 0.10 cubic feet per square foot of roof area. When
designed only to meet this recharge criteria, the maximum
size for a single sump is 100 cubic feet, and the minimum
sump surface area (A) to depth (D) ratio (A/D) must be a
minimum of 4/1. The sump depth less any freeboard should
not exceed 24 inches.
[2] Additional criteria for residential roof sumps are included
in § 147-18G.
(b) All or portions of driveways, roadways, and parking areas can
be removed from the impervious area calculation when sheet
flow from these areas is directed to undisturbed natural buffer/
filter areas or constructed filter strips. This flow must be
dispersed as sheet flow as it crosses the buffer/filter area.
Sheet flow velocities should be nonerosive as they cross the
impervious area/filter interface. If erosion occurs on the buffer/
filter area, velocity control measures shall be installed at the
interface.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:335
[1] To ensure proper infiltration characteristics, the natural
soil profile within natural buffer/filter areas cannot be
disturbed during construction. Completely undisturbed
natural recharge areas serve this function best. However,
minor surface scarring and landscaping is permitted in
these areas as long as natural grades are not altered. In
special cases, when approved by the Municipal Engineer,
minor grading, combined with soil profile reconstruction
may be permitted in natural buffer/filter areas. In addition,
the following standards apply to natural filter/buffer areas:
[a] Natural filter/buffer areas must have a minimum width
of five feet or 1/2 of the impervious area drainage
length immediately tributary to the buffer area,
whichever is greater. This width is measured parallel
to the direction of sheet flow.
[b] To quality for a recharge volume credit, the surface
slope of natural filter/buffer areas must be conducive
to recharge, and not result in flow concentration or
erosion. To meet this intent, the surface slope of the
area tributary to the natural buffer/filter area, and the
surface slope of the natural buffer/filter area itself
may not exceed 5%. In special cases, steeper slopes
may be used if specifically authorized by the
Municipal Engineer.
[c] The total impervious area tributary to a natural buffer/
filter area cannot exceed twice the buffer/filter area.
[2] To qualify for a recharge volume credit, constructed filter
strips shall be designed to the following standards:
[a] The minimum filter strip width shall be five feet or 1/2
of the impervious area drainage length immediately
tributary to the constructed filter strip, whichever is
greater. This width is measured parallel to the
direction of sheet flow.
[b] The total impervious area tributary to a constructed
filter strip area cannot exceed twice the constructed
filter strip area.
[c] The surface slope of the area tributary to the
constructed filter strip area and the surface slope of
the constructed filter strip area itself may not exceed
5% and 3%, respectively. In special cases, steeper
slopes may be used if specifically authorized by the
Municipal Engineer.
[d] The filter strip surface shall consist of a minimum of
six inches of natural or reconstructed topsoil and with
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:336
a stable grass surface treatment. Reconstructed
topsoil designs must be approved by the Municipal
Engineer prior to application. Reconstructed topsoil
consists of soils augmented by tillage and the addition
of soil amendments such as compost, lime, animal
manures, crop residues, etc.
[e] To minimize erosion of the topsoil layer during
construction, it is recommended that these areas be
sodded. However, the Municipal Engineer may permit
the use of an acceptable erosion control seeding
application. In this later case, any loss of topsoil and
seed must be replaced until a permanent vegetative
stand is achieved.
(c) Sidewalks separated from roadways and/or other impervious
surfaces by a grass strip of equal or greater width than the
sidewalk itself can be removed from the impervious area
calculation when the sidewalks are graded so that sheet flow
from the walk is directed to the grass strip. Sidewalks with
steep longitudinal slopes that themselves would act as
channels during runoff events cannot take advantage of this
credit. A five-percent longitudinal sidewalk slope shall be used
as the benchmark defining steep slopes.
(d) Impervious areas tributary to natural closed depressions can
be subtracted from the total site impervious area used in the
recharge volume calculation as long as a qualified geotechnical
engineer or soil scientist certifies to the soundness of these
site-specific applications. Water quality pretreatment may be
necessary prior to the direct discharge of runoff to existing
closed depressions or sinkholes.
(e) Impervious areas tributary to man-made closed depressions
can be subtracted from the total site impervious area as long as
a qualified geotechnical engineer or soil scientist certifies to
the soundness of these site-specific applications. Man-made
closed depressions can be created through the use of low head
berms one foot or less in height.
(f) Fifty percent of the capture volume in a pond that includes a
subsurface drain may be credited towards the recharge volume
requirement. For sites less than one acre, a waiver will need to
be obtained.
(g) Additional credits may apply for undisturbed land areas that
are known to have high infiltration capacity and that are
maintained or enhanced. These areas must be defined and
quantified from actual site data.
(3) After credits, the remaining recharge volume shall be directed to a
recharge BMP such as infiltration trenches, beds, etc. These
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:337
facilities can be located in open areas or under pavement
structures. The appropriateness of the particular infiltration
practice proposed, as well as the design parameters used, shall
be supported by a geotechnical report certified by a qualified
professional (soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, geotechnical
engineer).
(a) Stormwater recharge requirements or credits affect
stormwater management design requirements. For stormwater
management computations, the reduction of site CNs based
only on a weighting type analysis, as is sometimes done for
cluster-type developments, is not permitted. However, for
stormwater management purposes, the CN for recharged
areas can be computed using the NRCS method for
disconnected impervious areas. The actual hydrologic process
that occurs within the basin must be stressed in all recharge
situations.
(b) These recharge requirements must be met on all sites unless it
can be demonstrated that recharge would be inappropriate.
Any request for such a waiver from these recharge
requirements must be accompanied by a supporting report
certified by a qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist,
hydrogeologist, geotechnical engineer).
(c) Developers and site design professionals are encouraged to
use a higher standard for recharge volume on sites where local
site conditions do not restrict a higher standard.
(d) Water quality sensitive (WQS) developments must use an
acceptable pretreatment BMP prior to recharge. Acceptable
pretreated BMPs for these developments include BMPs that
are based on filtering, settling, or chemical reaction processes
such as chemical coagulation.
(e) Accounting for recharge within lined stormwater management
ponds is not permitted. However, if unlined, uncompacted
ponds and/or depressed lawn areas are used to satisfy water
quality or capture volume criteria, these areas and volumes
can also be used to meet recharge requirements as previously
defined. Additional recharge volume may be credited to these
areas as long as it is demonstrated by a qualified professional
that recharge processes can naturally occur in these areas.
(f) Finally, because this analysis is concerned with trying to
adequately represent real processes that occur within the
watershed, there will be areas that cannot physically recharge
stormwater. These areas include exfiltration areas that are
commonly found at the base of wooded hillsides where clay
pans exist and saturation areas near major streams or
floodplains. These areas may not accept recharge during most
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:338
runoff events. These areas are exempt from recharge
requirements when these conditions are documented and
certified by a qualified professional (soil scientist, geologist,
hydrogeologist, or geotechnical engineer). In addition,
stormwater management techniques relying on infiltration
techniques are not permitted in these areas.
(4) The Municipal Engineer may waive the recharge requirement in
the following situations:
(a) In highly developed areas or areas undergoing redevelopment
where the Municipal Engineer has determined that forced
recharge could have adverse impacts on adjacent landowner
structures, property, or municipal infrastructure. These
waivers should be limited to small land areas (generally less
than five acres in size) where the ability to place recharge beds
may be limited or may hinder redevelopment.
(b) In areas where a qualified soils scientist or geologist has
determined that none of the site soils are suitable for recharge
or that the location of the suitable soils is such that harm to
adjoining properties could occur as stated under Subsection
C(4)(a) above.
(c) In areas where recharge cannot physically occur as
documented by a qualified soil scientist, geologist, or
hydrologist. These areas include:
[1] Exfiltration areas commonly found at the base of wooded
hillsides where clay pans or fragipans exist; and
[2] Saturation areas near major streams or floodplains.
(5) As identified above, recharge analysis and/or waiver requests must
be supported by a geotechnical report sealed by a qualified
professional (nine soil scientist, geologist, hydrogeologist, or
geotechnical engineer). The intent of this report will be to establish
the suitability of a particular parcel of land or area for recharge and
to identify areas on a development site appropriate for recharge. It
is recommended that the geotechnical/soils consultant discuss the
extent and approach to the analysis with the Municipal Engineer
prior to initiating the field investigation. At a minimum this report
shall include the following information:
(a) A description of the geotechnical site investigation performed,
including the methods and procedures used.
(b) Data presentation.
(c) Analysis results including the following information:
[1] A map identifying site areas inappropriate for recharge
along with supporting justification. In addition to
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:339
illustrating topographic features, significant geologic and
hydrologic features should be identified (rock outcrops,
sinkholes, closed depressions, etc.).
[2] Determination of the permeability coefficient for potential
recharge areas.
[3] Determination of the infiltration capacity of natural site
soils.
[4] Location, depth, and permeability coefficient for any
restrictive layers identified.
[5] Soil uniformity.
[6] Depth to bedrock in potential recharge areas, and a
statement reflecting the uniformity of the depth to bedrock
across the site.
[7] A statement relating to the site's proximity to fracture
zones within the bedrock.
[8] Additional information deemed pertinent by the
geotechnical engineer.
(d) Recommendations for any special design considerations
necessary for the design of recharge systems on the site. For
example, required soil depth over bedrock, appropriate surface
grades over recharge areas, appropriate hydraulic head over
recharge areas, etc.
(e) Justification as to why the site should be developed to a high
impervious density if the site has adverse soil and geotechnical
limitations which prohibit the ability to induce natural
recharge. Explain how these limitations will not create the
potential for undue harm to the environment and the Spring
Creek Watershed when the site is developed.
(6) Where it has been shown that recharge cannot be performed and a
waiver of the recharge requirements is being requested, the
municipality shall require that the first one inch of runoff from all
new impervious areas be treated through underdrained facilities.
These facilities may include underdrained basins, rain gardens, and
infiltration trenches. Treatment is to include use of amended
topsoil to provide filtration of the stormwater. All underdrain
outlets are to include a restrictor plate to prevent the underdrain
system from functioning as a primary outlet.
(7) The following guidelines are provided relative to the use of
subsurface exfiltration BMPs (often referred to as engineered
infiltration BMPs):
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:340
(a) Soils should have a minimum percolation rate of 50 min/cm
(0.47 in/hr) for effective operation of subsurface exfiltration
BMPs. If no site soils have percolation rates of 50 min/cm,
subsurface exfiltration BMPs should not be used.
(b) A minimum of 30 inches of soil must be maintained between
the bottom of a subsurface exfiltration BMP and the top of
bedrock or seasonally high groundwater table. The separation
requirement shall be increased if recommended by a qualified
professional.
(c) If the minimum percolation rate is not met and/or the minimum
soil depth cannot be maintained on a site, recharge should be
accommodated by directing shallow sheet flow from
impervious areas across surface filter strips and/or
undisturbed natural areas, or some other innovative surface
infiltration feature should be used. Limiting subsurface
percolation rates and/or depth to bedrock shall not by
themselves warrant a recharge waiver.
(8) In addition, since recharge is intended as a volume control,
innovative or new methods that address the significant increase in
the volume of runoff from sites having large impervious areas are
encouraged. These volume-control alternatives can be used only if
they can be shown to function with the original intent through
sound engineering and science. The final determination of "original
intent" shall always be the responsibility of the Municipal Engineer.
D. Storm drain conveyance system design. Storm drainage conveyance
systems consist of storm sewer pipes, swales, and open channels.
Computational methods for design of storm drain conveyance systems
shall be as follows:
(1) Recommended computational methods (models) for storm drain
design are based on site or watershed drainage area as follows:
Up to 200 acres in size Rational Method
Between 200 acres and 1.5
square miles
HEC-1
PSRM
TR-20
Over 1.5 square miles in size PSU-IV with the carbonate
adjustment factor at the
discretion of the Municipal
Engineer
Other methods as approved by the Municipal Engineer, such as
SWMM, SWIRM-ROUTE, etc.
(2) Rational coefficients used are to be from Rawls et al. (1981), PA
DOT Design Manual 2-10 or using the Aron curves (Appendix A,138
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:341
Table A-3) to convert CNs to C. If the Aron curves are used, all CNs
must be applicable to the HSG as identified by the NRCS.
(a) The design engineer may choose to use the following Rational
C coefficients without regard to soil HSG for small sites.
However, it is recommended that they be used for storm drains
up to 24 inches in diameter. The use of these conservative
values shall fully be the choice of the design engineer.
All impervious areas: C = 0.95
All pervious areas: C = 0.30
(3) Storm drains shall be designed at a minimum using a ten-year
runoff event without surcharging inlets. Storm drains tributary to a
multiple site SWM facility within a public right-of-way across
municipal roads or crossing other properties must convey, at a
minimum, a twenty-five-year runoff event without surcharging
inlets. Runoff events in excess of the indicated design event must
be conveyed safely downstream.
(4) Inlets on grade cannot assume a sumped condition for hydraulic
modeling (i.e., top of inlet casting set below pavement surface in
parking areas).
(5) The Municipal Engineer may require the analysis of the onehundred-
year peak runoff rates for conveyance purpose in some
instances where regional SWM facilities are employed.
(6) Any storm drain within state or federal rights-of-way or that falls
under the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to the minimum
requirements of this chapter.
(7) The time of concentration (Tc) can be computed by any method
which best represents the subject watershed. However, the NRCS's
segmental method is not recommended for use with drainage areas
that are predominately undeveloped and are greater than 100
acres in size. The NRCS Lag Equation or another more appropriate
method should be used under these conditions.
(8) For any drainage area smaller than five acres in size a Tc of five
minutes may always be assumed at the discretion of the Design
Engineer (for the postdevelopment condition), without needing to
provide supporting documentation.
(9) Precipitation values applicable to the entire Spring Creek Drainage
Basin are those reflected in the PA DOT's IDF curves for Region 2,
regardless if the area was formerly considered in Region 3.
138. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:342
(10) Storm drain conveyance systems stability (swales, open channels,
and pipe discharge aprons) shall be computed using a ten-year
return period peak runoff rate.
(11) Storm sewers, where required by zoning and land use densities,
shall be placed under or immediately adjacent to the roadway site
of the curb, or as directed by the municipality, when parallel to the
street within the right-of-way. Storm sewers that cross under
roadways should be of the combined storm sewer/underdrain type
to permit drainage to the roadway subbase.
(12) When located outside a public right-of-way, they shall be placed
within a drainage easement not less than 20 feet wide as approved
by the Municipal Engineer.
(13) The use of properly designed, graded and turfed drainage swales is
encouraged in lieu of storm sewers in commercial and industrial
areas and, where approved by the Municipal Engineer, in
residential areas. Such swales shall be designed not only to carry
the required discharge without excessive erosion but also to
increase the time of concentration, reduce the peak discharge and
velocity, and permit the water to percolate into the soil, where
appropriate.
(14) Inlet types and inlet assemblies shall conform to the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Standards for Roadway
Construction, Publication 408, as approved by the Municipal
Engineer.
(a) Inlets shall, at a minimum, be located at the lowest point of
street intersections to intercept the stormwater before it
reaches pedestrian crossings or at sag points of vertical curves
in the street alignment which provide a natural point of
ponding of surface stormwater.
(b) Curb inlets on dedicated bicycle lanes shall use only a throat
opening.
(c) Where the municipality deems it necessary because of special
land requirements, special inlets may be approved.
(d) The interval between inlets collecting stormwater runoff shall
be determined in accordance with Pa DOT Design Manual
(DM-2), Chapter 10, Section 5, "Capacity of Waterway Areas."
In curbed sections, the maximum encroachment of water on
the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a through-traffic
lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during the ten-year
design storm of five-minute duration. Inlets shall be provided
to control the encroachment of water on the pavement. When
inlets are used in a storm system within the right-of-way limits
of a street in lieu of manholes, the spacing of such inlets shall
not exceed the maximum distance of 450 feet.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:343
(15) Accessible drainage structures shall be located on a continuous
storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations
where a transition in storm sewer pipe sizing is required, at all
vertical and horizontal angle points exceeding 5°, and at all points
of convergence of two or more influent storm sewer mains. The
construction locations of accessible drainage structures shall be as
indicated on the land development drainage plan or area drainage
plan approved by the municipality.
(16) When evidence availability to the municipality indicates that
existing storm sewers have sufficient capacity as determined by
hydrograph summation and are accessible, the developer may
connect their stormwater facilities to the existing storm sewers so
long as the peak rate of discharge does not exceed the amount
permitted by this chapter.
(17) Design criteria for swales and culverts.
(a) Drainage swales.
[1] The maximum velocity as determined by Manning's
equation shall not exceed the allowable velocity for
specific types of vegetative material as specified in
Appendix A,139 Table A-7. Inlets shall be provided to
control the shoulder encroachment and water velocity.
[2] The side slope for any vegetated drainage channel
requiring mowing of the vegetation shall have a maximum
grade of three horizontal to one vertical on those areas to
be mowed.
[3] Erosion prevention. All drainage swales shall be designed
to prevent the erosion of the bed and bank areas. Suitable
stabilization during vegetative cover establishment shall
be provided to prevent erosion.
[4] All storm sewers or drainage swales shall discharge to a
detention or retention basin for the control of peak runoff
discharge except as provided in the plan.
[5] A minimum grade of 1% shall be maintained for all swales.
[6] Design standard. Because of the critical nature of
vegetated drainage channels, the design of all vegetated
channels shall, as a minimum, conform to the design
procedures outlined in the Centre-Clinton County
Conservation District Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook.
(b) Culverts.
139. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:344
[1] Culvert design and construction shall be done in
accordance with PA DOT specifications, except where
more stringent requirements are noted within this chapter.
[2] Minimum grade and size. All storm drain culvert pipes
shall be designed to maintain a minimum grade of 1/2%.
All storm pipes shall have a minimum inside diameter of 15
inches or a cross-sectional area of 176 square inches,
except that pipes under a twenty-five-foot or greater fill
shall not be less than 24 inches or a cross-sectional area of
453 square inches and shall consist of reinforced concrete.
[3] Corrugated metal pipe shall be at least sixteen-gauge
thickness. Smooth plastic pipe used for storm sewers shall
be SDR-35 or stronger. Corrugated plastic pipe must meet
PA DOT strength specifications.
[4] Where storm sewers discharge into existing drainage
channels at an angle greater than 30° from parallel with
the downstream channel flow, the far side bank shall be
stabilized by the use of rip-rap or masonry and/or concrete
walls. The stabilization shall be designed to prevent
erosion and frost heave under and behind the stabilizing
media.
(18) Computational procedures other than those indicated here should
follow the methods of the Federal Highway Administration's Urban
Drainage Design Manual [Hydraulic Engineering circular No. 22
(HEC-22)].
(19) The minimum diameter for pipe under driveways is 15 inches.
E. Water quality standards.
(1) Water quality performance standards. To minimize adverse impacts
to stream health resulting from stormwater nonpoint source (NPS)
pollution, standards are provided for the implementation of water
quality best management practices (BMPs) to reduce nonpoint
source pollutant loadings resulting from land development
activities. The following performance standards and guidelines
shall be addressed at all sites where stormwater management is
required.
(a) Site designs shall minimize the generation of stormwater
runoff through the use of low-impact design techniques.
(b) Stormwater runoff from all land development activities should
be treated through the use of nonstructural and structural
BMPs to effectively treat the adverse impacts of stormwater
runoff including NPS pollutants.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:345
(c) Water quality BMPs shall be incorporated into site designs to
treat the required water quality volume as determined below.
(d) The use of nonstructural BMPs shall always take priority over
the use of structural BMPs. The use of innovative BMPs and
low-impact site planning is encouraged to reduce the
generation of stormwater runoff and effectively treat
pollutants transported in stormwater from the site.
(e) The use of multiple nonstructural water quality techniques
along with new, emerging, and innovative techniques is
encouraged to improve the quality of stormwater runoff to
receiving areas and reduce and/or eliminate the need for
structural BMPs. The Municipal Engineer should be consulted
to clarify the design concept for meeting or exceeding the
intent of this section.
(f) Where nonstructural BMPs are unable to effectively treat all of
the stormwater runoff generated from land development
activities, structural BMPs shall be designed to capture and
treat the computed water quality volume (WQv).
(g) The priority pollutant source areas to be treated with BMPs are
streets, parking lots, driveways, and roof areas.
(h) Due to the karst nature of the watershed, stormwater
discharges from water quality sensitive developments and
discharges to sensitive wellhead protection areas (identified in
Appendix B,140 Exhibit 1) will require special consideration. In
these instances, the developer shall provide water quality
pretreatment (use of a filtering BMP and/or special structural
design features) to prevent the discharge of stormwater
contaminants to groundwater resources. In addition,
hydrogeologic studies may be required to document potential
karst-related impacts.
(i) Prior to stormwater management and water quality design,
developers should consult with the Municipal Engineer to
verify stormwater quality criteria and present proposed
features and concepts for the treatment of stormwater runoff.
Following this meeting the Municipal Engineer shall define any
needed support studies or documentation.
(2) Water quality volume (WQv).
(a) The required water quality volume that must be treated for any
WQS development on sites in sensitive areas underlain by
carbonate rock, and all areas not underlain by carbonate rock
is to be computed within the municipality:
140. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:346
WQdepth = the larger of 0.5 inches or 0.25 + (0.012)
2.9[0.044(SIA)]
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
WQdepth = depth in inches that must be captured for
impervious areas
SIA = percent of site impervious area (all paved areas
and roof with asphalt-based roofs)
A = total of all paved areas and asphalt-based roofs on
site in acres
(b) The required water quality volume that must be treated for any
non-WQS development in nonsensitive areas underlain by
carbonate rock (see exhibits in Appendix B10) within the
municipality shall be computed as:
WQdepth = 0.25 + (0.012) 2.9[0.044(SIA)]
WQv = WQdepth(A)/12
Where:
WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet
WQdepth = depth in inches that must be captured for
impervious areas
SIA = percent of site impervious area (all paved areas
and roof with asphalt-based roofs)
A = total of all paved areas and asphalt-based roofs on
site in acres
[1] For designs in which the final roof material is unknown,
the design engineer must assume an asphalt-based roof.
[2] The water quality volume must be captured and treated
through a water quality BMP over an extended period of
time as per the specific requirements of each structure.
Credits to reduce the effective impervious area are
applicable as presented below.
(3) Water quality credits. Due to the karst nature of the Spring Creek
Basin, the nonstructural water quality credits and techniques
identified below may be limited for suitability and use based on
development type and location. These limitations for use are
specified in the restrictions section for each credit. The Municipal
Engineer may require additional documentation or investigation
prior to use of each specific credit to reduce the risks of sinkhole
development or groundwater contamination for sensitive areas and
development types.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:347
Nonstructural
Technique Water Quality Credit
Drainage protection
(DWP)
Subtract drainageway protection areas
from impervious site area in WQv
computation.
Natural area
conservation (NAC)
Subtract conserved natural areas from
impervious site area in WQv
computation.
Filter/buffer area Subtract impervious areas discharged
over pervious areas from impervious
site area in WQv computation.
(a) No area may be double counted for use with credits. The
combined credits of natural area conservation and vegetated
filter strips is limited to 50% of the site's impervious area. The
drainageway protection credit is limited to 50% of the site's
impervious area. The maximum total water quality credit for
any site may, therefore, be 100% of the site's impervious area.
(b) Drainageway protection. A water quality credit is given for the
protection of natural drainageways on a development site.
Natural karst drainageways within the Spring Creek
Watershed often do not exhibit a defined channel bed and
banks. More often, these drainageways appear as wide,
shallow parabolic swales. These drainageways are an integral
part of the natural drainage system and often exhibit
significant infiltration capacity. Protection of these
drainageways is critically important to the health of the
watershed. The drainageway protection (DWP) area is defined
as an area centered on the drainageway and having a
maximum width of 300 feet. The Municipal Engineer may
modify the defined maximum width in cases where natural land
forms define an appropriate alternate width. The impervious
area used in the WQv equation for the development site may be
reduced by twice the area of the preserved drainageway (2 to 1
ratio).
[1] Restrictions on the credit:
[a] Drainageway protection areas must remain in an
undisturbed condition during and after construction
activities. There can be no construction activity within
these areas, including temporary access roads or
storage of equipment or materials. Temporary access
for the construction of utilities crossing this protection
area may be permitted, at the Municipal Engineer's
discretion. However, the alignment of any such
crossing must be perpendicular to the drainageway.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:348
[b] These areas should be placed in a conservation
easement or be permanently preserved through a
similarly enforceable agreement with the municipality.
[c] The limits of the undisturbed DWP area and
conservation easement must be shown on all
construction plans.
[d] The DWP area must be located on the development
site.
[e] The maximum total DWPA credit is 50% of the site
impervious area.
[f] Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
[2] Sensitive area and development restrictions:
[a] DWP areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive
areas unless the impervious area actually flows across
the area as sheet flow.
[b] Untreated urban runoff from sensitive development
types may not be directed to DWP areas without
pretreatment.
(c) Natural area conservation (NAC). A water quality credit is
given for natural areas that are conserved at the development
site thereby maintaining predevelopment water quality
characteristics. The impervious area used in the WQv equation
for the development site may be reduced by the natural area
conserved in the water quality volume computations. Natural
area conservation is different than vegetated filter strip/
recharge area and drainageway protection in that, in some
cases, surface runoff may never be directed over the natural
area (i.e., if upslope wooded areas are conserved).
[1] Restrictions on the credit:
[a] Natural areas must remain in an undisturbed
condition during and after construction activities.
Temporary incidental land disturbance activities
associated with utility construction may be permitted
within the conservation area.
[b] These areas should be placed in a conservation
easement or similarly enforceable agreement with the
municipality.
[c] The limits of the undisturbed area and conservation
easement must be shown on all construction plans.
§ 147-15 (RESERVED) § 147-15
123:349
[d] The area must be located on the development site.
[e] Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
[f] The maximum total NAC credit is 50% of the site
impervious area. However, the combination of natural
area conservation credits and filter buffer area credits
is also 50%.
[2] Sensitive area and development restrictions:
[a] NAC areas may not be counted as a credit in sensitive
areas unless the impervious area actually flows across
the area as sheet flow.
[b] Untreated urban runoff from sensitive development
types may not be directed to natural areas without
pretreatment.
(d) Filter/buffer area. A water quality credit is given when
stormwater runoff is effectively treated via a filter/buffer area
or strip. A filter/buffer area is a vegetated boundary
characterized by uniform mild slopes. Filter strips may be
forested or vegetated with turf grass. Effective treatment is
achieved when impervious area runoff is directed as sheet flow
across vegetative filter or buffer areas (i.e., concentrated flow
discharged to a filter strip does not meet water quality
reduction criteria). The area draining via overland sheet flow
to an undisturbed, natural, vegetated filter strip (natural
unmaintained meadow or forested area) can be subtracted
from the site impervious area (IA) on a 1:1 area ratio in the
water quality volume computation. Impervious areas draining
across constructed (disturbed or regarded) pervious areas can
be subtracted from the site impervious area (IA) on a 1:1/2
area ratio in the water quality volume computation.
[1] Restrictions on the credit:
[a] The maximum impervious area that can be included in
this credit shall be computed as follows:
IAc = WIA LIA
Where:
IAc = Impervious area recharge credit (L2)
LIA = Length of impervious area measured
perpendicular to the sheet flow direction (L)
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-15
123:350
WIA = Width of impervious area (L). Maximum
width permitted for credit is the smaller of 100
feet or twice the width of the vegetated filter
strip.
[b] To qualify for a water quality credit, natural and
constructed filter areas or strips must meet the same
restrictions identified for natural or constructed
recharge areas with regard to width, length, slope,
tributary drainage length, and construction. These
restrictions are presented in § 147-15C.
[c] Runoff shall enter the filter/buffer strip as overland
sheet flow.
[d] Filter/buffer areas shall remain undisturbed/
unmanaged other than to remove accumulated trash
and debris.
[e] The maximum total water quality credit for vegetative
filter/buffer areas is 50% of the site impervious area.
However, the maximum credit for the combination of
NAC and filter/buffer areas is also 50%.
[2] Sensitive area and development restrictions:
[a] Water quality credits are not permitted for water
quality sensitive (WQS) developments.
[b] Untreated urban runoff from WQS developments may
not be directed to filter/buffer areas without
pretreatments.
(4) Comments related to water quality credits.
(a) Concurrence of the Municipal Engineer is required prior to the
use of all water quality credits for the reduction of the water
quality treatment volume. The Municipal Engineer may
approve the use of additional credits based upon sufficient
documentation regarding suitability for sensitive development
types and areas, pollutant removal effectiveness, and
maintenance criteria. Multiple water quality credits cannot be
claimed for the identical area of the site (i.e., a stream buffer
credit and disconnecting roof recharge area cannot both be
claimed for the same area).
(b) Additional impervious coverage reduction using low-impact
development techniques (development practices which reduce
the impact of urban runoff such as narrower residential road
sections, smaller cul-de-sacs, smaller parking stalls, smaller
building setbacks to reduce driveway lengths, etc.) will also
reduce the required water quality treatment volume. These

123:351
§ 147-16. Erosion and sedimentation requirements.
techniques require prior approval by the municipality before
implementation into land development design.
A. Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such
activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and
Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of
Environmental Protection, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control", and in
accordance with the Centre County Conservation District and the
standards and specification of the municipality.
B. The Centre County Conservation District has been delegated the
authority by the PA DEP to administer the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program in Centre County. It shall be the
responsibility of the land developer to submit the E&SPC Plan,
application, and other necessary material to the Conservation District.
A copy of the transmittal letter, plan, narrative, and other necessary
material shall be provided to the municipality.
C. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has
regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan (E&SPC
Plan) for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more
under 25 Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
D. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for any earth disturbance of one acre or
more with a point source discharge to surface waters or the
municipality's storm sewer system or five acres or more regardless of
the planned runoff (hereinafter collectively referred to as "regulated
earth disturbance activities"). This includes earth disturbance on any
portion of, part of, or during any stage of, a larger common plan of
development.
E. No regulated activities or regulated earth disturbance activities within
the municipality shall commence until approval by the Centre County
Conservation District of an E&SPC Plan for construction activities.
F. Comments shall be received and E&SPC Plan approval obtained from
the Conservation District prior to issuance of any building permits for
construction within the area covered by the stormwater management
plan.
G. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality. The
issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under
the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements of
Subsection E.
§ 147-15 PATTON CODE § 147-16
123:352
§ 147-17. Sinkhole protection.
Intent: The use of sinkholes for stormwater management must be carefully
planned, because discharging runoff directly into existing sinkholes is not
an engineered stormwater solution. Aside from potential water quality
effects, cover collapse sinkholes that exist throughout the watershed can be
unstable, and it should be assumed that they could stop taking water at any
time. Numerous sinkholes throughout the region already flood during larger
runoff events. Nonetheless, in the watershed there are large drainage areas
that completely drain to existing sinkholes and all upslope development
tributary to them cannot be realistically stopped. Therefore, the following
sections have been developed.
H. Additional erosion and sedimentation control design standards and
criteria must be applied where recharge or water quality BMPs are
proposed:
(1) Areas proposed for these BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as
to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) These BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until the
entire contributory drainage area to the BMP has received final
stabilization.
I. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit(s), as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the
project site at all times.
A. Stormwater from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof drains, or
other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged directly into
sinkholes without prior filtration in accordance with Subsection B,
below.
B. Sinkholes capable of absorbing substantial amounts of stormwater shall
be protected by diverting such runoff around the sinkhole (refer to
Subsection F below) or, upon approval of the Municipal Engineer, by
planting and maintaining a dense filter path of suitable vegetative
material in such a manner and location to disperse and slow the runoff
to a sheet flow condition to promote the maximum possible filtration
and sedimentation of impurities.
(1) The filter path must be at least 100 feet in length and 20 feet in
width. Ten-foot-wide filter paths are acceptable if land slope is less
than 2%.
(2) Filter paths shall be designed and installed so that they filter sheet
flow rather than concentrated flow. If concentrated flow occurs,
grading and shaping or the use of best management practices such
as grass waterways or drop structures may be required.
§ 147-16 (RESERVED) § 147-17
123:353
§ 147-18. Design criteria for stormwater management facilities.
(3) Sedimentation basins and proposed vegetative filter paths, in
conjunction with temporary stone filter check dams, shall be
installed prior to subdivision or land development construction
activities where sinkholes are used to accept stormwater
discharges. The sedimentation basin shall be designed to meet the
larger volume requirement of DEP Chapter 102 standards or the
permanent stormwater storage criteria.
C. If increased runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole, even in filtered
conditions, a hydrogeologic assessment of the effects of such runoff on
the increased risk of land subsidence and adverse impacts to existing
sinkhole floodplains and groundwater quality shall be made by a
qualified professional and submitted with the stormwater management
plan. Such discharge shall be prohibited if the Municipal Engineer
determines that such poses a hazard to life, property, or groundwater
resources.
D. All sinkholes shall be posed by permanent on-site notices clearly visible
at the sinkhole prohibiting any disposal of refuse, rubbish, hazardous
wastes, organic matter of soil into the sinkhole. Rockfill may be
permitted in the sinkhole for the purpose of preventing dumping of said
materials.
E. To protect sensitive karst areas, the Municipal Engineer may require
basins to contain an impervious liner. The liner may be of the
impervious membrane type, placed in accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations, or may be constructed by mixing
Bentonite, or an approved alternative, with existing soil available at the
site, as approved by the Municipal Engineer.
F. If it is determined that runoff from upslope developing areas should be
diverted around a sinkhole due to existing problems, the Municipal
Engineer may require additional upstream volume controls as required
to protect downstream areas.
G. If a sinkhole that is a component of an approved stormwater
management plan closes or does not accept water, all owners of the
approved stormwater management plans tributary to the closed
sinkhole shall install volume control BMPs or safe conveyance to a
suitable discharge point.
A. Materials, worksmanship, and methods: All materials, workmanship,
and methods of work shall comply at a minimum with the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Form 408 specifications, as accepted and
commonly used by the municipality, and shall be considered to be
incorporated into this article as if copied in full. In the event a conflict
arises between the requirements of this article and the Form 408
Specifications, the Municipal Engineer shall resolve the difference, and
his opinion shall be binding.

B. General.
(1) Facilities in state rights-of-way. Any stormwater facility located on
state highway rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PA DOT). Any
stormwater facility that discharges directly onto state highway
rights-of-way shall be subject to review by the PA DOT.
(2) Water obstructions. Any facilities that constitute water
obstructions (e.g., culverts, bridges, outfalls, or stream
enclosures), and any work involving wetlands as directed in PA DEP
Chapter 105 regulations (as amended or replaced from time to time
by PA DEP), shall be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and
will require a permit from PA DEP. Any other drainage conveyance
facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be
able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the designated design storm with a minimum
of 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the
top of the roadway.

Ordinances)
Roadway crossings located with designated floodplain areas must
be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm
within a minimum of 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of roadway. Any facility that constitutes
a dam as defined in PA DEP Chapter 105 regulations may require
a permit under dam safety regulations. Any facility located within
a PA DOT right-of-way must meet PA DOT minimum design
standards and permit submission requirements.
(3) Conveyance facilities. Any drainage conveyance facility and/or
channel that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be
able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or
roadway, runoff from the return period design storm as specified in
Subsection B(2), above. Conveyance facilities to or exiting from
stormwater management facilities (i.e., detention basin) shall be
designed to convey the design flow to or from that structure.
Roadway crossings located within designated floodplain areas must
be able to convey runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm.
Any facility located within a PA DOT right-of-way must meet PA
DOT minimum design standards and permit submission
requirements.
§ 147-18 (RESERVED) § 147-18
123:355
C. Stormwater basin design considerations. Stormwater management
basins for the control of stormwater peak discharges shall meet the
following minimum requirements.
(1) The design of all facilities over limestone formations shall include
measures to prevent groundwater contamination and, where
required, sinkhole formation. Soils used for the construction of
basins shall have moderate to low erodibility factors (i.e., "K"
factors of 0.32 or less). The design for any basin greater than four
feet in height, measured from the top of berm to the downslope toe
of the abutment, must also include:
(a) Berm soil specifications;
(b) A determination of site soils are available for the construction
of the berms or cutoff trench;
(c) An impervious cutoff trench, which extends the full length of
the downstream berm located in fill.
(2) Energy dissipators and/or level spreaders shall be installed at
points where pipes or drainageways discharge to or from basins.
Generally, outlet pipes designed to carry the predevelopment, oneyear
storm flow will be permitted to discharge to a stream with only
an energy dissipator. Discharges to drainage swales shall be spread
with a level spreader or piped to an acceptable point.
(3) Outlet structures:
(a) Outlet structures within detention/retention basins shall be
constructed of reinforced concrete or an approved alternate.
With the exception of those openings designed to carry
perennial stream flows, design openings shall have a
childproof, non-clogging trash racks over all openings nine
inches or larger in any dimension. Outlet aprons shall be
designed and shall extend at a minimum to the toe of the basin
slope. Where spillways will be used to control peak discharges
in excess of the ten-year storm, the control weirs shall be
constructed to withstand the pressures of impounded waters
and convey flows at computed outlet velocities without erosion.
(b) All metal risers, where approved for use, shall be suitably
coated to prevent corrosion. A trash rack or similar
appurtenance shall be provided to prevent debris from
entering the riser. All metal risers shall have a concrete base
attached with a watertight connection. The base shall be
sufficient weight to prevent flotation of the riser. An antivortex
device, consisting of a thin vertical plate normal to the basin
berm, shall be provided on the top of all metal risers.
(4) Emergency spillway:
§ 147-18 PATTON CODE § 147-18
123:356
(a) Any stormwater management facility (i.e., detention basin)
designed to store runoff and requiring a berm or earthen
embankment required or regulated by this chapter shall be
designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to
and including the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
conditions. The height of embankment must be set as to
provide a minimum 0.5 foot of freeboard above the elevation
required to safely pass the one-hundred-year postdevelopment
inflow. Should any stormwater management facility require a
dam safety permit under PA DEP Chapter 105, the facility shall
be designed in accordance with Chapter 105 and meet the
regulations of Chapter 105 concerning dam safety which may
be required to pass storms larger than a one-hundred-year
event.
[1] Any underground stormwater management facility (e.g.,
tanks and pipe storage systems) must have a method to
bypass flows higher than the required design (up to a onehundred-
year postdevelopment inflow) without structural
failure or causing downstream harm or safety risks.
[2] Any stormwater management facility that has a paved
roadway as the lower berm, and therefore cannot provide
a traditional berm emergency spillway, is not required to
provide 0.5 feet of freeboard above the elevation required
to safely pass the one-hundred-year postdeveloment
inflow, but is required to show that the design is stable and
no significant undermining, scour, or erosion will occur.
(b) Emergency spillways shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete, vegetated earth, or riprap in accordance with
generally accepted engineering practices. All emergency
spillways shall be constructed so that the detention basin berm
is protected against erosion. The minimum capacity of all
emergency spillways shall be the peak flow rate from the onehundred-
year design storm. The dimensions of the emergency
spillways can be determined from the Centre County Erosion
and Sediment Control Handbook. Emergency spillways shall
extend along the upstream and downstream berm
embankment slopes. Protection should be provided on the
upstream embankment a minimum of three feet in elevation
below the spillway crest elevation. The downstream slope of
the spillway shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of the berm
embankment. The emergency spillway shall not be located on
or discharge over uncompacted earthen fill and/or easily
erodible material.
(c) Rock-filled gabions may be used where combination berm and
emergency spillway structures are required to prevent
concentrated flows. The Municipal Engineer may require the
use of open concrete lattice blocks, stone riprap, or concrete
§ 147-18 (RESERVED) § 147-18
123:357
spillways when slopes would exceed four feet horizontal to one
foot vertical and spillway velocities might exceed Conservation
District standards for the particular soils involved.
(5) Antiseep collars. Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the
detention basin berms. The antiseep collars and their connections
to the pipe barrel shall be watertight. The antiseep collars shall
extend a minimum of two feet beyond the outside of the principal
pipe barrel. The maximum spacing between collars shall be 14
times the minimum projection of the collar measured perpendicular
to the pipe.
(6) Slope of detention basin embankment. The top or toe of any slope
shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from any property line.
Whenever possible, the side slopes and basin shape shall be
amenable to the natural topography. Straight side slopes and
rectangular basins shall be avoided whenever possible.
(a) Exterior slopes of compacted soil shall not exceed three feet
horizontal to one foot vertical and must be further reduced if
the soil has unstable characteristics.
(b) Interior slopes of the basin shall not exceed two feet horizontal
to one foot vertical, except with approval of the municipality.
(c) Where concrete, stone, or brick walls are used with side slopes
proposed to be steeper than three feet horizontal to one foot
vertical, a fence or railing at least 42 inches high shall be
installed above the wall.
(7) Width of berm. The minimum top width of detention basin berms
shall be 10 feet.
(8) Slope of basin bottom. In order to ensure proper drainage of the
detention basin, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for all
basins used exclusively for peak runoff control. Water quality or
recharge basins with filtration systems incorporated into them may
have a minimum grade of 1/2%.
(a) A collecting swale, low-flow channel, or underdrain shall be
provided in basin designed for use as recreational facilities.
The slope of such a basin can be reduced to 1%.
(9) The lowest floor elevation of any structure constructed within 50
feet of a detention basin or other stormwater facility shall be two
feet above the emergency spillway elevation of the detention basin.
The distance between any structure and any stormwater facility
shall be a minimum of 25 feet.
§ 147-18 PATTON CODE § 147-18
123:358
(10) Landscaping and planting specifications must be provided for all
stormwater management basins and be specific for each type of
basin.
(11) Basins should be lined with impervious liners only in areas with a
high risk of sinkhole formation or potential groundwater
contamination, as determined by a geotechnical engineer.
However, where a liner is deemed necessary or appropriate, the
use of controlled, compacted natural clay liners for SWM basins
should be considered. Local available clay, when properly installed,
can provide near impervious conditions (approximately E-6 cm/s or
less).
(a) Some of the advantages of using controlled, compacted,
natural clay soil liners:
[1] Can offer better long-term solution as a basin liner versus
geosynthetics because of greater thickness and the ability
to withstand settlement;
[2] Can be constructed to allow relatively uniform leakage
rates to facilitate groundwater recharge but not to an
excessive degree that overloads karst bedrock;
[3] When properly constructed in two or more eight-to-teninch-
thick lifts, rapid movement of surface water through
the clay liner is eliminated (rapid leaks can occur in
geosynthetic-lined basins due to poor seaming, punctures,
or other factors);
[4] Cleaning/maintenance of clay-lined stormwater basins will
be easier/safer versus geosynthetic liners which could
easily be damaged during maintenance operations; and
[5] The abundance of clayey soils (derived from limestone
residuum) within the Spring Creek Watershed can provide
adequate, cost-effective, soil resources for construction of
clay liner systems at most development projects.
(b) However, the installation of any low-permeability clay liner
system needs to be carefully controlled and the designer needs
to ensure that specifications meet standards to ensure
integrity.
(12) The depth of water in the pond should not exceed five feet.
(13) Fence or screening. A fence or suitable vegetative screening may
be provided as required by the municipality, around all detention
basins. All fencing should be at least 3 1/2 feet in height as
approved by the municipality. A vegetative screening of suitable
landscaping plant material in or around a detention basin may also
be required. Vegetative screening should generally provide a
§ 147-18 (RESERVED) § 147-18
123:359
barrier to prevent entrance to and effectively naturalize the
appearance of the detention basin area.
D. Construction of basins.
(1) Basins shall be installed prior to or concurrent with any
earthmoving or land disturbances which they will serve. The
phasing of their construction shall be noted in the narrative and on
the plan. Basins that include water quality or recharge components
shall have those components installed in such a manner as to not
disturb or diminish their effectiveness.
(2) Construction specifications in accordance with the minimum
criteria of the municipality must be provided for all embankments
pursuant to § 147-18C(1)(b) of this chapter.
(3) Compaction test reports shall be kept on file at the site and be
subject to review at all times with copies being forwarded to the
Municipal Engineer upon request.
(4) When rock is encountered during the excavation of a pond, it shall
be removed to an elevation of at least 12 inches below the proposed
basin floor (for a manufactured liner, 24 to 30 inches). All exposed
cracks and fissures are to be structurally filled.
(5) Temporary and permanent grasses or stabilization measures shall
be established on the sides and base of all earthen basins within 15
days of construction.
E. Construction inspection. Inspections may be conducted by the
Municipal Engineer during the construction of the stormwater
management basin and facilities. Such inspections do not constitute
approval of construction methods or materials.
F. Special use basins.
(1) The design and construction of multiple use stormwater detention
facilities is strongly encouraged. In addition to stormwater
management, facilities should, where appropriate, allow for
recreational uses, including: ball fields, play areas, picnic grounds,
etc. Provision for parking facilities within basins and permanent
wet ponds with stormwater management capabilities may also be
appropriate. Prior approval and consultation with the municipality
are required before design. Multiple use basins should be
constructed so that potentially dangerous conditions are not
created. Water quality basins or recharge basins that are designed
for a slow release of water or other extended detention ponds are
not permitted for recreational uses, unless the ponded areas are
clearly separated and secure.
(2) Multiple development basins. Stormwater management facilities
designed to serve more than one property or development in the
§ 147-18 PATTON CODE § 147-18
123:360
same watershed are encouraged. Staged construction of existing
or proposed multiple-use detention facilities by several developers
in conjunction with watershed development is encouraged. Each
developer shall be responsible for the incremental increase in
runoff generated by the respective development and incremental
construction improvements necessary for the overall detention
facility. Prior approval and consultation with the municipality is
required before design of such facilities.
(3) Alternative detention facilities. Alternative stormwater detention
facilities, including rooftop, subsurface basins or tanks and in-pipe
detention storage, or other approved alternative designs, are
permitted as determined by the Municipal Engineer.
G. Design criteria for residential roof sumps, cisterns, and rooftop storage
facilities.
(1) Design of seepage pits and seepage trenches for infiltration:
(a) Criteria.
[1] These structures shall be designed to assimilate, in 72
hours, a volume of water equal to 0.2 cubic feet per square
foot of roof coverage.
[2] The soils on which a seepage pit or trench are located shall
have a minimum infiltration rate of 0.27 inches per hour
based upon soils data obtained by direct testing methods
in accordance with procedures outlined in the Technical
Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers, Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection.
[3] The porosity of the gravel or rock to be used in seepage
pits must be specified in the plan. The rock or gravel shall
be covered with a ground stabilization fabric [trade
names: Mirafi 500 (Monsanto), Typer (DuPont), Bidim
(trade name) and Supac (trade name)] or equivalent.
[4] Seepage pits or seepage trenches shall not be installed on
slopes greater than 20%.
[5] Seepage pits or the drains to them must contain a
sediment trap which can be maintained regularly. All
downspouts should have leaf strains to prevent leaves
from clogging the seepage pit.
[6] Seepage pits connected to roof drains shall be located at
least 10 feet from basement walls and downhill from the
building.
[7] The bottom of a seepage pit shall be at least two feet above
seasonal high water table and bedrock or be shown to be
otherwise capable of handling required design volumes.
§ 147-18 (RESERVED) § 147-18
123:361
(b) Guidelines.
[1] Runoff control capacity may be distributed among several
seepage pits, trenches or runoff control berms so long as
total assimilative capacity of all structures equals the
required volume.
[2] Where adequate seepage pit capacity is difficult to achieve
with a rock-filled pit, a concrete (or equivalent material)
culvert pipe with a lid may be placed vertically over a
stone bed to provide storage capacity; alternatively, a
septic tank-type structure operating as a cistern with
discharge to the seepage pit may be used.
[3] The longer dimension of seepage pits or seepage trenches
should parallel the slope where slopes exceed 5%.
[4] The use of a perforated or porous pipe leading to the
seepage pit is encouraged.
[5] In all cases, an overflow system should be provided to
accommodate heavy rains in excess of the design criteria.
(2) Design of cisterns and rooftop storage facilities:
(a) Criteria.
[1] Cisterns shall be located within a building or below frost
level where they will be protected against freezing. They
shall be designed to hold two-tenths cubic feet of water
per square foot of roof coverage.
[2] Access to the structures by insect or animal vectors shall
be controlled by screens or other obstructions.
[3] Facilities to be used for water supply purposes shall
comply with plumbing code regulations for cross
connections.
[4] Rooftop storage must comply with all building code
regulations on load limitations and other related factors.
[5] All water storage facilities shall be equipped to divert
flows in excess of their holding capacity to appropriate
areas of discharge. If water stored in cisterns will not be
used for nonpotable water supply purposes, the facility
shall be designed to drain down within 72 hours through a
seepage bed.
(b) Guidelines.
[1] Facilities should have a means of access for cleanout of
accumulated debris or sediment.
§ 147-18 PATTON CODE § 147-18
123:362
§ 147-19. Easements.
Stormwater management facilities located outside of existing or proposed
rights-of-way shall be located within and accessible by easements as
follows:
[2] Septic tank-type structures are recommended for smaller
facilities.
A. Drainage easements. Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement paralleling the line of such watercourse, drainageway,
channel or stream. The width of the drainage easement will be
adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage in the
one-hundred-year floodplain, in accordance with computed top widths
for water surface elevations determined under § 147-15D.
B. Access easements. Where proposed stormwater management facilities
are not adjacent to proposed or existing public rights-of-way or are not
accessible due to physical constraints, as determined by the Municipal
Engineer, a twenty-foot-wide passable access easement specifying
rights of entry shall be provided. Access easements shall provide for
vehicle ingress and egress on grades of less than 10% for carrying out
inspection or maintenance activities, when directed by the Municipal
Engineer.
C. Maintenance easements. A maintenance easement shall be provided
which encompasses the stormwater facility and appurtenances and
provides for access for maintenance purposes. The maintenance
easement must be located outside of one-hundred-year surface
elevation and the stormwater facility and appurtenances.
D. Easement shall stipulate that no trees, shrubs, structures, excavation or
fill be placed and no regarding be performed within the area of the
easement without written approval from the municipality upon review
by the Municipal Engineer. Upon approval of the Municipal Engineer,
such landscaping may be placed in maintenance easements, provided it
does not impede access.
E. Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel with and conjunctive
to property lines of the subdivision.
F. All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the relevant subdivision or land
development plan. The format and content of the easement agreement
shall be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Engineer.
G. When stormwater conveyance pipes or channels are located in
undedicated land, they shall be placed within a drainage easement not
less than 20 feet wide, as approved by the Municipal Engineer.

ARTICLE V
Stormwater Management Plan Requirements
§ 147-20. General requirements.
§ 147-21. Stormwater management plan contents.
The stormwater management plan shall consist of all applicable
calculations, maps, and plans. A note on the maps shall refer to the
associated computations and erosion and sediment pollution control plan
by title and date. The cover sheet of the computations and erosion and
sediment pollution control plan shall refer to the associated maps by title
and date. All stormwater management plan materials shall be submitted

facilities may be dedicated to the municipality. If stormwater
facilities are accepted by the municipality for dedication, persons
installing stormwater facilities shall be required to pay a specified
amount to the municipality to help defray costs of periodic
inspections and maintenance expenses. The amount of the deposit
shall be determined as follows:
(a) If the stormwater facility is to be owned and maintained by the
municipality, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Municipal
Engineer will establish the estimated costs utilizing
information submitted by the developer.
(b) The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The Municipal
Engineer shall determine the present worth equivalents, which
shall be subject to the approval of the municipal governing
body.
(c) If a stormwater facility is proposed that also serves as a
recreation facility (e.g., ball field, lake), the municipality may
reduce or waive the amount of the maintenance fund deposit
based upon the value of the land for public recreation purpose.
(d) If at some future time a dedicated stormwater facility is
eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other
facilities, the unused portion of the maintenance fund deposit
will be applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and
connection to the storm sewer system or other facility. Any
amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of
abandonment are paid will be returned to the depositor.
C. Stormwater facilities should be inspected by the landowner/developer
or responsible entity (including the Municipal Engineer for dedicated
facilities) on the following basis:

Street Design Standards and Construction Specifications
§ 149-13. General.
The street design standards and construction specifications herein are
regarded as minimum standards and specifications. They are developed
giving high priority to the safety and durability of the future Township
streets. The Township reserves the right to require designs in excess of
these standards when conditions warrant, and also to approve alternate
designs when proven to the Township Engineer they are equal or better
than a design based on these standards.
§ 149-14. Design standards.
A. Table 1 presents the Township's design standards and Figures 1, 2 and
3 illustrate various design details.144 These design standards have been
developed from the following references:
(1) Guidelines for Design of Local Roads and Streets, Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation Pub. 70, April 1983
Edition.
(2) A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, 1984.
(3) Highway Design Manual - Part 2, Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, August 1981, as revised through 1985.
(4) Publication 408 Roadway Specifications, Pennsylvania Department
of Transportation, 1987 Edition, as revised through 1989.
(5) Performance Streets, A Concept and Model Standards for
Residential Streets, Bucks County Planning Commission, April
1980.
B. When conditions warrant designs not covered by the herein standards,
the design shall conform to the standards set forth in the references. If
differing standards exist, the most stringent will apply, as determined
by the Township Engineer.
C. Streets shall be designed for a twenty-year service life. If a street is to
be utilized prior to complete construction, the utilized portion must be
structurally designed to support all anticipated loading without
significant loss of the designed service life of the street.
D. Special consideration for future bus and truck routes must be taken into
account in design of streets for pavement thickness and width, sight
distances and curb radii.

conform to the requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications, Publication 408, unless specifically stated
otherwise herein. Table 2145 summarizes the specifications for the
components that will typically be encountered in street construction within
the Township. If structural components are encountered which are not
enumerated in the table, the appropriate section of Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Publication 408 will govern.
E. Intersection designs will be reviewed on a case by case basis for
inclusion of turning lanes, medians, acceleration and deceleration lanes
and traffic control devices. Intersections shall be designed to be at right
angles, or as close to right angles as possible, given topographic and
other constraints. The minimum spacing between centerlines of offset
intersections shall be 150 feet.
F. Requirements for traffic signal preemption systems. [Added
2-24-1999 by Ord. No. 99-363]
(1) All traffic signals installed following the enactment of this
requirement shall be equipped with traffic signal preemption
systems.
(2) The traffic signal preemption systems shall be compatible with
transmitting devices installed in apparatus of the Alpha Fire
Company and shall permit approaching fire-protection apparatus to
have a green light at any intersection equipped with the necessary
receiving equipment.
(3) Acquisition, installation and testing costs for a preemption system
installed as part of a subdivision or land development plan shall be
the responsibility of the developer.
(4) For traffic signals installed by a public entity, the acquisition,
installation and testing costs of the required preemption system
shall be the responsibility of the appropriate public entity.
(5) The specifications of the traffic signal preemption device shall be
determined by the Centre Region Council of Governments, the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation and the Township
Engineer. For the purposes of this requirement, the point of contact
shall be the Fire Administrator. All proposed traffic light designs
shall be provided to the Fire Administrator for review and comment
at least 15 business days before the related subdivision or land
development plan is presented to the Township Planning
Commission for action.

(1) It is the general policy of the Township to require sidewalks along
both sides of public streets to provide for the safe movement of
§ 149-34 (RESERVED) § 149-38
123:401
pedestrians. Thus, sidewalks are to be constructed in all zoning
districts in the Township, except the following: [Amended
5-28-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-496]
R-1 Rural Residential NR-1 Natural Resources
FP-1 Floodplain UD University District
A-1 Rural
(2) These areas are viewed as not typically generating enough
pedestrian movement to warrant sidewalks. However, if
circumstances arise which, in the opinion of the Board of
Supervisors, will generate pedestrian traffic in these areas, the
Board can require sidewalks to be constructed therein.
(3) Any rezoning of an area to a more intensive development zone will
require sidewalks to be constructed along public streets in that
zone. The cost of the sidewalks will be borne by the initiator of,the
rezoning request unless an alternative arrangement is deemed
acceptable by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Materials and methods.
(1) Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Supervisors, all
sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with Section 676 of
PennDOT Publication 408, 1987 Edition, with the exception that a
four-inch stone base can be provided instead of a six-inch stone
base. The construction material shall be air-entrained cement
concrete, the width of the sidewalk shall be five feet, and the
thickness of concrete no less than four inches. A cross-slope of oneeighth
(1/8) inch per foot shall be provided to direct runoff toward
the street.
(2) Bituminous sidewalks may be approved by the Board of
Supervisors only after presentation of substantial noneconomic
based information supporting their use instead of cement concrete.
If permitted, bituminous sidewalks shall be constructed of four
inches of compacted ID-2 material on a four-inch stone base, and
shall be five feet wide.

imposed under § 149-41.1.
A. It shall be the duty of all owners of multiple-family dwellings or
apartments to cause sidewalks leading from said buildings to the
streets, parking lots or other sidewalks located along the respective

[ii] Recommended: grasses, sedges and perennials.
Though not required to be installed, the planting
of grasses, sedges, and perennials outside the
first 35 feet of the riparian buffer is
recommended. If planted, they should be spaced
approximately one to three feet apart or per
nursery instructions. See Appendix 3.161
[b] Density.
[i] The required quantity of plantings shall be
derived based on the following formula:
Length of Buffera x 50b x 150c / 43,560d = Total
Required Plantings
a = length of stream frontage located
within the riparian buffer
b = width of riparian buffer
c = required number of trees per acre
d = square feet per acre
[ii] The survival rate after three years shall meet or
exceed 70% of the required density. If, after three
years, less than 70% of the trees have survived,
additional trees shall be planted to meet the
seventy-percent standard.
[c] Size.
[i] Required: balled and burlapped, and/or large
container stock equal to or greater than 1.5
inches in caliper.

each fall for the first three years following
planting. Mowing may not be beneficial if a large
number of trees are destroyed in the process.
Mowing should be site specific.
[v] In addition to mowing, maintenance should
include mulching and the replacement of mulch
as needed, the removal of invasive species (See
Appendix 2.164) and the removal of dead trees.
[vi] If, after three years, less than 70% of the trees
have survived, additional trees shall be planted to
meet the seventy-percent standard.

architecturally harmonious, on all building walls and other building
components visible from public rights-of-way. Unpainted plain
concrete block shall not be used on building exteriors. Tinted or
textured concrete block is acceptable.
(2) Glazed areas shall not exceed 60% of the exterior surface of any
single building. All glazing materials shall have a maximum of 15%
outside visible light reflectivity value.
(3) Facades greater than 45 feet in length facing rights-of-way shall
employ one or more of the following architectural design
strategies:
(a) Use of varying materials, textures or colors.
(b) Use of architectural detailing or elements, such as windows,
colonnades, porches, porticos, columns, pilasters, cornices, or
canopies.
(c) Varying horizontal elevations, bump outs, and recesses.
(4) Facades of retail buildings which face a public right-of-way or
parking area shall have a minimum of 30% of the ground floor
exterior area devoted to windows or display windows.
B. Building placement and site design.
(1) Developers are encouraged to avoid construction of buildings on
high points of hills or ridges. Any building near a hilltop should not
protrude above the natural ridgeline as seen from a site's frontage
on the I-99 corridor. Rooftop equipment (including but not limited
§ 153-34.1.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.2
123:449
to satellite dishes and air conditioning units), deck support
structures and trash receptacles shall be adequately screened so
they are not visible from major public rights-of-way or viewing
places. Architectural perspectives or drawings shall be submitted
that document compliance with this requirement.
(2) Trash receptacles, mechanical equipment, outdoor storage, loading
docks, and other accessory uses shall be located or screened in
such a manner as to be hidden from all off-property views,
including the interstate highway and interchange access road.
C. Slope restrictions.
(1) For the purpose of this section, the slope(s) of a site shall be
determined by utilizing topographic surveys following written
guidelines prepared by the Township Engineer and approved by the
Board of Supervisors.
(2) In areas of steep slopes within the Interchange Overlay District, the
following standards shall apply to all grading and development:
(a) For slopes averaging 15% to 25%, no more than 40% of
naturally occurring slopes shall be developed, graded,
deforested, and/or stripped of vegetation. An additional 30% of
such naturally occurring slope may be developed upon
submission of a report by a qualified professional engineer
certifying that the sloped areas may be safely developed and
inclusion of two of the following mitigation measures when the
disturbed area exceeds 55% of such naturally occurring slope:
[1] Preserve other undisturbed land with less than 15% slope
equal to 1.0 times the additional area disturbed.
[2] Provide for the recharge of stormwater for an amount of
impervious area equal to 1.2 times the additional area
disturbed. The minimum required recharge volume is
equal to 1.5 inches of runoff for the area defined.
[3] Provide additional landscaping equivalent to a twenty-footwide
Buffer Yard D for an area equal to 1.2 times the
additional area disturbed. The "Required Plant Units/100"
are required for each 2,000 square feet required to be
landscaped. The landscaping may be provided on nonwooded,
undisturbed ground or in developed areas.
Substitutions between types of plantings may be made at
the exchange ratios established for setback landscaping.
[4] Provide a developer-proposed mitigation of equal
environmental value and acceptable to the Township.
(b) For slopes averaging greater than 25%, no development shall
be allowed, except upon submission of a report by a
§ 153-34.2 PATTON CODE § 153-34.2
123:450
§ 153-34.3. Grading. [Added 3-26-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-417]
professional engineer certifying that the steep slope may be
safely developed. Furthermore, the owner and/or developer
shall agree, as a condition to approval of the development
plan, to hold the municipality harmless from and against any
and all claims or damages due to approval of such plan. If
development is allowed to occur under this subsection, no
more than 15% of such naturally occurring slopes shall be
developed, graded, deforested, and/or stripped of vegetation.
(c) On Lots 4, 6, and 7 of Oakwood Planned Community, no
allowed use may be denied solely because a particular lot or
lots do not meet the slope restriction regulations of this section
as long as the intent of the I-99 Interchange Overlay District is
maintained. [Added 6-20-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-390]
D. Stream and wetland buffers.
(1) All improvements or land disturbances within the Interchange
Overlay District shall be set back at least 100 feet from the top of
any stream bank or edge of any wetland in a rural area and 65 feet
from the top of any stream bank or edge of any wetland in an urban
area. The urban or rural location shall be determined by the
location of the Regional Growth Boundary in the Centre Region
Comprehensive Plan. This setback shall apply to all streams
delineated on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map for the
Township and all streams depicted on the Township's Official
Zoning Map with drainage areas greater than 100 acres. Where no
well-defined top-of-bank exists for an intermittent stream, the
setback shall be measured from the line defined by the water
surface elevation for the two-year storm.
(2) All existing vegetation within the setback established in Subsection
D(1) above shall be preserved.
(3) Where stream crossings are approved pursuant to applicable
federal and state stream encroachment regulations, the setback
established in Subsection D(1) above shall be waived as to the
approved crossing; provided, however, the natural channel shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible.
A. Cuts. No excavation should be made with a cut face steeper than two
feet horizontal to one foot vertical, unless it is shown the excavation is
made sufficiently stable to sustain a steeper slope. Retaining walls will
be required if a stable slope cannot be maintained. Any retaining wall
design must be approved by the Municipal Engineer. The top of the
slope of any cut must be located a minimum of 10 feet from property
lines.
§ 153-34.2 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3
123:451
§ 153-34.3.1. Excavations possibly including pyritic rock. [Added
9-28-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-532]
B. Fills. No fill shall be made which creates any exposed surface steeper in
slope than two feet horizontal to one foot vertical, except where the fill
is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not result in
property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property, streets or
buildings. For an exposed surface steeper than 2:1 to be permitted, the
applicant must provide documentation that the steeper slope is not a
safety concern. A retaining wall will be required to support the face of
the fill where the above-specified requirements cannot be met.
A. Intent.
(1) When construction activities result in the disturbance and exposure
of sulfur-bearing minerals (hereafter referred to as "pyritic rock"
because pyrite is the most common of the base metal sulfides), the
unexpected consequences may be physical (expansion as the
sulfides oxidize) and chemical as the soluble alteration products
become mobile in runoff and groundwater. A common effect of the
latter, known as "acid rock drainage" (ARD), is the most
widespread. Expansion in situ or from the use of pyritic rock as fill
material in construction projects can lead to serious foundation and
structural damage.
(2) Construction of Interstate Highway 99 in the Skytop area of the
Township resulted in the exposure of pyritic veins and the
formation of ARD, causing public health concerns and requiring a
very costly mitigation effort. The extent and concentration of the
"pyrite" veins encountered during that excavation was unexpected.
Hence, in the interest of public health and safety, it is the intent of
these regulations to regulate certain excavation activities in an
effort to avoid hazards associated with the disturbance of pyritic
rock.
B. Applicability; background.
(1) Applicability. These regulations shall apply to the following
activities when such activities will result in one or more acres of
earth disturbance involving the following soil types: Hazleton,
Laidig, Buchanan, Andover, Murrill, and Clarksburg:
(a) All nonresidential and all multifamily residential excavation
activities, including but not limited to excavations associated
with the construction of related buildings, roads, access drives
and accessory structures.
(b) Excavation activities associated with, but not limited to, the
construction of buildings, roads, access drives and accessory
structures for residential development when more than one
single-family detached dwelling and/or related accessory
§ 153-34.3 PATTON CODE § 153-34.3.1
123:452
structures, driveways and other uses accessory to a singlefamily
detached dwelling are proposed to be constructed and
served by a common access road, drive or driveway, public
or private, whether such construction is to occur initially or
cumulatively over time and when such construction is to occur
on a lot or lots created under the same subdivision or land
development plan.
(c) The regulations shall not apply to residential projects limited to
the construction of one single-family detached dwelling and/or
related accessory structures, driveways and other uses
accessory to an existing single primary residential structure,
unless such a project requires that an NPDES permit be issued
by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(PA DEP). If an NPDES permit is required, these regulations
shall apply. Please see Appendix 7, A Residential Guide to
Excavations and Pyritic Rock.166 This guide provides a
recommended step-by-step approach for proceeding with
residential excavations when such activities are exempt from
these regulations.
(d) Further exemptions listed in § 153-34.3.1F.
(2) Background.
(a) The process in determining the appropriate course of action in
assessing the potential for ARD is based upon the extent of the
planned excavation. The topographic settings and subsurface
conditions of the project site are integral to this determination.
(b) The term "topographic setting" relates to the characteristics of
the ground surface of a project site, while the term "subsurface
conditions" refers to the geologies that are likely to be found in
each topographic setting. The following information is
provided to help the on-site personnel understand the
probability for ARD in relationship to the settings and
conditions.
(c) The three general settings in Patton Township can be referred
to as Ridge Crest, Slopes, and Valley Floor. The two general
subsurface conditions are Soils and Bedrock. (The top layer of
bedrock is referred to as "cap rock.") The following categories
combine settings with the typical subsurface condition for that
setting in order to provide a general probability for the
existence of ARD-producing conditions:
[1] Setting A: Ridge Crest, with Hazleton soils. Probability for
ARD:
[a] Low, if thin soil and thick oxidized cap rock.
166. Editor's Note: Appendix 7 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 153-34.3.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3.1
123:453
[b] Moderate to high, if oxidized cap rock is penetrated.
[2] Setting B: Slopes, with Laidig, Buchanan or Andover soils.
Probability for ARD:
[a] Low, if thick colluvial soils and thick oxidized cap rock.
[b] Moderate, if thick colluvial soils and thin oxidized cap
rock.
[c] High, if thin colluvial soils and thin oxidized cap rock.
[3] Setting C: Valley Floor, with Murrill or Clarksburg soils.
Probability for ARD:
[a] Low, if thick soils and thick oxidized cap rock.
[b] Moderate to high, if thin soils and thin oxidized cap
rock.
[4] The regulations contained herein focus on surface
inspections and subsurface conditions only. Prior to
beginning any excavation, on-site personnel should review
the above information for further assistance in assessing
the potential for ARD. See also the flow chart in Appendix
5 and Appendix 4, Subsurface Conditions in Three
Topographic Settings.167 Those appendixes provide a
visual depiction of the process and requirements
contained within these regulations.
C. Definitions. The definitions set forth below shall be applicable to this
section.
ACID ROCK  As used herein, it refers to any rock, soil, regolith or fill
in which an accumulation of sulfur-bearing minerals produces sulfuric
acid, during weathering. Sulfur may be present as native sulfur (S),
sulfide (-S2), or sulfate (-SO4), the last two of which combine with iron
or other elements to form minerals.
ACID ROCK DRAINAGE (ARD)  Acid toxic surface water and
groundwater draining from an oxidizing and hydrating sulfur source.
(See photo below.)
167. Editor's Note: Appendixes 4 and 5 are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 153-34.3.1 PATTON CODE § 153-34.3.1
123:454
ACID SULFATE SOILS  Soils in which sulfate minerals have
precipitated from lateral and upward migrating ARD leachate. The
process of migration and deposition is known as sulfuricization. Acid
sulfate soils generally occur in flat, low-lying areas down hydraulic
gradient from oxidizing sulfide mineral deposits. The secondary sulfate
minerals that form near the surface from evaporation are called
efflorescent minerals.
COLLUVIUM  Unconsolidated sediments on a hill or mountainside,
ranging in size from large boulders down to sand and clay, which were
moved downhill due to gravity and deposited lower on the slope. The
rate of sediment movement is usually slow, but rapid advancement can
happen by landslides or mudslides. Many colluvial soils contain one
or more brittle, clay-rich subsoil layers known as "fragipans." Colluvial
deposits may continue to move downhill, normally at a slow rate.
Transported soils (colluvium), particularly on ridge slopes, may overlie
and cover any of the in situ conditions (fresh bedrock, weathered
bedrock, residual soils).
EFFLORESCENT MINERALS  Secondary minerals that precipitate at
or near the earth's surface from migration leachate and reflect in their
composition the composition of the source materials. Although we are
interested in those that formed from the oxidation and weathering of
pyrite and other base metal sulfides, we need to be aware of other
alumina-bearing efflorescent minerals (such as alunite and alunogen)
formed from reactions with shale in treated fill site. At Skytop, hydrated
iron sulfate minerals, such as copiapite and melanterite, precipitated
as fine-grained, powdery, white to yellow to orange encrustations on
rocks and construction materials at the surface or in the near-surface
environment. Efflorescent minerals are highly soluble in water and
typically grow or disappear rapidly depending on local moisture
conditions. (See photos below.)
EXCAVATION  Other than customary activities related to landscaping,
any disruption of the earth's surface for activities including, but not
limited to, clearing and grubbing, the construction of buildings, roads,
access drives, driveways and accessory structures which results in one
or more acres of earth disturbance when any of the following soil
§ 153-34.3.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3.1
123:455
types are present: Hazleton, Laidig, Buchanan, Andover, Murrill, or
Clarksburg.
GOSSAN  Typically a hard rock or encrustation on the surface of
another rock, composed of iron oxide/hydroxide minerals (and quartz)
colored brown, red, orange, and yellow (any or all combinations). They
represent the oxidized and leached remnants of sulfide deposits on the
weathered surface. Gossans form from oxidation and decomposition
of pyrite-bearing rocks and others that host sulfide minerals. The
presence of gossan suggests that pyrite and/or other sulfide minerals
occur within nearby soil or bedrock. (See photo below.)
OXIDIZED CAP ROCK  Bedrock weathering in the near-surface
environment produces an oxidized and hydrated zone on which soil
may be developed. In general it mimics the surface topography. In
the Skytop excavation the oxidized cap rock extended to depths of
approximately 40 feet near the crest and thinned toward the slopes.
This zone of alteration includes the conversion of potentially toxic
sulfide minerals to benign oxides and hydroxides and is referred to as
the "oxidized cap rock." The depth of the alteration interface varies
with rock type, bedding attitude, fracture density, slope angle, climate,
and erosion rate and in chemical terms represents a redox (reductionoxidation)
front between oxidizing and reducing conditions. There is a
complex relationship between the fluctuating groundwater table and
the redox front. Oxidized cap rock may be stripped off by rapid erosion
or mass wasting (e.g., landslides) to directly expose fresh bedrock.
Gossans are developed in oxidized cap rock over sulfide deposits. In
the Skytop excavation, the oxidized cap rock extended to depths of
approximately 40 feet near the crest and thinned toward the slopes.
PYRITE  An iron sulfide mineral characterized by a brassy/pale yellow
color and metallic luster that superficially resembles gold. If the
crystals are large enough to be visible, pyrite is typically seen as
small cubes. Finer-grained pyrite occurs as dispersed, isolated crystals
(nearly invisible) in a rock matrix or as aggregates of very small crystals
that may coat fracture openings in rock or construction materials.
Massive deposits of pyrite include small to large (greater than one
centimeter) cubic crystals, or rarely very small "whisker" crystals, that
comprise veins in bedrock. These veins form in fractures, long after
the bedrock itself is consolidated. Such pyrite (and related sulfide
minerals such as galena and sphalerite) is referred to as "epigenetic."
Pyrite associated with coal deposits is considered to be "syngenetic";
it formed contemporaneously with the coal and normally occurs in
layered (bedded) form. (See photos below.)
§ 153-34.3.1 PATTON CODE § 153-34.3.1
123:456
PYRITIC ROCK  The term shall be deemed to include pyrite, pyritebearing
rock and sulfur-bearing rock or minerals.
D. Inspection and testing. No excavation shall be performed except upon
submission of a report by an individual licensed, trained and
experienced in the practice of geotechnical engineering certifying that
the site has been investigated and tested for the potential presence of
pyritic rock and, thus, the potential for acid rock drainage in
accordance with the following. Any prescribed testing shall be
performed in accordance with methods of common practice unless
otherwise stated. See also the flow chart in Appendix 5,168 which
provides a visual depiction of the process and requirements contained
within these regulations.
(1) Preexcavation. The following procedure shall be required prior to
any excavation of the site:
(a) Soils identification. Prior to proceeding with excavation, the
soil types of the project lands must be identified and mapped.
See also the flow chart in Appendix 5 and Map 1 in Appendix
6,169 which provides an illustration of the general location of
the relevant soil types as per the Centre County Soil Survey.
[1] Soil types shall be illustrated on any required subdivision
or land development plan and/or shall be documented as
part of any applicable Patton Township permit application.
[2] If any of the following noted soil types are present, these
regulations shall apply: Hazleton, Laidig, Buchanan,
Andover, Murrill, Clarksburg.
[3] If none of the above soil types are present, proceed with
the excavation in accordance with customary procedure
and applicable Patton Township Code. The regulations of
this section shall not apply.
(b) Review geologic literature and maps associated with the site
and contact local expertise, including the PA DEP, the geology
department of Pennsylvania State University, and local
consultants.
(c) Visual inspection. Visually inspect ground surface areas of the
site for the following identifiers of the potential for ARD:
168. Editor's Note: Appendix 5 is included at the end of this chapter.
169. Editor's Note: Appendixes 5 and 6 are included at the end of this chapter.
§ 153-34.3.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3.1
123:457
gossans and/or oxidized cap rock, drainage seeps and/or
surface waters, distressed vegetation, efflorescent
mineralization.
[1] Note the results of the visual inspection.
[2] If seeps and/or surface waters are present on any portion
of a tract of land affected by the excavation, any such
seeps and/or surface waters must be tested in accordance
with § 153-34.3.1D(1)(d), Testing of seeps and surface
waters, below.
[3] Depending on the presence or absence of one or more of
the above identifiers, further evaluation will be
determined in accordance with § 153-34.3.1D(1)(d),
Testing of seeps and surface waters, and
§ 153-34.3.1D(1)(e), Analysis and procedure.
(d) Testing of seeps and surface waters. All seeps and surface
waters located on the project site must be tested in accordance
with the following analytical indicators of the potential for
ARD:
[1] pH. Customary pH testing shall be performed at multiple
points on any seeps and/or surface waters located within
100 feet from any edge of a proposed excavation. The
testing shall be conducted at least two times prior to
proposed excavation and at three-month intervals between
samplings. The number of testing samples and locations
shall correspond to methods of common practice.
[a] If the pH of any sample is less than 4, this shall be
considered a positive indicator for the potential of
ARD.
[b] If the pH of any sample source is less than 4 and the
source exists in close proximity to distressed
vegetation and/or the presence of efflorescent
mineralization, proceed immediately to § 153-34.3.1E,
Positive identification: potential acid rock drainage.
[2] Specific conductance (EC25). Elevated conductivity shall
be considered a positive indicator for the potential of ARD.
(e) Analysis and procedure.
[1] If any one of the visual indicators is present, it shall not
alone be deemed sufficient to require the additional
testing of § 153-34.3.1D(2)(c), Additional testing
requirements.
[2] If the pH result of any water sample is less than 4 and one
or more visual indicators are present anywhere on site,
§ 153-34.3.1 PATTON CODE § 153-34.3.1
123:458
proceed to § 153-34.3.1D(2)(c), Additional testing
requirements.
[3] If results do not indicate a potential for pyritic rock and/or
ARD, proceed to § 153-34.3.1D(1)(a), Soils identification.
(2) During excavation. If pre-excavation inspection and testing yields
negative results, the next process in determining the appropriate
course of action is based upon the extent of the planned excavation.
Topographic settings and subsurface conditions are integral to this
determination. See § 153-34.3.1B(2), Background, for additional
information.
(a) Excavation of soil only.
[1] If the deepest extent of excavation will not disturb earth
materials beyond the soils, the type(s) of soils present will
determine whether or not further evaluation is necessary
as noted herein.
[2] If any of the following soil types are present, proceed with
the excavation in accordance with these regulations:
Hazleton, Laidig, Buchanan, Andover, Murrill, Clarksburg.
(b) Excavation to or beneath bedrock. If the deepest extent of
excavation will disturb earth materials to the point of exposing
or disturbing the bedrock, proceed in accordance with the
following. During excavation, continue to visually inspect the
excavated materials for the presence of gossan and/or oxidized
cap rock.
[1] Positive results. If gossan or oxidized cap rock is present in
the excavated materials, proceed immediately to
§ 153-34.3.1E, Positive identification: potential acid rock
drainage.
[2] Negative results. If gossan or oxidized cap rock is not
present, analyze the excavated soils for total sulfur in
accordance with § 153-34.3.1D(2)(c), Additional testing
requirements.
[a] If total sulfur is detected, proceed to § 153-34.3.1E,
Positive identification: potential acid rock drainage.
[b] If the bedrock has been disturbed and no sulfides are
present, proceed with excavation.
[c] If the bedrock is fresh, has not yet been disturbed, but
will be disturbed by further excavation:
[i] Analyze excavated materials located beyond the
bedrock for total sulfur in accordance with
§ 153-34.3.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3.1
123:459
§ 153-34.3.1D(2)(c), Additional testing
requirements.
[ii] If total sulfur is detected, proceed to
§ 153-34.3.1E, Positive identification: potential
acid rock drainage.
(c) Additional testing requirements. When required herein, these
tests shall be performed by a person or persons trained and
experienced in such testing and analysis. Furthermore, all
excavation activities must cease during the testing and
analysis prescribed below. The person or persons performing
the testing shall first contact the Patton Township Manager
and the PA DEP within 24 hours following discovery or in a
good faith effort to do so as soon as possible following
discovery that these testing requirements shall apply. A report
of the findings shall be provided to applicable federal, state
and/or local agencies upon completion of the testing. For
additional reference, see also Coal Mine Drainage Prediction
and Pollution Prevention in Pennsylvania, published by the PA
DEP in October 1998, and "The Need for Interdisciplinary
Interaction in Route Planning and Site Characterization to
Avoid Acid Rock Drainage and Road Bed Heave," by Gold,
Doden and Scheetz, 2008. Much of the information contained
in those documents is relevant to acid rock drainage in
general.
[1] Total sulfur. For validity purposes relevant to acid-base
accounting, analyze for total sulfur.
[2] Acid-base accounting and potential peroxide acidity:
proceed with assessment through static acid-base
accounting.
[a] If net neutralization potential is greater than - 5, and
PPA greater than 10, it is deemed that ARD is likely to
form in the absence of special handling procedures.
Proceed to § 153-34.3.1E, Positive identification:
potential acid rock drainage.
[b] If test results do not indicate a potential for ARD,
proceed in accordance with § 153-34.3.1D(3), Post
excavation.
(3) Post excavation.
(a) Following excavation, the site should be continuously visually
monitored for the presence of efflorescent mineralization.
When mineral blooms, yellow to white in color, appear and
dissolve with following rains, this is a clear indication of pyritic
rock being present in the excavated material.
§ 153-34.3.1 PATTON CODE § 153-34.3.1
123:460
(b) If mineral blooms occur, contact the Patton Township Manager
and the PA DEP within 24 hours following discovery or in a
good faith effort to do so as soon as possible following
discovery.
E. Positive identification: potential acid rock drainage.
(1) When, at any time, the findings of inspection and testing indicate
the presence or potential for pyritic rock and/or ARD, the project
manager or other authorized project personnel shall contact the
Patton Township Manager and the PA DEP within 24 hours
following discovery or in a good faith effort to do so as soon as
possible following discovery and prior to resuming excavation
activities in order to determine any special handling procedures
that may be required.
(2) Any further action shall be undertaken only in accordance with any
requirements contained herein and any additional requirements
imposed by said federal and/or state agencies.
(3) The future status of the project shall be determined by any and all
applicable federal, state and/or local agencies. Verification of
reviews and approvals, as necessary, shall be submitted to Patton
Township for review prior to resuming excavation activities.
F. Exemptions. The following activities shall be deemed exempt from the
requirements contained herein:
(1) Lands not containing any of the following soil types: Hazleton,
Laidig, Buchanan, Andover, Murrill, Clarksburg.
(2) Residential projects limited to the construction of one single-family
detached dwelling and/or related accessory structures, driveways
and other uses accessory to an existing single primary residential
structure, whether or not one or more acres of land is disturbed,
unless such a project requires that an NPDES permit be issued by
the PA DEP. If an NPDES permit is required, these regulations shall
apply.
(3) Drinking water, geothermal or other wells drilled in accordance
with the Centre Region Building Safety and Property Maintenance
Code, 2010 Edition, as per § 127-3 of the Patton Township Code,
and as amended.
(4) Any activity that does not incorporate any excavation as defined
herein.
(5) Any oil and gas drilling and exploration, surface or subsurface
mining operation already regulated by Pennsylvania state law.
G. Indemnity. The owner and/or developer shall agree to hold the
municipality harmless from and against any and all claims, causes of
action, damages and judgments arising out of the presence or
§ 153-34.3.1 (RESERVED) § 153-34.3.1

discharge of any hazardous substances which existed on or under
the subject property prior to the date of first excavation or earth
disturbance completed in accordance with any and all local, state and/
or federal regulatory requirements.
H. Residential guide.
(1) Although residential excavation activities are exempt from these
regulations when those activities are limited to the construction of
one single-family detached dwelling and/or related accessory
structures, driveways and other uses accessory to an existing
single primary residential structure, and an NPDES permit is not
required, it is highly recommended that a landowner proceed in a
manner similar to that which is provided herein.
(2) Please see Appendix 7, A Residential Guide to Excavations and
Pyritic Rock.170 This guide is meant to assist landowners with a set
of recommended procedures when pyritic rock is known or
suspected to exist on site. The procedures set forth in the guideline
are highly advised, though not required.
A. Specific intent. Where feasible, Patton Township encourages the
preservation of preexisting, healthy, noninvasive vegetation through the
development process, especially if that vegetation is mature trees.
Already established trees and plants can reach maturity sooner and
thus improve stormwater retention and effectively shade parking lots
and buildings earlier. However, construction activity must avoid
polluting or compacting the soil around these plants if they are to
survive. Hence, the following regulations are intended to protect trees
designated by the developer for preservation from the construction
process. They are also intended to require the preservation of existing
mature, healthy trees within buffer yards, where buildings are
prohibited.
B. Any tree that exists before development but is proposed for
preservation through the development process shall be noted on
subdivision/land development plans, unless that tree is part of a group
more than 50 feet away from development activities. Tree protection
zones shall be delineated on plans and marked on the ground around
each of these designated trees during construction using a fence or
similar barrier, so as to protect the tree's canopy and root zones from
soil compaction, excavation damage, or hazardous materials.
C. Prior to the start of any site work, the fences or barriers that mark the
tree protection zones must be erected. They must remain in place until
170. Editor's Note: Appendix 7 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 153-34.3.1 PATTON CODE § 153-34.4
123:462
the project is completed, unless crossed as specified under Subsection
D below.
D. The tree protection zones shall be delineated no closer to the trees
designated for protection than their driplines (i.e., the area underneath
their branches and leaves). Activities inside of the tree protection zones
shall be regulated as follows:
(1) Excavation or digging shall be prohibited within a radius of the tree
designated for protection equal to one foot for each inch of the
tree's diameter measured at breast height (54 inches above grade).
(2) Temporary haul roads for construction may only pass within the
tree protection zones if a PennDOT Class IV geotextile base is
installed covered with six inches minimum of mulch, wood chips or
gravel to protect the soil from compaction. The roadbed material
shall be replenished as necessary to maintain this six-inch
minimum depth.
(3) Storage of materials is prohibited within a radius of the tree
designated for protection equal to two feet for each inch of the
tree's diameter measured at breast height (54 inches above grade).
The storage or spillage of hazardous materials, such as fuel, is
banned within this area.
(4) No vehicles shall be parked within the tree protection zones.
Vehicles may only cross these zones on temporary roads
constructed as required above.
(5) Temporary foot traffic during construction shall be kept to a
minimum within the tree protection zones. If foot traffic within
these zones is necessary, a temporary pathway shall be installed
using a PennDOT Class IV Geotextile base covered with no less
than three inches of mulch, wood chips or gravel to protect the soil
from compaction. The pathway material shall be replenished as
necessary to maintain this three-inch minimum depth.
(6) PennDOT Class IV geotextile shall be considered a viable
alternative to the required subbase where curbs and sidewalks
must be installed within tree protection zones.
(7) Erosion control devices shall be designed and installed to prevent
siltation and/or erosion from occurring within tree protection
zones.
(8) Trees that are to be removed shall be felled so as to fall away from
tree protection zones and to avoid pulling or breaking the roots or
branches of trees that are designated for preservation through the
development process.

§ 153-34.5. Protection of required trees and shrubs. [Added
7-16-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-498]
§ 153-34.6. Riparian buffers. [Added 2-10-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-517]
Under the authority of Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution,
Act 247, the Municipalities Planning Code as amended,171 other
Commonwealth and federal statutes, and in recognition of the fact that
natural features contribute to the welfare of its residents, the following
riparian buffer regulations have been enacted to provide an additional set
of measures on top of existing regulations to implement reasonable controls
governing the restoration, conservation, disturbance, and management of
existing riparian corridors.
E. Within any required buffer yards or screening, all existing, mature,
healthy trees must be preserved unless a sidewalk, trail, roadway or
utility cannot reasonably avoid them.
A. Specific intent. Patton Township prefers to see the trees and shrubs
that are required by the buffering, screening, or landscaping
requirements of the Patton Township Code grow to a mature size,
normal pruning and trimming aside. At maturity, the aesthetic,
environmental, stormwater retention, shading, and cooling benefits of
these trees to both the involved development and the Township as a
whole will be maximized. But the Township understands that disease,
damage, or death may require some vegetation to be removed. This
section is intended to regulate when and how required trees and shrubs
may be removed and replaced.
B. Each tree or shrub that is required to be planted to meet the
landscaping, screening, or buffering requirements of this Code and
shown on an approved subdivision and/or land development plan shall
be maintained, unless the plant is significantly damaged, diseased, or
overtly hazardous to human life or property. Only in these
circumstances may the required vegetation be removed, and it must be
replaced with plants of the same type (shrub, understory tree, or
canopy tree), at no less than the originally installed size, within six
months.
A. Applicability.
(1) These riparian buffer regulations shall apply to all subdivisions and
land developments of existing properties for which a plan must be
submitted to the Township for approval by the Board of Supervisors
in accordance with Article II and any and all other applicable
regulations.
171. Editors Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 153-34.4 PATTON CODE § 153-34.6
123:464
(2) Within the riparian buffer, all existing zoning, land use, and
building regulations now in place continue to apply except where
the regulations of this section are stronger or more restrictive.
(3) Any riparian buffer preservation and maintenance shall remain the
sole responsibility of each individual property owner.
(4) No action shall be required of landowners of property containing
existing structures when no subdivision or land development of
that property is proposed.
(5) Adoption of these regulations does not grant public access to
private property. Any grant of public access remains the
prerogative of each individual property owner.
B. Definitions. The definitions set forth below shall be applicable to this
section.
AGRICULTURAL USE  An enterprise that is actively engaged in the
commercial production and preparation for market of crops, livestock
and livestock products and in the production, harvesting and
preparation for market or use of agricultural, agronomic, horticultural,
silvicultural and aqua cultural crops and commodities. The term
includes an enterprise that implements changes in production practices
and procedures or types of crops, livestock, livestock products or
commodities produced consistent with practices and procedures that
are normally engaged by farmers or are consistent with technological
development within the agricultural industry. The term also includes
agricultural activities and/or Penn State University research intended
to demonstrate or implement technological changes in the agricultural
industry.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Structural or nonstructural
stormwater facilities and techniques to maintain or improve the water
quality of surface runoff or reduce the quantity of surface runoff in
order to mitigate flooding, pollution and reduce soil loss and water
quality degradation caused by nutrients, animal wastes, toxins,
sediments and runoff.
FLOODPLAIN  Areas adjacent to a stream or river that are subject
to flooding or inundation during severe storm events (often called a
one-hundred-year floodplain). It would include the area or flooding that
occurs, on average, once every 100 years.
FORESTRY  The management of forests and timberlands when
practiced in accordance with accepted silvicultural principles, through
developing, cultivating, harvesting, transporting and selling of trees
for commercial purposes, which does not involve any kind of land
development.
LEVEL SPREADER  A device used to disperse concentrated
stormwater flow uniformly over the ground surface as sheet flow.
§ 153-34.6 (RESERVED) § 153-34.6
123:465
NATURALIZED STORMWATER BASIN  Stormwater control facilities
that are planted with native vegetation rather than maintained as
hardscape or lawn.
NUTRIENT  A substance that provides food or nourishment, such
as usable proteins, vitamins, minerals or carbohydrates. Fertilizers,
particularly phosphorus and nitrogen, are the most common nutrients
that contribute to eutrophication.
PLANTING REGION  That area comprising the first 35 feet of the
riparian buffer and within which required plantings must be installed,
unless otherwise noted.
RIPARIAN BUFFER  That area which borders any body of water
on either (or all) side(s) and which extends for a distance measured
outward from and perpendicular to its defined top of bank or edge, and
within which development is restricted or prohibited.
STREAMBANKS  Physiographic features that normally contain
streams within a channel. The bank is distinct from the streambed,
which is normally wetted and provides a substrate that supports
aquatic organisms.

stream or watercourse for temporary and/or permanent use as a means
of ingress and egress, livestock, or construction and/or agricultural
vehicles.
STREAM, INTERMITTENT  Surface water drainage channels with
definite bed and banks in which there is not a permanent flow of water.
Stormwater management facilities and their related appurtenances
constructed as part of a site development project are not considered
streams. Constructed drainageways including water bars, swales, and
roadside ditches may be considered streams based on interpretation of
Township staff and/or expert opinion. (See also "stream, perennial.")
STREAM, PERENNIAL  Surface water drainage channels with
definite bed and banks in which there is a permanent flow of water.
Stormwater management facilities and their related appurtenances
constructed as part of a site development project are not considered
streams. Constructed drainageways including water bars, swales, and
roadside ditches may be considered streams based on interpretation of
township staff and/or expert opinion. (See also "stream, intermittent.")
STRUCTURE  For the purposes of this regulation, anything
constructed or erected on a property which requires location on the
ground or upon something fixed to the ground.
TOP OF BANK  The point along a streambank where an abrupt
change in slope is evident, and where the stream is generally able to
overflow the banks and enter the adjacent floodplain during flows at or
exceeding the average annual high water stage.
TOTAL BUFFER WIDTH  The sum of the widths of all zones or regions
comprising a riparian buffer.

development of a property that touches or is at least partially
located within the planting region of the riparian buffer, a
vegetated buffer shall be installed as follows.
(a) Planting region: Required vegetation shall be installed within a
thirty-five-foot-wide area nearest the stream. This shall be
referred to as the planting region.
(b) Type.
[1] Required: trees and/or shrubs. Required plantings shall be
installed within the thirty-five-foot-wide planting region.
[2] Recommended: grasses, sedges and perennials. Though
not required to be installed, the planting of grasses,
sedges and perennials outside the thirty-five-foot-wide
planting region is recommended. If planted, they should be
spaced approximately one to three feet apart or per
nursery recommendations. See Appendix 3.172
(c) Density. The required quantity of plantings shall be derived
based on the following formula:

123:468
Length of Buffera x 35b x 700c / 43,560d = Total Required
Plantings
a = length of stream frontage located within the riparian
buffer
b = width of planting region
c = required number of seedlings per acre
d = square feet per acre
(d) Size.
[1] Required: containerized seedlings and/ or bare root
seedlings of any size.
[2] Substitutions: whether existing or newly planted as part of
these requirements, one tree or shrub of a recommended
species:
[a] Greater than 0.75 inch in caliper, but less than 1.5
inches in caliper may be substituted for three
seedlings.
[b] Greater than or equal to 1.5 inches in caliper may be
substituted for five seedlings.
(e) Species: A minimum of four and a maximum of 12
recommended species shall be planted. For recommended
species, see Appendix 1.173
(f) Spacing: Recommended random spacing between trees is
based on plant size at installation as follows.
[1] Seedlings: six to 10 feet.
[2] Tree or shrub greater than 0.75 inch in caliper, but less
than 1.5 inches in caliper: 14 to 16 feet.

tall.
173. Editors Note: Appendix 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 153-34.6 (RESERVED) § 153-34.6
123:469
[ii] The tree shelter shall be installed with a
hardwood or bamboo stake a minimum of 42
inches or 3.5 feet tall.
[b] Greater than or equal to 1.5 inches in caliper: No
protection is required.
(h) Maintenance. Maintenance shall remain the sole responsibility
of each individual property owner and should be performed
according to the following.

only use shelters with a high likelihood of allowing trees to
burst out with no damage.
[2] Tree shelters should be maintained and replaced as
needed.
[3] The landowner should hire a qualified professional to
apply herbicide with the initial planting and once yearly
for three years after planting.
[a] First application: one year after planting.
[b] Second application: two years after planting.
[c] Third application: three years after planting.
[4] Where possible, the landowner should mow non-herbicide
alleyways between rows of trees where rodents are a
problem. This mowing should be done each fall for the first
three years following planting. Mowing may not be
beneficial if a large number of trees are destroyed in the
process. Mowing should be site specific.
[5] In addition to mowing, maintenance should include
mulching and the replacement of mulch as needed, the
removal of invasive species (See Appendix 2.174) and the
removal of dead trees.
[6] Landowners should strive to achieve a survival rate after
three years equal to at least 70% of the number of original
plantings. If, after three years, less than 70% of the trees
have survived, additional trees should be planted to meet
the seventy-percent standard.
[7] Details for the above are related to the Conservation
Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) and clarified in
"Establishment and Maintenance Guidance for CREP
Participants and Contractors" and "CREP CP 22 Herbicide
Recommendations for Weed Management."

(i) Exceptions.
[1] Limited land area in planting region:
[a] Required plantings shall be installed within the
planting region if possible. In the event that it can be
demonstrated that it is not possible to plant all
required vegetation within the planting region, the
following shall apply.
[i] The remaining trees or shrubs shall be planted in
the next available location closest to the planting
region. If it can be demonstrated that the next
available location does not lie within the sixty-fivefoot
riparian buffer, no further vegetation shall be
required beyond that which can be installed in
accordance with the spacing recommendations
herein.
[ii] If it can be demonstrated that only 50% or less of
the total required vegetation can be installed in
the planting region:
[A] The remaining vegetation may be reduced by
50% and installed as per above; or
[B] The remaining vegetation may be installed as
grasses and sedges as per § 153-34.6D(2)(b)
and Appendix 3.175
[b] Examples of situations that might prevent
replacement of vegetation include, but may not be
limited to, the presence of existing vegetation
immediately adjacent to and surrounding the site, or
existing sensitive areas that could be negatively
impacted by the installation of vegetation.
[2] Wetlands. The installation of a vegetated buffer around
wetlands is not required; however, existing vegetation
shall be preserved.
(3) Existing vegetation. Existing vegetation shall be preserved, with
the exception of identified invasive species which should be
removed and monitored on a regular basis. (See Appendix 2.176)
Existing vegetation shall be deemed as meeting the vegetation
requirements of § 153-34.6D(2) as follows.
(a) Invasive species shall not be counted towards meeting the

planting density requirement of § 153-34.6D(2), the remaining
density shall be installed as required herein.
E. Development regulations.
(1) Within the riparian buffer.
(a) Improvements or modifications to existing structures.
[1] When an existing structure lies entirely or partly within
the riparian buffer, and improvements or modifications to
the existing structure will also lie entirely or partly within
the riparian buffer, said improvements or modifications
shall be permitted, provided that the portion that will lie
within the riparian buffer involves less than 50% of the fair
market value and less than 50% of the square footage as
existed on the date of original enactment of this section,
and whether proposed initially or cumulatively.
[2] A vegetated buffer shall be installed in accordance with
§ 153-34.6D(2).
(b) New structures. With the exception of improvements or
modifications to existing structures as permitted herein, new
structures are prohibited within the riparian buffer.
(c) Stream-access paths. As part of a new buffer installation, or
where stream access is restricted by an existing buffer, streamaccess
paths may be created for the purpose of passage to the
stream from outlying areas as follows. (For stream-crossing
standards, see § 153-34.6F below.)
[1] Quantity:
[a] Lot width at stream frontage less than or equal to 100
feet: one access per property.
[b] Lot width at stream frontage greater than 100 feet:
one access per 100 feet of stream frontage.

§ 153-34.6 PATTON CODE § 153-34.6
123:472
[3] Design: To the extent that it is possible, access routes
should be designed to cross the buffer at a direct right
angle to minimize disturbance.
[4] Wearing surface: may remain in its natural state or be
improved with other pervious material.
(2) Outside the riparian buffer. New construction on lands located
outside the riparian buffer is permitted in accordance with all other
existing local, state and federal land use laws. However, when
those lands are part of a parcel which touches or is at least partially
located within the riparian buffer, and a subdivision or land
development plan must be submitted for approval by the Board of
Supervisors prior to construction, a vegetated buffer shall be
installed within the riparian buffer in accordance with
§ 153-34.6D(2).
F. Stream crossings. Any and all local, state and federal regulations
pertaining to stream crossings must be strictly adhered to. In addition,
the following minimum standards are recommended.

greater than the minimum required by Patton Township, unless
additional right-of-way is offered for dedication to the
Township.
(b) Design. Stream crossings should be designed to cross at direct
right angles to minimize disturbance.
(c) Separation distance. When multiple stream crossings are
proposed on the same property, they should be separated by a
minimum of 1,000 feet.
G. Plan requirements. In addition to all other plan requirements of the
Township, a planting plan showing the following information shall be
part of any plans submitted to the Township for approval.

§ 153-34.6 (RESERVED) § 153-34.6
123:473
§ 153-34.7. Colluvial soils. [Added 7-18-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-544]
(f) Location of any proposed stream crossings.
A. Intent. On lands identified as having slopes of 15% or greater and
comprised of colluvial soils, severe limitations exist or may exist for
development activities, including, but not limited to, structures with or
without basements, septic tank absorption fields, and local roads and
streets. "Colluvial soils" refers to those soils having been formed on
colluvium, which consists of loosely consolidated or fragmented earth
materials typically associated with moderate to steep slopes. The
Centre County Soil Survey identifies the following soil series as being
colluvial in nature or closely associated with colluvial soils: Andover,
Buchanan, and Laidig. It is the intent of the regulations set forth herein
to regulate development activities occurring on slopes of 15% or
greater and comprised of any one or more of the above soils to:
(1) Identify the location of the most severe soil areas where
development is not appropriate;
(2) Minimize the potential for damage from erosion, sedimentation and
to minimize other degradation to lands or sensitive environmental
features;
(3) Protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Patton
Township.
B. Applicability. The following regulations shall apply to any parcel of land
containing colluvial soils as defined herein and where those soils are
situated on slopes of 15% or greater in grade. Where steep slopes exist
without colluvial soils, or where colluvial soils are present in areas not
identified as steep slopes, these regulations do not apply. Please note
that, although there may be locations that contain colluvial soils that do
not fall under the scope of these regulations, any development on or
near any area that contains colluvial soils should be undertaken with
caution and through consultation with a registered professional
engineer.
C. Definitions. The definitions set below shall be applicable to this section.
BUILDABLE AREA  That portion of a building lot consisting of the
proposed footprint for any structure, access, on-lot disposal system,
and any required replacement area; and all land disturbances
associated with any construction activity.
COLLUVIAL SOILS  Soils having formed on colluvium consisting of
loosely consolidated or fragmented earth materials typically associated
with moderate to steep slopes. For the purposes of these regulations,
this shall include Andover, Buchanan, and Laidig.
COLLUVIUM  A deposit of soil and rock debris accumulated through
the action of gravity at the base of a slope.
§ 153-34.6 PATTON CODE § 153-34.7
123:474
DRAINAGEWAY  The natural or man-made path of surface water from
a given area.
SEEP  A type of spring. Groundwater flows gradually to the surface
at a slower rate than a spring.
SPRING  A concentrated discharge of groundwater emerging and
flowing at the ground surface, including perched water flow from the
soil.
D. Septic system approval. As part of the soils testing for the entire site,
the testing for septic systems must be accomplished. The septic
systems must be approved by the Township's Sewage Enforcement
Officer in conformity with the rules, policies, regulations and
specifications of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
E. Mapping. In order to determine the likelihood for the presence of
colluvial soils, the Centre County Soil Survey should be consulted. The
Survey illustrates all the soil series that are found throughout Patton
Township and provides an accurate basis for further soils identification
and mapping. Soils and topographic mapping shall be performed by a
qualified, licensed professional and illustrated on any required
subdivision or land development plan in accordance with the following.
See also Appendix 1,177 which provides a map illustrating the general
location of steep slopes and colluvial soils in the Township.
(1) Soils. Any Andover, Buchanan, and Laidig soils shall be mapped,
and a report of the findings shall be submitted and shall include a
list of all limitations associated with each soil type as per the
Centre County Soil Survey.
(a) In order to accomplish the soils mapping, the developer must
meet with the Township's Engineer or a designated agent to
determine, at a minimum, the location, number and type of soil
test pits that will provide a representative sample of the soils
present within the area intended to be disturbed.
(b) An on-site soils assessment and report preparation must be
completed and submitted by a qualified soil scientist or
registered professional with the appropriate experience in soil
science interpretation, subject to approval by the Township
Engineer or designated agent.
(c) The soils assessment report will provide the data necessary to
prepare a detailed soils map of the site that will allow the
applicant to determine the potential to provide roads,
driveways and/or structures in accordance with these
regulations and whether there is sufficient buildable area to do
so.
177. Editor's Note: Appendix 1 is on file in the Township offices.
§ 153-34.7 (RESERVED) § 153-34.7
123:475
(d) For those properties or sites where the above required soils
assessment report definitively indicates that the proposed land
disturbance activities will not be impacted by the location of
colluvial soils, the remainder of the requirements of these
regulations shall not be applicable.
(2) Slopes. Slopes equal to or exceeding 15% in grade shall be mapped.
In any application for subdivision and/or land development
purposes, the applicant shall, using two-foot contours, delineate all
slopes meeting or exceeding 15% in grade.
(3) Upon completion of the soils and topographic mapping, an area
shall be identified on the plan clearly illustrating the buildable area
of the parcel. The buildable area shall include the proposed
footprint of any structure, accessways, on-lot disposal system(s)

associated with any construction activity.
F. Criteria for subdivision and development. The following criteria will
determine the ability to, and establish the process for, the subdivision of
land or development of land on parcels to which these regulations
apply. The criteria are intended to address activities that may cause
instability such as cut and fill processes, runoff from development and
disturbance of natural drainage patterns. These criteria apply to land
disturbance involving the construction of habitable structures, the
installation of paved driveways and the construction of roads which are
used for access to a dwelling unit or units.
(1) Drainageways and sinkholes.
(a) No land disturbance shall occur within 100 feet of a defined
drainageway.
(b) The required separation distance may be reduced as the result
of a hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each specific
site and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal permits
associated with the proposed development activity.
(2) Floodplain.
(a) No land disturbance shall occur within 100 feet of the edge of a
floodplain or the Floodplain Conservation District as per
§ 175-28.
(b) This distance may be reduced for areas where there is a
minimum rise of 5% between the edge of the floodplain and the
area of earth disturbance. Where such reduction in distance is
desired, information shall be provided to assure that an
adequate separation has been provided.
§ 153-34.7 PATTON CODE § 153-34.7
123:476
(3) Slope. No land disturbance shall occur within 100 feet downgrade
of any area with a slope of 15% or more that is comprised of
colluvial soils.
(4) Seeps and springs.
(a) No land disturbance shall occur within 100 feet of a defined
spring.
(b) This required separation distance may be reduced as the result
of a hydrological analysis of the characteristics of each specific
site and/or the issuance of appropriate state or federal permits
associated with the proposed development activity.
(5) Wetlands.
(a) No land disturbance shall occur within 50 feet of the edge of a
wetland as defined herein and/or as established by the PA DEP,
Army Corps of Engineers or other applicable agency.
(b) This distance may be reduced, if necessary, when the
appropriate permits from these state and federal agencies are
obtained. Where such reduction in separation distance is
desired, information shall be submitted that substantiates the
need to reduce the separation distance as well as the
endorsement of the permitting agencies.
(6) Excavation and fill. No excavation or fill that will cause any slope to
become unstable, impose loads that may affect the safety of
structures or slopes, interfere with adequate drainage for the site
area and the drainage area of land tributary to the site, obstruct,
damage, or adversely affect existing sewerage or drainage, cause a
stagnant pond of water to form, or cause erosion or sedimentation
shall be permitted. The following information shall be supplied for
any proposed excavation or fill:
(a) A report from a licensed professional engineer certifying that
such proposed activity will not have any adverse impact noted
above.
(b) The location and details of the proposed excavation or fill.

accordance with the PA Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Manual.
(7) Criteria for land accessed across steep slopes with colluvial soils.
In many cases, access to an area that is developable may not be
possible without crossing colluvial soils. In such cases, the
following requirements shall apply:
§ 153-34.7 (RESERVED) § 153-34.7
123:477
(a) Low-impact driveway or roadway design, in accordance with
the associated PaDOT or other recognized standards
acceptable to the Township Engineer, shall be used.
(b) The proposed location and design of the access shall provide
the least practicable disturbance to the colluvial soils in the
area.
(c) The access is located in conformance with the setback
restrictions associated with wetlands, floodplains, springs,
drainageways, and watercourses as referenced above.
(d) Where conformance with existing setbacks and the standards
required herein reduces the buildable area for the access to
the extent that such access cannot be built in accordance with
Township regulations, the access may extend into a setback
area in accordance with the following:
[1] When the setback is a requirement of Chapter 153,
Subdivision and Land Development, or other chapter not
being Chapter 175, Zoning, only the minimum relief
necessary to accomplish the construction of the access
shall be permitted.
[a] This relief shall be granted either in the form of a
waiver or modification of requirements.
[b] Evidence that the location and design of the access is
not adversely impacted by its proximity to any
features to which the setback/s apply shall be
provided.
[2] When the setback is a requirement of Chapter 175,
Zoning, relief from the setback shall only be granted by
way of a variance subject to the requirements of Article
XII.
[3] The applicant shall provide a hold-harmless agreement
and indemnification in favor of the Township for any

NOTES:
Gross Floor Area (G.F.A.)  The sum of the gross horizontal areas
of the several floors of a building measured from the exterior face
of exterior walls or from the center line of a wall separating two
buildings, but not including interior parking spaces, loading space
for motor vehicle or any space where the floor-to-ceiling height is
less than six feet.
Maximum Design Capacity (M.D.C.)  The actual number of
occupants for whom each occupied space, floor or building is
designed.
Off-street parking for future building expansion on any land
development shall remain as landscaped open space until
development of such.
(3) Provisions to reduce required off-street parking spaces. In an effort
to reduce impervious coverage, traffic congestion and allow an
increase in landscaped green space area, the following shall be
considered.
(a) Shared parking spaces that are accessible by neighboring
properties or uses may be permitted when use of the spaces
does not occur during the same daily time period. The
applicant must provide justification showing calculations of the
peak parking use for the spaces that would have overlapping
users during their respective hours of operation. The hours of
operation must show that sufficient spaces would be available
for the shared parking purpose. Should the use change in the
§ 153-38 PATTON CODE § 153-38
123:496
future, and its associated off-street parking, the parking must
be provided as required or shared parking be pursued.
(b) Car-pooling.
[1] When increasing the passengers per vehicle to sites with
high employment would decrease parking demand, relief
in the required parking spaces may occur. The applicant
may utilize one or a combination of the following modes of
transportation to reduce single occupant vehicles:
[a] Shared-ride/car-pooling.
[b] Van pooling.
[c] Subscription bus service(s), public transportation.
[2] As part of the request to reduce parking spaces, the
applicant shall show to the satisfaction of the Township
that the actions proposed shall reduce the parking demand
by the amount requested.
(c) Other options.
[1] At the option of the Township, and requiring approval by
the Supervisors, a reduction of off-street parking spaces
may be considered as follows that would pertain only to
parking at the site fronting arterial roads:
[a] The buffer yard in the front contains unique natural
features as determined by the Township that may
require an area to be wider than the minimum front
buffer.
[b] The buffer yard in the front contains features that
contribute to the community character of the
Township as determined by the Township that may
require area to be wider than the minimum front
buffer.
[c] The requirements of a corridor overlay zone that may
provide for a wider than minimum buffer.
[2] The Township may recommend the reduction in the offstreet
parking spaces associated with increasing the front
buffer yard. The area removed from parking may be
allowed as off-street parking at a future date should the
operator of the use experience a parking shortage based
on demand after the use is in operation for a period
exceeding two years. The requirements of site plan
submission and approval are to be followed. All density
and yard requirements of the zoning ordinance districts
shall be met by this section.
§ 153-38 (RESERVED) § 153-38
123:497
D. Parking lots. For the purposes of this chapter, "parking lots" are defined
as facilities providing off-street parking spaces for five or more motor
vehicles. All parking lots shall meet the design and maintenance
standards specified below.
(1) Dimensions.
(a) All parking spaces shall comply with the dimensions as
specified above. The minimum dimensions of all aisles
providing access to parking lot spaces shall be as follows:
Aisle Width
(Feet)
Angle of Parking
Space to Aisle
(degrees) One-Way Two-Way
Parallel 12 20
30 12 20
45 15 20
60 18 20
90 24 24
(b) No portion of any parking space shall intrude into the required
aisle width. For aisles providing access to parking spaces set at
angles other than those specified above, the required aisle
width shall be that of the nearest specified angle of parking. If
equidistant from specified angles, the greatest aisle width of
the two nearest angles shall apply.
(2) Obstructions. Parking lots shall be designed to permit each motor
vehicle to proceed to and from all unoccupied parking spaces
without requiring the moving of any other parked motor vehicle
and without leaving the lot.
(3) Ingress and egress. Entrance and exit driveways and aisles linking
parking lots to public streets shall comply with the standards for
motor vehicle access stipulated above. Parking spaces shall be
designed to prevent motor vehicles from backing onto a public
street in order to leave the lot.
(4) Location and yard requirements.
(a) All parking lots shall meet the location requirements as
stipulated above. All yards surrounding the parking lot,
exclusive of driveways providing ingress and egress to the lot,
shall be bordered by a concrete (Class A) curb no less than
four-inch high reveled curb along the sides of the yard abutting
§ 153-38 PATTON CODE § 153-38
123:498
the parking lot, including spaces and aisles. Details for curbing
shall be provided by the applicant.
(b) Curbs may be deleted from portions of the parking lots if a part
of a stormwater management plan providing water quality or
groundwater recharge benefits. Wheel stops or other approved
barrier shall be provided in lieu of curbs.
(c) Setback areas shall be planted with grass or other vegetative
material and may include shrubs, fences or walls, provided that
they are not placed closer than three feet to any parking space.
(5) Structures. Utility poles, light standards and similar structures
shall not be permitted within any aisle or parking space. Any
structure located elsewhere within a parking lot shall be
surrounded on all sides abutting the spaces or aisles by a concrete
curb no fewer than four inches in height, separated from the
structure by at least three feet.
(6) Raised islands.
(a) Raised islands shall be installed at the ends of all parking bays
abutting an aisle or driveway. In addition, when parking bays
incorporate more than 10 parking spaces in a continuous row,
a raised island shall be incorporated within the parking bay for
over nine parking spaces. The raised islands shall be bordered
by a concrete curb four inches high (at a minimum). Wherever
it abuts a space or aisle it shall be 10 feet wide and extend the
length of the parking space and/or bay. Islands, when required,
shall include shade trees that are tolerant to the parking lot
environment.
(b) Interior parking lot landscape alternatives. In order to provide
flexibility in parking lot landscaping to reduce heat, glare and
visual expansiveness, the following alternatives shall be
considered and/or combined with interior landscaped islands.
The amount of landscaped open space shall not be less than
what is required in § 153-34A.
[1] Provide a continuous landscape strip between every four
rows of parking. The strip shall be a minimum of eight feet
in width to accommodate a low level landscaping and
shade trees.
[2] Create large planting islands (over 600 square feet) to be
located throughout the lot and planted with shade trees,
low level landscaping and/or ground cover.
[3] The required ratio of landscaped islands (one island per
nine parking stalls) must be maintained but can be utilized
in any combination within the parking area.
§ 153-38 (RESERVED) § 153-38
123:499
(c) In areas where excessive cut and fill is required for parking lot
site development, terraced parking shall be considered in
order to reduce visual expansiveness.
(d) Brick, block, cobblestone concrete and sawn wood blocks or
other similar material shall be used as surface material for
islands where foot traffic is anticipated. These shall be
installed on a permeable base in a manner to allow water
percolation into the ground. Where foot traffic is not a
consideration, any of these paving materials or shrubs and
living ground cover may be used with threes in the islands.
Bituminous concrete shall not be used.
(e) Utility poles and light standards are permitted within the
raised islands, provided that they are separated from the
spaces and aisles.
(f) No islands are required on sixty-foot width or less parking lots,
as long as perimeter planting is used around entire lot.
Whenever a building adjoins on perimeter of said parking lot,
islands shall be required. Trees for the islands shall be of a
deciduous canopy-type or shade-tree type.
(7) Maintenance. All off-street parking areas, including perimeter
plantings and raised islands, shall be maintained in good condition
and kept free of litter and trash. All required pant material which
dies shall be replaces as soon as seasonal conditions occur for the
replacement of the species, within one year.
(8) Drainage. All parking areas shall comply with Chapter 147,
Stormwater Management.
(9) Perimeter planting.
(a) The perimeter of all areas shall be landscaped with living plant
material to a minimum width of 10 feet measured from the
back of the parking area curb towards the property line or
building wall, except where the perimeter is adjacent to a
public street, in which case the minimum width shall be 15
feet. The perimeter planting shall include a combination of
shrubs, deciduous and coniferous trees, all selected to provide
shade and a view restrictive screen for parking areas. Special
consideration should be given to form, color, texture, density,
growth habits and maintenance requirements.
(b) Trees and shrubs shall be an integral part of this perimeter
planting. Walls, earth mounds and fences or any combination
thereof may be included with living plant material to produce a
view-restrictive screen. Highlights of parked vehicles should
be obscured from the public way. Grass or other living ground
cover shall be planted, mulched and maintained on all portions
§ 153-38 PATTON CODE § 153-38
123:500
of the landscaped strip not occupied by other landscape
material.
(c) A minimum of one tree shall be planted within the perimeter
planting area for every 45 feet of the perimeter of the parking
area, exclusive of driveway widths. Required perimeter trees
shall be planted no fewer than 25 feet nor greater than 50 feet
apart. Interior islands within parking lots shall include shade
trees unless the dimension of said island is such that planting a
tree within the island could not be accomplished due to
obscured sight distance.
(10) Tree specifications.
(a) Existing trees, if properly located, may be used to satisfy the
requirement above for perimeter and interior planting.
Existing trees located closer together than the twenty-five-foot
minimum shall, for the purpose of calculating the required
number of trees, be counted as one tree. No required tree shall
be planted closer than 20 feet to an existing columnar tree or
25 feet to an existing tree of other shape.
(b) The size of all trees shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches caliper,
measured six inches above ground level. These shall be planted
a minimum of three feet from the back of any curbing.
(c) All plant material and installation shall follow the American
Standard for Nursery Stock and the Code of Standards
currently recommended by the American Associations of
Nurserymen.
(11) Sight distance. Clear sight triangles, in conformance with
American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials Geometric Design shall be provided at all intersections
between driveways, parking lot aisleways/perimeter roads and
streets. No vision obstructing objects shall be permitted above the
height of 30 inches measured from the center-line grade of the
intersecting streets within such sight triangle.
(12) Building structures and ramps. Motor vehicles parked within,
under or on top of buildings, parking structure or on ramps shall be
screened from public view. On street level, living plant material is
required in the setback areas. Walls, earth mounds, fences or any
combination thereof may also be included with the plant material.
All floors or levels above the street shall be screened by walls,
fences or other approved materials.
(13)Walkways.
(a) Walkways adjacent to or within off-street parking areas shall be
wide enough to provide a minimum of five feet clear horizontal
§ 153-38 (RESERVED) § 153-38
123:501
passenger space exclusive of car overhang, parking meters or
other obstructions.
(b) Walkways shall comply with the design and construction of
standards of § 149-38.

Transportation Impact Report Requirements
[Added 3-8-1995 by Ord. No. 95-319]
§ 153-39. When required.
§ 153-40. Applicability.
This article applies only to subdivision and land development activities that
occur after enactment of this chapter.
§ 153-41. Safety or capacity deficiencies.
The Township may also require a transportation impact study because of a
localized safety or capacity deficiency such as:
A. A transportation impact shall be required for any land development
activity that is projected to generate at least 500 trip-ends per day. The
projected number of trip-ends will be determined through use of the
unit trip-end values presented in the latest edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers' (ITE) Trip Generation Manual multiplied by
the size of the proposed development. The Township Engineer will
determine the appropriate ITE land use category to be used for a
proposed development.
B. For phased single-family residential subdivisions, the study must be
submitted when a plan is submitted for Township approval that
subdivides the parent tract(s) to the point at which at least 500 tripends/
day are generated.
C. For phased multifamily, commercial or industrial land development, the
study must be submitted when a land development plan is submitted for
Township approval that would generate at least 500 trip-ends/day from
the parent tract(s).
A. Current traffic problems in the local area, such as a high-accident
location, confusing intersection, or an intersection in need of a traffic
signal.
B. The current or projected level of service of the roadway system
adjacent to the development which will be significantly affected.
C. The sensitivity of the adjacent neighborhoods or other areas that may
be perceived as being impacted.
D. The proximity of existing or proposed site driveways to other driveways
or intersections.
E. The ability of the adjacent, existing or planned roadway system to
handle increased traffic or the feasibility of improving the roadway
system to handle increased traffic.
§ 153-39 (RESERVED) § 153-41
123:503
§ 153-42. Study contents.
The area extent and scope of a proposed transportation impact report
are a function of the size and location of the proposed development. The
exact delineation of the study area, required data collection effort and
required analyses will be determined by Township staff with input from
the developer's consultant. As a minimum, the report shall include the
following:
F. Other specific problems or deficiencies that may be affected by the
proposed development or affect the ability of the development to be
satisfactorily accommodated.
A. A description of existing conditions and traffic volumes for the major
road network within the study area.
B. A base condition analysis shall be prepared to establish existing levels
of service followed by analysis and description of projected traffic
conditions based on the land uses proposed within the development.
Trip generation rates for morning and evening peak hours of the project
shall be prepared, as well as the internal/external trip distribution and
intersection analyses.
C. The report shall evaluate the traffic impacts of the proposed
development and identify the need for road and access and traffic
control measure improvements caused by the proposed development.
D. The analysis shall contain recommended internal and off-site road
improvements. These recommended improvements should be specific
as to location and scope of work required along with a phased schedule
for implementation. Examples of additional items that should be
included in this section are: typical sections for each category of street;
and a phasing plan which delineates the street improvements that will
be provided simultaneously within the construction of each
development phase.
E. Utilization of alternate modes of transportation shall be a component of
the traffic impact analysis. Evaluation of traffic mitigation measures as
they relate to public transportation and future development of the site
should also be addressed.

mitigation in place. Analysis of conditions if
the proposed development is built and
improvements are implemented to mitigate
the impacts.
[E] The study must detail the methods used to
arrive at future traffic projections and must
project traffic impacts at least to the first full
year of operation of the development. If the
proposed development is phased over time,
traffic projections must be prepared for each
phase.
[F] Level of Service D shall be the minimum
acceptable level of service (LOS) for an
intersection approach in the postdevelopment

affected municipalities and the Centre Regional
Planning Commission (CRPC). In order to select the
external road network and intersections to be
analyzed, the intersections analyzed in the district
plan transportation study (DPTS) will be reviewed to
determine which intersections are projected to
operate at Level of Service (LOS) D, E or F. District
plan transportation study intersections that exhibit
LOS E or F will be candidates for inclusion in the
traffic impact study to undergo a more detailed
analysis. District plan transportation study
intersections which exhibit LOS D will also be

amended and restated by Act 32 of 2008, and to do so within the time frame
required by Act 32. Any prior enactment imposing a tax on earned income
or net profits of individuals is amended and restated in its entirety to read
as stated in this enactment. Any other prior enactment or part of any prior
enactment conflicting with the provisions of this enactment is rescinded
insofar as the conflict exists. To the extent the same as any enactment in

in the amount of $52 per annum, beginning the first day of January 2008
and continuing on a calendar basis annually thereafter, until modified or
repealed by a subsequent ordinance. This tax is in addition to all other taxes
of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the municipality.
§ 158-17. Exemptions.
The tax levied by § 158-16 shall not be imposed upon the following persons:
§ 158-18. Collection through employers.
A. Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the United
States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under
honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military
service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple
amputee or has a service-connected disability declared by the United
States Veterans' Administration or its successor to be a total onehundred-
percent permanent disability.
B. Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
calendar year. For purposes of this subsection, "reserve component of
the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army Reserve, United
States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United
States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, the
Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air National
Guard.

sources within the municipality is less than $12,000 for the calendar
year in which the local services tax is levied.
A. Every employer shall, within 15 days after first becoming an employer,
register with the Collector the employer's name, address and such
other information as the Collector may require. Failure to register in a
timely manner does not relieve the employer of the requirements of this
article.
B. As to each taxpayer employed for any length of time during any payroll
period of an employer during the calendar year, each employer shall
deduct a pro rata share of the tax from the earned income payable to
the taxpayer with respect to such payroll period. The pro rata share of
the tax assessed on a taxpayer for a payroll period shall be determined
by dividing the rate of the tax ($52) levied for the calendar year by the
number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar
year. For purposes of determining the pro rata share of the tax, an
employer shall round down the amount of tax deducted for each payroll
period to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar.
C. Each employer shall file a return on a form prescribed by the Collector
and pay the Collector the full amount of all such taxes deducted during
§ 158-16 (RESERVED) § 158-18

a calendar quarter within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter.
A tax return must be filed for each calendar quarter, regardless of
whether withholdings were completed or any tax liability exists.

calendar year shall, within 15 days after discontinuing business or
ceasing operation, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax
to the Collector.
E. The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the
employee from the duty to file a return and pay the tax. Any employer
who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section or who fails to pay
such tax to the Collector shall be liable for such tax in full, as though the
tax had originally been levied against such employer. No employer shall
be liable for failure to deduct the tax if the failure to deduct the tax
arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the
employee's place or places of employment, the employee's principal
office or where the employee is principally employed.
F. Priority of withholding.
(1) The tax shall be withheld at the place of employment on the first
day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll
period.
(2) In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, i.e.,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the
person working in more than one political subdivision during the
payroll period, the priority to withhold the local services tax shall
be in the following order:
(a) The political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed.
(b) The political subdivision in which the person resides and
works, if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(c) The political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
G. The employer shall not deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate
records concerning the employees in the cases described in § 158-17A,
§ 158-17B and § 158-17C.
(1) It is the intent of this section that no person shall be subject to the
payment of the local services tax in more than one municipality
during each payroll period. No taxpayer shall be required to pay
more than $52 in total during the calendar year. In the case of
concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides:
§ 158-18 PATTON CODE § 158-18
123:534
(a) A recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes
the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and
the amount of local services tax withheld; and
(b) A statement from the employee that the pay statement is from
the employee's principal employer and the employee will notify
other employers of a change in principal place of employment
within two weeks of its occurrence.
(2) In the case of an employee claiming the exemption set forth at
§ 158-17C, an employer shall refrain from withholding the local
services tax if:
(a) The employee has provided an exemption certificate to the
employer;
(b) The Collector has not otherwise instructed the employer;
(c) The employer has not received notification from the person
who claimed the exemption or from the Collector that the
person has received earned income and/or net profits from all
sources within the municipality equal to or in excess of
$12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year; and
(d) The employer has not paid to the person earned income within
the municipality an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in
that calendar year.
(3) If a person has claimed exemption from the tax under § 158-17C for
a given calendar year but either a) the employer has received
notification from the person who claimed the exemption or from the
Collector that the person has received earned income and/or net
profits from all sources within the municipality equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise
ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or b) the
employer has paid to the person earned income within the
municipality an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, then the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year, and the employer shall withhold
from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification described in (item a) above or for the first payroll
period after payments described in (item b) above have been made,
a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from
the person due to the exemption claimed by the person, plus the

Brush, grass and weeds  See Ch. 58.
§ 163-1. Purpose.
In order to preserve the beauty of Patton Township and to protect property
owners' single plantings or stands of trees from diseased trees, it is
necessary that best management practices be required to reduce the spread
of Dutch Elm Disease and Oak Wilt.
§ 163-2. Duty of property owners.
A. Dutch Elm Disease. To reduce the spread of Dutch Elm Disease within
existing American elms (Ulmus Americana) and other species of this
genus, it is necessary to reduce the breeding sites for the two beetles
(Scolytus multistriatus marshan and Hylurgopinus rufipes eichoff) that
transport the pathogen which causes Dutch Elm Disease, i.e.,
Ceratostomella ulmi buisman. The major breeding sites for these
beetles are dead and dying elm trees and logs and debris from cut elm
trees.
B. Oak Wilt. To reduce the spread of the fungal pathogen (Ceratocystis
fagacearum) that causes Oak Wilt, it is necessary to reduce the vectors
for transmission by removing infected oak trees (Quercus spp.) and by
disrupting root grafts that will transmit the fungus from infected oak
trees to uninfected oak trees. Infected trees provide sites that produce
spores for the fungus that may be carried to uninfected oak trees by
insects. In addition, it is necessary to regulate the pruning and spiking
of any oak trees which would provide sites that may be easily infected
by insects. Oak species commonly killed by Oak Wilt in the northern
United States include Black Oak (Q. velutina), Bur Oak (Q. macrocarpa),
Northern Pin Oak (Q. ellipsoidalis), Northern Red Oak (Q. rubra),
Chestnut Oak (Q. montana), and White Oak (Q. alba).
A. It shall be the duty of every property owner in the Patton Township to
remove, treat and dispose of or destroy the following trees from their
property in accordance with the best practices recommended by the
Pennsylvania State University, their Extension Service, or the United
States Department of Agriculture.
(1) Dead and dying elm trees.
(2) Oak trees that have Oak Wilt.
§ 158-59 (RESERVED) § 163-2
123:551
§ 163-3. Report of infested or infected trees; removal by owner.
The Township may or, if a resident of Patton Township provides a report in
writing, shall investigate cases of failure to remove a tree or trees suspected
of being infected by a pathogen specified in § 163-1. If it appears that the
tree or trees are infected by a pathogen specified in § 163-1, or otherwise
appear to be dying from a pathogen specified in § 163-1 or has tested
positive for a pathogen specified in § 163-1, the Township shall instruct the
property owner to remove, treat, and dispose of or destroy the infected
tree or trees within 30 days. A property owner providing plant pathology
test results, conducted in accordance with procedures recommended by
the United States Department of Agriculture, showing the tree to be free
from the suspected pathogen shall be relieved of the duty to remove the
suspected tree.
§ 163-4. Testing and removal by Township.
§ 163-5. Transportation of elm logs through the Township.
It shall be unlawful to transport elm logs through, to, or within Patton
Township in an uncovered vehicle from May 1 to September 1 of each year.
B. It shall be the duty of every property owner; and every arborist,
landscaper, utility company, contractor or other vendor providing tree
care services; in the Patton Township to follow these best practices in
limiting the spread of Oak Wilt by:
(1) Not pruning, nor allowing or permitting others to prune, oak trees
between April 1 and October 31 without sealing the pruning cuts
with a commercial tree paint or wound dressing.
(2) Not climbing, nor allowing or permitting others to climb, with boot
spurs or spikes, or the like, any oak tree unless the tree is being
entirely removed.
A. If the owner fails to remove the tree or trees within the specified period
of time, the Township shall employ a qualified person or company to
collect sample(s) for testing, remove, treat, dispose of and/or destroy
the tree or trees. For trees suspected of Oak Wilt infection the Township
shall only proceed to remove, treat, dispose of and/or destroy the tree
after testing of a sample confirms the presence of the fungal pathogen.
B. In such case, the Township shall forthwith, upon completion of the
work, send an itemized bill of the cost of the removal and associated
work to the owner of the property where the infected tree or trees were
located, which bill shall be payable forthwith. In case of neglect or
refusal by the owner of such property to pay said bill, the Township
shall file a municipal lien within six months of the date of the
completion of the removal and associated work, the same to be subject
in all respects to the general law provided for the filing and recovery of
municipal liens.
§ 163-2 PATTON CODE § 163-6
123:552
§ 163-6. Storage of infected logs and debris.
Logs and debris from a tree or trees infected by a pathogen specified in
§ 163-1, shall only be stored, stockpiled, or used within Patton Township
in accordance with the best practices recommended by the Pennsylvania
State University, their Extension Service, or the United States Department
of Agriculture (materials available upon request).

2001-384; 9-26-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-545]
A. To provide sufficient space, appropriately located, for residential
development to meet the housing needs of the present and expected
future population of the Township, within the range of house types and
densities anticipated.
B. To assure light, air and privacy, as far as possible, by controlling the
spacing and height of buildings and other structures.
C. To protect residential areas against hazards of fire, offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, odors, glare or other objectionable influences.
D. To prevent congestion, as far as possible, by regulating the density of
population and the bulk of buildings and by providing for off-street
parking.
E. To protect residential neighborhoods as far as possible, against heavy
traffic or through traffic.
F. To make possible provision of those public and private educational,
recreational, health and similar facilities serving the needs of nearby
residents which perform most effectively in a residential environment
and/do not create objectionable influences.
G. To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building
development in accord with a well considered plan, to promote stable
residential development, to protect the character of any district and its
peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve the value of land and
buildings and to protect the Township tax revenues.
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to encourage residential development which will
blend with existing agricultural uses and perpetuate the rural
atmosphere of the area. With such restrictions it will be possible for
limited residential uses to develop while preserving natural features
and scenic landscapes. It is also the purpose of this section to provide
sufficient space for on-lot sewage disposal which will not create any
menace to public health. In this manner, sufficient open space will be
retained thus reducing the need for such municipal facilities.

A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to regulate residential development in those
areas near major highways, commercial areas and/or centers of
employment. Such areas are suitable for medium-density residential
development, provided that off-site water and sewer services are
provided. However, restrictions are provided to maintain suitable areas
of open space between residences to create a suburban atmosphere
adequate for family needs.
B. Use regulations and area and bulk regulations are detailed in Table 1.
(1) Uses by right. In any R-3 District, provided that both off-site sewer
and water are provided, land, buildings or premises shall be used
by right only for one or more of the uses shown in Table 1.
(2) Accessory uses shown in Table 1 shall be permitted:
(a) Accessory uses with additional restrictions:
§ 175-11 PATTON CODE § 175-12
169:632
[1] Swimming pool, provided that it is located in the rear yard
or side yard of the dwelling to which it is accessory, 25 feet
from any lot line and enclosed by a continuous barrier not
less than four feet high.
(3) Uses permitted as a conditional use. The uses shown in Table 1
shall be permitted as a conditional use subject to meeting the
procedures and criteria for conditional uses contained in § 175-42.
If a conditional use approval is granted for any of these uses by the
Board of Supervisors, the buffer yard requirements of § 175-40A
must be addressed for all uses within this district.
C. Area and bulk regulations for lots having off-site sewer and water
services only are shown in Table 1. Where off-site sewer and water
services are not provided, the area and bulk regulations of the R-2
District shall apply. Additional area and bulk-related regulations are as
follows:
(1) Single-family (detached or semidetached) dwelling.
(a) Side yards: 25 feet aggregate, 10 feet minimum. (If the
developer aligns the axis of the single-family detached dwelling
at an acute angle with the street line and thus the side property
lines, the developer may utilize an average side yard distance
of 15 feet, which shall imply that no portion of the building
shall be located closer than 10 feet to the side property line
with the average distance along the side of the building being
no less than 15 feet from the side property line.)
(2) Multiple units.
(a) Distance between buildings. Where two or more buildings are
to be located on one lot, the distances between such buildings
shall be the sum of the required side and rear yard depths for
such buildings. As an alternative, the buildings can be moved
closer together, provided that the side and rear yard depths are
correspondingly increased. The minimum distance to be
maintained between buildings is 30 feet.
(b) Location of parking lots and driveways. Only driveways giving
access to parking located within the main building shall be
located within the required minimum yard area. Parking lots or
driveways abutting R-1 and R-2 lands shall be screened by
hedges.
(c) Landscaping. Fifty percent of the total area of any lot on which
apartments are to be erected shall be landscaped. See
§ 175-44C.
(3) Group dwellings (townhouses).
§ 175-12 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-12
169:633
(a) Within the lot containing group dwellings, land may be
subdivided into lots consisting of land immediately beneath
and immediately adjacent to each dwelling unit, provided that:
[1] Such lots not include common elements, such as parking
stalls, driveways, sidewalks and front, side and rear yards
of the group dwellings lot.
[2] Such lots shall not contain yard lines.
[3] The common elements of the group dwellings lot, exclusive
of the individual dwelling unit lots, be owned by a
homeowners' association consisting of the owners of every
dwelling unit.
[4] The homeowners' association shall be created by recorded
declaration, and said declaration shall contain such
provisions as may be established by the Board of
Supervisors by resolution from time to time.
(b) Distance between buildings. Where two or more buildings are
to be located on one lot, the distances between such buildings
shall be the sum of the required side and rear yard depth for
such buildings.
(c) Location of parking lots and driveways. Only driveways giving
access to parking located within the main building shall be
located within the required minimum yard area. Parking lots or
driveways abutting R-1 and R-2 lands shall be screened by
hedges.
(d) Landscaping. Fifty percent of the total area of any lot on which
group dwellings are to be erected shall be landscaped. See
§ 175-44C.
D. Off-street parking regulations. See § 153-38.
E. The buffer yard requirements contained in § 175-40A, Tables 3, 4 and 5,
shall apply to new multihousehold development within the Medium-
Density Residence (R-3) District. Existing vegetation may be used to
meet these requirements. All trees that are to be used to meet the
requirements of this section (whether planted or preexisting), however,
must have a caliper no less than 2.5 inches measured six inches above
the root ball. Invasive species, as defined by Appendix B of the I-99
Overlay District regulations (Ordinance No. 2001-388),194 may not be
planted or counted towards meeting any landscaping requirements.

shall be laid out to permit a motor vehicle to proceed to and from all
unoccupied spaces without moving other parked vehicles. Parking shall
be provided on the lot no closer than two feet to a side or rear lot line,
unless the two adjoining property owners mutually agree to a common
driveway in such form and manner acceptable for recording in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of Centre County, Pennsylvania, binding
their heirs and assigns to the easement so created or unless the two
adjoining property owners agree that each may locate his or her
driveway at the lot line joined to the driveway of the other. No parking
spaces or driveways shall be allowed in the twenty-foot front yards, side
yards or rear yards described in Table 1. No carport roof or garage shall
be built within any front yard, side yard or rear yard.

Commercial Districts
[Amended 8-12-1987 by Ord. No. 87-221]
§ 175-15. Intent.
In addition to the general goals in § 175-2, the districts established in this
regulation are intended to achieve the following:
§ 175-16. C-1 General Commercial District. [Amended 1-13-1993 by
Ord. No. 93-297; 12-10-1997 by Ord. No. 97-354; 7-16-2008 by Ord.
No. 2008-498; 11-2-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-533; 3-27-2013 by Ord.
No. 2013-548]
A. To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations with public water
and sewer service for the types of commercial and service
establishments anticipated in the Comprehensive Plan.
B. To provide appropriate space for the requirements of present-day
merchandising, including the provisions of off-street parking spaces,
safe circulation of pedestrian and motor traffic in the district and in
nearby areas.
C. To promote the most desirable use of land and pattern of building
development in accordance with a well-considered plan, to promote
stable commercial development, to protect the character of the
commercial area and nearby districts and to conserve the value of land
and buildings.
D. To provide a means whereby the Township may, from time to time,
redesignate certain areas for planned commercial uses according to
commercial needs.
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to provide commercial and other permitted
facilities to serve primarily the needs of the local residents, including
automotive-oriented facilities, neighborhood-type facilities and general
convenience needs.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Uses by right. In any C-1 District, land and structures may be used
for only the uses shown in Table 3.
(2) Accessory uses are shown in Table 3.
C. Prerequisites for review and approval use. All uses shall comply with
the provisions of § 175-48, Site plan requirements and procedures, and
Chapter 147, Stormwater Management, to issuance of a permit to
occupy or use the lot.
§ 175-15 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-16
169:647
D. Area and bulk regulations. The regulations shown in Table 4 shall be
observed.
(1) Additional area and bulk regulations are as follows.
(a) Front setback: 70 feet. (As an alternative, the setback may be
reduced to no less than 50 feet upon approval of a site plan
which provides a rear yard of sufficient size so that the sum of
the setback and rear yards is at least 100 feet.)
(b) Side yards: 15 feet minimum for each. (As an alternative, the
Patton Township Planning Commission may recommend and
the Patton Township Supervisors may approve the
consolidation of side yards for a property located in a C-1
Commercial District so that one side yard is eliminated but the
resulting side yard must be a minimum of 30 feet. Such a
conditional approval would be based on a certified statement
that abutting property owners will develop abutting properties
simultaneously, using the same style or types of architecture
and the same types of construction materials.)
(c) Rear yards: 30 feet, except upon approval of a site plan as
provided in the setback section above. Screening shall be
provided at the rear yard, along a ten-foot buffer strip
measured from the rear property line.
E. Off-street parking requirements. See § 153-38.
F. Off-street loading regulations. See § 175-47.
G. Design standards. The following shall be applicable in all C-1
Commercial Districts:
(1) Screening shall be provided along all property lines as follows:
(a) In all front yard areas, canopy shade trees shall be planted at
thirty-foot intervals on average. Shrubs shall be planted
between the canopy trees.
(b) Screening in side and rear yards shall be based on the zoning
of the adjacent property according to Table 1.
(c) Applicants are encouraged to utilize existing vegetation to
meet the screening requirements. Following the completion of
a tree inventory, existing woodland areas may be used to
address the landscaping/screening requirements for setback
areas. All trees that are to be used to meet the requirements of
this section (whether planted or preexisting), however, must
have a caliper no less than 2.5 inches measured six inches
above the root ball. Invasive species, as defined by Appendix B
of the I-99 Overlay District regulations (Ordinance No.
2001-388),195 may not be planted or counted towards meeting
any landscaping requirements.

Ord. No. 93-297; 12-10-1997 by Ord. No. 97-354; 11-18-1998 by

Ord. No. 2013-548]
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to provide a cohesive unit of commercial usages
arranged and constructed according to a plan which will serve the
regional needs of this area. It is to reserve areas in the municipality for
specialized stores and larger retailers who must have an expanded
trade area.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Uses by right. In any C-2 District, land and structures may be used
for only the uses shown in Table 3.
(2) Accessory uses are shown in Table 3.
C. Prerequisites for review and approval of use. All uses shall comply with
the provisions of § 175-48, Site plan requirements and procedures, and
Chapter 147, Stormwater Management, prior to issuance of a permit to
occupy or use the lot.
D. Area and bulk regulations. The regulations shown in Table 4 shall be
observed. The following additional regulations shall also apply.
(1) Front setback. The minimum required front yard setback in the C-2
Zoning District shall be 25 feet. In this zoning district (C-2), in
addition to the general prohibition against structures in the yard
areas, development improvements such as parking lots and lighting
standards shall only be permitted in the front yard area when the
requirements of Subsection D(1)(a) are satisfied. Stormwater
basins shall only be permitted in the front yard area when the
requirements of Subsection D(1)(b) are satisfied. This prohibition
shall not include driveways and walkways providing ingress and
egress to the lot.
(a) The front yard setback may be reduced to 10 feet where a plan
for architectural, landscaping and earth-mounding features
acceptable to the Township provides enhanced screening of
such and aesthetic improvements to the property as a whole. A
property owner shall be authorized to place architectural
features and lighting standards, which might otherwise be
prohibited structures, in the reduced ten-foot setback as part
of the plan for enhanced screening. The Township reserves the
right to determine the level and type of architectural
enhancements which will be necessary to achieve the
reduction in the front setback area.
(b) A property owner shall be authorized to place stormwater
management facilities within the front yard setback where a
§ 175-17 PATTON CODE § 175-17
169:654
plan for enhanced landscaping and/or architectural features
is provided. The plan for enhanced landscaping and/or
architectural features shall meet the following standards:
[1] All perimeter basin walls shall be landscaped with
evergreen and deciduous shrubs and ornamental grasses
to form a continuous landscaping area.
[2] All internal basin walls which are visible from the public
right-of-way or parking lot shall be landscaped with
shrubs, ornamental grasses and, where appropriate,
understory trees.
[3] Architectural features may be substituted for landscape
enhancements if the plan to do so is acceptable to the
Township.
(2) Side setback.
(a) In this zoning district (C-2), in addition to the general
prohibition against structures in the yard areas, no
development improvements, such as parking lots, lighting
standards and stormwater basins, shall be permitted in the
rear or side yard areas. This prohibition shall not include
driveways and walkways providing ingress and egress to the
lot or driveways along a property line when adjacent to a
nonresidential district, provided that the driveway is at least
five feet from the property line.
(b) If a plan acceptable to the Township is presented which
provides a combination of landscaping, mounds and sound
attenuation barriers to buffer the adjacent rural or residential
district, this setback shall be reduced to 75 feet. The Township
reserves the right to determine the level and type of
landscaping, mounds and sound attenuation barriers which
will be necessary to achieve the reduction in the setbacks. The
landscaping requirements shall be as provided in Subsection
G(1).
(c) Stormwater facilities shall be permitted in rear or side yards
adjacent to nonresidential districts or adjacent to identified
nonresidential areas within Planned Community, University
and Planned Airport Districts.
(3) Maximum impervious coverage is illustrated in Table 4. The
following additional regulations also apply.
(a) The developer of a C-2 property may utilize up to 70% of the
property for impervious coverage, provided that an enhanced
plan for stormwater management meeting the following
standards is provided and approved by the Township.
§ 175-17 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-17
169:655
(b) Enhanced stormwater standards. The following standards shall
apply in addition to the standards required under Chapter 147:
[1] Detain the one-year, twenty-four-hour design storm using
the SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made so
that the one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to
drain from the facility from a point where the maximum
volume of water from the one-year storm is captured (i.e.,
the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility). Release of water can begin at the start of the
storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at the
invert of the facility). The design of the facility shall
consider and minimize the chances of clogging and
sedimentation potential.
[2] To accomplish the above, the land developer may submit
original and innovative designs to the Township Engineer
for review and approval. Such designs may achieve the
water quality objectives through a combination of best
management practices (BMPs).
[3] Where appropriate, BMPs should encourage infiltration to
reduce detention volumes and recharge groundwater. A
geologic evaluation of the project site shall be performed
to determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The
evaluation shall be performed by a qualified geologist and/
or soil scientist and at a minimum address soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole
formation and subgrade stability. The design of all
facilities over limestone formations shall include measures
to prevent groundwater contamination and sinkhole
formation.
[4] In selecting the appropriate BMPs, the land developer
shall consider the following:
[a] Total contributing area.
[b] Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
[c] Slope and depth to bedrock.
[d] Seasonal high-water table.
[e] Proximity to building foundations and well heads.
[f] Erodibility of soils.
[g] Land availability and configuration of the topography.
(c) A developer shall be entitled to achieve 65% impervious
coverage on the property (or 70% as stated above). If the
setbacks established in Subsection D(4) make it impossible to
§ 175-17 PATTON CODE § 175-17
169:656
achieve this coverage, because of the small size or odd
configuration of the property, the setbacks shall be
proportionately lessened to permit such impervious coverage
at the limits established by this subsection.
E. Off-street parking requirements. See § 153-38.
F. Off-street loading regulations. See § 175-47.
G. Design standards. The following shall be applicable in all C-2
Commercial Districts.
(1) Screening and landscaping.
(a) In all front yard areas, canopy shade trees shall be planted at
thirty-foot intervals on average. Shrubs shall be planted
between the canopy trees.
(b) Screening in side and rear yards shall be based on the zoning
of the adjacent property according to the following
requirements:
[1] Screening shall be provided at the rear yard, along a tenfoot
buffer strip measured from the rear property line.

(3) Conditional uses. The uses shown in Table 1 shall be permitted as
conditional uses within the Office Buffer District. The procedures
outlined in § 175-42 shall be followed in the review of any
conditional use application by Patton Township.
C. Prerequisites for review and approval. All uses shall comply with the
provisions of § 175-48, Site plan requirements and procedures, and
Chapter 147, Stormwater Management, prior to the issuance of a
permit to occupy or use any lot located within this district.
D. Area and bulk regulations. The regulations shown in Table 1 shall be
observed. In addition, the following regulations shall also apply:
(1) Parking areas and driveways are prohibited from the side and rear
setback areas adjacent to R-l, R-2, or A-l Zoning Districts.
(2) (Reserved).
(3) Maximum impervious coverage: 55%. The developer may utilize up
to 60% of the property for impervious coverage, provided that an
enhanced plan for stormwater management meeting the following
standards is provided and approved by the Township:
(a) Detain the one-year, twenty-four-hour design storm using the
SCS Type II distribution. Provisions shall be made to ensure
the one-year storm takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from
the facility from a point where the maximum volume of water
from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum water
surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water
can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water
quality orifice is at the invert of the facility). The design of the
facility shall consider and minimize the chances of clogging
and sedimentation potential.
(b) To accomplish the above, the land developer may submit
original and innovative designs to the Township Engineer for
review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water
quality objectives through a combination of Best Management
Practices (BMPs).
(c) Where appropriate, BMPs should encourage infiltration to
reduce detention volumes and recharge groundwater. A
geologic evaluation of the project site shall be performed to
determine the suitability of recharge facilities. The evaluation
shall be performed by a qualified geologist and/or soil scientist,
and, at a minimum, address soil permeability, depth to
bedrock, susceptibility to sinkhole formation and subgrade
stability. The design of all facilities over limestone formations
shall include measures to prevent groundwater contamination
and sinkhole formation.
§ 175-17.1 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-17.1
169:665
(d) In selecting the appropriate BMPs, the land developer shall
consider the following:
[1] Total contributing area.
[2] Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
[3] Slope and depth to bedrock.
[4] Seasonal high-water table.
[5] Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
[6] Erodibility of soils.
[7] Land availability and configuration of the topography.
E. Off-street parking regulations. The off-street parking regulations
contained in § 153-38 of the Patton Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance shall apply to all developments within the
Office Buffer District. In addition, the following requirements will apply:
(1) In calculating the number of parking spaces required for uses
within the Office Buffer District, all interior areas used for
stairways, elevators and any unfinished space used for storage

§ 175-17.2. OBD2 Officer Buffer District 2. [Added 9-22-2004 by
Ord. No. 438; amended 5-28-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-496; 3-27-2013
by Ord. No. 2013-548]
A. Intent. The intent of the Office Buffer District 2 is to:
(1) Establish a zoning district for larger tracts of land along
interchanges and major highways to serve as a buffer to residential
neighborhoods.
(2) Avoid problems associated with highway-oriented development by
encouraging office development to occur in a manner compatible
with the nature of the interchange area.
(3) Mitigate the traffic, noise and other impacts from interchanges on
immediately adjacent neighborhoods.
(4) Mitigate impact of nonresidential development along highways on
residential neighborhoods.
(5) Control access points to collector and arterial roads.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Uses by right. In any OB2 District, land and structures may be used
only for the uses shown in Table 1.
(2) Conditional uses. The uses shown in Table 1 shall be permitted as a
conditional use within the Office Buffer District 2 as per § 175-42 of
the Code.
(3) Prerequisites for review and approval. All uses shall comply with
the provisions of § 175-48, Site plan requirements and procedures,
and Chapter 147, Stormwater Management, prior to the issuance
of a permit to occupy or use any lot located within this district.
C. Master plan approval. All development within the Office Buffer District
2 must be done pursuant to approval of a master plan in accordance
with the procedure that follows. Master plans for the Office Buffer
District 2 shall be reviewed by the Patton Township Planning
Commission and the Centre Regional Planning Commission and shall be
approved or denied by the Board of Supervisors in accordance with the
procedures specified herein.
(1) Preapplication meeting. A preapplication meeting is recommended
but shall not be mandatory, nor shall it be regarded as a formal
application for development, in the Office Buffer District 2. The
purpose of the meeting is to provide for an informational exchange
at the municipal staff level where the major elements of a proposed
master plan can be reviewed and evaluated. The filing of any
report, sketch plan, plat or map prior to or at such meeting shall
not constitute submission of a plan or application for Office Buffer
§ 175-17.2 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-17.2
169:671
District 2 development, nor shall such materials be binding on
subsequent submissions by the applicant.
(2) Sketch plan submission. The applicant is encouraged to submit a
sketch plan, in both paper and digital (in a form acceptable to the
Township) format, of the proposed Office Buffer District 2
development. The purpose is to discuss a conceptual sketch of the
proposed development with the municipal staff, the Planning
Commission and the Board of Supervisors prior to final submission.
(3) Master plan application and review. Application for Township
approval of an Office Buffer District 2 development shall commence
with the official submission of a complete set of plans and all
required supplementary data and information to the Township. At
any time during the review process, the applicant may amend the
originally submitted plan solely for the purpose of correcting minor

requirements of this section.
(a) A master plan shall be deemed to have been submitted for
review when the applicant has furnished to the Township the
following documents:
[1] Twelve copies of a master plan prepared by a registered
engineer, surveyor, landscape architect or similarly
qualified person, which shall fully comply with the
requirements of this chapter. One additional copy shall be
submitted in a digital format acceptable to Patton
Township.
[2] Three copies of a narrative, which shall fully comply with
the requirement of this chapter.
[3] Three copies of a transportation impact analysis, which
shall comply with the requirements of this chapter.
(b) Upon receipt of the above, the Township Zoning Officer shall
forward copies of the master plan and accompanying
documentation to the Township Engineer, Centre Regional
Planning Commission, Centre County Planning Commission
and other appropriate agencies.
(c) Review by the Township Planning Commission.
[1] At its next regular meeting following the receipt of the
application for Master Plan approval, provided that such
application was made at least 30 days prior to the meeting,
the Planning Commission shall review the plan to
determine its conformance with the provisions contained
in these regulations.
§ 175-17.2 PATTON CODE § 175-17.2
169:672
[2] The Planning Commission shall notify the Township Board
of Supervisors of any recommended action, changes or
modifications to the plan after such decision is made,
provided that the Planning Commission shall make such
recommendations within 70 days after the date the
application for approval was filed. The Planning
Commission shall make no recommendation on such
application until reports from the Centre County and
Centre Regional Planning Commissions are received, or
until expiration of 30 days from the date the plan was
forwarded to these agencies, whichever comes first.
[3] If review by the Township Planning Commission results in
an unfavorable recommendation because the
requirements of this chapter have not been met,
notification to the Township Board of Supervisors should
specify the defects found in the plan, describe the
requirements that have not been met, and cite the
provisions of this chapter from which such defects or
requirements originate.
(d) Review by the Township Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of
the recommendation from the Planning Commission or upon
failure to receive said recommendations 70 days after
submittal, the Board of Supervisors shall review the
application for master plan approval.
[1] The Board of Supervisors shall review the plan and the
written reports of the Township Planning Commission, the
Centre County Planning Commission, the Centre Regional
Planning Commission, the Township Engineer and the
other reviewing agencies to determine if the plan meets all
applicable regulations. Prior to approval of a master plan,
the Board of Supervisors shall require a public hearing.
[2] The Township shall place a notice of the time and place of
the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation as
set forth by the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.
(e) Approval or denial. The Board of Supervisors, within 50 days
following the Planning Commission action or inaction, shall by
official written communication to the applicant either:
[1] Grant approval of the master plan as submitted.
[2] Grant approval subject to the applicant meeting specified
modifications to the master plan as submitted.
[3] Deny approval of the plan, including a list of reasons and/
or plan deficiencies.

169:673
(f) Where an Office Buffer District 2 development may occur over
a period of years, the Board of Supervisors may authorize
development in phases subject to such requirements or
guaranties as to improvements in future phases of the
development that it finds essential for the protection of any
approved phase. In such case, a schedule showing the
proposed times within which applications for final approval of
land development plans of all phases of the development are
intended to be filed shall be included with the master plan. The
schedule may be revised by the Board of Supervisors if
requested to do so by the landowner or developer.
(g) Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the
manner required herein shall be deemed an approval of the
master plan in terms as presented, unless the applicant has
agreed, in writing, to an extension of time or change in the
prescribed manner of presentation or communication of the
decision, in which case failure to meet the extended time or
change in manner of presentation of communication shall have
like effect.
(h) In the event that approval is granted subject to conditions, the
owner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official
written communication of the governing body, notify the Board
of Supervisors of his or her refusal to accept all of said
conditions, in which case, the Board of Supervisors shall be
deemed to have denied approval of the master plan. In the
event that the landowner does not, within said period, notify
the Board of Supervisors of his or her acceptance of all of said
conditions, approval of the master plan shall be deemed to
have been denied.
(i) An approved master plan shall be recorded by the developer in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Centre County within 90
days of approval.
(j) Approval of a master plan shall not authorize construction or
the issuance of any building permit. Such authorization or

the requirements of this article. In the event of a conflict between
the requirements contained in this article and any other ordinance,
the requirements of this article will apply.
(2) Any major change proposed to an approved master plan will
require an amendment of the master plan. If the major change is
contained within a proposed subdivision or land development plan,
the Board of Supervisors shall not grant approval of the plan until
an amendment of the master plan occurs. In the event of such
denial, the landowner may refile the final plan without the major
changes identified in such written notice or file an application to
amend the master plan, following the procedures required herein
for approval.
(3) A minor change to an approved master plan shall not require an
amendment of the master plan. If the minor change is proposed as
part of a subdivision or land development plan, then the change will
be approved through the normal review process for subdivision and
land development plans.
E. Area, bulk, open space, setbacks and parking regulations are shown in

NOTE:
1 See full text of § 175-17.2.
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to provide opportunities for commercial
development; to transition between established residential
neighborhoods and major commercial corridors with either buffering or
an appropriate mix of uses; to potentially supply new housing within
close proximity of employment, retail, and public transit opportunities;
and to offer a mechanism to address Patton Township's need for
housing that is affordable to households with incomes no greater than
120% of the Centre County annual median income (AMI) through the
aid of private sector commercial development.
B. Use regulations.
(1) Uses by right. All uses permitted in the C-1 District except
commercial parking lots, automobile service stations, fueling or
§ 175-17.2 PATTON CODE § 175-17.3
169:686
gasoline stations, dry cleaning, mortuaries, bus passenger stations,
businesses that house animals overnight, and warehousing
operations.
(2) Conditional uses. Single-family homes, duplexes, and townhouses/
apartments, subject to the requirements of § 175-17.3H.
(3) The uses of this section are also noted in Table 4.
C. Prerequisites for review and approval of use. All uses shall comply with
the provisions of § 175-48, Site plan requirements and procedures, and
Chapter 147, Stormwater Management, prior to issuance of a permit to
occupy or use the lot.
D. Area and bulk regulations. The regulations shown in Table 5 shall be
observed for development as a use by right (§ 175-17.3H sets different
area and bulk regulations for conditional uses); in addition, the
following regulations shall also apply:
(1) Open space. In order to properly buffer existing residential
neighborhoods from commercial development, open space shall be
provided as follows:
(a) Minimum 25% of tract.
(b) To be adjacent to residential uses and between residential uses
and commercial corridors and/or commercial uses.
(c) Landscaped with trees, shrubs, and/or fences to fully screen
residential uses from commercial corridor or uses. Screening
may also be accomplished by preservation of existing trees or
enhancement of existing tree stands.
(d) To be protected from any future change of use by donation of
all of this open space to Patton Township or a qualified
conservancy, to be placed under a conservation easement to be
held by a qualified conservancy, and to be endowed to provide
funds for maintenance and monitoring of the conservation
easement in perpetuity.
(2) Front setback. The minimum required front yard setback in the C-T
Zoning District shall be 25 feet. In this zoning district (C-T), in
addition to the general prohibition against structures in the yard
areas, development improvements such as parking lots and lighting
standards shall only be permitted in the front yard area when the
requirements of Subsection D(5)(a) are satisfied. Stormwater
basins shall only be permitted in the front yard area when the
requirements of Subsection D(5)(b) are satisfied. This prohibition
shall not include driveways and walkways providing ingress and
egress to the lot.
(a) The front yard setback may be reduced to 10 feet where a plan
for architectural, landscaping and earth-mounding features
§ 175-17.3 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-17.3
169:687
acceptable to the Township provides enhanced screening of
such and aesthetic improvements to the property as a whole.
A property owner shall be authorized to place architectural
features and lighting standards, which might otherwise be
prohibited structures, in the reduced ten-foot setback as part
of the plan for enhanced screening. The Township reserves
the right to determine the level and type of architectural
enhancements which will be necessary to achieve the
reduction in the front setback area.
(b) A property owner shall be authorized to place stormwater
management facilities within the front yard setback where a
plan for enhanced landscaping and/or architectural features is
provided. The plan for enhanced landscaping and/or
architectural features shall meet the following standards:
[1] All perimeter basin walls shall be landscaped with
evergreen and deciduous shrubs and ornamental grasses
to form a continuous landscaping area.
[2] All internal basin walls which are visible from the public
right-of-way or parking lot shall be landscaped with
shrubs, ornamental grasses and, where appropriate,
understory trees.
[3] Architectural features may be substituted for landscape
enhancements if the plan to do so is acceptable to the
Township.
(3) Side yards. The minimum required side yard setback in the C-T
Zoning District shall be based on the zoning of the adjacent
property as shown in Table 5.
(a) In this zoning district (C-T), in addition to the general
prohibition against structures in the yard areas, no
development improvements, such as parking lots, lighting
standards and stormwater basins, shall be permitted in the
rear or side yard areas, except that stormwater basins may be
permitted between the commercial and residential portions of
a conditional use development. (See § 175-17.3H.) This
prohibition shall not include driveways and walkways
providing ingress and egress to the lot or driveways along a
property line when adjacent to a nonresidential district,
provided that the driveway is at least five feet from the
property line.
(b) If a plan acceptable to the Township is presented which
provides a combination of landscaping, mounds and sound
attenuation barriers to buffer the adjacent rural or residential
district, this setback shall be reduced to 75 feet. The Township
reserves the right to determine the level and type of
landscaping, mounds and sound attenuation barriers which
§ 175-17.3 PATTON CODE § 175-17.3
169:688
will be necessary to achieve the reduction in the setbacks. The
landscaping requirements shall be as provided in Subsection
G(1).
(c) Stormwater facilities shall be permitted in rear or side yards
adjacent to nonresidential districts or adjacent to identified
nonresidential areas within planned community, university and
planned airport districts.
(4) Rear yards. The minimum required rear yard setback in the C-T
Zoning District shall be based on the zoning of the adjacent
property as shown in Table 5.
(5) Screening shall be provided at the rear yard, along a ten-foot buffer
strip measured from the rear property line.
(6) Maximum impervious coverage: 70% of area outside the required
open space. A developer shall be entitled to achieve impervious
coverage of 70% of area outside the required open space. If the
setbacks established in Subsection D(5) and D(6) make it
impossible to achieve this coverage, because of the size or
configuration of the property, the setbacks shall be proportionately
lessened to permit such impervious coverage at the limit
established by this subsection.
E. Off-street parking requirements: See § 153-38.
F. Off-street loading regulations: See § 175-47.
G. Design standards. The following shall be applicable in all C-T

ARTICLE IV
Planned Community District
[Amended 2-24-1993 by Ord. No. 93-300; 8-12-1998 by Ord. No.
98-357; 12-15-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-446; 12-14-2005 by Ord. No.
2005-464; 5-8-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-496; 1-6-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-551]
§ 175-18. Intent.
The Planned Community Zoning District is implemented through a master
plan process which provides flexibility in land use planning by providing
criteria that allow a mix of uses in a growth area to be served by public
utilities. In addition, the district achieves the following purposes:
§ 175-19. Establishment.
The area of Patton Township designated on the Zoning Map of the Township
as "Planned Community District" is hereby established as the Planned
Community District.
§ 175-20. Use regulations.
A. Provision of a means for determination, review and mitigation of
potential community and environmental impacts.
B. Provision of adequate and well-designed open space for the use of all
residents and general public.
C. Provision for an orderly and creative arrangement of all land uses with
respect to each other within the development, those on adjoining
properties and to the entire community.
D. Assurance that, to the maximum extent possible, the community is
afforded the opportunity to participate in the review of master plans for
proposed development in the district.
E. Provision for innovative design and the use of density zoning that allows
the clustering of buildings, structures and open space which preserves
natural features, woodlands and prevents soil erosion.
F. Encouragement of innovative strategies to reduce transportation
impacts from proposed development that will improve safety, reduce
congestion, provide adequate access and promote the use of
transportation demand management strategies.
A. Uses by right. The following uses are permitted in the Toftrees and
Oakwood Planned Communities:
(1) The uses are shown in Table 1 included at the end of this section.
(2) Additional restrictions pertaining to accessory uses are as follows:
§ 175-18 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-20
169:703
(a) Swimming pools: provided that it is located in the rear yard or
side yard of the dwelling to which it is accessory, 25 feet from
any lot line and enclosed by a continuous barrier not less than
four feet high.
(3) Exceptions to occupancy limits for unrelated individuals in
residential dwelling units in the Toftrees Planned Community.
[Added 3-22-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-583]
(a) The maximum number of unrelated individuals permitted to
occupy a dwelling unit may be increased as follows:
[1] Maximum occupancy of dwelling units shall not exceed
five unrelated individuals or one unrelated individual per
bedroom, whichever is more restrictive.
[2] If the occupancy of any dwelling unit proposed is to exceed
three unrelated individuals, then the occupancy for each
type of dwelling unit shall be stated on the land
development plan and approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
[3] The occupancy limit may not be increased in group living
facilities such as group homes, halfway houses, personal
care facilities, nursing homes, or rehabilitation centers.
[4] All units shall be sized and occupied in accordance with
Chapter 63, Uniform Construction Codes, and Chapter
127, Property Maintenance and Fire Code. In instances of
conflict, the more restrictive regulations shall apply.
(b) The following additional requirements shall apply to
developments which are subject to increased occupancy:
[1] Fire protection. All units or subunits intended for human
occupancy shall have automatic fire sprinkler systems
installed.
[2] Lot size. The property shall be at least 15 acres, but no
more than 35 acres.
[3] Location and dwelling unit composition.
[a] The property shall be in an area that is intended for
residential use as specified by § 175-23.2B(2)(e).
[b] The property must be located in areas with a
permitted density of no greater than 9.00 units per
acre, as specified in § 175-23.2B and no more than
35% of the total number of units are permitted to be
five-bedroom units.
§ 175-20 PATTON CODE § 175-20
169:704
§ 175-21. Master Plan approval.
All development within the Planned Community District must be done
pursuant to approval of a master plan in accordance with the procedure that
follows. Master plans for the Planned Community District shall be reviewed
[i] The exception shall be that such developments
are permitted in areas with a permitted density of
9.01 to 15.00 units per net acre if the total
number of five-bedroom units does not exceed
25% of the total number of units.
[4] Ownership. All buildings within the development shall be
owned by a single owner.
[5] Rentals. All rental dwelling units shall be rented by the
bedroom.
[6] Style of development. The site must be developed as a
cottage-style community consisting of numerous buildings
with a varying number of units in each building and having
a variety of facades. No single building shall contain more
than 10% of the total number of units in the development.
B. All other Planned Community Districts permit the same uses as shown
above and in Table 1 for Toftrees and Oakwood, except that shopping
centers shall be limited to 75,000 square feet in building area.
C. In order to minimize required daily trips, a town center shall be
provided within a planned community that contains a total of 150 acres
or more unless it is deemed by the Township that the location of a town
center is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. A town center
should be designed so that it is easily distinguishable from the
surrounding planned community residential and open space areas.
Planned communities of less than 150 acres are not required to provide
for a town center concept; however, nonresidential uses should be
clustered where feasible.
D. The concern for protection of the potential future source of
groundwater is embodied within Schedule A,196 which prohibits certain
activities from being conducted in the critical groundwater recharge
areas shown on the master plans that could contaminate the potential
water supply. In addition, a buffer of at least 150 feet shall be required
from all designated well sites. This buffer shall be measured from the
perimeter of the designated site(s). Vegetation and/or a combination of
low-maintenance trees, shrubs and ground cover plantings shall be
provided within the buffer. All buildings, structures, parking or other
impervious surfaces shall be prohibited from locating in the buffer yard.
The designated well sites shall be identified on the Master Plan.
196. Editor's Note: Schedule A is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 175-20 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-21

by the Patton Township Planning Commission and the Centre Regional
Planning Commission and shall be approved or denied by the Board of
Supervisors in accordance with the procedures specified herein. Parcels
smaller than 100 acres existing on the date of enactment of this chapter are
exempt from the master plan requirement.
A. Preapplication meeting. A preapplication meeting is recommended but
shall not be mandatory nor shall it be regarded as a formal application
for development in the Planned Community District. The purpose of the
meeting is to provide for an informational exchange at the municipal
staff level or Planning Commission level where the major elements of a
proposed master plan can be reviewed and evaluated. The Planning
Commission may make recommendations as a result of the
preapplication conference. The filing of any report, sketch plan, plat or
map prior to or at such meeting shall not constitute submission of a
plan or application for Planned Community District development nor
shall such materials be binding on subsequent submissions by the
applicant. Any recommendations made by the Planning Commission
shall not be binding upon the applicant or the Planning Commission in
its review of the plan after formal application.
B. Master plan application and review. Application for Township approval
of a Planned Community District development shall commence with the
official submission of a complete set of plans and all required
supplementary data and information to the Township. At any time
during the review process, the applicant may amend the originally
submitted plan solely for the purpose of correcting minor deficiencies in
the original plan to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of
this section.
(1) A master plan shall be deemed to have been submitted for review
when the applicant has furnished to the Township the following
documents:
(a) Fifteen copies of a master plan prepared by a registered
engineer, surveyor, landscape architect or similarly qualified
person, which shall fully comply with the requirements of
§ 175-21C of this chapter. One additional copy shall be
submitted in a digital format acceptable to Patton Township.
(b) Fifteen copies of a narrative which shall fully comply with the
requirement of § 175-21C(4) of this chapter.
(c) Fifteen copies of a Transportation Impact Report, which shall
comply with the requirements of § 175-21C(6) of this chapter.
(2) Upon receipt of the above, the Township Zoning Officer shall
forward copies of the Master Plan and accompanying
documentation to the Township Engineer, Centre Regional
Planning Commission, Centre County Planning Commission and
other appropriate agencies.
§ 175-21 PATTON CODE § 175-21
169:706
(3) Review by the Township Planning Commission.
(a) At its next regular meeting following the receipt of the
application for master plan approval, provided that such
application was made at least 30 days prior to the meeting, the
Planning Commission shall review the plan to determine its
conformance with the provisions contained in these
regulations.
(b) The Planning Commission shall notify the Township Board of
Supervisors of any recommended action, changes or
modifications to the plan after such decision is made, provided
that the Planning Commission shall make such
recommendations within 70 days after the date the application
for approval was filed. The Planning Commission shall make no
recommendation on such application until reports from the
Centre County and Centre Regional Planning Commissions are
received or until expiration of 30 days from the date the plan
was forwarded to these agencies, whichever comes first.
(c) If review by the Township Planning Commission results in an
unfavorable recommendation because the requirements of this
chapter have not been met, notification to the Township Board
of Supervisors should specify the defects found in the plan and
describe the requirements which have not been met and
should cite the provisions of this chapter from which such
defects or requirements originate.
(4) Review by the Township Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of the
recommendation from the Planning Commission or upon failure to
receive said recommendations 70 days after submittal, the Board of
Supervisors shall review the application for master plan approval.
(a) The Board of Supervisors shall review the plan and the written
reports of the Township Planning Commission, the Centre
County Planning Commission, the Centre Regional Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer and the other reviewing
agencies to determine if the plan meets all applicable
regulations. Prior to approval of a master plan, the Board of
Supervisors shall require a public hearing. The Board of
Supervisors shall require, as a condition of approval, that the
applicant furnish written confirmation from the appropriate
bodies that off-site water and sewer service is and will be made
available to the Planned Community District.
(b) The Township shall place a notice of the time and place of the
public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation as set
forth by the requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.
§ 175-21 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-21
169:707
(5) Approval or denial. The Board of Supervisors, within 50 days
following the Planning Commission action, or inaction, shall, by
official written communication to the applicant, either:
(a) Grant approval of the Master Plan as submitted.
(b) Grant approval subject to the applicant meeting specified
modifications to the Master Plan as submitted.
(c) Deny approval of the plan, including a list of reasons and/or
plan deficiencies.
(6) Where a Planned Community District development may occur over
a period of years, the Board of Supervisors may authorize
development in phases, subject to such requirements or guaranties
as to improvements in future phases of the development that it
finds essential for the protection of any approved phase. In such
case, a schedule showing the proposed times within which
applications for final approval of land development plans of all
phases of the development are intended to be filed shall be
included with the Master Plan. The schedule may be revised by the
Board of Supervisors if requested to do so by the landowner or
developer.
(7) Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the Master Plan in
terms as presented, unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to
an extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation or communication of the decision, in which case
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
(8) In the event that approval is granted subject to conditions, the
owner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official
written communication of the governing body, notify the Board of
Supervisors of his or her refusal to accept all of said conditions, in
which case the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have
denied approval of the Master Plan. In the event that the landowner
does not, within said period, notify the Board of Supervisors of his
or her acceptance of all of said conditions, approval of the Master
Plan shall be deemed to have been denied.
(9) An approved master plan shall be recorded by the developer in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of Centre County within 90 days of
approval.
(10) Approval of a master plan shall not authorize construction or the
issuance of any building permit. Such authorization or issuance

or neighboring land uses.
[2] If development pursuant to a master plan is to be done in
phases, over a period of years and according to an
§ 175-21 PATTON CODE § 175-21
169:712
approved schedule, the gross density of any phase, or
in combination with previously developed phases, shall
be in general proportion to residential and nonresidential
density requirements.
(6) Transportation impact report. A transportation impact report shall
be prepared by a qualified professional and include the following:
(a) Analysis and description of existing conditions and traffic
volumes for the external road network serving the site. The
external road network to be studied shall be determined by the
municipality prior to the Master Plan review.
(b) A base condition analysis shall be prepared to establish
existing levels of service followed by analysis and description
of projected traffic conditions based on the land uses proposed
within the development. Trip generation rates for morning and
evening peak hours of the project shall be prepared, as well as
the internal/external trip distribution and intersection analysis.
(c) The analysis shall address the traffic impacts of the proposed
development, along with surrounding traffic-generating land
uses in the area including land use changes. The analyses will
evaluate the adequacy of the area road network and identify
the need for road and access and traffic control measure
improvements generated by the proposed development and
surrounding land uses.
(d) The analysis shall contain recommended internal and off-site
road improvements. These recommended improvements
should be specific as to location and scope of work required
along with a phased schedule for implementation. Examples of

[1] Typical sections for each category of street.
[2] A phasing plan which delineates the street improvements
that will be provided simultaneously with the construction
of each development phase.
(e) Utilization of alternate modes of transportation shall be a
component of the traffic impact analysis. Evaluation of traffic
mitigation measures as it relates to public transportation and
future site development should also be addressed.
(f) Revision of the traffic impact study based on major changes (as
defined in this article) to the approved Master Plan shall be
required. This shall occur prior to the filing of an application to
amend the Master Plan.
D. Amendments to an approved master plan. Any major changes requested
to an approved master plan must meet the procedural and content

§ 175-23. Area, bulk, open space and parking requirements for
Oakwood Planned Community.
Area, bulk, open space and parking requirements for Oakwood Planned
Community are shown in Table 2. In addition, the following regulations shall
also apply.
requirements presented in § 175-21B and C. A major change to an
approved master plan is represented by any of the following:
(1) Any increase in the approved residential or commercial area
percentage.
(2) Any significant changes in the approved densities for residential
areas.
(3) Any significant changes in the commercial or industrial floor area
ratios.
(4) Any decrease in the approved open space area percentage.
(5) A change in the location of external vehicular access points or
interior roadway locations.
(6) Any other change determined by the Township to be significant.
A. After approval of a master plan, all subsequent subdivision and land
development plans within the master planning area must be submitted
in accordance with and meet the applicable requirements of Chapter
153, Subdivision and Land Development, this chapter and Chapter 147,
Streets and Sidewalks, in addition to the requirements of this article. In
the event of a conflict between the requirements contained in this
article and any other ordinance, the requirements of this article will
apply.
B. Any major change proposed to an approved master plan will require an
amendment of the master plan. If the major change is contained within
a proposed subdivision or land development plan, the Board of
Supervisors shall not grant approval of the plan until an amendment of
the Master Plan occurs. In the event of such denial, the landowner may
refile the final plan without the major changes identified in such written
notice or file an application to amend the Master Plan, following the
procedures required herein for approval.
C. A minor change to an approved master plan shall not require an
amendment of the master plan. If the minor change is proposed as part
of a subdivision or land development plan, then the change will be
approved through the normal review process for subdivision and land
development plans.
§ 175-21 PATTON CODE § 175-23
169:714
A. Height requirements. The height of any buildings or structures within
the Planned Community District shall not exceed the applicable
limitations in this chapter for the respective type of residential,
commercial or industrial construction being undertaken.
B. Setback requirements. Setback requirements are shown in Table 2. In
addition, the following regulations shall also apply.
(1) Required setbacks from Master Plan property boundaries are 30
feet for structures and 30 feet for parking. [Amended 4-8-2015
by Ord. No. 2015-566]
(a) Such setbacks will be established by the Board of Supervisors
for each subdivision or land development plan submitted
pursuant to an approved master plan and taking into account
the impacts on the adjacent properties. This allows the
designer flexibility in the placement of structures. However, a
proposal using minimal setbacks must clearly establish the
sufficiency of the design pattern for which the minimal
setbacks are proposed.
(b) Setbacks established by reference. In some cases, the exterior
setbacks for parcels in the Oakwood Planned Community have
been established that do not conform to the setbacks
established above and in Table 2. In these instances, the
setbacks noted on the approved land development plans will
take precedence. These plans include:
[1] Oakwood Planned Community Parcel 2 (Oakwood Centre)
 Recorded October 12, 2006.
[2] Oakwood Planned Community Parcel 8 (Heritage Village)
 Recorded September 19, 2007.
[3] Oakwood Planned Community Parcel 15 (Pickwick Avenue)
 Recorded February 9, 1981.
(2) No minimum setbacks for interior streets or internal lot lines are
established herein. Such setbacks will be established by the Board
of Supervisors for each subdivision or land development plan
submitted pursuant to an approved master plan. This allows the
designer flexibility in the placement of structures. However, a
proposal using minimal setbacks must clearly establish the
sufficiency of the design pattern for which the minimal setbacks are
proposed.
C. Open space requirements. Open space requirements are shown in Table
2. In addition, the following regulations shall also apply.
(1) The Township Supervisors may require dedication of part of the
open space shown on the plan in one or several locations according
to the following standards:
§ 175-23 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-23
169:715
(a) The land so dedicated meets the acreage requirements of
Chapter 153, Subdivision and Land Development.
(b) The land so dedicated is large enough to support active and
passive recreation facilities for the proposed population
densities and housing characteristics.
(c) The land is accessible to the public and is viewable from a
public street.
(2) If part of a planned community, golf courses should be located away
from the town center area. Up to 25% of the total area of a golf
course may be applied towards the minimum open space land area
requirement. As an incentive, up to 50% of the total area of a golf
course may be applied towards the minimum open space land area
requirement if a suitable area within the open space is utilized for
the treatment of wastewater effluent (i.e., spray irrigation, etc.).

agreement with the owner(s) of the off-site parking lot. This
agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Recorder of
Deeds. In no such case shall the off-site parking be less than
the required amount for the principal use unless the remaining
portion of the parking lot is provided on site.
(d) Large expansive parking lots shall be discouraged.
(e) All streets shall terminate at other streets or at public land
within the defined town center and shall provide connections
to existing or proposed adjoining land uses where feasible.
(4) Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of streets within the
defined town center perimeters. Alternate pedestrian circulation
may be considered by the Township in appropriate locations.
A. Environmental design. Development in the Planned Community District
should be based on an environmentally harmonious and aesthetically
pleasing design. Consideration should be given to the overall character
of the development and its visual effect on adjacent uses as well as the
tenants of the development, residents of the Township and Centre
Region at large. The following factors should be taken into account in
the design and presented on all plans submitted pursuant to an
approved master plan.
(1) Existing trees should be preserved whenever possible. Existing
stands of mature healthy trees, hedgerows, waterways, historic
sites, scenic points, views and vistas and other community assets
and landmarks should be preserved.
(2) The development plan should be designed to minimize grading and
other changes to the natural terrain. All graded slopes should blend
with the surrounding terrain and development.
(3) All landscaping shall be in conformance with an overall
landscaping plan and unifying concept for the development.
(4) Buffer yards and landscaping.
(a) Buffer yards are required, as applicable, on each lot (or lease
area) or land development area, independent of adjoining uses
or adjoining buffers.
§ 175-23.2 PATTON CODE § 175-24
169:728
(b) If a developed use increases in intensity or changes, increases
in the buffer yards may be required by the Board of
Supervisors.
(c) Consideration should be given to utilizing existing vegetation
as an element in the application of buffer yards.
(d) Buffer yards shall not be used for parking, loading, storage or
structures. All except side buffer yards of interior lots may be
crossed by access driveways and utility easements, provided
that such are not more than 25 feet in width at the point
intersection.
(e) Where a required buffer yard is wider than the setback(s)
required in the district, the wider dimension will govern.
(f) All plantings shall be selected to be compatible with the
environmental conditions they will be exposed to.
[1] Any plant material that does not survive must be replaced
within one year.
[2] The determination of the buffer yards shall be made
through the use of Tables 3, 4 and 5 as provided in
§ 175-40A, Environmental design. All uses within each use
classification would be considered to have an equal impact
on neighboring uses.
[3] Impacts resulting from greater intensity uses on adjacent
parcels would include noise, dust, lighting glare, heat,
traffic, building bulk and height, storage areas and
impervious surface areas.
[4] The intensity of adjoining uses must also be determined
from the classification system.
[5] Once the land use classifications are determined, the
appropriate buffer yard can then be applied to the land
development.
B. Town centers.
(1) Town center (except for Toftrees and Oakwood Planned
Communities). The Master Plan shall include a town center area
that incorporates the following design standards:
(a) Buildings in the town center shall be located next to the
sidewalk along a primary street (i.e., Grays Wood Boulevard) to
create a main street environment.
(b) Parking shall be located at the rear of the buildings, out of view
from the primary street (i.e., Grays Wood Boulevard). For the
purpose of this section, the side of the building immediately
§ 175-24 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-24
169:729
adjacent and facing the primary street shall be considered the
front of the building.
(c) Buildings shall be constructed with materials that distinguish
this area from other sections of the development by using
architectural treatments such as brickwork and awnings.
Renderings shall be submitted to the Township illustrating the
view of the buildings from the streetscape.
(d) The town center shall contain an area dedicated as a parklet or
community space that can be counted towards the total
parkland required for the planned community.
(2) Town center for Toftrees Planned Community. The master plan shall
include a town center area that incorporates the following design
standards:
(a) Building layout and orientation in the town center should
provide an atmosphere and environment that is walkable and
provides a pedestrian scale. This may be accomplished by
locating buildings along sidewalks along primary streets.
(b) Parking in the town center should be provided in a variety of
locations, including on street and off street. The overall design
should be cohesive and allow for an optimum mix and usability
of all the spaces in such a way to promote viable retail interests
while maintaining a pedestrian scale and public spaces. Offstreet
parking is encouraged at the rear of the buildings to
minimize large areas for specific uses (such as parking) in the
public viewshed.
(c) Building facades are an integral component of the streetscape.
The architectural treatments in the town center shall be
distinctive and distinguish this area from other sections of the
development. This may be achieved by using treatments such
as brickwork, awnings, and varying rooflines. Renderings shall
be submitted to the Township illustrating the view of the
buildings from the streetscape.
(d) The town center shall contain an area dedicated as a parklet or
community space that can be counted towards the total
parkland required for the planned community.
(e) The town center shall create an environment that encourages
active human engagement and is pedestrian, child, and family
friendly. Amenities in the town center will include pedestrian
lighting, a central public space where people may gather,
street trees, areas designated for shrubs, seasonal plantings,
and planters. Other elements that may be included, such as
sculpture or water features that are in harmony with the
architecture and the Toftrees community, are encouraged. The
town center should also use increased sidewalk widths, bicycle
§ 175-24 PATTON CODE § 175-24
169:730
facilities, and similar techniques to promote pedestrian
movements.
C. Signs. Signage shall be provided as required by Chapter 140, Signs,
with the following exceptions:
(1) Maximum height shall be 10 feet above grade for all ground-pole
signs in a planned community.
(2) No roof signs shall be permitted.
D. Utilities.
(1) Sewage disposal. Development within the Planned Community
District shall utilize public sewer service or an approved package
treatment system. Upon adoption of this district, all existing septic
systems in this area shall comply with the three-year frequency
pumping requirement of the Patton Township Sewage Management
Program, until such time as public sewer service is available to the
property and is required by the Board of Supervisors.
(2) Water supply. Development within the Planned Community District
shall utilize public water service. All water mains constructed shall
meet the design and installation specifications of the public water
supplier.
(3) Other utilities. All other utilities servicing the Planned Community
District shall be provided underground.

1-2-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-384; 10-24-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-486;
5-28-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-496; 3-10-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-518;
9-28-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-531; 1-6-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-551]
A. To provide for the preservation of the Township's natural recharge
areas.
B. To preserve areas of natural resources such as forests, rock
outcropping, areas of geological significance and areas of natural flora.
C. To preserve and protect land most suitable for agricultural and related
activities from urban encroachment.
D. To blend rural and suburban design elements where public sewer is
available. [Added 10-24-2007 by Ord. No. 2007-486]
A. Statement of intent.
(1) Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it
is the purpose of this section to encourage the pursuance of
existing agricultural uses and to maintain the rural character of the
area. In this manner, sufficient open land will be retained for future
use as stream, valley, parks and watershed control, conservation
and natural wilderness areas or game preserves. Areas within the
Regional Growth Boundary and Sewer Service Area can provide
transitional residential areas between higher-density zoning and
lower-density development outside the Sewer Service Area.
(2) Furthermore, the rural preservation design standards established
herein are intended to achieve the following:
(a) To encourage innovative residential development and design
resulting in a coherent overall development pattern and
streetscape.
(b) To create neighborhoods with direct visual access to open land.
(c) To conserve and efficiently use open land in rural areas by
maintaining permanent open land through the use of rural
preservation techniques and ensuring that this open land is
§ 175-25 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-26
169:739
incorporated as an integral component of community and
neighborhood design.
(d) To encourage new woodlands through natural succession,
reforestation and landscaping, where appropriate, and
encourage the preservation and improvement of habitat for
various forms of wildlife.
(e) To preserve and enhance the rural appearance and serenity of
outlying portions of the Township.
(f) To preserve environmentally sensitive features and historically
significant elements.
(g) To implement the environmental protection policies of the
Centre Region Comprehensive Plan by requiring open land.
(h) To promote land development beneficial to maintaining the
High Quality Cold Water Fishery designation for Buffalo Run
and the related watershed areas.
(i) To provide sufficient space in appropriate locations for the
pursuits of limited agricultural, horticulture and forestry
activities.
(j) Within the Regional Growth Boundary, to provide for the
efficient utilization of public water and sewer services.
B. Use regulations. Uses by right. Land, buildings and premises shall be
used by right for the uses shown in Table 1.
(1) Uses permitted as a conditional use. The uses shown in Table 1
shall be permitted as a conditional use subject to meeting the
procedures and criteria for conditional uses contained in § 175-42
and in conjunction with the specific requirements of each use as
identified in Table 1.1. If a conditional use approval is granted for
any of these uses by the Board of Supervisors, the buffer yard
requirements of § 175-40A must be addressed for all uses within
this district. [Amended 5-28-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-557]
(a) Community-supported agriculture. Developments within the
A-1 District that propose to incorporate within them a
community-supported agriculture (CSA) enterprise shall be

without review and approval by the Federal Insurance and Mitigation
Administration.
A. Declaration of legislative intent. In the interest of the public health,
safety and welfare, the regulations of the Floodplain District are
intended to protect areas of floodplain subject to and necessary for
floodwaters and to permit and encourage the retention of open land
uses which will be so located and designed as to constitute a
harmonious and appropriate part of the physical development of the
municipality as provided for in the Comprehensive Plan. In advancing
these principles and the general purposes of this chapter and the
Comprehensive Plan, the specific intent of this district is to:
(1) Combine with present zoning requirements certain restrictions
made necessary for the floodplains to promote the general health,
welfare and safety of the community.
(2) Prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage
by reason of danger from flooding, unsanitary conditions or other
hazard.
(3) Minimize danger to public health by protecting the water supply
and promoting safe and sanitary drainage.
(4) Reduce the financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units and its individuals by frequent and periodic
floods and overflow of lands.
(5) Permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in the
floodplain as herein defined and which will not impede the flow of
floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and property at or
above or below their locations along the floodway.
(6) Permit only those uses in the floodplain compatible to the
preservation of natural conditions which are conducive to the
maintenance of constant rates of water flow throughout the year
by:
(a) Withholding rapid water runoff contributing to downstream
flooding.
(b) Providing area for groundwater absorption for maintenance of
the subsurface water supply.
(7) Provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of
stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation.
B. The Floodplain Conservation Area shall include all lands designated by
the following:
(1) Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS).
§ 175-28 PATTON CODE § 175-28
169:758
(2) Alluvial soils delineated by Soils Report of the Soil Conservation
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, on map sheets
(47, 48, 55, 56, 63) of USDA Soil Survey, 1981:
Name Symbol
1. Chagrin Loams Ch
2. Lindside Silt Loam Lx
3. Melvin Silt Loam Mm
4. Dunning Silty Clay Loam Du
5. Wyoming Wy
6. Nolin No
(3) Wyoming (Wy) and Nolin (No) soils, while not displaying all of the
characteristics common to the alluvial soils indicated in the
preceding table, may be subject to periodic overflow or flooding.
For this reason, they shall be considered an integral part of a flood
network. However, they may be exempted from the provisions of
this chapter where it is determined that:
(a) They are not contained within the areas delineated by the
official Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) of the Federal Insurance Administration,
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(b) That such exemption would not have the effect of nullifying the
declaration of legislative intent of this chapter. Those cases in
which either Wyoming or Nolin, local-alluvium, are involved
shall be referred to the Planning Commission, which shall
examine each case and recommend either compliance with or
exemption from the provisions of this chapter and shall attach
any conditions appropriate to meet the declaration of
legislative intent of this chapter.
C. Permitted uses. The uses shown in Table 1 are permitted in the
Floodplain Conservation Area, provided there is strict compliance with
the floodproofing and related provisions in this and all other applicable
codes and ordinances.
D. Prohibitions and use limitations. The uses permitted in Subsection C,
Table 1, are limited as follows:
(1) All new construction or development is prohibited.
(2) Improvements or modifications to an existing structure shall be
permitted, but they shall be elevated or floodproofed as much as
possible, provided that said improvements or modifications involve
less than 50% of the fair market value and less than 50% of the
square footage as it existed on January 6, 2014.
§ 175-28 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-28
169:759
(3) All other uses, whether temporary or permanent, are prohibited,
including but not limited to the following, which are not interpreted
as customary uses:
(a) All structures and buildings with the exception of retaining
walls, flood retention dams, culverts and bridges as approved
by the Department of Environmental Protection.
(b) The filling in, removal of topsoil from, any alterations or
damming of any watercourse within the Floodplain
Conservation Area without prior approval by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection; the applicant must
notify all adjacent communities, the State Coordinating Office
and the Administrator of the Federal Insurance Administration.
(c) Sanitary landfill or dumping of any kind.
(d) Fences which impede, retard or change the direction of the
flow of water or catch or collect debris carried by such water.
(e) On-site sewage disposal system.
(f) Swimming pools.
(4) Outdoor storage materials which are buoyant, flammable or
explosive or those hazardous materials listed in Section 38.7 of the
Pennsylvania Department of Community Affairs Flood Plain
Management Regulations.
E. Special exceptions. The uses shown in Table 1 shall be permitted in the
Floodplain Conservation Area upon approval by the Zoning Hearing
Board as a special exception. Additional regulations for specific uses
are as follows:
(1) Residential front, side and/or rear yards and uses customarily
incidental thereto.
(a) Except that no structures shall be permitted.
(b) Inclusion of floodplain lands within the residential lots in order
to meet minimum lot area or yard requirements is contingent
upon complying with the objectives and standards set forth in
the declaration of legislative intent of this chapter (§ 175-2)
and with any other pertinent municipal regulations. If such
compliance cannot be shown, the land area within the
Floodplain District shall not be calculated for purposes of
determining lot areas or yard requirements.

§ 175-29. Intent.
In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, the district established in
this regulation is intended to achieve the following:
§ 175-30. I-1 Industrial District. [Amended 9-25-1984 by Ord. No.
84-191]
A. To provide sufficient space, in appropriate locations, to meet the
anticipated future needs for industrial activity with due allowance for
the needs for a range of choice of sites.
B. To provide that the land most suitable for industrial and related
activities will be available by prohibiting the use of such land for new
residential development and at the same time, to protect residences by
separating them from such activities.
C. To protect industry against congestion by limiting the bulk of buildings
in relation to the land around them and to one another and by providing
sufficient off-street parking and loading facilities for such
developments.
D. To promote the most desirable use of land and direction of building
development in accord with a well-considered plan, to promote stable
industry, to strengthen the economic base, to protect the character of
particular industrial areas and their peculiar suitability to particular
uses, to conserve the value of land and buildings and to protect local tax
revenues.
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to provide industrial locations for plants which
are normally undesirable adjacent to residential and commercial areas,

impacts likely to result from projected development and activities
within the district for a ten-year period. The transportation study shall
include the following:
(1) Parking area identification and projections. Transportation impacts
within the UPD will principally arise from the location and size of
parking areas within the district. The transportation study,
therefore, must identify existing parking areas and the general size
and location of areas within each subdistrict which are projected
for use as parking areas within a ten-year period.
(2) Traffic analysis. The study shall identify the transportation study
area and the transportation systems to be studied. Existing
transportation conditions for highway links and intersections
serving the UPD must be described and the existing level of use
analyzed. Potential transportation impacts of future parking
development must be assessed for a ten-year period.
Recommendations for potential system or service improvements in
order to accommodate the projected transportation impacts of UPD
development shall be included. When feasible, the study shall
identify specific recommendations designed to reduce or avoid
impacts created by campus development on existing and future
residential neighborhoods.
(3) Internal circulation and facilities. The study shall describe existing
and proposed internal roads for vehicular traffic; existing and
proposed connections to the public street network; plans for street
openings and closings and possible impacts on the adjoining
transportation system and adjoining zoning districts; and existing
and proposed facilities and accommodations for public
transportation, pedestrian circulation, bicycle paths and other
transportation methods.
(4) Travel demand management. The study shall include a travel
demand management analysis addressing the manner in which
various methods, such as promotion of ridesharing, pedestrian/
bicycle improvements and changes to on-campus and public
transportation systems, will be utilized to reduce the number of
single occupancy vehicle trips associated with existing or future
development under the district plan.

ARTICLE VIII
Planned Airport District
[Added 2-27-1991 by Ord. No. 91-261]
§ 175-34. Intent.
A. Since its inception in the early 1950's, the University Park Airport has
continually expanded its size and services. This airport growth creates
potential impacts on the surrounding community, including but not
limited to the areas of transportation, noise, air and water pollution,
safety hazards, need for public infrastructure and emergency services.
Future land developments in the Centre Region will place greater
demands on this facility and the neighboring largely undeveloped lands.
B. In order to meet these demands, land use compatibility between the
airport and the neighboring lands is imperative. Prudent planning is
essential and must relate to the development goals of the Centre Region
municipalities as articulated in the Comprehensive Plan. Development
of infrastructure must also be consistent with the impending airport
growth to prevent problems and at the same time, protect the
environment. Recent studies have identified a significant potential
source of groundwater immediately adjacent to the airport. This
valuable source of future water supply for the Centre Region must be
protected from contamination.
C. The Planned Airport District is designed to minimize airport hazards
related to development of lands surrounding the University Park
Airport and to minimize the potential for contamination of the potential
well field located within the district. It is also intended to promote the
careful planning and orderly development of lands impacted by the
airport consistent with the goals and objectives of Patton Township as
described in the Comprehensive Plan. In addition, the district achieves
additional purposes that include:
(1) Provision of flexibility for land development, while also providing
for determination, review and mitigation of potential community
and environmental impacts associated with future airport
development.
(2) Promotion of the health, safety and general welfare of the
inhabitants of Patton Township by protecting them from the
adverse effects of aircraft noise and preventing an increase in the
number of people exposed to airport-related hazards.
(3) Prevention of the obstructions and incompatible land uses that
affect navigable airspace.
(4) Prevention of the development of land uses which tend to
concentrate large numbers of people in the airport hazard areas.
§ 175-34 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-34

§ 175-35. Establishment.
The area of Patton Township designated on the Zoning Map of the Township
as the "Planned Airport District" is hereby established as the "Planned
Airport District".
§ 175-36. Use regulations.
(5) Encouragement of innovative design in the layout of buildings,
structures and open spaces and encouragement of a pattern of
development which preserves trees and natural features, and
prevents soil erosion.
(6) Provision of adequate water supply, sanitary facilities, stormwater
management and other utilities and services.
(7) Encouragement of innovative strategies to reduce transportation
impacts from proposed development that will improve safety,
reduce congestion, provide adequate access and promote the use
of transportation demand management strategies.
(8) Assurance that, to the maximum extent possible, the community is
afforded the opportunity to participate in the development or
amendment of the district.
(9) Provision of criteria that allows a mix of land uses in a growth area
served by public utilities with an emphasis on providing area for
light industrial uses.
A. Uses by right.
(1) The specific uses permitted within different portions of the Planned
Airport District are listed in Table 1.201 These uses are a function of
the noise levels projected to be generated by aircraft using the
airport, the proximity of a given area to the airport runways and
flight approach paths and the desire to protect the nearby potential
groundwater supply from contamination by activities conducted
within the district.
(2) Lines delineating residential, mixed use and nonresidential areas
within the Planned Airport District are to be depicted on and are to
be considered an integral part of the Zoning Map. The location of
these lines are generally based on projected decibel levels
contained in the report prepared by L. Robert Kimball Associates
entitled "Noise Analysis Based on 8,500 Foot Runway and
Corresponding Operations at the University Park Airport," dated
January 5, 1989. The location of these lines is to be considered a
fixed part of the Zoning Map and their location can only be changed
by amendment of the Zoning Map.

§ 175-37. Procedure for master plan approval.
All development within the Planned Airport District must be done pursuant
to approval of a master plan in accordance with the procedure that follows.
The minimum area for which a master plan can be prepared is 20 acres.
Master plans for the Planned Airport District shall be reviewed by the
Patton Township Planning Commission and the Centre Regional Planning
Commission and shall be approved or denied by the Board of Supervisors
in accordance with the procedures specified herein. Parcels smaller than 20
(3) In order to protect the safety of persons on the ground and within
aircraft, additional safety measures as established by the Federal
Aviation Administration will be made part of this chapter. These
safety measures are identified as the runway protection zone,
runway approach zone and horizontal clearance zone. The runway
and approach areas (based on the Federal Aviation Administration
runway protection zone and runway approach zone respectively)
are to be depicted on and are to be considered an integral part of
the Zoning Map and their location can only be changed by
amendment of the Zoning Map. The entire Planned Airport District
lies within the horizontal clearance zone.
B. The concern for protection of the potential future source of
groundwater identified in the airport area is embodied within Table
2,202 which prohibits certain activities from being conducted in the
Planned Airport District that could contaminate the potential water
supply. In addition, a buffer of at least 150 feet shall be required from
all designated well sites. This buffer shall be measured from the
perimeter of the designated site(s). Vegetation and/or a combination of
low maintenance trees, shrubs and ground cover plantings shall be
provided within the buffer. All buildings, structures, parking or other
impervious surfaces shall be prohibited from locating in the buffer yard.
The designated well sites shall be identified on the Master Plan.
C. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any area established by this chapter in
such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make
it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport and aircraft, make it
difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others,
result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in
the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any
way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of
aircraft intending to use the airport. All uses by right permitted in the
Planned Airport District must conform to the regulations established by
the Federal Aviation Administration that govern development within the
airport horizontal clearance zone, runway approach zone and runway
protection zones as defined in this chapter.

recommendation on such application until reports from the
Centre County and Centre Regional Planning commissions are
received or until expiration of 30 days from the date the plan
was forwarded to these agencies, whichever comes first.
(c) If review by the Township Planning Commission results in an
unfavorable recommendation because the requirements of this
chapter have not been met, notification to the Township Board
of Supervisors should specify the defects found in the plan and
describe the requirements which have not been met and
should cite the provisions of this chapter from which such
defects or requirements originate.
(4) Review by the Township Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of the
recommendation from the Planning Commission or upon failure to
receive said recommendations 70 days after submittal, the Board of
Supervisors shall review the application for master plan Approval.
(a) The Board of Supervisors shall review the plan and the written
reports of the Township Planning Commission, the Centre
County Planning Commission, the Centre Regional Planning
Commission, the Township Engineer and the other reviewing
agencies to determine if the plan meets all applicable
regulations. Prior to approval of a master plan, the Board of

finds essential for the protection of any approved phase. In such
case, a schedule showing the proposed times within which
applications for final approval of land development plans of all
phases of the development are intended to be filed shall be
included with the Master Plan. The schedule may be revised by the
Board of Supervisors if requested to do so by the landowner or
developer.
(7) Failure of the Board of Supervisors to render a decision and
communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the master plan in
terms as presented, unless the applicant has agreed to an
extension of time or change in the prescribed manner of
presentation or communication of the decision, in which case
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
(8) In the event that approval is granted subject to conditions, the
owner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official
written communication of the governing body, notify the Board of
Supervisors of their refusal to accept all of said conditions, in which
case the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to have denied
approval of the master plan. In the event that the landowner does
not within said period notify the Board of Supervisors of their
acceptance of all of said conditions, approval of the master plan
shall be deemed to have been denied.
(9) An approved master plan shall be recorded by the developer in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds of Centre County within 90 days of
approval.

for the area of the Planned Airport District within 500 feet
of the district's northwestern boundary line as defined at
the end of Table 1.204
[2] Two and five-tenths dwelling units per residential use acre
for the remaining portion of the Planned Airport District
that permits residential uses.
(b) As an incentive for larger-scale planning, the maximum
densities permitted under Subsection B(1)(a)[1] and [2] can be
doubled for master plan areas encompassing 100 or more
acres. Acreage within the runway area cannot be credited
toward master plan acreage for development occurring outside
of the runway area.
(2) The maximum density for areas to be used for nonresidential uses
shall not exceed a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of two-tenths (0.2). The
acreage to be used in determining the FAR is the nonresidential
acreage within the Master Plan not contained within the runway
area. As an incentive for larger scale planning, the maximum
density for areas to be used for nonresidential uses shall not exceed
a FAR of four-tenths (0.4) for master plan areas encompassing 100
or more acres. Acreage within the runway area cannot be credited
toward master plan acreage for development occurring outside of
the runway area.
(3) Within any phase of a master plan, where applicable, no more than
20% of the nonresidential floor area may be devoted to the
commercial uses listed in Table 1.205
C. Allowable use percentages.

(1) In the mixed use, nonresidential and approach areas, all
development plans must devote at least 50% of their area to
general airport area uses and shall devote no more than 20% of
their area to the commercial uses listed in Table 1.
(2) In the residential area only the uses listed in Table 1 shall be
permitted.
(3) If development done pursuant to an approved master plan is to be
done in phases, the construction within each phase must comply
with the use percentages listed in part of this section.
D. Maximum lot coverage.
(1) Within residential use areas, structures shall not cover more than
25% of the lot area. The maximum impervious coverage in
residential use areas shall not exceed 50% of the Master Plan area
designated for residential uses.
(2) Within nonresidential use areas, the maximum impervious
coverage shall not exceed 60% of the Master Plan area designated
for nonresidential uses.
E. Height requirements.
(1) The height of all buildings within the Planned Airport District shall
not exceed 50 feet or the maximum height limitations imposed by
FAA regulations (Part 77) for horizontal clearance zones, runway
approach zones or runway protection zones, whichever is less.
(2) The height of all structures within the Planned Airport District shall
not exceed 70 feet or the maximum height limitations imposed by

not abut public rights-of-way shall be 50 feet for structures and 15
feet for parking areas.
(3) No minimum setbacks for interior streets or internal lot lines are
established herein. Such setbacks will be established by the Board
of Supervisors for each subdivision or land development plan
submitted pursuant to an approved Master Plan. This allows the
designer flexibility in the placement of structures. However, a
proposal using minimal setbacks must clearly establish the
sufficiency of the design pattern for which the minimum setbacks
are proposed.

capable of being used as an outdoor recreation facility. Such an
area may be added to the 15% maximum as described above upon
review and approval by the Municipal Engineer.
A. Environmental design. Development in the Planned Airport District
should be based on an environmentally harmonious and aesthetically
pleasing design. Consideration should be given to the overall character
of the development and its visual effect on adjacent uses as well as the
tenants of the development, residents of the Township and Centre
Region at large. The following factors should be taken into account in
the design and presented on all plans submitted pursuant to an
approved master plan.
(1) Existing trees should be inventoried and preserved whenever
possible. Existing stands of mature healthy trees, hedgerows,
waterways, historic sites, scenic points, views and vistas and other
community assets and landmarks should be preserved.
(2) The development plan should be designed to minimize grading and
other changes to the natural terrain. All graded slopes should blend
with the surrounding terrain and development.
(3) All landscaping shall be in conformance with an overall
landscaping plan and unifying concept for the development.
(4) Buffer yards. The determination of the buffer yards shall be made
through the use of Tables 3, 4 and 5.206 All uses within each use
classification would be considered to have an equal impact on
neighboring uses. Impacts resulting from greater intensity uses on
adjacent parcels would include: noise, dust, lighting glare, heat,
traffic, building bulk and height, storage areas and impervious

surface areas. The intensity of adjoining uses must also be
determined from the classification system. Once the land use
classifications are determined, the appropriate buffer yard can
then be applied to the land development.
(a) Buffer yards are required, as applicable, on each lot (or lease
area) or land development area independent of adjoining uses
or adjoining buffers.
(b) If a developed use increases in intensity or changes, increases
in the buffer yards may be required by the Board of
Supervisors.
(c) Consideration should be given to utilizing existing vegetation
as an element in the application of buffer yards.
(d) Buffer yards shall not be used for parking, loading, storage or
structures. All except side buffer yards of interior lots may be
crossed by access driveways and utility easements, provided
that such are not more than 25 feet in width at the point of
intersection.
(e) Where a required buffer yard is wider than the setback(s)
required in the district, the wider dimension will govern.
(f) All plantings shall be selected to be compatible with the
environmental conditions they will be exposed to. Any plant
material that does not survive must be replaced within one
year.
B. Utilities.
(1) Sewage disposal. Development within the Planned Airport District
shall utilize public sewer service. Upon adoption of this district, all
existing septic systems in this area shall comply with the threeyear-
frequency pumping requirement of Chapter 143, Sewage and
Sewage Disposal, until such time as public sewer service is
available to the property.
(2) Water supply. Development within the Planned Airport District
shall utilize public water service. All water mains constructed shall
meet the design and installation specifications of the public water
supplier.
(3) Other utilities. All other utilities servicing the Planned Airport
District shall be provided underground.

I-99 Interchange Overlay District
[Added 5-16-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-388]
§ 175-40.1. Intent and area of application.
A. The intent of the Interchange Overlay District is to encourage
controlled, sensible interchange development by providing an
additional set of protective measures on top of existing regulations. The
District regulations will:
(1) Provide uniformity and standardization from interchange to
interchange.
(2) Promote safety.
(3) Minimize the impact to the natural environment.
(4) Promote highway beautification in Patton Township.
B. Within the Interchange Overlay District, all existing zoning, land use,
and building regulations now in place continue to apply except where
the regulations contained in the Interchange Overlay District are
stronger or more restrictive.
C. Area of application. The following are the corridors for application of
the Interchange Overlay District at a corridor width of 1/8 mile (660
feet) on both sides, measured from the center line of the right-of-way.
The overlay district corridor is modified to exclude areas as described
in Subsection E below.
(1) The full length of I-99 in Patton Township, both existing and
proposed sections.
(2) Waddle Road extended north into Toftrees to the multifamily parcel
west of the existing golf course and to the south to Clearview
Avenue.
(3) Valley Vista Drive from I-99 west to Carnegie Drive.
(4) North Atherton Street south from I-99 to Douglas Drive and
Hawbaker Industrial Drive.
(5) Scotia Road west from I-99 to the property line between Tax
Parcels 18-3-58B and 18-3-58C.
(6) Existing Route 322 west from the I-99 Interchange to property line
between Tax Parcels 18-3-47A and 18-3-17B, which is
approximately the extension of Sellers Lane.
D. Parcels included. The overlay district requirements shall apply to all
development within the corridor and apply to all development on
§ 175-40.1 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.1
169:807
§ 175-40.2. Highway access and safety.
parcels on which the overlay district corridor covers at least 50% of the
area of the parcel.207
A. Specific intent. It is the intent of the section to improve safety by
limiting the number of access points which are permitted onto the
interchange access road. The reduction in paving by eliminating the
need for numerous entryways will also create more frontage space for
landscaping or retention of existing trees, thereby promoting highway
beautification and, thus, a more pleasing gateway to the community.
B. Access from highways.
(1) All plans for vehicular access to new development from the
interchange access road shall be submitted to the municipality. If
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) approval is
required, plans must be submitted to the municipality and
PennDOT concurrently for review and approval. All access plans
are subject to the requirements of Subsection C below.
(2) Any new right-of-way providing vehicular access from the
interchange access road shall be located a minimum distance of
300 feet from the point at which the exit/entrance ramp intersects
the interchange access road. This point shall be measured from the
property boundary of the limited access right-of-way. Any new
right-of-way providing vehicular access from the interchange
access road shall be no closer to any other such right-of-way than
800 feet, measured from center line to center line. (Figure 1)
Figure 1. Vehicular access standards for interchange access road
(3) Direct vehicular access to uses fronting on an interchange access
road may be permitted in the following instances:
(a) Where direct access currently exists, shared driveways shall be
utilized except where lot width exceeds 300 feet.
(b) Where phased development is to occur as a single project or as
part of a larger development, whether by one or more
applicants, temporary direct access may be permitted. For
purposes of this subsection, the period of temporary direct

district and which originally followed this subsection, was repealed 6-20-2001 by Ord. No.
2001-389.
§ 175-40.1 PATTON CODE § 175-40.2
169:808
access shall not extend, nor be renewed, beyond the lesser
of one year or at such time as construction of the second
phase of development has commenced. Upon termination of
the temporary direct access period, direct access shall no
longer be permitted.
(4) Access easements that connect adjoining properties and land
developments for vehicular and pedestrian access shall be
provided.
C. Traffic studies and transportation improvements.
(1) The municipality may require a traffic impact study for any
proposed development within the Interchange Overlay District.
(2) The traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified
professional and shall meet or exceed the requirements set forth in
Appendix A.208
(3) The traffic impact study shall include recommended improvements
mitigating the development's traffic impact and maximizing public
safety. Such recommended improvements shall be taken into
account in any zoning, site plan, or subdivision review of the
proposed development.
D. Intermodal transportation.
(1) All commercial and industrial uses in an Interchange Overlay
District shall provide for on-site bicycle storage for 2.5% of the
total number of required parking spaces.
(2) Any use that does not fully utilize its parking area on weekdays is
encouraged to provide daytime park and ride opportunities.
(3) All uses shall provide for bicycle trails or lanes that connect to all
appropriate adjacent properties and neighborhoods as a means of
providing linkage between lots in the Interchange Overlay District.
Where the bicycle trail can be combined with pedestrian sidewalk
systems, as determined by the municipality, then the combined
pedestrian/bicycle trail shall meet American Association of State
Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards.
(4) Public transit amenities shall be provided where appropriate, as
determined by the municipality. The amenities shall include a
transit stop pull-off and pad area, covered shelter, and connecting
walkway(s) to the building(s). The appropriateness, design, and
location of these facilities shall be based on ADA (Americans with
Disabilities Act) standards and the operational requirements of the
transit provider.

§ 175-40.2 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.3
169:809
§ 175-40.3. Setbacks and landscaping.
A. Intent.
(1) Under Pennsylvania zoning and planning enabling legislation, local
governments have the authority to adopt regulations requiring
adequate setbacks and landscaping. The basic approach discussed
here establishes a buffer between the interstate highway right-ofway
and all development and standards for landscaping along the
interchange access road and in and around parking lots.
(2) Concern about the impacts of development on safety, the future
scenic character around the interchanges, and the environment
prompted the creation of this section. Trees and other landscaping
are required within and around parking lots: for highway
beautification as seen from the interstate or interchange access
road; to improve safety by reducing diagonal travel across traffic
patterns; and to minimize environmental impacts by reducing heat
build up and stormwater runoff volume and velocity. Furthermore,
the planting materials section requires that new plantings use at
least 50% vegetation native to central Pennsylvania. Native species
tend to be more tolerant of local environmental conditions and tend
to be healthier, reducing the need for watering, pesticides, and
nutrient applications. On the other hand, the standard still provides
flexibility for other plant selections. Invasive species are excluded
from use because of their nuisance capacity and adverse impact on
other valued plants and animals.
B. Setbacks.
(1) All proposed development to be located within the interstate
highway and interchange access road corridors shall meet the
following setback requirement:
(a) A minimum setback of 75 feet from the edge of the mainline
portion of the right-of-way of the interstate highway. This
setback shall not apply to parcels abutting state-controlled
limited-access right-of-way where the difference in the
bearings of the right-of-way line and the nearest through travel
lane is greater than 45°.
(b) The setback in Subsection B(1) may be reduced to 50 feet,
provided that the requirements of Subsection C(4) are met.
(2) The setback requirements shall apply to all buildings, parking
areas, and service or loading zones.
(3) No provision of this section is intended to contravene the intent or
application of § 175-23D(4) regarding setbacks in the Oakwood and
Toftrees Planned Communities.
C. Setback landscaping.
§ 175-40.3 PATTON CODE § 175-40.3
169:810
(1) All setbacks adjacent to rights-of-way shall be landscaped in
accordance with this subsection.
(2) All lots shall provide a minimum of one tree for each 40 linear feet
of road frontage. Lots less than 40 feet in width shall provide a
minimum of one tree.
(3) All required trees planted within the setback shall be of a shadetype
variety with a minimum caliper of 2.5 inches at planting and
an expected height at maturity of at least 30 feet.
(4) The following enhancements shall be provided to reduce the
minimum setback along the mainline portion of the right-of-way
from 75 feet to 50 feet.
(a) Provide a visual screen of landscaping meeting these minimum
required plantings per 100 lineal feet of mainline right-of-way
frontage:
Canopy trees (minimum four-inch caliper measured 12 inches
above ground: four.
Understory trees (minimum three-inch caliper measured 12
inches above ground: four.
Shrubs: 16.
Evergreens (minimum height eight feet): eight.
(b) The required numbers of trees and shrubs in Subsection
C(4)(a) may be reduced by 25% if a combination of earth
berms, hedges, or architectural walls or fences a minimum of
four feet in height measured from finished grade are provided
as a part of the visual screen along the mainline right-of-way
frontage.
(c) Existing vegetation may be counted toward landscaping
requirements at the discretion of the Township.
(d) At least 75% of the new vegetation on the lot shall be native to
the region. Native vegetation shall include, but not be limited
to, plant materials set forth in Appendix C.209
(e) To allow flexibility in the preparation of screening plans, the
following exchange ratios may be utilized, subject to approval
of the detailed plan by the Township:
[1] Two understory trees may be substituted for one canopy
shade tree.
[2] One canopy shade tree may be substituted for two
understory trees.
209. Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 175-40.3 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.3
169:811
§ 175-40.4. Building and site design.
[3] Two evergreen trees may be substituted for one canopy
shade tree.
[4] One evergreen tree or canopy tree may be substituted for
five shrubs.
[5] One understory tree may be substituted for three shrubs.
(f) Where differing requirements are imposed by this section on
screening and by other sections requiring landscaping, the
requirements of this section shall take precedence.
(g) Recharge of stormwater shall be provided for an amount of
impervious area equivalent to 1.5 times the area of the
reduction of the setback from 75 feet to 50 feet. The minimum
required recharge volume is equal to 1.5 inches of runoff from
the area defined above.
D. Sidewalks and pedestrian walkways in setbacks. Developers are
encouraged to respond to topography and vegetation in the design of
sidewalk or walkway layouts.
E. Parking lot landscaping.
(1) Planting islands within parking areas shall be underlain by a
minimum of two feet of suitable planting soil free of construction
debris. Developers are encouraged to reduce curb height, provide
breaks in the curb, or eliminate curbs around planting islands so
that they may be used as infiltration areas for stormwater
reduction. Islands to be used for this purpose would be required to
be at a lower grade to allow for the absorption of water.
F. Planting materials.
(1) All new vegetation on a lot in the Interchange Overlay District,
including street trees, canopy trees, shrubs, bushes, hedges,
flowers, plants, and ground cover shall be of a noninvasive species.
For purposes of this article, those invasive species to be avoided
shall include those set forth in Appendix B.210
(2) At least 50% of the new vegetation on a lot in the Interchange
Overlay District shall be native to the region. For purposes of this
article, native vegetation shall include, but need not be limited to,
plant materials set forth in Appendix C.
(3) New vegetation shall be maintained permanently by the lot owner,
and any plant material which does not live shall be replaced within
one year.
210. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 175-40.3 PATTON CODE § 175-40.4
169:812
A. Intent. How buildings look, their placement on a site, and their
relationship to the immediate surroundings provide some of the most
significant influences on the character of a community. Community
character, especially along well-traveled routes, is an important
contributor to property values and strong economic development. As
such, these regulations aim to reinforce two of the main intentions of
the Interchange Overlay District: to provide for uniformity of standards
and highway beautification. The standards provided here will be
equitable for all who develop, but more importantly, they will provide a
consistency to the development character thereby enabling the longterm
preservation of property values and the promotion of economic
development, both valid legal rationales for regulation by
municipalities.
For example, expansive blank walls of retail uses facing a street
contribute very little to the life and vitality of that location. Therefore,
the standards here for ground-floor display windows and a primary
entry facing the interchange access road reflect retail building
qualities found in the Township's originally settled crossroads, villages,
and towns. Many zoning codes in other municipalities in Pennsylvania
require that new structures have features similar to those of existing
or historic neighborhood buildings.
B. Specific building and site requirements in Subdivision and Land
Development chapter. The specific requirements for building exteriors
and building placement and site design are found in Chapter 153
(Subdivision and Land Development), § 153-34.2, Design standards,
I-99 Interchange Overlay District.
C. Underground Infrastructure.
(1) After the effective date of this article, all new utility lines serving
uses proposed or developed, including electric, telephone, data,
and CATV, shall be installed underground, except as provided in
Subsection C(3) below.
(2) Junction boxes, transformers, and other apparatuses essential to
utility service which, due to their function, are required to be
located above ground shall be screened from view of public rightsof-
way. No apparatus or its screening shall be placed in a location
that obstructs motorist visibility.
(3) The following uses shall be exempt from the requirements of
Subsections C(1) and (2) above:
(a) Single-family dwellings constructed on lots subdivided prior to
the effective date of this article; and
(b) Agricultural uses that require additional utility service,
provided such use is permitted under the terms of Chapter
175.
§ 175-40.4 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.4
169:813
§ 175-40.5. Environmentally sensitive areas.
(c) Where existing overhead service is located, additional services
such as data, lighting, and communications may be attached.
A. Intent. This region is fortunate to be blessed with high quality natural
resources; however, as with any natural systems, they are vulnerable to
degradation if altered too much. Two categories of environmentally
sensitive areas are discussed in this section due not only to their
contribution to our unique natural heritage but also because of their
relationship with public health and safety: steep slopes, and streams
and wetlands. The standards here have been structured to provide
straightforward explanation (versus complicated calculations) and
flexibility in their implementation. The state's Stormwater Management
Act also provides authority as well as allowing limits on earthmoving
activities to "minimize the extent of disturbed lands."
B. Slope restrictions. The specific requirements for slope restrictions are
found in Chapter 153 (Subdivision and Land Development), § 153-34.2,
Design standards, I-99 Interchange Overlay District.
C. Stream and wetland buffers. The specific requirements for stream and
wetland buffers are found in Chapter 153 (Subdivision and Land
Development), § 153-34.2, Design Standards, I-99 Interchange Overlay
District.

§ 175-40.6. Historic preservation uses.
A. Specific intent. The intent of this section is to encourage protection of
historical buildings for the educational and cultural welfare of the
public in Patton Township; to safeguard the heritage of the Township by
preserving historic buildings that reflect elements of cultural, social,
economic, political, and architectural history; and to foster civic pride
in the beauty and accomplishments of the Township's past without
unduly impacting surrounding properties by providing limits on the
allowable historic conditional uses.
B. Scope. The regulations shall apply to all zoning districts in Patton
Township.
C. Use regulations.
(1) Use by right: all uses permitted by right in the underlying zoning
district.
(2) Uses permitted as a conditional use. The following uses shall be
permitted as conditional uses subject to meeting the definition of a
historic building and approval of the Township Board of
Supervisors:
(a) All uses permitted as conditional uses in the underlying zoning
district; and
(b) Historic use;
(c) Antique shop;
(d) Monument or exhibit for the purpose of community awareness
or education that is operated by a nonprofit organization.
D. Procedure and criteria for conditional uses. Prerequisites for approval
of conditional use:
(1) Prior to the issuance of a conditional use permit, a site plan, a
building plan illustrating all proposed alterations to the historic
building and list of materials that will be used shall be submitted to
the Township.
(2) All conditions listed under § 175-42 shall be completed.
E. Design standards.
(1) For screening, storage, landscaping, access and traffic control,
interior circulation and lighting requirements, see § 175-44.

(4) Alteration: No major alterations shall be allowed to the historic
exterior facade of the building. If a natural or accidental alteration
occurs after a use is approved in a historic building in accordance
with this article, the owner can reapply for a conditional use to
rebuild the historic section of the building within five years from
the date of the alteration. The Board of Supervisors may approve
the conditional use if satisfactory evidence is provided that the
proposed reconstruction of the historic character of the property
would meet the intent of the article.
F. Area, bulk, open space and parking requirements. Area, density,
parking and open space requirements shall be as required in the
underlying zoning district in which the historic building is located as
per § 153-38 of the Patton Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
G. Proof of eligibility. The owner of the building must provide necessary
information and proof on the historic value of the building. The owner
may present literature, photographs, maps or any other information
that the Township will need to determine the historic value of the
building. The Township may require additional proof at any time during
the evaluation of the building's eligibility. Validity of the building's
historic value can be reinforced if a written statement is obtained from
The Centre County Historical Society or The Pennsylvania Historic and
Museum Commission. Based on the information presented, the Board of
Supervisors shall determine if the building meets the criteria to be
considered historic.

169:816
H. Withdrawal. If the historic value for which the use was granted is
destroyed or altered, the building will no longer be considered historic.
The Township will provide a ninety-day written notice to the owner,
after which the use permitted will be withdrawn. Any proposed
alterations to the building should be reported to the Zoning Officer for
evaluation. The Township shall determine if the alteration is major or
minor.

Wind Energy Facilities
[Added 9-28-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-531]
§ 175-40.7. Wind energy facilities.
A. Intent. The intent of these regulations is to provide for the construction
and operation of wind energy facilities in Patton Township, subject to
reasonable conditions that will protect the public health, safety and
welfare.
B. Scope. These regulations apply to all wind energy facilities proposed to
be constructed after the effective date of these regulations. Wind
energy facilities constructed prior to the effective date of these
regulations shall not be required to meet the requirements of these
regulations, provided that any physical modification to an existing wind
energy facility that materially alters the size, type and number of wind
turbines or other equipment shall require a permit under these
regulations.
C. Definitions. The definitions set forth below shall be applicable to this
article:
AMBIENT NOISE LEVEL  Sometimes referred to as "background
noise," is the existing or inherent sound level of an area at any given
time as produced by existing sources, normally specified as a reference
level for determining intrusive sound levels introduced by new sources.
BLADE CLEARANCE  Required minimum distance between the
lowest point of a rotor blade and the ground surface below it.
COMMERCIAL WIND ENERGY FACILITY (CWEF)  An electric
generation facility consisting of one or more wind turbines with a
combined rated capacity exceeding 100 kW, the main purpose of which
is to supply electricity for offsite use. This term shall include all other
related accessory structures and buildings serving the primary
intention of the producing and transmitting of electricity off site. The
term does not include wind turbines constructed primarily for
residential use on site as a permitted accessory use.
DECIBEL (dB)  A unit of sound level which is a division of a
logarithmic scale used to express the ratio of the sound pressure of
the source to the pressure of an arbitrarily chosen reference pressure;
the ratio is expressed on the decibel scale by multiplying its base 10
logarithm by 20.
FACILITY OWNER  The entity or entities having equity interest in a
commercial wind energy facility, including their respective successors
and/or assigns.
FAIL-SAFE MODE  A device or feature which, in the event of failure,
responds in a way that will cause no harm or at least a minimum of
harm to other devices or danger.
§ 175-40.7 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.7
169:819
KILOWATT (kW)  The kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts. This unit is
typically used to express the output power of engines and the power
consumption of electric motors, tools, machines, and heaters.
LANDOWNER, NONPARTICIPATING  Any landowner except those on
whose property all, or a portion, of a commercial wind energy facility is
located pursuant to an agreement with the facility owner or operator.
LANDOWNER, PARTICIPATING  A landowner upon whose property
all, or a portion, of a commercial wind energy facility is located or
pursuant to an agreement with the facility owner or operator.
METEOROLOGICAL TOWER (often referred to as a "met tower")  A
structure designed to support the gathering of wind energy resource
data, including the tower, base plate, anchors, cables, anemometers
and any and all related appurtenances used to monitor or transmit wind
speed and wind flow characteristics over a period of time.
NACELLE  The structure that houses all of the generating
components, gearbox, drive train, etc., of a wind turbine.
OCCUPIED BUILDING  A residence, school, hospital, church, public
library or other building used for public gathering that is occupied or in
use when the permit application is submitted.
OPERATOR  The entity responsible for the day-to-day operation and
maintenance of a wind energy facility.
RESIDENTIAL WIND ENERGY FACILITY (RWEF) (often referred to as
"small wind")  An electric generation facility consisting of one or more
wind turbines, with a combined rated capacity equal to or less than 100
kW, the purpose of which is to supply electricity for on-site residential
use. This term shall include all other related accessory structures and
buildings accessory to a primary use located on the same site.
ROTOR  The blades and hub assembly of a wind turbine.
SHADOW FLICKER  The on-and-off flickering effect of a shadow
caused when the sun passes behind the rotor of a wind turbine.
STALL  The increased angle at which the relative wind strikes the
blades of a wind turbine, or the "angle of attack," and reduces the
induced drag associated with lift. Stalling occurs passively by
increasing automatically when the winds speed up, but it increases the
cross section of the blade(s) face-on to the wind, and thus the ordinary
drag. A fully stalled turbine blade, when stopped, has the flat side of the
blade facing directly into the wind.
TURBINE HEIGHT  The vertical distance measured from average
elevation of the existing grade at the proposed tower foundation
perimeter to the highest point of the turbine, including the turbine rotor
blade. In the case of rooftop installations, see § 175-40.7D(4)(g).
VERTICAL AXIS WIND TURBINE (VAWT)  A type of wind turbine
in which the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the wind stream and
the ground. VAWT systems can be mounted on buildings,
§ 175-40.7 PATTON CODE § 175-40.7
169:820
telecommunications towers and poles for the purpose of producing
energy.
WIND ENERGY FACILITY ACCESSORY FACILITIES  All structures
and buildings associated with the conversion of wind to energy with
the exception of the wind turbine. Accessory facilities include but are
not limited to structures, buildings, substations, meteorological towers,
electrical transmission lines and access roads.
WIND TURBINE  A wind energy conversion system that converts
wind energy into electricity through the use of a wind turbine generator
and includes the nacelle, rotor, tower and turbine pad, if any.
YAWING  The misalignment between the wind and turbine pointing
directions. By minimizing the yaw angle, power output is maximized
and nonsymmetrical wind loads are minimized.
D. Residential wind energy facilities (RWEFs). An RWEF is permitted in all
zoning districts as an accessory use. RWEFs must meet the following
standards:

ARTICLE VIIID
Mixed-Use Overlay District
[Added 4-9-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-555]
§ 175-40.8. Intent and area of application.
A. Specific intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, it is the
purpose of this section to:
(1) Permit and encourage a mix of land uses on previously developed
lands and in new construction in the C1 General Commercial
zoning district.
(2) Facilitate the redevelopment of underutilized commercial
properties.
(3) Promote walkable communities with pedestrian-oriented buildings
and connections to nearby destinations.
(4) Provide additional housing opportunities.
(5) Allow growth in places that are most conducive to accommodating
additional development.
B. Applicability. These are optional regulations.
(1) These regulations may be utilized to develop or redevelop property
located within the C-1 General Commercial District of Patton
Township.
(2) Any lands rezoned to C-1 subsequent to the enactment of these
provisions are eligible to develop under these provisions.
(3) Within the Mixed-Use Overlay District, all existing zoning, land use,
and building regulations now in place continue to apply except
where the regulations contained herein conflict with any other
regulation. When such is the case, these regulations are intended
to supersede and apply in order to facilitate development
consistent with the purposes of § 175-40.8A above.
C. Developer Agreement. In addition to any other required guarantees for
the installation of site improvements, a landowner or developer
proposing to develop or redevelop property in accordance with the
Mixed-Use Overlay District provisions shall submit a written statement
declaring their intent to develop under these regulations and to install
all improvements as required herein in addition to any other
requirements of the underlying zoning and all other applicable
regulations. The statement may be included on site development plans
or submitted as a separate document.
D. Definitions. For the purposes of the Mixed-Use Overlay District, the
following definitions shall apply.
§ 175-40.8 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.8
169:837
ADULT USE  Any use involving a transaction for the purchase of
sexually oriented products.
AWNING  A temporary or permanent roof-like projection constructed
of cloth or fiber, wood, metal or other rigid material installed on a
wall above windows or other facade treatment and lending shelter to
pedestrians. The structure may or may not be retractable.
CANOPY  Similar to an awning. A canopy is considered to be an
extension of the architectural character of the building materials and
serving as a roof-like projection from a wall above windows or other
facade treatment and lending shelter to pedestrians.
COLONNADE  Similar to a portico. Consists of a series of columns
forming an entry area to a building and often attached to a roof
structure.
COMMUNITY FACILITIES  On-site amenities provided for the
common enjoyment of residents and pedestrians. Such facilities
include, but may not be limited to, seating areas, landscaping,
architecture, public art, etc.
CORNICE  A horizontal element of a building that projects outward
from the building. Located at the top of the building or at another area
such as the top of a floor. Examples include roof overhangs and eaves.
DEVELOPER AGREEMENT  A written statement provided by an
owner or developer which declares their intent to develop a property in
accordance with the provisions of the Mixed-Use Overlay District.
GROUND FLOOR  The first floor of a structure located above the
surface of the ground.
LIVE/WORK UNIT  A space located within a nonresidential zoning
district where the primary use of the space is nonresidential. The
residential living area is subordinate to the nonresidential use. The use
of space for living purposes shall be limited to 40% of the floor area.
This type of arrangement differs from that of a home occupation where
the dwelling is the primary use.
MIXED-USE  A development incorporating a combination of
nonresidential and residential uses on the same property. A site may
integrate such uses vertically and/or horizontally.
PILASTER  A pier or column type structure attached to the wall of a
building at the ground floor level.
PORTICO  Typically an entrance area to a building constructed of a
series of columns.
PRIMARY FACADE ARTICULATION  Required architectural
treatments to be installed along the portion of the building facade
facing a street. For the purposes of the Mixed-Use Overlay District,
the location of these elements is the interface between the top of the
ground floor and the beginning of the second floor.
§ 175-40.8 PATTON CODE § 175-40.8
169:838
SHARED PARKING, ON-SITE  Parking required to be provided on the
same site as the mixed-use development. The calculation for required
parking is determined by analyzing the different peak parking periods
for each use and establishing the minimum parking based on the
maximum peak.
SHARED PARKING, OFF-SITE  Required parking that is permitted to
be located off premises from the mixed-use development. Parking shall
be determined in accordance with § 153-38, Off-street parking.
SIDE FACADE ARTICULATION  The placement of required
architectural treatments on the sides of mixed-use buildings. These
elements shall be consistent with those used on the primary facade.
TRANSIT REDUCTION  A reduction in the required amount of
parking based on the proximity of a development to public transit. A
common practice meant to encourage the use of public transportation.
E. Use regulations.
(1) Permitted uses. In addition to all currently permitted uses in the C1
District, in the Mixed-Use Overlay District, a parcel or building may
be used for one or more of the following uses permitted by right.
The uses must be combined with an existing use/s or, if new
construction, combined with a use/s permitted in the C1 District
notwithstanding any prohibited mix of uses included herein.
(a) Dwelling units located above the ground floor.
(b) Live/work units located above the ground floor.
(c) Accessory uses as permitted in the C1 district.
(d) Nonresidential uses above the ground floor.
Nonresidential uses are permitted on additional floors in

conditional uses within the Mixed-Use Overlay District. All
procedural requirements for conditional uses outlined within the
Township Code shall be followed.
(a) Live/work units located on the ground floor. Live/work units
are permitted on the ground floor of a mixed-use structure in
accordance with the following conditions:
[1] The portion of the floor area contained within the unit
being utilized as a live/work unit and allocated to living
space shall not exceed 25% of the total floor area of the
live/work unit space.
§ 175-40.8 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.8
169:839
[2] The minimum size of the dwelling space shall meet the
standard established by the Centre Region Building Safety
and Property Maintenance Code.
[3] Parking shall be provided in accordance with § 153-38, Offstreet
parking, and § 175-40.8H herein, and determined
based on the nonresidential use of the space in accordance
with the following:
[a] No additional residential parking shall be required
when all employees reside in the unit (in accordance
with maximum occupancy established by the

(d) Automobile service stations and gasoline stations.
(e) Drive-through facilities.
F. Area and bulk regulations. In order to achieve the purposes of the
Mixed-Use Overlay District, the following area and bulk regulations
shall be in effect.
(1) The following standards are per the underlying C-1 Zoning District,
unless otherwise noted:
(a) Lot width: minimum 150 feet.
§ 175-40.8 PATTON CODE § 175-40.8
169:840
(b) Building coverage (all structures): maximum 30%.
(c) Setback: 70 feet.
[1] As an alternative, the setback may be reduced to no less
than 50 feet upon approval of a site plan which provides a
rear yard of sufficient size so that the sum of the setback
and rear yards is at least 100 feet.
(d) Side yards: 15 feet minimum for each. (As an alternative, the
Patton Township Planning Commission may recommend and
the Patton Township Supervisors may approve the
consolidation of side yards for a property located in a C-1
Commercial District so that one side yard is eliminated but the
resulting side yard must be a minimum of 30 feet. Such a
conditional approval would be based on a certified statement
that abutting property owners will develop abutting properties
simultaneously, using the same style or types of architecture
and the same types of construction materials.) In addition to
the underlying zoning standard, the following shall also apply:
[1] Parking is permitted in the side yard area.
[2] To the extent practicable, parking for residential units
should be located in areas closest to a rear or side
entrance to the unit.
(e) Rear yards: 30 feet; except upon approval of a site plan as
provided in setback section above. Screening shall be provided
at the rear yard, along a ten-foot buffer strip measured from
the rear property line. In addition to the underlying zoning
standard, the following shall also apply:
[1] Parking is permitted in the rear yard area.
(f) Maximum building height: 50 feet.
(g) Maximum impervious coverage: Maximum impervious
coverage shall be increased by 5% from the underlying zoning
to 80% for lot sizes fewer than three acres and 75% for lot sizes
equal to or greater than three acres.
[1] Lots less than or equal to 2.0 acres in size. Where
installed, permeable pavers, porous pavement and/ or
other permeable surface as approved by the Township
Engineer shall be considered as pervious surface in the
calculation for total maximum impervious coverage
permitted herein. Permeable surface shall be considered
to be pervious up to a maximum of 5% of the total lot area
of the lot upon which it is installed, in accordance with the
following:
§ 175-40.8 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.8
169:841
[a] The permeable surface shall be used only for parking
areas containing spaces which are in excess of the
minimum required number of parking spaces. Only
those spaces located farthest away from the main
entrance shall be permitted to be covered with the
permeable surface.
[b] The surface shall have a ten-percent minimum
drainage void area and be designed with open graded
base and subbase material to promote infiltration and
filtration.
[c] For every portion of land area covered by permeable
surface, a backup, overflow system equal to the
permeable portion shall be installed adjacent to the
permeable surface. On uncurbed parking lots, such a
system may consist of a perimeter stone edge drain
with a direct connection to the subsurface storage
area.
[d] Spill controls must be installed in accordance with
standard engineering practice.
[e] In addition to the above, one or more of the
enhancements included on the Planned Commercial
(C-2) District List of Approved Landscaping and
Architectural Enhancements, included as an
attachment to Chapter 175, shall be installed on site.
[f] Signage. Signage shall be installed stating that no
parking or staging of construction vehicles is
permitted in areas covered with permeable paving.
[g] Installation. The permeable surface shall be installed
according to the manufacturer's specifications.
[h] Maintenance and repair. Maintenance and repair of
the permeable surface shall be performed in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual, Chapter 6.
[2] Bonus impervious area. For mixed-use development, an
additional 5% of impervious area shall be permitted when
stormwater best management practices are installed and
maintained in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Management Best Practices Manual and when
at least one of the following is utilized:
[a] Green roof.
[b] Fully subsurface detention or retention of stormwater.
§ 175-40.8 PATTON CODE § 175-40.8
169:842
[c] Other best management practice that substantially
enhances stormwater management as approved by
the Township.
(2) The following standards are not part of the underlying zoning
district:
(a) Windows and doors. In an effort to create a pedestrianoriented
environment in mixed-use settings, a building used for
mixed-use shall incorporate storefront treatments in
accordance with the following:
[1] Transparency. A minimum of 50% of the street facing
ground floor facade shall be comprised of clear glass in
windows and doors.
[2] The areas provided above shall be designed to allow for
pedestrian views to interior displays or other store spaces.
[3] Opaque or reflective glass materials are prohibited.
(b) Maximum residential density. There shall be no maximum on
residential density established herein. Other site limitations
associated with parking requirements, impervious area,
building coverage, etc., will sufficiently govern the achievable
densities.
(c) Mix of uses. The following establishes the limits for different
uses in a mixed-use building. It is the purpose of these limits to
maintain the existing commercial character of the C1 District.
(d) Commercial/office/retail. The amount of ground floor area
devoted to nonresidential uses shall be no less than 75%.
G. Design standards. All design standards not otherwise specified herein
shall be per the underlying zoning district.
(1) Architectural standards. To provide for an aesthetically appealing
distinction between ground floor nonresidential uses and the
residential units above, the following minimum requirements shall
be met:
(a) Use of varying materials, textures or colors consistent with
adjacent structures.
(b) Use of architectural detailing or elements, such as awnings,
windows, colonnades, porches, porticos, columns, pilasters,
cornices, or canopies.
[1] Primary facade articulation. For the purposes of this
district, the primary facade articulation is that which
creates distinct separation between the top of the ground
floor and the beginning of the second floor. All treatments
§ 175-40.8 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-40.8
169:843
designed for these purposes such as awnings, cornices,
canopies, etc. shall be installed accordingly and as
illustrated below.
[2] Side facade articulation. Side facade treatments shall be
similar and consistent with those of the primary facade
and according to the following:
[a] Where the distance between buildings is 20 feet or
greater, full treatments shall be required.
[b] Where the distance between buildings is less than 20
feet but greater than 10 feet, treatments such as
canopies, awnings, and cornices may be replaced with
offsets, bump-outs, recesses and belt courses or
similar architecture with less projection.
[c] Where the distance between buildings is less than 10
feet, additional treatments shall not be required, but
the varying colors and textures should be used.
(c) Varying horizontal elevations, bump outs, and recesses.

Figure 2
H. Off-Street parking requirements.
(1) Shared parking on-site. In determining the amount of parking to be
provided, the following method may be applied. For existing
development, the method is to be used to verify whether or not
§ 175-40.8 PATTON CODE § 175-40.8
169:844
additional parking is required for proposed residential units and/
or any reduction in parking required per § 153-38C(3)(a). Parking
for new mixed-use development shall be in accordance with the
following.
(a) Step 1: Calculate the minimum amount of shared parking
required per § 153-38 for each land use as if it were a separate
use. This is the base parking rate normally required.
(b) Step 2: To determine peak parking requirements for the site,
multiply the minimum parking required for each land use as
determined in Step 1 by the corresponding percentage for
each of the time periods shown in the table below.
(c) Step 3: Calculate the total parking for each of the uses for each
of the time periods.
(d) Step 4: Calculate the total aggregate required parking for each
time period by adding up the parking required for each use in
that time period column.
(e) Step 5: Identify the minimum shared parking requirement as
the column with the highest value.

Weekend 12:00 a.m. to 8:00
a.m. - 130 spaces
Total = 550 spaces Total = 460 spaces (using
peak period of 8:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m. on weekdays)
With on-site shared parking, the development requires only
460 spaces. This equates to the maximum needed for the
highest peak usage during the week and is 90 spaces fewer
than would otherwise be required, more than a 15%
reduction.
(2) Shared parking off-site. Off-site shared parking is permitted in
accordance with § 153-38C(3)(a). This differs from the above-noted
provision in that it pertains to shared parking located on adjacent
properties not held in common ownership.
(3) Transit reduction. Mixed-use development located within 1/4 mile
of a public transit stop may reduce the amount of required parking
by 10%.
(4) Other parking reductions. Other parking reductions as permitted
by § 153-38C(3)(a) remain in effect. In the event of a conflict
between these parking provisions and those of § 153-38, the
regulation that requires fewer parking spaces shall apply.
(5) Bicycle parking. Mixed-use development shall provide on-site
bicycle storage for 2.5% of the total number of required parking
spaces.
I. Bicycle and pedestrian connections.
(1) All mixed-use development shall provide for bicycle trails or lanes
that connect to all appropriate adjacent properties and
neighborhoods as a means of providing linkage between lots.
§ 175-40.8 PATTON CODE § 175-40.8
169:846
Where the bicycle trail can be combined with pedestrian sidewalk
systems, as determined by the municipality, then the combined
pedestrian/ bicycle trail shall meet American Association of State
Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standards.
(2) Sidewalks shall be required as per Chapter 149, Streets and
Sidewalks.
J. Community facilities.
(1) In lieu of public open space and in addition to required bicycle and
pedestrian amenities, mixed-use development shall include a
minimum combination of other amenities as per Table 1.

§ 175-40.9. District regulations.
A. Intent. In addition to the general goals listed in § 175-2, General intent,
these regulations may be utilized to develop or redevelop properties in
the C-2 (Planned Commercial) Zoning District and are intended to:
(1) Permit and encourage a diverse mix of land uses on properties
located near existing commercial and residential areas.
(2) Facilitate the redevelopment of underutilized commercial
properties and allow growth in places that are most conducive to
accommodating additional development.
(3) Provide opportunities for small-scale or locally owned businesses.
(4) Promote aesthetically pleasing developments with consistent
architectural themes.
(5) Promote communities with bicycle- and pedestrian-oriented
buildings and facilities, and connections to and from surrounding
properties.
(6) Promote communities with access to public transit.
(7) Encourage shared parking facilities to reduce impervious cover
and encourage effective management of stormwater runoff.
(8) Provide workforce and/or affordable housing opportunities
consistent with the goals and objectives of the Centre Region
Comprehensive Plan.
(9) Provide public gathering places for community events or public
celebrations.
B. Applicability. These are optional regulations.
(1) These overlay zoning district regulations, entitled Mixed-Use
Overlay District 2 (MXD2), may be applied only within the C-2
Zoning District of Patton Township.
(2) All existing zoning, land use, and building regulations of the Code
of Patton Township now in place continue to apply except where the

plan (LDP) that includes the building(s) that constitute more
than 40% of the entire floor area included on the master plan,
provided that at least 20% of the floor area included on the
master plan has been completed and is occupied. If the initial
LDP includes 40% or more of the entire floor area included on
the master plan or less than 20% of the floor area is occupied,
§ 175-40.9 PATTON CODE § 175-40.9
169:864
the first study shall be submitted when the first of the below
thresholds are met.
(b) Studies shall also be submitted with LDPs that meet the sixtypercent
and eighty-percent floor area thresholds, provided that
at least 30% or 40%, respectively, of the floor area included on
the master plan has been completed and is occupied.
(c) Should a parking study indicate that the required parking
ratios and time-based utilization rates for the uses included on
the approved master plan will not provide sufficient parking for
the future phases of the MXD2 site, the developer shall submit
a revised/amended master plan to provide additional parking
spaces or reduce the proposed total building floor area to align
with the available parking proposed.
(d) Should a parking study indicate that the required parking
ratios and time-based utilization rates for the uses included on
the approved master plan have overestimated the parking
needs for the future phases of the MXD2 site, the developer
may submit a revised/amended master plan to align the
required number of parking spaces with the proposed total
building floor area and mix of uses.
H. Off-street loading regulations. All loading areas shall be in accordance
with § 175-47, Loading regulations, unless specified herein.

H. Change of an approved site plan. An applicant who proposes to change
an approved site plan may do so only under the following conditions and
procedures: [Amended 4-23-1997 by Ord. No. 97-340]
(1) Substantial change. If the building is to be enlarged more than 30%
of the original gross floor area or curb cuts are to be increased, the
applicant must reapply to the Planning Commission for approval.
Also, if the applicant wishes to rearrange parking, landscaping,
drainage, lighting, etc., so that the revised plan substantially
changes the original site plan, the applicant must reapply.
(2) Minor change. If the applicant wishes to rearrange the off-street
parking, change the landscape schedule, lighting, drainage, fences
or move the buildings in a manner in which the revised site plan
does not substantially change the original plan, the applicant can
do so upon the approval of Township Zoning Officer and the revised
site plan shall be filed with the Township Planning Commission and
Board of Supervisors.
I. Conduction of business on approved site plan lot without meeting site
plan conditions. On a parcel of land having an approved site plan, the
initiation of any activity or use shall not take place before all of the
conditions of the site plan and other provisions of this chapter have
been satisfied. Such conduct of an activity or use without compliance
with site plan conditions and/or this chapter provision shall be
considered a violation of this chapter, except in cases where weather or

telecommunication towers, buildings and structures.
§ 175-48 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-48.1
169:887
(3) To ensure that new towers will be safe, placed in suitable locations
and blend into the environment where located.
B. Review and permitting.
(1) All applications for the location, subdivision, lease and licensing of
sites for all new telecommunications facility buildings and towers
are subject to the requirements of the Township's Subdivision and
Land Development215 and Zoning Ordinances and are subject to
review by the Planning Commission and approval by the Board of
Supervisors.
(2) Telecommunications facilities that cease to operate for 12
consecutive months shall be determined to have terminated
operation and must be removed within 90 days at the expense of
the facility and/or property owners.

meet the following requirements unless specifically indicated.
C. Location, area and bulk requirements.
(1) Telecommunications towers are permitted in the following zoning
districts:
(a) NR-1 (Natural Resource District).
(b) A-1 (Rural District) [tower location permitted only above 1,400
feet; see Subsection C(2)]. [Amended 5-28-2008 by Ord. No.
2008-496]
(c) C-1 and C-2 (Commercial Districts).

feet, measured from the average natural grade of the approved
facility area to the top point of the tower or antenna, whichever is
greater, except for locations above elevation 1,400 feet as shown on
United States Geological Survey Topographic Quadrangle
mapping, in which case the following shall apply: the maximum
height shall be 50 feet and a whip antenna shall be permitted to
extend a maximum of 15 feet above the structure to a total
maximum height of 65 feet, and the tower and/or antenna must be
of a concealed, camouflaged or stealth design that blends into the
natural environment so as not to be seen or recognized. This
215. Editor's Note: See Ch. 153, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 175-48.1 PATTON CODE § 175-48.1
169:888
includes tree poles or architecturally screened antenna that can be
attached to existing structures other than towers.
(3) The minimum setback of telecommunications towers shall be as
required in the applicable zoning district, except for the following:
No telecommunications tower shall be located closer than 200 feet
or 110% of the proposed telecommunications tower height,
whichever is greater, from any existing residence or residential lot
line regardless of the zoning district in which the tower and
associated buildings are located.
(4) Minimum lease area and/or license area size of telecommunications
facilities. No minimum lease area and/or license area size is
required for a telecommunications facility; however, as required in
the applicable zoning district and Subsection C(3) above, the
setbacks of the parent tract perimeter boundaries shall apply.
(5) Evidence of need for towers.
(a) It is required that the applicant for the placement of a
telecommunications tower shall submit to the Township
evidence of the need for the telecommunications tower in the
proposed location and that the applicant has exhausted all
alternatives to locate on an existing tower or structure.
(b) In addition, the applicant must demonstrate via written
evidence from a qualified, licensed and professional engineer
that, in terms of location and construction, there are not
existing towers, telecommunications towers, buildings,
structures, elevated tanks or similar uses able to provide the
platform for the telecommunications antenna within a one-mile
radius of the chosen location. Collocation is not possible if:
[1] Coverage diagrams and technical reports demonstrate
that collocation on existing telecommunications towers is
not technically possible in order to serve the need; and
planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity
of existing telecommunications towers within the
municipality, considering existing and planned use of those
telecommunications towers, and existing
telecommunications towers cannot be reinforced to
accommodate planned or equivalent equipment at a
reasonable cost;
[2] Planned equipment will cause radio frequency (RF)
interference with other existing or planned equipment for
that telecommunications tower, and the interference
cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost;
[3] Existing or approved telecommunications towers do not
have the space on which planned equipment can be placed
§ 175-48.1 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-48.1
169:889
so it can function effectively and at least in parity with
other similar equipment in place or planned; or
[4] Other reasons make it impractical to place the equipment
planned by the applicant on existing and approved
telecommunications towers.
(6) Telecommunications antennas (shared use). Telecommunications
antennas may be attached to any building or structure in all zoning
districts, including but not limited to a church, a municipal or
governmental building or facility, an agricultural building, a
building owned by a utility, telecommunications tower, water tank
and major electrical transmission lines, pursuant to the following:
(a) Antennas shall not be permitted on single-family homes,
townhomes and duplexes.
(b) Building and zoning permits shall be required.
(c) Antennas shall be no taller than 15 feet above the existing
structure.

structurally, electrically and in all respects, to accommodate both
the applicant's antennas and comparable antennas for at least two
additional users if the tower is over 100 feet in height or for at least
one additional user if the tower is over 60 feet in height. Towers
must be designed to allow for future rearrangement of antennas
upon the tower and to accept antennas mounted at varying heights.
(2) The telecommunications tower shall be designed and constructed
to all applicable standards of the American National Standards
Institute, ANSI/EIA-222-F Manual, as amended.
(3) A soil report complying with the standards of Appendix 1,

(6) The applicant shall present documentation that the
telecommunications tower is designed in accordance with all
applicable state and federal regulations.
(7) Guy wires, if utilized, must be anchored no closer than 25 feet from
any property line. Guy wires shall not cross or encroach on any
utility rights-of-way and shall not cross property lines.
(8) The applicant shall provide, upon request, a statement from a
qualified, licensed professional engineer that the NIER
(Nonionizing Electromagnetic Radiation) emitted from the
telecommunications tower, when measured in conjunction with the
emissions from all communication facilities on the tower, does not
result in an exposure at any point on or outside such facility which
exceeds the lowest applicable exposure standards established by
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI).
(9) Except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration, no
telecommunications tower may use artificial lighting or strobe
lighting at night.
(10) Upon request, the applicant shall provide to the municipality, not
more than once per year, information indicating that the approved
telecommunications tower or antenna remains structurally sound.
The applicant shall bear the costs of any inspection necessary to
determine the structural soundness of a telecommunication tower
or antenna.
(11) All federal, state and municipal environmental regulations
regarding the placement of telecommunications facilities must be
followed in the design, review and construction processes.
(12) Telecommunications facilities shall be fully automated and

fifteen-foot minimum landscaping requirement if a
telecommunications facility is located within a COD.
(b) Landscaping, consisting of sight obscuring trees and shrubs in
accordance with the buffer yard regulations (Class V, Tables
3-5), shall be required at the perimeter of the security fences
and the telecommunications facility. Existing wooded areas,
tree lines and hedgerows adjacent to the facility shall be
preserved and used to substitute or meet a portion of the
buffer yard requirements.
F. Access and parking.
(1) The applicant must demonstrate on the land development plan that
parked vehicles at the facility will not impede traffic on the
adjoining cartways.
(2) Internal access to the telecommunications tower shall be provided
by a minimum twelve-foot-wide cartway with a concrete or

NOTES:
1. The maximum permitted illumination is measured in footcandles
at the property lines at ground level. Lighting levels must be
measured in footcandles with a directreading, portable light
meter.
2. The maintained average illumination is calculated in footcandles
on the pavement areas of the site. In no case shall the level of
illumination be less than 0.2 footcandles in parking and pedestrian
areas. Additional illumination may be needed where pedestrian
security and site entrance identity issues arise. The "utilization
curve" as identified in the IES (Illuminating Engineering Society)
Lighting Handbook, Application Volume, as revised, shall
determine the maintained average illumination.
3. All luminaires utilized by commercial, industrial and
nonresidential uses shall be designed to have total cutoff of light
at an angle less than 90° and located so that the bare lightbulb,
lamp or light source is completely shielded from the direct view of
an observer at ground level at the property line.
4. (Reserved) [Amended 4-27-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-456]
5. Safety or security lighting may be mounted on a home up to the
height of any exterior wall. Such lighting shall be directed to serve
the property and shall have as little spill-over as possible.
6. Lights illuminating balconies of multistory apartments shall not be
included in the twelve-foot-height limitation.
C. Illumination requirements.
(1) Wall-mounted luminaires intended for parking lot illumination on
commercial, industrial, nonresidential and multifamily residential
buildings and structures shall have fixtures that cut off direct light
from view. All parking lot and site perimeter lighting must be
located on poles or at ground level and must be directed toward the
§ 175-48.2 PATTON CODE § 175-48.2
169:894
property interior. All luminaires designed for entryways and
decorative purposes on nonresidential and multifamily residential
buildings and structures which exceed 2,000 lumens (150 watts
incandescent) shall have fixtures that cut off direct light from view.
(2) All outdoor lighting shall be reduced by 75% or deactivated by
timers and sensors during nonoperating hours for nonresidential
uses. Illuminated signs are included in this requirement.
(3) (Reserved) [Amended 4-27-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-456]
(4) All nonresidential site light sources, and residential light sources
higher than 12 feet, must be directed away from public streets and
private properties. The lamps must be shielded in a manner so that
they are not visible from an adjoining property. Sensor controlled
lamps exceeding 2,000 lumens (150 watts incandescent) must have
cutoff-type luminaires.
(5) In parking lots, luminaires shall be located on mast arms, where
necessary, such that trees do not interfere with the required
lighting.
(6) As part of any land development plan submittal, an exterior lighting
plan must be provided to Patton Township. The plan must provide a
detail of all fixtures proposed, and a plan view must be provided
showing number and location of the fixtures along with the
intensity, lighting patterns and type of illumination.
(7) Luminaires mounted beneath canopies such as those at gasoline
stations and convenience stores shall be recessed so that the lens
cover is recessed or flush with the bottom surface (ceiling) of the
canopy and/or shielded by the fixture or the edge of the canopy so
that light is cut off at less than 90 degrees. Luminaires shall not be
mounted on the top or sides (fascias) of the canopy, and the sides
(fascias) of the canopy shall not be illuminated.
(8) Parking lot lighting designs may include luminaires of a particular
"period" or architectural style as an alternative or supplement to
the cutoff luminaires, provided that:
(a) If the fixtures are not cutoff luminaires, the maximum output
shall not be more than 2,000 lumens (150 watts incandescent);
(b) Maximum luminaire mounting height shall not exceed 15 feet;
(c) Parking area lighting shall be in accordance with Table 1.
(9) Federal and state required security lighting specifically for air
travel safety shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.
This lighting includes, but is not limited to, airport runway lights
and warning lights.
§ 175-48.2 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-48.2
169:895
(10) Streetlights shall be exempt from the provisions of this section
except that federal interstate, state and Township roadways within
the Township shall have a maximum shielded luminaire height of 25
feet or, if a plan for full cutoff fixtures and supplemental shielding
to protect neighboring properties from glare is presented to and
approved by the Township, a maximum luminaire height of 40 feet.
[Amended 6-16-1999 by Ord. No. 99-367]
(11) Temporary holiday and special event lighting is permitted and shall
be placed to prevent glare.
(12) Flood- and/or spotlights shall be directed away from adjoining
properties and roadways and shall be completely shielded to
prevent glare.
(13) Existing lighting (prior to the adoption of this regulation) that
produces glare to pedestrians or vehicles shall be shielded and/or
redirected to eliminate the hazard. When existing light fixtures are
replaced, the new fixtures and luminaires shall meet the
requirements of this regulation.
(14) Luminaires shall not be permitted which shine light into the night
sky except as noted in (a) and (b) below. Luminaires utilized to
uplight building facades shall be completely shielded and/or aimed
so that no light is directed to the night sky. [Amended 5-22-2002
by Ord. No. 2002-400]
(a) Flood and/or spot lights utilized to uplight landscaping shall
have luminaires with a maximum output of no more than 2,000
lumens (150 watts incandescent). The luminaires shall be
located or shielded so that the light source is not visible by an
observer standing at ground level at the property line.
(b) Flagpoles displaying the flag of the United States of America
may utilize uplighting in all districts with the following
limitations:
[1] No more than one uplit flag display is permitted on a lot.
[2] No more than two luminaires may be installed. The
combined maximum output of the luminaires shall not
exceed 9,500 lumens. The combined maximum output
shall be computed by adding the manufacturers initial
lumen rating for each lamp.
[3] Luminaires shall be selected that concentrate and direct
the light to illuminate the area where the flag will be
displayed. Wide-angle floodlights shall not be used.
[4] The luminaire(s) shall be located or shielded so that the
light source is not visible by an observer standing at
ground level at the property line.
§ 175-48.2 PATTON CODE § 175-48.2
169:896
D. Recreational sports facilities lighting. Recreational sports facilities are
areas designed for active recreation, whether publicly or privately
owned, including but not limited to: baseball diamonds, soccer and
football fields, basketball courts, golf courses, tennis courts, swimming
pools, and any other outdoor area where the primary use is the pursuit
of an athletic activity. [Added 4-27-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-456]
(1) Minimum lot size for recreational sports facilities lighting: two
acres.
(2) Illumination of the activity area. To provide sufficient illumination
to safely conduct recreational activities, lighting designs should
meet the sports lighting illumination recommendations of
publication IESNA RP-6-01, "Recommended Practice for Sports and
Recreational Area Lighting," from the Illuminating Engineering
Society of North America (IESNA).
(3) Luminaire height. The height of luminaries shall, to the extent
practicable, be the minimum necessary to provide the illumination
levels recommended by IESNA RP-6-01 as well as to ensure
meeting the shielding and spill light requirements of this section.
(4) Shielding of luminaries. Recreational sports facilities have unique
lighting needs that vary on the nature of the activity and the size of
the facility. Because of their uniqueness, the actual playing area
cannot always be illuminated appropriately with cutoff luminaries.
Accordingly, semicutoff luminaries such as floodlights and other
applications are permitted to meet the lighting design objectives
for recreational sports facilities, provided such luminaries meet the
following criteria:
(a) Luminaires shall be full cutoff as defined by IESNA; or
(b) Luminaires shall be:
[1] Provided with internal and/or external glare-control
louvers, visors, barndoors or other shielding.
[2] Installed in a manner consistent to minimize uplight and
off-site lighting.
[3] Aimed at an angle such that the luminaire meets the
definition for semicutoff fixture (no more than 5% of the
emitted light projects above the horizontal) as defined by
the IESNA.
[4] Aimed, to the extent practicable, to restrict illumination to
the functional area being illuminated for sports or
recreation.
(c) Only full cutoff luminaries conforming to the other outdoor
lighting regulations shall be used to illuminate areas beyond
the active sport area.
§ 175-48.2 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-48.2
169:897
(5) Curfew. A nightly deadline for extinguishing the recreational sports
facility lighting shall be included on the land development plan.
With the approval of the Board of Supervisors, a process for
requesting an extension of the deadline for special events (e.g.,
tournaments) may also be included on the land development plan.
(6) Maximum illumination at property lines. The maximum illumination
levels permitted at the property line(s) produced by the sum of all
outdoor lighting installations on said property shall be measured at
grade in horizontal footcandles (FC) and shall not exceed the
requirements of Table 2 (below).

Table 2 Notes:
1. The maximum illumination permitted at the property line can
be increased to 0.5 FC adjacent to existing residential uses
within the RGB and 1.0 FC adjacent to other uses within the
RGB when the site developer provides proof that property
owners and residents within 200 feet of the property line
location(s) where the increased light trespass is proposed
have been notified of the time and place of public meetings at
which the illumination plan will be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors. Proof of notice shall
be in the form of signature for delivery of notice or a signed
statement from property owners and residents or similar
document. If warranted, the Board of Supervisors may require
additional screening at the property line in the form of fencing
or buffer yard plantings to mitigate the additional light
trespass.
2. "Existing residential use" shall mean parcels with dwelling
units upon them, or parcels with residential zoning permits,
land development plans, or subdivision plans that have been
approved within five years, or parcels with plans for
residential development that are under review by the
Township and were submitted prior to the land development
plan for sports facility lighting.

ARTICLE X
Nonconforming Uses, Premises, Structures and Lots
§ 175-49. Intent.
§ 175-50. Nonconforming use regulations.
Lawful uses, located either within a building or other structure, or part
thereof or on the land or in combination of both, which at the effective date
of this chapter or subsequent amendment thereto became nonconforming,
may be continued so long as they remain otherwise lawful, including
subsequent sales of the property, subject to the following regulations:
A. The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to guide
the future use of land in the Township by encouraging the development
of desirable residential, commercial and manufacturing areas, with
appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses, to the end of
promoting and protecting the public health, safety, comfort, prosperity
and other aspects of the general welfare.
B. To achieve this end, lawful existing uses which would be prohibited or
restricted under the terms of this chapter, or future amendments, and
which do not conform to the character and regulations of the zoning
district in which they are located must be subject to certain limitations.
The regulations set forth below are intended to provide a gradual
remedy for the undesirable conditions resulting from indiscriminate
mixing of uses and to afford a means whereby nonconforming uses can
be gradually eliminated and reestablished in more suitable locations
within the Township.
C. Similarly, buildings or other structures which do not comply with one or
more of the applicable district requirements as to lot width, minimum
lot area and yard spaces, width of lot, coverages or height are deemed
to be nonconforming.
D. Nonconforming uses and structures will be generally permitted to
remain; the purpose of regulating them is to restrict further investment
in uses or structures which are inappropriate to their locations.
E. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in plans, construction or intended use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date or amendment of this chapter and on which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on.
A. Enlargement. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
increased upon ground not occupied at the time of the passage of the
Zoning Ordinance nor upon that portion of said ground not devoted to
the nonconforming use.
B. Damage or destruction.
§ 175-49 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-50
169:901
§ 175-51. Nonconforming lots of record.
Nonconforming lot regulations shall be as follows: In any district, in which
single-family houses are permitted, notwithstanding the area limitation
imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a single-family house and
customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record
in existence at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter,
provided that the following requirements shall be observed.
(1) In the event that a manufacturing nonconforming use, in a
residential district, is destroyed or partially destroyed by fire,
explosion or other disasters or otherwise damaged to the extent of
75% or more of the assessed valuation of all buildings, structures
and other improvements on the lot, as determined from the
assessment rolls effective at the date of the damage or destruction,
such nonconforming uses shall terminate and the lot shall
thereafter be used only for conforming uses.
(2) In the event that any nonconforming use, in any district, is
destroyed or partially destroyed by fire, explosion or other disaster
or otherwise damaged to the extent of 75% or more of the assessed
valuation (as defined above), such nonconforming use shall
terminate and the lot shall thereafter be used only for conforming
uses.
C. Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use of land ceases operations for a
period of more than one year after which the owner of such property
does not file a certification of intention to maintain such use, then this
shall be deemed to be an intent to abandon such use and any
subsequent use of the land shall conform to the regulations of this
chapter.
A. Such lot must be in separate ownership, and not form part of a
continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
B. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet
requirements of area or width, or both, generally applicable in the
district in which the lot is located and a variance shall be issued by the
Zoning Hearing Board except as follows:
(1) No application for a variance shall be accepted if the side, front or
rear yards or the width or area of the lot in question is less than
50% of the required minimum for the district in which it is located.
(2) If two or more lots with continuous frontage in a single ownership
are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this chapter,
and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot
width and area established by this chapter, the lands involved shall
be considered an undivided parcel and no portion of such parcel
shall be occupied or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this chapter.216

information that may be required by the Zoning Officer or other
sections of this chapter. Where it is proposed to establish on-site
sewage disposal and/or water, a feasibility report by an independent
registered engineer shall be required.
F. A permit shall also be required before any proposed construction,
alteration or other development is undertaken within the Flood District.
Prior to the issuance of a zoning permit in the Flood District, the Zoning
Officer shall review the application to determine if all other necessary
governmental permits such as those required by state and federal laws
have been obtained including those required by Act 537, the
Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act,217 and the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. 1334. No

findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to them
not later than the day following its date. To all other persons who have

J. Applications for variances and special exceptions to Chapter 140
(Signs) of the Patton Township Code. [Added 10-24-2001 by Ord. No.
2001-395]
A. No issue of alleged defect in the process of enactment of any ordinance
or map or any amendment thereto shall be raised in any proceeding
filed with the Board later than 30 days from the time such ordinance,
map or amendment takes effect unless the person raising such issues
alleges and proves that they failed to receive adequate notice of the
enactment or amendment. If such person has succeeded to their
interest after the enactment of the ordinances, adequate notice to their
predecessor shall be deemed adequate notice to them.
B. Under the same conditions, limitations and exceptions as prescribed in
§ 175-67A, no person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the
Board later than 30 days after any application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate Township
officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to limit the
approval in any manner.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Section 913.3 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code219 and during its pendency
before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or
body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed unless the
Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the
Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life
or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by
the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on
219. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10913.3.
§ 175-65 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-68

§ 175-69. Special exceptions and variances in the Flood District.
[Amended 9-12-1978 by Ord. No. 154]
petition, after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency
or body. When an application for development, preliminary or final, has
been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant,
the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing
the proceedings before the board.
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
consideration of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by them if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney
fees incurred by the petitioner.
A. Application requirements.
(1) A plan which accurately delineates the area which is subject to
flooding, the location of the proposed construction, the location of
any other flood-prone development or structures and the location
of any existing or proposed stream improvements or protective
works. Included shall be all plans for proposed subdivision and land
development in order to assure that:
(a) All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize
flood damage.
(b) All utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems are located, elevated and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(c) Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
§ 175-68 PATTON CODE § 175-69
169:914

of the ground (in relation to National Geodetic Vertical Datum) and
the lowest floor (including basement) of the proposed construction,
base flood elevations (highest flood elevation of record) and other
associated factors such as pressures and impact forces, etc.,
storage elevations, size of the structure streets, water supply,
sanitary facilities, soil types and floodproofing measures, including
the specific reference to the level of the floodproofing in relation to
the base flood elevation.
(3) A document, certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, which states that the proposed construction has been
adequately designed to withstand the flood depths, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplift forces and other hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic and buoyancy factors associated with the base flood.
Such statement shall include a description of the type and extent of
floodproofing measures which have been incorporated into the
design of the structure.
B. Criteria.
(1) All new structures and structures which are modified, improved,
altered or reconstructed to an extent which equals or exceeds 50%
of the structure shall meet the following criteria.
(a) They shall be firmly anchored in accordance with engineering
practices to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
Manufactured homes shall be anchored as follows: [Amended
10-25-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-379]
[1] Over-the-top ties shall be provided at each of the four
corners of the manufactured home with two additional ties
per side at intermediate locations for units 50 feet or more

carrying a force of 4,800 pounds.
(b) They shall be constructed so as to prevent the entrance of
floodwaters into the water supply and waste treatment systems
as well as other utility and facility systems. In addition, waste
treatment systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
§ 175-69 VEHICLES, RECREATIONAL § 175-69
169:915
§ 175-70. Procedures. [Amended 7-10-1985 by Ord. No. 85-204]

of water and with structural components having the
compatibility of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and effects of buoyancy.
(2) Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, repair or improvement
of any kind to an existing structure, to an extent or amount of less
than 50% of its market value, shall require that the structure be
elevated and/or floodproofed as specified above to the greatest
extent possible.
A. In reviewing any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider, at a minimum, that the granting of a variance will not:
(1) Result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights,
additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense.
