serviced by TCI of Pennsylvania and sets forth the following procedures:

as its cable television operator may enter into an agreement with
SHACOG to jointly review and decide on cable television rates as
permitted by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 (the "Cable Act"), and the Rate Regulation
Standards of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") in
Subpart (N)  Cable Rate Regulation, 47 CFR 76.900 et seq., as may
be amended.
(b) The signing of an agreement to participate in the Joint Rate Review
Program will be binding on that member municipality for the duration
of that calendar year. The agreement will automatically renew unless
the Executive Director of SHACOG receives written notice of
withdrawal at least 90 days before the end of the preceding calendar
year.
Section 2
(a) The SHACOG Rate Review Board Administrative Committee is hereby
established (hereinafter referred to as the Rate Review Committee).
The Committee shall consist of the Manager or Secretary or a
designated substitute from each participating municipality. The
SHACOG Executive Director shall be ex officio the Secretary for this
Committee.
(b) The Rate Review Committee shall meet and review rate information
filed with the participating member municipalities within 10 days
of notification that rate review information has been submitted to
a member municipality. The representatives of those participating
municipalities present shall decide what investigation, if any, will be
undertaken to determine if the rate request is appropriate and lawful.
A quorum of the Rate Review Committee will consist of a
representative from 1/2 of the participating municipalities.
(c) A majority vote of the members then present and voting shall be
binding on all municipalities participating in the program. The Rate
Review Committee may extend the time within which to decide on the
extent of investigation, provided that the total time expended permits
the hearing provided for in Section 3 to be conducted within the time
parameters permitted by the FCC regulations.
(d) If a majority of the Rate Review Committee members present
determine that the thirty-day period is insufficient to review the filing,
they may recommend that participating municipalities act to extend
the period established for the review as permitted by the Cable Act
and the FCC's regulations to prevent the proposed rates from
becoming effective by operation of law.
(e) The Rate Review Committee may waive the requirements of the public
hearing provided for by Section 3 for promotional rate reductions.

Section 3
(a) The SHACOG Joint Rate Review Board is hereby established with
authority to determine whether a rate request received by any
participating member municipality is appropriate and lawful. The
SHACOG Executive Director shall be ex officio the Secretary of the
Board.
(b) The Review Board small be composed of one representative and one
alternate appointed by each participating member municipality,
although each municipality will only have one vote in deciding whether
the rate request is permissible. Each municipality will determine who
its representatives will be on the Review Board, and said
representatives need not be a presently elected official or a member of
the municipality's professional staff. In the event that an even number
of municipalities participate, then the Executive Director of SHACOG,
or his designate, shall sit on the Review Board to vote in the event of
a tie. A quorum of the Review Board will consist of a representative
from 1/2 of the participating municipalities.
(c) The Review Board will schedule and conduct a public hearing for the
receipt of oral comments and will receive written comments from the
public and the cable operator on the reasonableness of the rates. The
Executive Director of SHACOG shall give public notice of the hearing
and notice of the hearing to the participating municipalities and to the
cable operator.
(d) The public hearing for oral comments shall normally be held and the
close of the period for written comments shall be scheduled within
30 days of receipt of the rate filing unless extended by the Rate
Review Committee. If the Rate Review Committee extends the period
for the review of a rate filing, the period for written comments and the
public hearing may be scheduled by the Board later than the thirty-day
period commencing upon receipt of the rate filing, provided that such
a period and hearing shall be held at such time that the comments
received will be available for the Board's consideration in making the
evaluation. The close of the comment period and the hearing for the
initial rate filing of a cable operator that is providing service upon
the effective date of the participating member municipality's ability to
review rates as permitted by the FCC shall not be scheduled more than
120 days from the effective date of the participating member's ability
to review rates.
(e) The Review Board shall review the rate filing and the comments
received and make a determination as to the reasonableness of the
rate filing. The Board shall present its evaluation within 30 days of
receipt of the rate filing unless the time period is extended as provided
in Section 2(c).

Borough of Baldwin shall constitute and be the forum for the hearing
and determination of Heart and Lung Act benefits under the provisions

amended, 53 P.S. § 637, and all claims authorized under the provisions
of the Act shall be administered and determined by the Council of the
Borough of Baldwin, except that, in the event that a determination shall
be made by the Council of the Borough of Baldwin that a police officer
should be terminated or dismissed because of his inability to perform
his duties in accordance with the civil service provisions of the Borough
Code,16 and such officer has appealed the termination to the Civil
Service Commission and such officer has made claims under the Heart
and Lung Act because of his disability, then the Civil Service
Commission of the Borough shall be authorized and empowered to hear
such Heart and Lung Act claim, but only in that case. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed so as to authorize or impose any
responsibility for the determination or administration of workers'
compensation claims upon the Council.
B. For the purposes of the administration of this section, a quorum of the
Council of the Borough of Baldwin shall be considered a sufficient
forum for the determination of whether or not benefits should be
payable under the Heart and Lung Act, and the vote of the majority of
the quorum present shall be sufficient to render a decision. A
stenographic record of the proceedings shall be kept at the expense of
the Borough, which record is to be sealed and shall not be released to
any member of the public or to any persons other than the
Councilpersons of the Borough of Baldwin, the Secretary of the
Borough, the Solicitor of the Borough, or such persons acting in the
capacities of Borough Secretary or Solicitor, unless the police officer
shall, in writing, authorize the release of such transcript to any other
persons; provided further, however, that nothing contained herein shall
restrict the right of the Borough to use such records in any court
proceedings and appeals, or to provide them to the workers'

compensation benefits to employees of the Borough.
C. The hearing regarding any claim by a police officer under the Heart and
Lung Act shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Local Agency
Law, the Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53, as amended,17 and all
provisions stated therein shall be observed, unless the same shall be in
direct conflict with the provisions of this section insofar as the same
relates to the confidentiality of the stenographic record. Following the
hearing, the Council shall make its decision in writing, which shall
briefly describe its reasons for the adjudication, its findings of fact and
conclusions of law. The decision shall be rendered no later than 90 days
from the date of the hearing and shall be forwarded by first-class mail
to the police officer making any such claims. Prior to any such hearing,
and upon the presentation of a claim or demand by a police officer, such
police officer shall submit in writing a concise statement of all facts or
circumstances which the police officer deems to be relevant to his or
her claim, and shall submit any medical documentation of any
physicians attending such police officer which shall detail the nature of
the injury and whether or not the same is causally connected to the
claimed disability of the police officer, and shall specifically indicate
that the disability is job related or was incurred while on duty. To the
extent that the disabilities of any police officers have been the basis of a
claim for workers' compensation benefits, the standards of proof
requiring causal connection between the employment and the injury
which have been developed through workers' compensation cases shall
apply to the Heart and Lung Act cases where the issue of whether
disability is work related is involved. The Borough may seek further
evidence of the claimant's disability and may require the claimant to
appear before a physician of the Borough's choice for examination. The
failure or refusal of the police officer or claimant to submit such
documentation or yield to such examinations in a timely manner shall
be the basis for dismissal of all such claims. Witnesses may be
subpoenaed pursuant to the subpoena power contained in the Borough
Code.
D. This section shall take effect immediately; further, any cases decided
prior to the enactment of this section and pursuant to and in reliance
upon the determination of the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania in
the case of Sidlow v. Township of Nether Providence, 621 A.2nd 1105
(1993), shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of this
section pending its adoption by the Borough Council.
E. Any provisions of this section which shall be declared unconstitutional
shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the section,
and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect
unless amended or repealed by the Council of the Borough of Baldwin.

Administrator shall give notice of such alleged violation as hereinafter
provided. Such notice shall:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
(3) Allow a reasonable time not to exceed a period of 30 days for the
performance of any act it requires;
(4) Be served upon the property owner or his agent as the case may

§ 92-17. Appeals.
when a copy thereof has been served with such notice by any other
method authorized or required by the laws of this state;
(5) Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will effect
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.

Borough of Baldwin of not less than $25 nor more than $600 plus costs
of prosecution. In addition to the above penalties all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or noncompliance with this chapter shall not excuse the
violation or noncompliance or permit it to continue. All such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations and
noncompliance within a reasonable time. Any development initiated or
any structure or building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered,
or relocated, in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by

Administrator concerning the administration of the provisions of this
chapter may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. Such appeal must be
filed, in writing, within 30 days after the decision, determination or
action of the Floodplain Administrator.
B. Upon receipt of such appeal the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider
the appeal in accordance with the Municipal Planning Code and any
other local ordinance.

and amendments are hereby adopted by Borough of Baldwin and
declared to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood

FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
D. In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only
by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who

regulations. It will always include the area identified as the special flood
hazard area on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Insurance Study,
but may include additional areas identified by the community. See §§ 92-18
and 92-19 for the specifics on what areas the community has included in the
identified floodplain area.
LOWEST FLOOR  The lowest floor of the lowest fully enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished, flood resistant partially enclosed area,
used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, and incidental storage,
in an area other than a basement area is not considered the lowest floor of
a building, provided that such space is not designed and built so that the
structure is in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements
of this chapter.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis, and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required

materials for the purpose of its routine maintenance and upkeep, but not
including the cutting away of any wall, partition or portion thereof, the
removal or cutting of any structural beam or bearing support, or the
removal or change of any required means of egress, or rearrangement of
parts of a structure affecting the exitway requirements; nor shall minor
repairs include addition to, alteration of, replacement or relocation of any
standpipe, water supply, sewer, drainage, drain leader, gas, oil, waste, vent,
or similar piping, electric wiring, mechanical or other work affecting public
health or general safety.
NEW CONSTRUCTION  Structures for which the start of construction
commenced on or after September 26, 2014 and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. Any construction started after August 15,
1978 and before September 26, 2014 is subject to the ordinance in effect
at the time the permit was issued, provided the start of construction was
within 180 days of permit issuance.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION  A manufactured
home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads)
is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management
regulations adopted by a community.

with the regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program.
PRE-FIRM STRUCTURE  A structure for which construction or substantial
improvement occurred on or before December 31, 1974 or before the
community's initial Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) dated August 15,
1978, whichever is later, and, as such, would not be required to be
compliant with the regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program.
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE  A vehicle which is:
REGULATORY FLOOD ELEVATION  The base flood elevation (BFE) or
estimated flood height as determined using simplified methods plus a
freeboard safety factor of 1 1/2 feet.
REPETITIVE LOSS  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on
two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on average, equals or exceeds
25% of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred.
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA)  An area in the floodplain
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown
on the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH.
START OF CONSTRUCTION  Includes substantial improvement and other
proposed new development and means the date the permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,

after the date of issuance of the permit unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the Floodplain Administrator. The actual start means either
the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such
as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement
of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and walkways; nor does it include
A. Built on a single chassis;
Not more than 400 square feet, measured at the largest horizontal
projections;

of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property
of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the
actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling,
floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE  A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
SUBDIVISION  The division or redivision of a lot, tract, or parcel of
land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions
of land including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for distribution to heirs,
or devisees, transfer of ownership or building or lot development; provided,
however, that the subdivision by lease of land for agricultural purposes into
parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new street or easement of
access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage from any cause sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred substantial damage or repetitive loss regardless of the actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
to assure safe living conditions.
UNIFORM CONSTRUCTION CODE (UCC)  The statewide building code
adopted by The Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1999 applicable to new
construction in all municipalities whether administered by the municipality,
a third party or the Department of Labor and Industry. Applicable to
residential and commercial buildings, The Code adopted the International
Residential Code (IRC) and the International Building Code (IBC), by
reference, as the construction standard applicable with the state floodplain
construction. For coordination purposes, references to the above are made
specifically to various sections of the IRC and the IBC.
VARIANCE  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
VIOLATION  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A
structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other

fees. The Building Inspector shall transmit all applications to the
Borough Engineer who shall indicate his approval thereon. The
Borough Engineer shall provide findings and determinations in writing
to the Building Inspector within 10 working days of receipt.
B. Before issuance of a grading permit, all applicants who have applied for
a permit for excavation, grading or fill the sum of which equals or
exceeds 300 cubic yards shall post a bond, with corporate surety, or
other approved security in the amount of 100% of the estimated cost of
the grading work to guarantee the completion of said work, including
slope treatment and drainage contemplated under the permit. Such
bond shall be executed by a corporate surety, as well as by the
principal, and shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Solicitor
as to form. The bond shall inure to the benefit of the Borough and be
conditioned upon the faithful performance of the work required under
the terms and conditions of the grading permit to the satisfaction of the

executed by a corporate surety, as well as by the principal, and shall
be subject to the approval of the Borough Solicitor as to form. The
bond shall inure to the benefit of the Borough and be conditioned upon
the faithful performance of the work required under the terms and
conditions of the grading permit to the satisfaction of the Borough
Engineer. In lieu of such bond, a cash deposit or a certified check
in the same amount may be made with the Borough Treasurer. The
estimated cost of the grading work to be done on which the bond shall
be calculated must be prepared by a professional engineer registered
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and should be attached to the
application.
D. Before issuing a grading permit, the Building Inspector shall collect a
permit fee based upon the volume of material to be graded, as follows:
Volume of Material
(cubic yards) Fee
Not more than 100 $25
More than 100, but not more than
300
$30
More than 300, but not more than
500
$35
More than 500, but not more than
1,000
$40
More than 1,000, but not more
than 10,000
$40, plus $3 for each additional
1,000 cubic yards or portion
thereof above 1,000 cubic yards
More than 10,000, but not more
than 100,000
$70, plus $1 for each additional
1,000 cubic yards or portion
thereof above 10,000 cubic yards
More than 100,000 $160, plus $0.50 for each
additional 1,000 cubic yards or
portion thereof above 100,000
cubic yards, except that no fee
shall be more than $600
E. In addition, before issuing a grading permit, the Building Inspector
shall require an escrow account to be established by the person
proposing to perform the grading in an amount established by the
Borough Engineer. Said amount shall not be less than $50 nor more
than 2 1/2% of the estimated grading and improvement cost.
F. When calculating the volume of material for purposes of this chapter,
the volume of material shall be considered cumulatively with regard to
prior applications relative to the property. Thus, if grading, excavation
or fill work has been performed on a property, the volume of material
shall be the sum of all grading excavation or fill work previously
§ 99-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 99-6
1:159
§ 99-7. Expiration of permit; extension of time limit.
Every grading permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void
if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within
three months or is not completed within one year from the date of issue,
provided that the Borough Council, acting upon the recommendation of the
Borough Engineer, may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence
that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed
within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time, and
provided further that the application for the extension of time is made
before the date of expiration of the permit.
§ 99-8. Denial of permit; appeals.
§ 99-9. Inspections; plans to be maintained at site.
performed as well as the sum of the grading, excavation and fill work
which is currently under consideration.
A. Where, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer, the work as proposed by
the applicant is likely to endanger any property or person or any street
or alley or create hazardous conditions, he shall deny the grading
permit. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to endanger
property or streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the
Borough Engineer shall give due consideration to possible saturation by
rains, earth movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface
conditions such as the stratification and faulting of rock, aquifers,
springs and the nature and type of the soil or rock.
B. The Council of the Borough shall consider promptly appeals from the
provisions of this chapter or from the determinations of the Borough
Engineer, and the Council shall make determinations of alternate
methods, standards or materials when, in its opinion, strict compliance
with the provisions of this chapter is unnecessary. Any applicant or
permit holder shall have the right to appeal to any court of competent
jurisdiction from any decision or determination of the Council of the
Borough.
A. The Borough Engineer shall, when contacted by the permit holder as
required in this chapter, make the inspections hereinafter required and
shall either approve that portion of the work which has been completed
or notify the permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with the
provisions of this chapter. Where it is found by inspection that the soil
or other conditions are not as stated or shown in the application, the
Borough Engineer may refuse to approve further work until approval is
obtained for a revised grading plan conforming to existing conditions.
B. Plans for grading work bearing the stamp of approval of the Borough
Engineer shall be maintained at the site during the progress of the
grading work and until the work has been approved.
§ 99-6 BALDWIN CODE § 99-9
1:160
C. The permit holder shall notify the Borough Engineer in order to obtain
inspections in accordance with the following schedule and at least 24
hours before the inspection is to be made. The permit holder shall notify
the Borough Engineer at least five working days before the final
inspection is to be made.
(1) Initial inspection. When work on the excavation or fill is about to be
commenced.
(2) Rough grading. When all rough grading has been completed.
(3) Drainage facilities. When drainage facilities are to be installed and
before such facilities are backfilled.
(4) Special structures. When excavations are complete for retaining
and crib walls and when reinforcing steel is in place and before
concrete is poured.
(5) Final inspection. When all work, including the installation of all
drainage and other structures, has been completed.
D. If at any state of the work the Borough Engineer shall determine by
inspection that the nature of the formation is such that further work as
authorized by an existing permit is likely to endanger property or
streets or alleys or create hazardous conditions, the Borough may
require as a condition to allowing the work to be done that such
reasonable safety precautions are taken as the Borough Engineer
considers advisable to avoid such likelihood of danger. Safety
precautions may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a flatter
exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms,
terracing, compaction or cribbing.
E. Upon conclusion of the work but prior to final inspection by the
Borough Engineer, the professional engineer who designed the grading
plan shall sign and stamp the work guaranteeing that the work has
been performed in accordance with the submitted and approved plans.
Further, the professional engineer who signed and stamped the work
referred to above must show any changes on the drawings that differed
from the approved plans.
F. Upon conclusion of the work but prior to final inspection by the
Borough Engineer, all applicants who have applied for a permit for
excavation, grading or fill the sum of which equals or exceeds 300 cubic
yards shall have a professional engineer validate, through submission
of a signed and stamped document to the Borough Engineer that any fill
material used for a validly permitted project has been compacted within
the ranges established through moister density testing (using either
standard or modified proctor). All tests must be performed by an
accredited laboratory that possesses the necessary state or federal
certifications.
§ 99-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 99-9
1:161
§ 99-10. Excavation standards.
G. The Borough Engineer shall not proceed with the final inspection and
shall not grant authority to release any performance bond until the
items required under this chapter prior to final inspection are provided
to him.
H. Following final inspection, all applicants who have applied for a permit
for excavation, grading or fill the sum of which equals or exceeds 300
cubic yards shall be required to post a two-year maintenance bond with
corporate surety, or other approved security in the amount of 100% of
the estimated cost of maintaining said work, including slope treatment
and drainage contemplated under the permit. Such bond shall be
executed by a corporate surety, as well as by the principal, and shall be
subject to the approval of the Borough Solicitor as to form. The bond
shall inure to the benefit of the Borough and be conditioned on the
maintenance of the work performed under the terms and conditions of
the grading permit to the satisfaction of the Borough Engineer. In lieu
of such bond, a cash deposit or a certified check in the same amount
may be made with the Borough Treasurer. The estimated cost of the
maintenance work on which the bond shall be calculated must be
prepared by a professional engineer registered in the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania and should be reviewed by the Borough Engineer.
A. No excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in slope than one
vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal, except under one or more of the following
conditions:
(1) The excavation is located so that a line having a slope of one
vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal and passing in any portion of the plane
of the cut face will be entirely inside a line three feet inside the
property lines of the property on which the excavation is made.
(2) The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope of steeper than one vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal,
and a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Borough Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified above will
not result in injury to persons or damage to property.
(3) A retaining wall or other approved support design by a registered
engineer and approved by the Borough Engineer is provided to
support the face of the excavation and prevent injury to persons or
damage to property.
B. The Engineer may require an excavation to be made with a cut face
flatter in slope than one vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal if he finds the
material in which the excavation is to be made unusually subject to
§ 99-9 BALDWIN CODE § 99-10
1:162
§ 99-11. Fill standards.
erosion, or if other conditions exist which make such flatter-cut slope
necessary for stability and safety.
C. Excavations shall not extend below the angle of repose or natural slope
of the soil under the nearest point of any footing or foundation of any
building or structure unless such footing or foundation is first properly
underpinned or protected against settlement.
D. Before commencing any excavation which will in any way affect an
adjoining property or structures thereon, the person making or causing
the excavation to be made shall notify in writing the owners of the
adjacent property or buildings not less than 30 days before such
excavation is to be made that the proposed excavation is to be started.
Adjoining properties and structures shall be protected as provided in
the Borough Building Code50 as is then on file in the office of the
Building Inspector and/or as required by the Engineer.
A. No fill shall be made in a residentially zoned area of the Borough or
with an exposed face adjacent to such a district which creates a slope
steeper than one vertical to two horizontal. Fill slopes in lower zoned
districts shall not be steeper than one vertical to 1 1/2 horizontal,
except under one or more of the following conditions:
(1) The fill, in the opinion of the Borough Engineer, is located so that
settlement, sliding or erosion of the fill material will not result in
property damage or be a hazard to adjoining property, streets, ways
or buildings.
(2) A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in soil
engineering, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the standard specified slopes will not
endanger any property or result in personal hazard or property
damage is submitted to and approved by the Engineer.
B. In issuing permits, the Borough, on the advice and recommendation of
the Borough Engineer, may impose conditions requiring that a fill be
constructed with an exposed surface flatter than 1 1/2 horizontal to one
vertical if the Borough Engineer advises that under the particular
circumstances involved, such flatter surface is necessary for stability
and for the safety of persons and property.
C. Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil or earth,
the grading permit shall be subject to the following additional
limitations and requirements:

Chapter 121
NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION
§ 121-1. Findings and intent.
D. Upon the written order of a licensed physician, osteopath or
chiropractor.
A. The Borough Council of Baldwin finds that the commercial extraction of
natural gas in Baldwin Borough violates the rights of residents and
neighborhoods and poses a significant threat to their, health, safety and
welfare. Moreover, widespread environmental and human health
impacts have resulted from commercial gas extraction in other areas.
Regulating the activity of commercial gas extraction automatically
means allowing commercial gas extraction to occur within the Borough,
§ 116-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 121-1
1:181
§ 121-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CORPORATIONS  For purposes of this chapter, shall include any
corporation, limited partnership, limited-liability partnership, business
trust, or limited-liability company organized under the laws of any state
of the United States or under the laws of any country, and any other
business entity that possesses state-conferred limited liability attributes for
its owners, directors, officers and/or managers.
EXTRACTION  The digging or drilling of a well for the purposes of
exploring for, developing or producing natural gas or other hydrocarbons,
whether either the well site, or any part of the piping or well or removal
process is located on or under the geographic boundaries of the Borough of
Baldwin on either the surface or underground.
thus violating the rights of residents and neighborhoods and
endangering their health, safety and welfare by allowing the deposit of
toxins into the air, soil, water, environment and the bodies of residents
within our Borough.
B. Meaningful regulatory limitations and prohibitions concerning
Marcellus Shale natural gas extraction, along with zoning and land use
provisions, are barred because they conflict with certain legal powers
claimed by resource extraction corporations. The Borough Council
recognizes that environmental and economic sustainability cannot be
achieved if the rights of municipal majorities are routinely overridden
by corporate minorities claiming certain legal powers. The Borough
Council also recognizes that sustainability cannot be achieved within a
system of preemption which enables those corporations to use state
governments to override local self-government and which restricts
municipalities to only that lawmaking specifically authorized by state
government.
C. The Borough Council believes that the protection of residents,
neighborhoods and the natural environment constitutes the highest and
best use of the police powers that this municipality possesses. The
Borough Council also believes that local legislation that embodies the
interests of the community is mandated by the doctrine of the consent
of the governed and the right to local, community self-government.
Thus, the Borough Council hereby adopts this chapter, which
establishes a bill of rights for the residents and communities of the
Borough; bans commercial extraction of Marcellus Shale natural gas
within Baldwin Borough because that extraction cannot be achieved
without violating the rights of residents and communities or
endangering their health, safety and welfare; removes certain legal
powers from gas extraction corporations operating within Baldwin
Borough; and nullifies state laws, permits and other authorizations
which interfere with the rights secured by this chapter.
§ 121-1 BALDWIN CODE § 121-2
1:182
NATURAL GAS  Any gaseous substance, either combustible or
noncombustible, which is produced in a natural state from the earth and
which maintains a gaseous or rarified state at standard temperature or
pressure conditions, and/or gaseous components or vapors occurring in or
derived from petroleum or natural gas.
§ 121-3. Statements of law.
Rights of Baldwin residents and the natural environment:
A. Right to water. All residents, natural communities and ecosystems in
Baldwin Borough possess a fundamental and inalienable right to
sustainably access, use, consume and preserve water drawn from
natural water cycles that provide water necessary to sustain life within
the Borough.
B. Rights of natural communities. Natural communities and ecosystems,
including, but not limited to, wetlands, streams, rivers, aquifers and
other water systems, possess inalienable and fundamental rights to
exist and flourish within Baldwin Borough. Residents of the Borough,
along with the municipality, shall possess legal standing to enforce
those rights on behalf of those natural communities and ecosystems.
C. Right to a sustainable energy future. All residents, natural
communities, and ecosystems in Baldwin Borough possess a right to a
sustainable energy future which includes, but is not limited to, the
development, production and use of energy from renewable fuel
sources.
D. Right to self-government. All residents of Baldwin Borough possess the
fundamental and inalienable right to a form of governance where they
live which recognizes that all power is inherent in the people, that all
free governments are founded on the people's authority and consent,
and that corporate entities and their directors and managers shall not
enjoy special privileges or powers under the law which make
community majorities subordinate to them.
E. People as sovereign. Baldwin Borough shall be the governing authority
responsible to, and governed by, the residents of the Borough. Use of
the "Baldwin Borough" municipal corporation by the sovereign people
of the Borough to make law shall not be construed to limit or surrender
the sovereign authority or immunities of the people to a municipal
corporation that is subordinate to them in all respects at all times. The
people at all times enjoy and retain an inalienable and indefeasible right
to self-governance in the community where they reside.
F. Rights as self-executing. All rights delineated and secured by this
chapter shall be self-executing, and these rights shall be enforceable
against corporations and governmental entities.
§ 121-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 121-4
1:183
§ 121-4. Statements of law.
Prohibitions necessary to secure bill of rights' protection:
§ 121-5. Enforcement.
A. It shall be unlawful for any corporation to engage in the extraction of
natural gas within Baldwin Borough, with the exception of gas wells
installed and operating at the time of enactment of this chapter,
provided that the extraction of gas from those existing wells does not
involve any practice or process not previously used for the extraction of
gas from those wells.
B. Corporations in violation of the prohibition against natural gas
extraction or seeking to engage in natural gas extraction shall not have
the rights of "persons" afforded by the United States and Pennsylvania
Constitutions, nor shall those corporations be afforded rights under the
First or Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution or
corresponding sections of the Pennsylvania Constitution, nor shall
those corporations be afforded the protections of the commerce or
contracts clauses within the United States Constitution or
corresponding sections of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
"Corporations," for purposes of this chapter, shall include any
corporation, limited partnership, limited-liability partnership, business
trust, or limited-liability company organized under the laws of any state
of the United States or under the laws of any country, and any other
business entity that possesses state-conferred limited liability
attributes for its owners, directors, officers and/or managers.
C. Corporations engaged in the extraction of natural gas shall not possess
the authority or power to enforce state or federal preemptive law
against the people of Baldwin Borough, or to challenge or overturn
municipal ordinances adopted by the Borough Council of Baldwin, when
that enforcement or challenge interferes with the rights asserted by
this chapter or interferes with the authority of the municipality to
protect the health, safety and welfare of its residents.
D. No permit, license, privilege or charter issued by any state or federal
agency, commission or board of supervisors to any person or any
corporation operating under a state charter, or any director, officer,
owner or manager of a corporation operating under a state charter,
which would violate the prohibitions of this chapter or deprive any
Borough resident(s), natural community, or ecosystem of any rights,
privileges or immunities secured by this chapter, the Pennsylvania
Constitution, the United States Constitution, or other laws, shall be
deemed valid within Baldwin Borough.
A. Any person, corporation or other entity that violates any prohibition of
this chapter shall be guilty of a summary offense and, upon conviction
thereof by a Magisterial District Judge, shall be sentenced to pay the
maximum fine allowable under state law for a summary offense and
§ 121-4 BALDWIN CODE § 121-5
1:184
§ 121-6. Effective date and existing DEP permit holders.
This chapter shall be effective five days after the date of its enactment, at
which point the chapter shall apply to any and all extractions of natural gas
in Baldwin regardless of the date of any applicable DEP permits.
§ 121-7. People's right to self-government.
The foundation for the making and adoption of this chapter is the people's
fundamental and inalienable right to govern themselves and thereby secure
their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Any attempts to use
other units and levels of government to preempt, amend, alter or overturn
this chapter, or parts of this chapter, shall require the Borough Council
to hold public meetings that explore the adoption of other measures that
expand local control and the ability of residents to protect their fundamental
and inalienable right to self-government. Such consideration may include
actions to separate the municipality from the other levels of government
used to preempt, amend, alter or overturn the provisions of this chapter
or other levels of government used to intimidate the people of Baldwin
Borough or their elected officials.

The title of this chapter is the "Borough of Baldwin Vacant and Abandoned
Property Ordinance." It is the purpose and intent of the Borough of Baldwin
to establish a process to address the deterioration and blight of our
neighborhoods caused by an increasing amount of abandoned, foreclosed or
distressed properties located within the Borough, and to identify, regulate,
limit and reduce the number of abandoned properties located within the
Borough. It is the Borough's further intent to establish a registration
program as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from becoming blighted
due to the lack of adequate maintenance and security of abandoned and
foreclosed properties.

§ 134-55. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 134-54 of this article, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases pollution of water
resources.
B. Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal
separate stormsewer systems is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth,
their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated
small municipal separate stormsewer systems (MS4s).
A. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
B. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
§ 134-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 134-55

In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this article invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this article.
§ 134-60. Compatibility with other requirements.
Actions taken under this article do not affect any responsibility, permit or
approval for any activity regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or
ordinance.

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this article. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of
two broad categories or measures: structural or nonstructural. In this
article, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or
behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact of
pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.

[Adopted 4-19-2016 by Ord. No. 869]
§ 134-74. Fees established.
It is hereby enacted and ordained the authority of the same that in addition
to the principal sewage rental charge, penalty and interest due on any
sewage claim or sewage account as set forth in ordinances and any
amendments thereto, the Borough of Baldwin hereby establishes the

accounts:

month to each delinquent account of the Baldwin Borough that remains
delinquent for 60 days from the date first billed. The additional
delinquent fee of $6 will be added for each additional month that the
delinquent account remains delinquent until the entire account
becomes current. Each account that becomes delinquent in payment for
any portion of the bill or for any amount due for a period of 60 days or
longer will be assessed the delinquent accounting and collection fee
until the entire account balance is made current.
B. Each delinquent account of the Borough of Baldwin that is scheduled
for shut off of services due to a delinquency in the account shall be
assessed and charged a property posting fee of $15 for the posting of
the notice of termination of services. Each individual posting of the
realty of a notice to terminate services will result in a charge of $15
being assessed and charged to the said posted delinquent account for
each posting.
C. Each property to which water service has been terminated due to
delinquency in the sewage user's fee account owes to the Borough of
Baldwin shall be assessed $35 for the termination of water services plus
an additional accounting and management fee of $10; provided,
however, if the water company increases or decreases its current fee to
terminate the water services from $35 than the amount charged to the
Borough by the water company for said termination shall be the amount
assessed and charged to the service account, plus an additional
accounting and management fee of $10.
D. Each property that has had its water service terminated due to the
aforesaid delinquency will be assessed and charged a service charge of
$35 to reinstate water services plus an additional accounting and
management fee of $10; provided, however, if the Water Company
increases or decreases its current fee to reinstate water service from
$35; than the amount charged to the Borough by the Water Company
§ 134-74 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 134-74
1:285
shall be the amount assessed and charged to the reinstated service
account plus an additional accounting and management fee of $10.
E. If payment is made by any negotiable instrument that is dishonored for
any reason (i.e., NSF, closed account stop payments, etc.), then the rate
payer or user of the sewerage collection and treatment system of the
Borough of Baldwin shall be assessed and charged $38 for each
dishonored negotiable instrument. In the event that the Bank's fee
charged for dishonored Checks increase, then the aforesaid amount of
$38 will be increased an equal amount and shall be charged to the
drawer of the check, to the maker of the negotiable instrument
delinquent account, or to the account.
F. Cost of postage and/or certified mail shall be assessed and charged at
the actual postage cost to the delinquent account.
G. Notary public fees shall be assessed and charged at the actual cost
incurred to the delinquent account.
H. Fees for online payments shall be charged and assessed to the rate
payer. The current fee is $1.50 for each ACH transaction and $1.50 for
each online credit card or debit card charge; provided, however, if the
online clearing company fees increase, then the fee charged by said
clearing company shall be the fee imposed.
I. Fees for title certifications shall be $30 per certification and paid by the
title company or the buyer of the real estate.
J. This section relates to costs and legal fees incurred in collection of
delinquent sewage accounts of the Borough of Baldwin. Any sewage
account that is not fully paid on or before the due date of the first
delinquency notice, (i.e., 60 days from the initial bill), is hereby
declared to be a delinquent account subject to these charges set forth in
this section; provided however, dishonored negotiable instruments are
assessed and charged the aforesaid fee of $38 with the returned of any
check unpaid for any reason even if the account is not delinquent. The
costs and fees that are to be assessed to the delinquent accounts are to
be paid directly to the designated Borough's collector of sewage user's
fees, and shall be kept by the aforesaid collector and/or the collector's
attorneys who prosecute the claims as payment for the collection,
managing, and accounting fees. Any cost prepaid by the Borough to the
Borough's collector for the collection of said delinquent accounts that is
recovered from the delinquent accounts shall be reimbursed to the
Borough to the extent of the moneys that were recovered from and
were paid by the delinquent property owner or delinquent account
holder. The Borough shall advance posting payments of $15 per posting
to the designated Borough's collector prior to the postings, or such cost
shall be offset in the monthly amounts due the Borough. The Borough
shall pay the shutoff cost either directly to the water company or to the
Borough's collector to pay to the water company upon billing by the
water company. In the event that any of the delinquent accounts are

rental property, then the owner of the realty is responsible for these
additional costs and fees in addition to any unpaid usage charges,
penalties and interest. Landlords are required to register all rental
realty and properties with the designated collector of the sewage
accounts, and landlords who have registered with the designated
collector that the realty is a rental property with a tenant(s) shall
receive a notice of a delinquency in the tenant's account within 30 days
after the account becomes delinquent. Landlords who fail to register
with the designated collector that the realty is rental realty or if the
account is in the landlord's name, then there is a nonrebuttable
presumption that the landlord is responsible for the payment of the
sewage account, even if the landlord did not receive the thirty-day
notice of the tenant's delinquency.
K. That in addition to all costs incurred, the schedule of legal and
administrative fees that the designated collector of sewage usage fees
or his designated attorney or agent are authorized to charge in the

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 138-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Baldwin
Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 138-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Municipality finds that:
§ 138-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the Municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 138-2 of this chapter through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes,
flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation,
overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in
downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens
public health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of
water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including regulation of development and activities causing accelerated
runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and welfare and the
protection of people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater
recharge for water supplies and supports the base flow of streams.
D. The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development (LID)
are intended to address the root cause of water quality impairment by
using systems and practices which use or mimic natural processes to: 1)
infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices
and LID contribute to the restoration or maintenance of
predevelopment hydrology.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) program.
§ 138-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-3
1:299
§ 138-4. Statutory authority.
The Municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, and/or the Act
of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as
amended, The Stormwater Management Act.
§ 138-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 138-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the Municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 138-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve natural drainage systems.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes
and mimic predevelopment hydrology.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best
management practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the
Municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
§ 138-3 BALDWIN CODE § 138-8
1:300
§ 138-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 138-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the Municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
§ 138-10. Waivers.
A. If the Municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter
cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the Municipality
may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than
those in this chapter, subject to § 138-10B. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification
or waiver shall originate with the landowner, shall be in writing, and
shall accompany the stormwater management site plan submitted to
the Municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the
request is based, the provisions of the chapter involved, and the
proposed modification. The designated plan reviewer shall review the
request to determine if it meets the requirements of this chapter,
including Subsection B below. If acceptable to the Municipality, the
Municipality may grant the waiver or modification.
B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be
approved by the Municipality if enforcement will exact undue hardship
because of unique physical circumstances or conditions peculiar to the
land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or
detrimental to the public interest and will achieve the intended
outcome, and that the purpose of the chapter is preserved. Hardship
must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and
not to circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions
of the Stormwater Management Ordinance. Cost or financial burden
shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not substantially
or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany
the stormwater management site plan submission, as directed in
§ 138-10A above.
C. No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity
involving earth disturbance greater than or equal to one acre may be
granted by the Municipality.
§ 138-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-10
1:301
§ 138-11. Version of regulations and standards.
Any reference to a statute, regulation or standard shall be interpreted to
refer to the latest or most current version of that document.
§ 138-12. Disclaimer of liability.
D. This section shall not apply to requests for waiver or modification to the
provisions of Article V, Design Criteria. All requests for waivers or
modifications from Article V shall be reviewed by the Municipality for
applications of any size earth disturbance.
A. For regulatory purposes, the degree of stormwater management sought
by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable. This chapter
shall not impose upon the Municipality any legal duty in addition to
those duties otherwise imposed under the Stormwater Management
Act upon the Municipality, any appointed or elected official, employee
or representative of the Municipality. It is not the intention of the
Municipality to guarantee the elimination of harm resulting from
stream flow, floods, rain, snow, or stormwater runoff; or erosion
resulting therefrom. It is the intention of the Municipality to create
reasonable stormwater management regulations which balance several
competing interests in an appropriate fashion with the emphasis on
public safety.
B. This chapter does not imply that areas within or outside any identified
flood-prone area will be free from flooding or flood damages.
C. Neither the granting of any approval under this chapter, nor the
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, or with any condition
imposed by the Municipality or a Municipality official hereunder, shall
relieve any person from any responsibility for damage to persons or
property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed by law, nor
impose any liability upon the Municipality for damages to person or
property.
D. The granting of a permit which includes any stormwater management
facilities shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty
of any kind by the Municipality, or by an official, employee, or
consultant thereof, of the practicability or safety of any structure, use,
or other plan proposed, and shall create no liability upon or cause of
action against the Municipality, or an official, employee, or consultant
thereof, for any damage that may result pursuant thereto.

quantity by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act
167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, the "Storm Water
Management Act."
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture
such as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal
heavy use areas. This includes the work of producing crops including
tillage, land clearing, plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting
crops or pasturing and raising of livestock and installation of
conservation measures. Construction of new buildings or impervious
area is not considered an agricultural activity.
APPLICANT  A landowner, developer, or other person who has filed an
application to the Municipality for approval to engage in any regulated
activity at a project site in the Municipality.
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities,
designs, measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts
from regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to
promote groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes
of this chapter. Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of
two broad categories or measures: structural or nonstructural. In this
chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/
or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff, whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff. Structural BMPs
include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices and devices,
§ 138-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-13
1:303
from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands, to smallscale
underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter strips,
low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed
swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins, and
manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.
CONSERVATION DISTRICT  A conservation district, as defined in
Section 3(c) of the Conservation District Law (3 P. S. § 851(c)) that
has the authority under a delegation agreement executed with DEP to
administer and enforce all or a portion of the regulations promulgated
under 25 Pa. Code 102.
DEP  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
DESIGN STORM  The magnitude and temporal distribution of
precipitation from a storm event measured in probability of occurrence
(e.g., five-year storm) and duration (e.g., 24 hours) used in the design
and evaluation of stormwater management systems. Also see return
period.
DESIGNATED PLAN REVIEWER  A qualified professional as defined
herein, or organization such as the Allegheny County Conservation
District, that has been designated by the Municipality to be the
reviewer of SWM site plans for the Municipality, and shall be
understood to be the reviewer where indicated as the Municipality
within this chapter.
DETENTION BASIN  An impoundment designed to collect and retard
stormwater runoff by temporarily storing the runoff and releasing it at a
predetermined rate. Detention basins are designed to drain completely
in a designed period after a rainfall event, and to become dry until the
next rainfall event.
DETENTION VOLUME  The volume of runoff that is captured and
released into the waters of the commonwealth at a controlled rate.
DEVELOPMENT SITE (SITE)  See project site.
DISTURBED AREA  An unstabilized land area where an earth

from any natural source or delineated by applicable FEMA maps and
studies as being a special flood hazard area. Also includes areas that
comprise Group 13 soils, as listed in Appendix A of the Pennsylvania
DEP Technical Manual for Sewage Enforcement Officers (as amended
or replaced from time to time by DEP).
FLOODWAY  The channel of the watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains that are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the 100-year flood. Unless otherwise specified, the boundary
of the floodway is as indicated on maps and flood insurance studies
provided by FEMA. In an area where no FEMA maps or studies have
defined the boundary of the 100-year floodway, it is assumed, absent
evidence to the contrary, that the floodway extends from the stream to
50 feet from the top of the bank of the stream.
FOREST MANAGEMENT/TIMBER OPERATIONS  Planning and
activities necessary for the management of forestland. These include
conducting a timber inventory, preparation of forest management
plans, silvicultural treatment, cutting budgets, logging road design and
construction, timber harvesting, site preparation, and reforestation.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE  Systems and practices that use or mimic
natural processes to infiltrate, evapotranspire, or reuse stormwater on
the site where it is generated.

wells and springs and is within the saturated zone of soil and rock.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE  The replenishment of existing natural
underground water supplies from precipitation or overland flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)  Infiltration rates of soils vary
widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface
intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D)
according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare
soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS defines the four groups and
provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group
classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be
identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local
NRCS offices or conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious
as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS79).
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)  A surface that
prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces
(or areas) shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor
living spaces, patios, garages, storage sheds and similar structures; and
any new streets or sidewalks. Decks, parking areas, and driveway areas
are counted as impervious areas if they directly prevent infiltration. Any
surface areas designed to initially be gravel or crushed stone shall be
assumed to be impervious surfaces. In addition, any surface designed
79.Editor's Note: See § 138-43A and B.
§ 138-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-13
1:305
to be constructed of permeable, pervious or porous concrete, asphalt,
or pavers shall be considered an impervious surface.
INFILTRATION  Movement of surface water into the soil, where it is
absorbed by plant roots, evaporated into the atmosphere, or percolated
downward to recharge groundwater.
INVASIVE SPECIES  DCNR defines invasive plants as those species
that are not native to the state, grow aggressively, and spread and
displace native vegetation. (see http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/
public/documents/document/dcnr 010314.pdf for a list of invasive
species.)

the following meanings: the improvement of one lot or two or more
contiguous lots, tracts, or parcels of land for any purpose involving a) a
group of two or more buildings or b) the division or allocation of land or
space between or among two or more existing or prospective occupants
by means of, or for the purpose of streets, common areas, leaseholds,
condominiums, building groups, or other features; any subdivision of
land; development in accordance with Section 503(1.1) of the PA
Municipalities Planning Code.80
LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)  Site design approaches and
small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the use
of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of
rainwater. LID can be applied to new development, urban retrofits, and
revitalization projects. LID utilizes design techniques that infiltrate,
filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely
on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses
stormwater through a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features
located on-site.
MUNICIPALITY  Borough of Baldwin, Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania.
NATIVE VEGETATION  Plant species that have historically grown in
Pennsylvania and are not invasive species as defined herein.

for which a release rate has been established by an adopted Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan.82
RETENTION VOLUME/REMOVED RUNOFF  The volume of runoff
that is captured and not released directly into the surface waters of this
commonwealth during or after a storm event.
RETURN PERIOD  The average interval, in years, within which a
storm event of a given magnitude can be expected to occur one time.
For example, the twenty-five-year return period rainfall would be
expected to occur on average once every 25 years; or stated in another
way, the probability of a twenty-five-year storm occurring in any one
year is 0.04 (i.e., a 4% chance).

achieve the volume and rate controls required under this chapter,
the SWM site plan must include a detailed justification, acceptable
to the designated plan reviewer, demonstrating that the use of LID
and green infrastructure is not practicable.
H. Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the project site at
strategic locations, made as shallow as practicable, and located to
maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while still meeting
the other requirements of this chapter.
I. Normally dry, open-top storage facilities should completely drain both
the volume control and rate control capacities over a period of time not

storm. Infiltration tests performed at the facility locations and proposed
basin bottom depths, in accordance with the BMP Manual, must
support time-to-empty calculations if infiltration is a factor.
J. The design storm precipitation depths to be used in the analysis of peak
rates of discharge shall be as obtained in PennDOT's Drainage Manual,
Publication 584, Appendix 7A; or obtained from the latest version of the
Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic

E. Roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects, which do not increase
impervious area, and underground infrastructure projects are exempt
from the provisions of this chapter, provided the activities meet the
requirements of all other Municipal, state and federal requirements.
Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 138-14D through J.
F. The Municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the Municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
G. Voluntary green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) retrofit projects that
are solely intended to better manage runoff from existing development

possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the design
storm method in Subsection A or the simplified method in Subsection B
below. Water volume controls shall be implemented using the design storm
method in Subsection A or the simplified method in Subsection B below, or
alternative design criteria as allowed by PA Code Title 25, Chapter 102.
A. The design storm method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual94) is applicable as a
method to any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions. The following shall be incorporated
into the CG-1 method:
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a forty-eight- to seventy-two-hour dewatering
time in an area with a dedicated stormwater system (not
contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in
a facility designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an
area contributory to a combined sewer system before discharge to
local stormwater systems or the environment. Justification, as
prepared and sealed by a qualified professional, for assertion that
permanent removal is not feasible must be provided, at a minimum,
in the form of field-measured infiltration rate testing and
geotechnical evaluation of the existing site soils with regard to the
impact of proposed infiltration. Applications omitting this
justification, including infiltration rate testing will be considered
incomplete. BMPs proposing use of extended detention in lieu of
permanent reduction through the listed methods shall include a
valve to adjust or regulate dewatering time to achieve the
performance standards noted herein. The valve system shall
include an inspection/monitoring port for review of dewatering.
(3) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.

§ 138-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-16
1:313
§ 138-17. Rate controls.
B. The simplified method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual95) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the design storm
method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from the net increase in
impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of this
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration. If the developer provides
justification that the listed removal options are not feasible, and the
designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a
facility designed for a twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area
with a dedicated stormwater system (not contributory to a
combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility designed
for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a
combined sewer system before discharge to local stormwater
systems or the environment.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 138-17, Rate
Controls, if the project qualifies for exemption by the provisions of
§ 138-15A.
A. For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: Post-development discharge rates shall
not exceed the pre-development discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year twenty-four-hour storm events. This is
the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to those
rates shown in the maps contained in Appendix A (Release Rate
Management Districts). This predevelopment to post-development
control is not to be misconstrued as the same as the conditional direct
discharge areas on the release rate maps. For comparison of peak flow
rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth of a of a cubic foot per second
(cfs). If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year twenty-four-hour storms, then the
requirements of this section have been met. Otherwise, the applicant

§ 138-16 BALDWIN CODE § 138-17
1:314
§ 138-18. Riparian buffers.
shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate
of discharge requirement. Peak flows should be computed using the
methods included in the chapter titled "Stormwater Calculations and
Methodology" of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
Except, however, where documented downstream flooding problems
exist, the Municipality may impose a 50% reduced release rate criteria.
B. For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and 100-year twenty-four-hour storm events, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved
release rate maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (Release
Rate Management Districts) of this chapter. For comparison of peak
flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth of a cubic foot per second
(cfs). For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be
computed using the methods included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP
Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
A. In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer
easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or
land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The intent of this
chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve
stream water quality. The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland
flow to the stream through the presence of native grasses, trees and
shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition
of sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer
rather than in the stream; and reducing erosion by providing stream
bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams, keeping waters
cooler and reducing evaporation.
B. Except as required by PA Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer
easement shall be required for all, streams (as defined in Article II) with
a contributing watershed area of greater than 10 acres. The riparian
buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the
top of the streambank (on each side).
C. Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
(1) No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted
that is inconsistent with the intent of the riparian buffer as
described in § 138-18A.
(2) Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within
the riparian buffer easement.
(3) Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively
removed and the riparian buffer easement shall be planted with
§ 138-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-18
1:315
native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native
plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the Municipality
and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds
Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the
property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued
private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area
required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning
Ordinance.96
E. Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing
100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
F. Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement, but they shall cross the easement in the shortest practical
distance. Other structural stormwater management facilities are not
permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
G. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted by the Municipality within riparian
buffers:
(1) It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for
nonmotorized use only; however, impermeable trails are permitted
provided they have adequate drainage.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.
H. Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted
within the riparian buffer easement and shall comply with setback
requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
I. Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement; however, work shall be performed to minimize disturbance
area and removal of trees. Restoration within the riparian buffer
easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other
plantings. One tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the
restoration shall be designed by a registered professional with the
requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to
cross the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest
practical distance. Existing utilities may remain and be maintained as
required.

Design Criteria
§ 138-26. Calculation methodology.
A. All computations used in conjunction with the analysis and design of
stormwater management facilities shall be based on one or more of the
following methods, or as otherwise approved in advance by the
Municipality:
(1) TR-55-Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Technical Release No. 55.
(2) TR-20-Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Technical Release No. 20.
(3) Modified rational method.
(4) Penn State Runoff Model.
(5) Virginia Tech/Penn State Runoff Model.
B. These methods for determining peak discharge shall be used to:
(1) Determine predevelopment runoff conditions;
(2) Analyze the impact of development; and
(3) Perform calculations in the design of any detention/retention
facilities used in controlling runoff.
C. The SCS, Type II Rainfall Distribution shall be used for all analyses. The
design storm frequencies for the watershed are:
Design storm 24-hour rainfall depth
1-Year 1.97
2-Year 2.35
5-Year 2.88
10-Year 3.61
25-Year 4.31
50-Year 4.40
100-Year 5.71
D. Predevelopment conditions: The cover type for all sites will be
considered to be the dominant land cover during the five year period
immediately preceding a proposed regulated activity:
(1) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing nonforested pervious areas conditions shall
be considered as meadow (good condition). Forested land areas
shall be considered in good condition.
§ 138-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 138-26
1:323
§ 138-27. Standards for collection and conveyance facilities.
(2) For the purposes of predevelopment peak flow rate and volume
determination, 20% of existing disturbed impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow (good condition).
E. Post-development conditions: The hydrologic parameters used to
develop peak flow rates shall be reflective of anticipated soil runoff
characteristics following grading and development of the site.
F. Time of concentration: The minimum time of concentration for any
watershed shall be six minutes. A minimum six-minute time of
concentration may be assumed for any post-development watershed.
Calculations must be provided for all predevelopment times of
concentrations. A minimum time of concentration cannot be assumed
for predevelopment conditions.
G. The use of the basic rational method in estimating runoff may be
employed in the design of the storm sewer conveyance system within
the development. The storm sewer system shall be interpreted as the
conduits, culverts, inlets and appurtenant features for the conveying of
stormwater to, through or from a development site to the point of final
discharge or control facility. The rational method shall not be used in
the analysis of stormwater runoff from the development in its entirety
or in conjunction with the design of any retention/detention facilities or
other runoff control measures.
H. Points of interest for analysis of pre- and post-development runoff must
be selected to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
§§ 138-16 and 138-17 is achieved at all points where runoff exits the
perimeter of the property.
I. Stormwater runoff shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another unless the watersheds are subareas of a larger watershed that
are tributary to a common point of interest within or near the perimeter
of the property. Transfer of runoff from one watershed to another under
any other circumstances shall only be approved at the discretion of the
Municipality. Documentation shall be provided that peak flow rates are
not increased following development and there will be no detrimental
impact in downstream areas.
J. The stormwater management plan shall consider all of the stormwater
runoff flowing over the project site. Runoff calculations shall be made to
ensure that runoff from the upstream watershed area can be
accommodated by the pipes, drainage easements and watercourses,
etc., on the site.
A. All stormwater collection and conveyance facilities (pipes, swales, and
structures) shall be designed for a 100-year design storm event, unless
the runoff would naturally drain overland to a stormwater detention
facility, in which case a twenty-five-year design storm event may be

used. The hydraulic gradeline must be a minimum of two feet below
the surface elevation within the pipe. Swales and channels shall provide
at least one foot of freeboard above the energy gradeline. Backwater
effects of pipes discharging under surcharge conditions shall be
included.
B. Runoff calculations shall include complete hydrology and hydraulic
analysis of all downstream swales and pipe facilities to permanent

Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.99
§ 138-32. Special Stormwater Facility Maintenance Fund.
A. Persons installing post-construction stormwater management BMP
facilities will be required to pay a specified amount to the Municipal
Stormwater Facility Maintenance Fund to help defray the costs of
periodic inspections and annual maintenance expenses. The amount of
the deposit shall be determined as follows:
(1) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained, the
deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by
the Municipality for a period of 10 years, as estimated by the
Municipality. After that period of time, inspections will be
performed by the Municipality and billed directly to the owner.
(2) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Municipality, the deposit shall cover the estimated annual costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years, as estimated by the
Municipality.
(3) The amount of the deposit to the maintenance fund covering annual
inspection and maintenance costs shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Municipality Manager shall
determine the present-worth equivalents, which shall be subject to
the final approval of the Council.
B. If the storage facility is proposed, which also serves as a recreation
facility, such as a lake or ballfield, the Municipality may reduce or waive
the amount of the maintenance fund based on the value of the land for
public recreation purposes.
C. If at some future time any storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or another
storage facility (i.e, a distributed storage facility), the unused portion of
the maintenance fund will be applied to the cost of abandoning the
facility and connecting to the storm sewer system or other facility. Any
amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of abandonment are
paid will be returned to the depositor.

Planning Commission, other Borough officials and public utility people
on the availability of services and facilities in the area to be subdivided;
and to discuss the subdivision proposals with potentially interested

premature development in unsuitable areas that are inaccessible or
hazardous or lack services. The Planning Commission shall also
encourage replatting of dead subdivisions and coordinating the platting
of small adjacent land.

the subdivider may submit to the Planning Commission sketch plans
and data as specified in § 142-28.

plat and shall be in form prepared by the Borough of Baldwin. No
application may be submitted to the Borough Secretary during the 10
days immediately prior to the next meeting of the Planning

Commission may require the dedication or reservation of such area
within the subdivision in those cases in which the Planning Commission
deems such requirements to be reasonable.
C. Land which the Planning Commission has found to be unsuitable for
subdivision due to flooding, bad drainage and other features likely to be

eliminate these hazards are formulated by the developer and approved
by the Borough Engineer and the Planning Commission.
A. Street layouts shall conform to the following:
(1) The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of
all streets shall conform to the Borough Master Plan and shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to
topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety and in
their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be
served by such streets. Where not shown on the Master Plan or on
the Official Map of the Borough, the arrangement and other design
standards of streets shall conform to the provisions found herein.
(2) In general, all streets shall be continuous and in alignment with
existing streets and shall compose a convenient system to ensure
circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with the exception

streets and culs-de-sac, where made necessary by topographic
conditions, that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.

large blocks or in developments where it is desired to separate
pedestrian from vehicular traffic.

than 800 feet apart between their center lines.
(21) Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of 5°, connection
shall be by horizontal curves.

be constructed when they are a natural continuation of an alley
already partially open and in use, in which case they shall be ended
within a continuing distance of 300 feet.

General Provisions
§ 142-37. Title.
This Part 2 shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Baldwin
Stormwater Management Ordinance" or just the "stormwater regulations."
§ 142-38. Grant of power; prior ordinances superseded.
This Part 2 is adopted in accordance with the authority granted to
municipalities to regulate subdivision and land development by the
Stormwater Management Act of October 9, 1978 (P.L. 864, No. 167, 32 P.S.
§§ 680.1 through 680.17), as amended, and the Stormwater Management
Guidelines adopted by the General Assembly. This Part 2 shall supersede all
previous ordinances.
§ 142-39. Purpose.
These regulations are adopted and implemented to achieve the following
general purposes and objectives:
A. To manage stormwater runoff resulting from land alterations and
disturbance activities in accordance with watershed stormwater
management plans adopted pursuant to the Pennsylvania Storm Water
Management Act (Act 167 of 1978, as amended).108
B. To utilize and protect the desirable existing natural drainage systems
and to preserve the flood protection capacity of streams.
C. To encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater
supplies and stream flows.
D. To provide for adequate maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management facilities in the Borough.
E. To update and revise the existing Ordinance No. 605 (Note: Said
ordinance comprised the former stormwater regulations, amended in
their entirety by Ord. No. 691.) due to changes in the engineering
concepts concerning stormwater management.
F. To update and revise the existing Ordinance No. 605 (as amended by
Ord. No. 659) due to changes in the engineering and legal concepts
concerning stormwater management.
108. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 142-37 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-39
1:383
§ 142-40. Applicability.
The provisions of this Part 2 shall apply to all subdivision and land
developments unless specifically exempted or otherwise modified herein.
All activities related to proper operation and maintenance of approved
stormwater management BMPs and all activities that may contribute
nonstormwater discharges to a regulated small MS4 are subject to
regulation by this Part.
G. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases pollution of water
resources.
H. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
I. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated
small municipal separate stormsewer systems (MS4s).
J. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
K. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
L. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
M. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
N. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address nonstormwater discharges into the Municipality's separate
storm sewer system.
A. Repealer. Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the
Municipality inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Part 2 is
hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
B. Severability. In the event that any section or provision of this Part 2 is
declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision
shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this
Part 2.

fees will be established from time to time by the Borough by resolution;
engineer costs and expenses shall be billed to the Borough that shall be
payable by the applicant.
B. Administrative/clerical costs. The review of the BMP operations and
maintenance plan by the Municipal Engineer. The site inspections
including, but not limited to preconstruction meetings, inspections
during construction of stormwater BMPs, and final inspection upon

ARTICLE XI
Stormwater Plan Requirements
§ 142-43. General requirements.
The following general requirements shall be followed for all plan
submissions:
A. No final subdivision or land development plan shall be approved, no
permit authorizing construction issued, or any earthmoving or land
disturbance activity initiated until the final stormwater management
plan for the development site is approved in accordance with the
provisions of this Part 2.
B. A development of a single lot for a single family home or estate must
submit a simplified stormwater management plan. This plan must
include a site location map, a soils map, the runoff calculations and the
routing computations through the stormwater detention system. A site
plan must be submitted with contours at two foot intervals and all
natural features including any natural watercourse.
C. The Borough Engineer shall review the proposed provisions for
stormwater management for a single lot for a single family home or
estate. Where the applicant is proposing to connect to an existing storm
sewer, the applicant shall demonstrate that sufficient capacity exists in
the storm sewer from the point of connection to the point of outlet in
the natural drainage system. The Borough Engineer shall determine if
the proposed development site is part of a larger parcel or tract for
which a stormwater management plan was approved previously and,
therefore, subject to any specific stormwater management control
contained in the prior plan.
D. At the time of the submission of an application by a developer for
stormwater management review, the developer shall also submit a fee,
which will be established from time to time by resolution of the Borough
Council of the Borough of Baldwin. Such fees shall be in payment of the
costs incurred by the Borough for the review by the Borough Engineer
of the development plan, for any legal fees incurred in preparation of
development plan agreements, and other services, which shall be
established by resolution of the Borough Council from time to time, and
the cost of issuing permits related to the plan.
E. Techniques described in Appendix E (Low Impact Development) of this
chapter are encouraged, because they reduce the costs of complying
with the requirements of this Part 2 and the state water quality
requirements.
F. In conjunction with meeting the requirements of this Part 2, the
applicant shall refer to and meet all conditions and requirements set
forth in the Borough of Baldwin Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (MS4) Prohibited Discharge Ordinance.
§ 142-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-43
1:393
§ 142-44. Criteria for small developments.
G. In conjunction with meeting the requirements of this Part 2, the
Applicant shall refer to and meet all conditions and requirements set
forth in the Borough of Baldwin Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Plan
as adopted and revised.
A. At the time of application, the Borough Engineer shall determine if the
subdivision of land development qualifies as a "small development" and
therefore is eligible for a simplified stormwater management plan
submission. For the purposes of this article, a small development is as
follows: any subdivision or land development which results (or will
result when fully constructed) in the creation of 5,000 or less square
feet of impervious surface area shall be classified as a small
development and is exempt from a stormwater management plan
submission. Small developments must provide safe management of
stormwater runoff in accordance with the performance standard of this
article and as approved by the Borough. Any stormwater management
facilities constructed as part of the development shall be designed to
control the peak pre-development stormwater runoff for the one-, two-,
ten-, twenty-five-, and one-hundred-year storm. The detention facility
must be able to safely pass the post development one-hundred-year
storm peak discharge. The facility must provide an emergency outlet
which can discharge the peak runoff for the undetained post
development one-hundred-year storm.
B. Applications for small developments shall include a plan which
describes, narratively and graphically, the type and location of
proposed on site stormwater management techniques or the proposed
connection to an existing storm sewer system. The plan should show
accurately site boundaries, contours at five-foot intervals for areas of
greater than fifteen-percent slope gradient and at two-foot intervals for
areas with less than fifteen-percent slope, location of watershed and/or
subarea boundaries on the site (if applicable); and any watercourses,
flood plains or exiting drainage facilities or structures located on the
site.
C. The predevelopment and post-development calculations which show the
amount of increase impervious area for the land development must be
submitted prior to receiving an exception from submission of a
stormwater management plan.
D. If applicable, a copy of the PaDEP stream encroachment permit and all
supporting calculations must be submitted prior to an exemption.
E. If the land development discharges its runoff into a floodway or a
natural or manmade swale or ditch, and is located upstream of a known
area of continuous flooding, the calculations showing no increase in the
peak water surface elevation at the point of flooding shall be submitted
for review.
§ 142-43 BALDWIN CODE § 142-44
1:394
§ 142-45. Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System Ordinance.
In conjunction with meeting the requirements of this Part 2, the applicant
shall refer to and meet all conditions and requirements set forth in the
Borough of Baldwin's Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4)
Prohibited Discharge Ordinance.
F. The Borough Engineer shall review and approve the proposed
provisions for stormwater management for a small development. Where
the applicant is proposing to connect to an existing storm sewer, the
applicant shall demonstrate that sufficient capacity exists in the storm
sewer from the point of connection to the point of outlet in the natural
drainage system. The Borough Engineer shall determine if the proposed
development site is part of a larger parcel or tract for which a
stormwater management plan was approved previously, and therefore
subject to any specific stormwater management control contained in
the prior plan.
G. For a parcel or tract of land held under single ownership, only one
application for a small development, as defined above, shall be
permitted before requiring a stormwater management plan for the
entire parcel. A project cannot be phased to circumvent the stormwater
requirements by using the exemption for small developments.
Stormwater for phased projects will be looked at as a whole.

Stormwater Plan Review Procedures
§ 142-57. Preapplication phase.
§ 142-58. Preliminary and final stormwater plan reviews.
A. During the preapplication conference, applicants are encouraged to
consult with the Borough Engineer, the Allegheny County Planning
Department, and the county conservation district on the applicable
regulations and techniques for safely managing stormwater runoff from
the development site in a manner consistent with the Borough
ordinances. These agencies may be helpful in providing the data that is
necessary for preparing the stormwater management plan or the
development site.
B. Applicants are encouraged to submit a sketch plan with a narrative
description of the proposed stormwater management controls for
general guidance and discussion with the Borough and other agencies.
C. The preapplication phase is not mandatory, and any review comments
provided by Borough or other agencies are advisory only and do not
constitute any binding action on the part of the Borough or any other
agency.
A. Preliminary and final plans required. Stormwater management plans, in
accordance with the requirements of this Part 2, will be submitted with
the preliminary and final subdivision or land development plan
application to the Borough Secretary, together with the appropriate
fees.
B. Review by Borough Engineer and Conservation District. Preliminary
and final stormwater management plans will be reviewed by the
Borough Engineer.
C. Notification of affected municipalities. If, during the review of the
proposed stormwater management plan, the Borough determines that
properties in adjacent municipalities may be affected by the stormwater
runoff and proposed management system for the site, the applicant will
notify the affected municipality(ies) and provide an opportunity to
submit comments as part of the preliminary or final plan reviews.
Copies of the plans will be made available to the municipalities upon
request. Comments received will be submitted to the Planning
Commission and Borough Council.
D. Borough Engineer's review. The Borough Engineer shall provide a
recommendation to approve or disapprove the preliminary and final
stormwater management plan based on the requirements of the
Borough's ordinances, the standards and criteria of the watershed plan
and good engineering practice. The Engineer shall submit a written
report, along with supporting documentation, to the Borough Planning
§ 142-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-58
1:405
§ 142-59. Status of stormwater plan after final approval.
Upon recording of the final plat, the applicant may start to install or
implement the approved stormwater management controls, subject to the
Commission for its consideration as part of the overall subdivision or
land development plan review. In the cases where the Borough will
be responsible for the maintenance of the stormwater management
facility, the Borough Engineer shall also prepare a recommended
maintenance program for review and approval by Council.
E. Approval of stormwater plan required for subdivision and land
development approval. No preliminary or final approval shall be
granted for the overall subdivision or land development application
until a stormwater management plan for the site has been approved.
F. Permits required from other governmental agencies. Where the
subdivision or land development application requires a water
obstruction or erosion/sedimentation permit, then final subdivision or
land development plan approval shall be conditional upon receipt of
such permits. However, no building permit shall be issued, or
construction started, until the permits are received and copies filed
with the Borough. Approval from Allegheny county conservation district
or the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for Soil
and Erosion is required prior to construction.
G. County planning review.
(1) The Borough shall forward a copy of the stormwater plan, along
with all runoff calculations, shall be forwarded to the Allegheny
County Planning Department. A report of the findings will be
returned to the Borough within 30 days.
(2) If the Allegheny County Planning Department determines that the
plan fails to comply with the watershed standards and criteria or
that a possibility exists for harmful downstream impacts from the
development site, the applicant will be advised so that proposed
stormwater management controls can be modified. The Borough
Engineer shall not recommend approval of the development site's
stormwater management plan until it receives a positive review
from the County Planning Department.
H. Status of the Engineer's determination. The recommendation of
approval/disapproval of the site's stormwater management plan by the
Borough Engineer shall be considered final. The governing body shall
not reverse the engineer's determination by approval or disapproving
the site's stormwater management plan or any specific control measure
in contradiction to the engineer's action. The governing body may
request modifications or alternative approaches to the stormwater
management controls, provided that these are agreed to by the
Borough Engineer and the applicant's engineer.
§ 142-58 BALDWIN CODE § 142-59
1:406
provisions of the above. If site development or building construction does
not begin within two years of the date of final approval of the subdivision or
land development plan, then before doing so, the applicant shall resubmit
the stormwater management plans to verify that no condition has changed
within the watershed that would affect the feasibility or effectiveness of the
previously approved stormwater management controls. Further, if for any
reason development activities are suspended for two years or more, then
the same requirement for resubmission of the stormwater management
plan shall apply. The terms of these subsequent reviews shall be subject
to the provisions of this Part 2 and any amended additional ordinances
subsequently passed.
§ 142-60. Stormwater plan modifications.
Procedures for approving plan modifications. Requests for modifications in
the final approved stormwater management controls shall be submitted to
the Borough Engineer as follows:
A. If the request is initiated before construction begins, the stormwater
plan must be resubmitted and reviewed according to the original
procedures.
B. If the request is initiated after construction is underway, the Borough
Engineer shall have the authority to approve or disapprove the
modification, based on field inspection, provided that the request
changes in stormwater controls do not result in any modifications to
other approved borough land use/development requirements. The
Borough Engineer shall maintain a record of all changes approved for
the stormwater management controls and shall submit these to
Borough Council with the final as-built plans for the development, prior
to the acceptance of any improvements by the Borough and/or the
release of any bond money for improvements being constructed. If no
bond money was required, this information must be submitted prior to
the Borough's final inspection of the plan is completed and approval is
granted.

subareas which have similar hydrological characteristics and drain
to a common point.
B. The location and boundaries of the watershed(s) and subareas are
shown on the Municipal Stormwater Management District Zone Map
which is hereby adopted as part of this section. A copy of this District
Map is available through the Borough Office.
A. Any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration or
development of land which may affect stormwater runoff
characteristics shall implement such measures as are reasonably
necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or other property. Such
measures shall include actions as required and shall be evaluated
according to the following standards:
(1) To assure that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is no greater
after development than prior to development activities; or
119. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 142-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-62
1:409
§ 142-63. Technical performance standards.
The stormwater performance standards contained in this article are
intended to implement the standards and criteria contained in the
Monongahela River Stormwater Management plan, adopted and approved
in accordance with the Pennsylvania Storm Water Management Act.120 If
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this section and the
standards and criteria of the plan, or if the watershed plan is subsequently
amended, then the standards/criteria of the current watershed plan shall
govern.
§ 142-64. Storm frequencies.
(2) To manage the quantity, velocity and direction of resulting
stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately
protects health and property from possible injury.
B. The stormwater management plan for the development site must
consider all the stormwater runoff flowing over the site.
C. No discharge of toxic materials into any stormwater management
system shall be permitted. Where required by federal and state
regulation, the landowner or developer shall be responsible for
obtaining a NPDES permit for stormwater discharges.
D. For any development that is to be constructed in stages, the applicant
must demonstrate that stormwater facilities shall be installed to
manage stormwater runoff safely during each stage of development.
E. For the analysis of redevelopment projects 20% of the existing
impervious surface shall be considered meadow in good condition.
F. Where existing storm sewers are reasonably accessible, proposed
developments shall be required to connect with the storm sewer system
unless insufficient capacity or other reasons can be demonstrated to
prevent the connection. The Borough Engineer shall determine what is
reasonably accessible.
A. Stormwater management facilities on all development sites shall
control the peak stormwater discharge for the one-, two-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm frequencies. The SCS twentyfour-
hour Type II Rainfall Distribution shall be used for analyzing
stormwater runoff for both pre- and post-development conditions. The
twenty-four-hour total rainfall for these storm frequencies in the
watershed are:

100-year 5.71
B. The Modified Rational Method shall be used for analyzing the
stormwater runoff for small watersheds as specified in this article. The
rainfall intensities for the design storms are as specified. (For additional
information or data on other return periods, consult the Rainfall
Duration Frequency Tables for Pennsylvania, produced by PaDEP, Office
of Resource Management, Division of Stormwater Management,
Harrisburg, February 1983, or in its most recent update.)
A. Development sites. For the purposes of computing peak discharges and
runoff hydrographs from development sites and drainage areas larger
than three acres, calculations shall be performed using the
methodologies presented in SCS Publication, Technical Release 55 (TR
55) or TR 20, HEC 1, Penn State Runoff Method (PSRM), Modified
Rational Method, or an approved method for analyzing these types of
watersheds. For development sites less than three acres, the Rational
Method may be utilized using the design storm criteria shown in
§ 142-63 or an approved method for analyzing these types of
watersheds. The Borough may approve the use of simulation computer
programs for the stormwater analysis and design. The appropriate
calculations and worksheets or acceptable computer printouts as
approved by the Borough must be submitted regardless of the
methodology used for these calculations. An approved simulation of the
modified puls (Haested Method Pond 2, HEC 1) routing methodology
shall be used in analysis for routing the design storm hydrographs
through the detention/retention facility. The proper stage/storage and
stage/discharge and routed outflow hydrographs must be submitted for
approval.
B. Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purpose of
designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater runoff
collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational Method shall be
applied. Rainfall intensities for a twenty-five-year design storm with a
minimum five-minute duration must be used and should be obtained
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Part II Manual,
Chapter 10, Rainfall Intensity Charts. However, if the existing Tc is
larger than five minutes, it should be used as the rainfall duration.
§ 142-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-65
1:411
§ 142-66. Release rate percentage.
C. Detention/retention basin. The inflow hydrograph shall be routed
through the detention/retention facility by using the Modified Puls
method or other recognized routing method subject to the approval of
the Borough and the County. The routing and outflow hydrographs for
each design storm must be submitted.
D. Pre-development conditions. Pre-development conditions shall be
assumed to be those which exist on any site at the time of adoption of
the Monongahela River Stormwater Management Plan. Hydrologic
conditions for all areas with pervious cover (i.e., fields, woods, lawn
areas, pastures, cropland, etc.) shall be assumed to be in good
condition, and the lowest recommended SCS runoff curve number (CN)
shall be applied for all pervious land uses within the respective range
for each land use and hydrologic soil group.
A. Definition. The release rate percentage defines the percentage of the
pre-development peak rate of runoff that can be discharged from an
outfall on the site after development. It applies uniformly to all land
development or alterations within a subarea.
B. Procedure for use:
(1) Identify the specific subarea in which the development site is
located from the watershed map located in Appendix D of this Part
2121 and obtain the subarea release rate percentage from the
following corresponding zone release rate percentages:
Assigned Release Rate Area Release Rate Percentage
Zone 2 100
Zone 4 60
Zone 6 60
Zone 9 90
Zone 12 50
Zone 15 70
Zone 21 50
Zone 22 60
Zone 24 70
Zone 32 70
Zone 34 50
Zone 35 70
Zone 43 100

§ 142-65 BALDWIN CODE § 142-66
1:412
§ 142-67. No-harm evaluation.
All other areas not located within an assigned zone by the
Monongahela River Watershed Plan are assigned the release rate
of 100%.
(2) Compute the pre- and post-development runoff hydrographs for
each stormwater outfall on the development site using an
acceptable calculation method for the one-, two-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year storms. If the post-development peak
runoff rate and the runoff volume is less than or equal to the predevelopment
peak runoff rate and volume, then additional
stormwater control shall not be required at the outfall. If the postdevelopment
peak runoff rate and volume are greater than the predevelopment
peak runoff rate and volume, then stormwater
detention shall be required. The maximum allowable release rate
form the detention facility shall be calculated by multiplying the
subarea release rate percentage by the pre-development rate of
runoff from the development site for each of the four design storms.
A. An applicant may seek to exceed the otherwise applicable subarea
release rate percentage by performing the "no-harm evaluation." This
evaluation requires an independent engineering analysis to
demonstrate that other reasonable options exist to prevent the
occurrence of increased stormwater runoff discharge rates and/or
velocities, or that measures can be provided to prevent increased
stormwater discharge rates and/or velocities from increasing flood
elevations and accelerating erosion at all downstream points in the
watershed.
B. A no-harm evaluation will be considered only in the following instances:
(1) In the Monongahela River Watershed: only in instances where the
discharge to a stream channel from the development site occurs
directly to the Monongahela River, to an adequately sized storm or
combined sewer which discharges directly into the Monongahela
River, or through a properly sized and designed regional
stormwater detention facility.
C. The analysis for the no-harm evaluation shall be submitted to the
Municipal Engineer and the Allegheny County Planning Department for
review and approval.
D. The no-harm evaluation shall be prepared by a registered engineer who
is experienced in hydrology and hydraulics. The no-harm evaluation
analysis shall be completed using the following procedure.
E. The analysis shall be completed using an approved calculation
methodology in the following manner:
§ 142-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-67
1:413
§ 142-68. Design criteria for stormwater management controls.
(1) Develop the runoff hydrograph(s) for the design storms of the site
and areas tributary to it using the approved methodology for predevelopment
conditions using the land use characterizations
contained in the Monongahela River Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan.
(2) Develop the post-development discharge hydrograph from the
proposed site using the approved methodology.
(3) Subtract the runoff hydrograph ordinates under pre-development
conditions (Step 1) from the discharge hydrograph ordinates (Step
2), maintaining the time scales of both hydrographs for one-to-one
correspondence.
(4) Obtain the hydraulic model for the existing conditions for the
Monongahela River Watershed from the county.
(5) Locate the subbasin(s) in which the proposed development is
located and into which the discharge hydrograph enters. If more
than one subbasin receives this incremental flow, divide the flow
accordingly.
(6) Add the incremental increase computed in Step 3 to the runoff
hydrograph of the subbasin(s) identified in Step 5.
(7) Route the adjusted runoff hydrograph through the Monongahela
River Watershed Model and note any increase in peak flows which
would occur in downstream subbasins. If no increase is noted, then
the no-harm has been demonstrated. If no increase is observed in
peak flows, the increased potential for erosion and/or
sedimentation in downstream channels resulting from any change
in the flood hydrograph predicted by the model shall be evaluated.
If no increased potential can be demonstrated by appropriated
technical means, then the "No-Harm" exemption may be requested.
(8) If an increase in peak flow is observed in any of the downstream
subbasins or increased potential for erosion and/or sedimentation
is indicated, the no-harm exemption shall not be granted.
A. General design guidelines.
(1) Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or combinations of
techniques, as provided in this Part 2, Stormwater Management
Ordinance, which are most suitable to the level of stormwater
runoff control required, the type of development, and the natural
features of the site. Cost of maintenance shall be one of the
considerations in the designs selected. All controls are subject to
the approval of the Borough Engineer. The Engineer may request
specific information on design and/or operating features of the
§ 142-67 BALDWIN CODE § 142-68
1:414
proposed stormwater controls in order to determine their
suitability and adequacy in terms of the standards of this Part 2.
(2) In selecting and designing stormwater management systems and
controls, applicants may be guided by the following references:
(a) Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, Technical Release No.
55, USDA, Soil Conservation Service, June 1986 (or most
recent edition).

(3) The applicant should consider the effect on the proposed
stormwater management techniques of any special soil conditions
or geological hazards which may exist on the development site. In
the event such conditions are identified on the development site,
the Borough may require in-depth studies by a competent
geotechnical engineer.
(4) In developing a stormwater management plan for a particular site,
stormwater controls shall be selected according to the following
preference:
(a) Infiltration of runoff on site.
(b) Stormwater detention/retention facilities.
(5) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce peak runoff and promote groundwater recharge. A
combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the
applicable minimum control requirements. Justification shall be
provided by the applicant for rejecting each of the preferred
practices based on actual site conditions.
§ 142-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-68
1:415
B. Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
(1) If detention facility(ies) are utilized for the development site, the
facility(ies) shall be designed such that post-development peak
runoff rates from the developed site are controlled to those rates
defined by the subarea release rate percentage for the one-, two-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year storm frequencies.
(2) All detention facilities shall be equipped with outlet structures to
provide discharge control for the four designated storm
frequencies. Provisions shall also be made to safely pass the postdevelopment
one-hundred-year storm runoff in the event of an
outlet structure failure without damaging or impairing the
continued function of the facilities (i.e., impairing the continued
function of the facilities). The facility(ies) must have an emergency
outlet which is able to discharge the post-development onehundred-
year peak flow. Should any stormwater management
facilities qualify as a dam under PaDEP Chapter 105 criteria, the
facility shall be designed in accordance with those regulations and
meet the regulations concerning dam safety.
(3) Shared-storage facilities which provide detention of runoff for more
than one development site may be considered within a single
subarea. Such facilities shall meet the design criteria contained in
this section. In addition, runoff from the development sites involved
shall be conveyed to the facility in a manner so as to avoid adverse
impacts, such as flooding or erosion, to channels and properties
located between the development site and the shared-storage
facilities.
(4) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple-use facilities
such as lakes, ballfields or similar recreational uses, shall be
considered first as storage facilities wherever feasible, subject to
the approval of the Borough and Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection Chapter 105 Regulations.
(5) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the design
of the detention facilities include the following:
(a) Inflow and outflow structures should be designed and installed
to prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundment-type
structures must be protected from soil erosion. All outlet
velocities must be calculated and submitted. If riprap is used,
the sizing calculations must be submitted.
(b) Control and removal of debris both in the storage structure and
in all inlet or outlet devices must be a design consideration.
Trash racks on the outlet structures are required to minimize
debris that enters the structure.
§ 142-68 BALDWIN CODE § 142-68
1:416
(c) Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations and other
structures should be protected and designed to minimize
safety hazards.
(d) The interior slope of a detention/retention basin shall be 3:1
(horizontal to vertical). The water depth at the perimeter of a
storage pond should be limited to that which is safe for
children. This is especially necessary if bank slopes are steep
or if ponds are full and recirculating in dry periods. Restriction
of access (fences, walls, etc.) may be necessary depending on
the location of the facility.
(e) Detention/retention basins shall require a supporting report
from a geotechnical engineer including design
recommendations for embankment construction, interior and
exterior slopes, drainage swales and infiltration areas, and
shall be constructed under the supervision of the geotechnical
engineer.
(f) Landscaping must be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area. Landscaping of the
pond embankment shall not be permitted.
(g) Facility must be accessible for maintenance purposes,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will be
required. A maintenance schedule must be submitted and
approved by the Borough.
(h) Details of the facility must be shown on the plan.
(i) A riprap channel with underdrain for low flows must be sized
properly and provided within the pond.
(j) If an underground facility (i.e., tank, sump) is proposed, a
cleanout manhole with steps must be provided.
(k) An emergency spillway must be provided for all detention/
retention facilities. For aboveground basins, the spills must be
sized to pass the entire one-hundred-year post-development
storm with one foot of freeboard.
(l) Outlet control structures shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete (cast-in-place, precast or block) and provided with
trash racks approved by the Borough.
(m) All impoundment areas shall be adequately underdrained to
prevent long-term ponding of water.
(n) All detention facilities shall be provided with an access road
(with a legal easement) for maintenance purposes. Such roads
shall be minimum of 10 feet wide, have a maximum grade of
15% and be of a stone or impervious surface.
§ 142-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-68
1:417
(o) All pond outlet structures shall have suitable gaskets to
prevent leakage and piping of water through the pond
embankment. All storm pipe installed through the pond
embankment must be constructed of reinforced concrete pipe.
(p) An as-built drawing shall be required for each stormwater
detention facility constructed. (The drawing shall represent
the volume of the facility and the stage-storage relationship.)
The drawing shall be stamped by a registered professional
engineer and submitted to the Borough within 60 days of the
completion of the facility. No facility will be accepted until this
requirement has been fulfilled.
(q) The exterior slope of a detention/retention pond shall not
exceed three horizontal to one vertical.
(r) Normally dry, open-top, storage BMPs should drain in 24 hours
to 72 hours.
(s) Infiltration BMPs should be spread out and shallow as much as
practicable.
C. Criteria for collection/conveyance facilities. All stormwater runoff
collection or conveyance facilities, whether storm sewers or other open
or closed channels, shall be designed in accordance with the following
basic standards:
(1) All sites shall be graded to provide drainage away from and around
the structure in order to prevent any potential flooding damage.
(2) Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof and french
drains to the storm sewer in the street or to the gutter line of the
street if no sewer exists. Low side lots shall extend roof and french
drains to a stormwater collection/conveyance system or natural
watercourse in accordance with the approved stormwater
management plan for the development site.
(3) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel and
close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid the
possibility of causing the embankment to fail.
(4) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey the
twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet or
natural watercourse. Off site conveyance shall be provided with
easements to an existing storm sewer system or natural
watercourse.
(5) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall be
suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed to avoid excessive
velocities. Calculations must be presented for the velocities and it
must be shown that the proposed surface for the swale is adequate.
§ 142-68 BALDWIN CODE § 142-68
1:418
(6) Wherever storm sewers are proposed to be utilized, they must
comply with the following criteria:
(a) Designed to traverse under seeded and planted areas. If
constructed within 10 feet of the road paving, walks or other
surfaced areas, the drains shall have a narrow trench, and
maximum compaction of backfill to prevent settlement of the
superimposed surface or development.
(b) Installed after excavating and filling in the area to be traversed
is completed, unless the drain is installed in the original
ground with a minimum of three feet cover and/or adequate
protection during the fill construction.
(c) Designed with cradle when traversing fill areas of
indeterminate stability; designed with anchors when gradient
exceeds 20%, and designed with encasement or special backfill
requirements when traversing under a paved area.
(d) Designed to adequately handle the anticipated stormwater
flow and to be constructed and maintained economically. The
minimum pipe size shall be 15 inches in diameter.
(e) Drain pipe, trenching, bedding and backfilling requirements
shall conform to the requirements of the Borough and/or
applicable requirements of the Borough and/or applicable
requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation Specifications, Publication 408, latest edition.
(f) All pipe shall be made of either PVC, corrugated plastic pipe,
corrugated plastic pipe with smooth interior walls, corrugated
metal/steel or reinforced concrete. All corrugated metal pipe
shall be polymer coated, with bonding and paved inverts where
prone to erode. Pipe under a borough cartway shall be
reinforced concrete pipe with a minimum diameter of 15
inches.
(g) Storm inlets and structures shall be designed to be adequate,
safe, self-cleaning and unobtrusive and shall be consistent with
the standards of the Borough.
(h) Appropriate grates shall be designed for all catch basins,
stormwater inlets and other entrance appurtenances in
accordance with borough specifications.
(i) Manholes shall be designed so that the top shall be at finished
grade and sloped to conform to slope of finished grade. Top
castings of structures located in roads or parking areas shall
be machined or installed to preclude rattling.
(j) Where a proposed storm sewer connects with an existing
storm sewer system, the applicant shall demonstrate that

§ 142-69. Erosion and sedimentation controls.
Proposed erosion and sedimentation pollution control measures should be
submitted with the stormwater management plan. These plans shall follow
the guidelines set forth in the Borough's current Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Ordinance under a separate cover. In addition, the plan
shall be prepared in accordance with the Pennsylvania Erosion/
Sedimentation Regulations (25 Pa. Code, Chapter 102) and the standards
and guidelines of the county conservation district.
§ 142-70. As-built drawings.
Prior to releasing the final bond moneys, the Borough shall receive an asbuilt
drawing, signed and scaled by a registered surveyor, and these plans
shall include the following:
sufficient capacity exists in the downstream system to handle
the additional stormwater flow.
(k) Storm sewer outfalls shall be equipped with energy dissipation
to prevent erosion and conform with applicable requirements
of the PaDEP for stream encroachments (Chapter 105 of the
Department's Rules and Regulations).
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
B. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92,122 a DEP "NPDES
Construction Activities" permit is required for Regulated Earth
Disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or county
conservation district must be provided to the municipality. The issuance
of an NPDES construction permit (or permit coverage under the
statewide General Permit (PAG-2) satisfies the requirements Subsection
C.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required,
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project

ARTICLE XVI
Completion of Facilities and Maintenance
§ 142-71. Maintenance responsibilities.
§ 142-72. Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater
facilities.
A. The stormwater management plan for the development site shall
establish responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance
of all proposed stormwater control facilities. The proposed
maintenance plan should be consistent with the general maintenance
policies stated in this Part 2, the Borough Stormwater Management
Ordinance, and also consistent with the following principles:
(1) If a development consists of structures or lots which are to be
separately owned and in which streets, sewers and other public
improvements are to be dedicated to the Borough, stormwater
control facilities should also be dedicated to and maintained by the
Borough.
(2) If a development site is to be maintained in single ownership or if
sewers and other public improvements are to be privately owned
and maintained, then the ownership and maintenance of
stormwater control facilities should be the responsibility of the
owner or private management entity.
B. The Borough Council shall make the final determination on the
continuing maintenance responsibilities as part of the final application
review based on the recommendation of the Planning Commission. The
Council reserves the right to accept or reject the ownership and
operating responsibility of any or all of the stormwater management
controls.
C. A security deposit in the sum of $5,000 cash or certified check shall be
delivered to the Borough and held by it pending the completion of the
stormwater management facilities to ensure the final completion of the
site plan development. In the event that the Borough Engineer shall
determine that the aforementioned sum of $5,000 may be insufficient
because of the nature and size of the development, the Borough
Engineer shall submit a proposal to the developer of the amount which
the Engineer believes to be necessary for completion. In the event that
the developer disagrees with the amount so proposed by the Borough
Engineer, a third engineer may be retained to mediate the proposal and
establish the amount required to be deposited which will ensure
completion of the facilities. The cost incurred by retaining a mediator
shall be billed to the developer.
A. Prior to final approval of the site's stormwater management plan, the
property owner shall prepare and submit to the Borough Secretary a
stormwater management agreement which will be referred to the
§ 142-71 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-72
1:423
§ 142-73. Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund.
Borough Engineer and to the Borough Solicitor for approval. In the
event that the agreement shall be approved, it shall be submitted to
the Recorder of Deeds for recording and shall be binding upon all
successor owners or developers of the premises. The fees for recording
the agreement shall be at the cost of the developer. The agreement shall
stipulate that:
(1) The owner shall maintain all facilities in accordance with the
approved maintenance schedule and shall keep all facilities
maintained in a safe and attractive manner.
(2) The owner shall convey to the Borough easements and/or rights-ofway
to assure access for periodic inspections by the Borough and
maintenance if required.
(3) The owner shall keep on file with the Borough the name, address
and telephone number of the person or company responsible for
maintenance activities; in the event of a change, new information
will be submitted to the Borough within 10 days of the change.
(4) The owner shall establish any special maintenance funds or other
financing sources, in accordance with the approved maintenance
plan.
(5) If the owner fails to maintain the stormwater control facilities,
following due notice by the Borough to correct the problems, the
Borough shall perform the necessary maintenance or corrective
work. The owner shall reimburse the Borough for all costs or a lien
shall be placed on the property.
B. The Borough may require other items to be included in the agreement
where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance
of all facilities. The maintenance agreement shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Borough Solicitor.
A. Persons installing stormwater storage facilities shall be required to pay
a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater Maintenance Fund to
help defray the costs of periodic inspections and maintenance
expenses. The amount of the deposit shall be determined as follows:
(1) If the storage facility is to be privately owned and maintained, the
deposit shall cover the cost of periodic inspections performed by
the Borough for a period of 10 years as estimated by the Borough
Engineer. After that period of time, inspections will be performed at
the expense of the municipality.
(2) If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
Borough, the deposit shall cover 100% of the estimated costs for
maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The Borough Engineer
§ 142-72 BALDWIN CODE § 142-73
1:424
§ 142-74. Financial guaranties and dedication of public
improvements.
will establish the estimated costs utilizing information submitted by
the applicant.
(3) The amount of deposit to the fund shall be converted to present
worth of the annual series values. The Borough Engineer shall
determine the present worth equivalents which shall be subject to
the approval of the Borough Council.
B. If the storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation facility
(e.g., ballfield, lake), the Borough may reduce or waive the amount of
the maintenance fund deposit based upon the value of the land for
public recreation purposes.
C. If in the future, a storage facility (whether publicly or privately owned)
is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or other storage
facility, the unused portion of the maintenance fund deposit will be
applied to the cost of abandoning the facility and connecting to the
storm sewer system or other facility. Any amount of the deposit
remaining after the costs of abandonment are paid will be returned to
the depositor.
A. Guaranty of completion. A completion guarantee in the form of a bond,
cash deposit, certified check or other negotiable securities acceptable
to the Borough shall be filed. The guarantee shall cover all streets,
sanitary sewers, stormwater management facilities, water systems, fire
hydrants, sidewalks and other required improvements, it shall be in the
amount and form prescribed by the Municipal Planning Code (Section
509).123
B. Release of completion guarantee. The procedures for requesting and
obtaining a release of the completion guarantee shall be in a manner
prescribed by the Municipalities Planning Code (Section 510).124
C. Default of completion guaranty. If improvements are not installed in
accordance with the approved final plan, the governing body may
enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections
to all the improvements covered by said security, the governing body
may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the
development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to
recover the moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the
improvements. All proceeds, whether resulting from the security or
from any legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or
123. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10509.
124. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10510.
§ 142-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 142-74
1:425
both, shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such security and not for any other municipal purpose.
D. Dedication of public improvements.
(1) When streets, sanitary sewers, stormwater management facilities,
waterlines or other required improvements in the development
have been completed in accordance with the final approved plan,
such improvements shall be deemed private until such time as they
have been offered for dedication to the municipality and accepted
by separate ordinance or resolution or until they have been
condemned for use as a public facility.
(2) Prior to acceptance of any improvements or facilities, the Borough
Engineer shall inspect it to ensure that it is constructed in
accordance with the approved plan and is functioning properly. In
the case of any stormwater control facility, it must be free of
sediment and debris.
(3) The owner shall submit as-built plans for all facilities proposed for
dedication.

A. The Borough Engineer or a designated representative shall inspect the
construction of the temporary and permanent stormwater management
controls for the development site. The permittee shall notify the
Borough Engineer 48 hours in advance of the completion of the
following key development phases:
(1) At the completion of preliminary site preparation, including
stripping of vegetation, stock piling of topsoil and construction of
temporary stormwater management and erosion control facilities.
(2) At the completion of rough grading, but prior to placing topsoil,
permanent drainage or other site development improvements and
ground covers.
(3) During construction of the permanent stormwater facilities at such
times as specified by the Borough Engineer.
(4) Completion of permanent stormwater management facilities,
including established ground covers and plantings.
(5) Completion of any final grading, vegetative control measures or
other site restoration work done in accordance with the approved

C. If during construction, the contractor or permittee identifies any site
conditions such as subsurface drainage, which could affect the
feasibility of the approved stormwater facilities, he must notify the
Borough Engineer within 24 hours of the discovery of such condition
and request a field inspection. The Borough Engineer shall determine if
the condition requires a stormwater modification.
D. In cases where stormwater facilities are to be installed in areas of
landslide-prone soils of if other special site conditions exist, the
Borough may require special precautions such as soil tests and core
borings, full-time resident inspectors and/or similar measures. All costs
of any such measures shall be borne by the permittee, developer and/or
landowner.
E. Inspection of all stormwater management BMP's shall be undertaken by
a minimum of two persons at least two times per year, on or before
March 1 and October 1, or after runoff events in excess of one inch of

For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and assessed,
commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging in an
occupation with a primary place of employment within the Borough of
Baldwin during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such
privilege for any length of time during any tax year shall pay the tax for
that year in the amount of $52, assessed on a pro rata basis, in accordance
with the provisions of this article. This tax may be used solely for the
following purposes as the same may be allocated by the Borough Council
from time to time: 1) emergency services, which shall include emergency
medical services, police services and/or fire services; 2) road construction
and/or maintenance; 3) reduction of property taxes; or 4) property tax
relief through implementation of a homestead and farmstead exclusion
in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 85, Subch. F (relating to homestead
property exclusion). The political subdivision shall use no less than 25%
of the funds derived from the tax for emergency services. This tax is in
addition to all other taxes of any kind or nature heretofore levied by the
political subdivision. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person
for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions
within which a person may be employed.
§ 146-22. Exemptions and refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.
(2) Any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the
armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve
component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps
Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air
Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
§ 146-21 BALDWIN CODE § 146-22
1:450
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy
of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the
tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

§ 146-23. Duty of employers to collect.
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Council, in consultation with the Collector and
the DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund
claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption,
which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the general
municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on
overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75
days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the
last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject
to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough Council or the
Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds
to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period, shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
§ 146-22 BALDWIN CODE § 146-23
1:452
§ 146-24. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file a return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 146-25. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 146-26. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which
the person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 146-22B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 146-23 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 146-27
1:453
§ 146-27. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.

occupation or employed in more than one political subdivision:
§ 146-28. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 146-29. Administration of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period,
the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the
following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or
her principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of a dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment
constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine
and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce
the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted before the District Judge
and against any person in charge of the business of any employer who shall
have failed or who refuses to file a return required by this article.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights under Act 50 of
1998132 or under specific appeal processes set forth by the political
subdivision.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for
recovery of any such tax clue or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of such
tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery of
this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

A. Interpretation.
(1) Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on
any occupation not within the taxing power of the political
subdivision under the Constitution of the United States and the
laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(2) If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of
the Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of
the court shall not affect or impair the right to impose or collect
said tax or the validity of the tax so imposed on other persons or
individuals as herein provided.
B. Except as set forth hereafter, all ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed. Nothing herein shall be
construed to repeal the imposition and collection of an occupation
privilege tax, plus applicable penalties and interest, for calendar year
2005 and all prior calendar years, or of an emergency and municipal
services tax, plus all applicable penalties and interest, for the calendar
years 2006 and 2007, as the same exist prior to this amendment.

ARTICLE III
Parking Regulations; Residential Private Property
[Added 4-19-2016 by Ord. No. 870]
§ 154-17. Preamble; purpose; intent.
The indiscriminate parking of motor vehicles on residential lawn areas
and outside of off-street parking areas which were specifically built and
designed for the parking of motor vehicles has many deleterious effects
on the community. These include the destroying of lawn areas, resulting
in creating dirt, mud and other debris on private and public property.
Not only do these deleterious conditions lower the value of individual
properties, thereby causing an overall lowering of all property value in
the neighborhoods, but also mud, dirt and other debris are scattered and
spread onto public streets by motor vehicles so parked when those vehicles
leave the premises. Therefore, in order to stop the scattering of these
materials, which have a deleterious effect on the public streets and the
community as a whole, the Borough hereby declares that the parking of
motor vehicles on residential private property outside of off-street parking
areas is a public nuisance and prohibits the same.
§ 154-18. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DRIVER  A person who drives or is in actual physical control of vehicle.
LAWN AREAS  The areas on a residential property not specifically
designed for the parking of motor vehicles. Areas specifically designed
for the parking of motor vehicles are hard surfaced driveways or pads
constructed of concrete, asphalt, brick, gravel with barriers or permanent
curbing, and the like.
MOTOR VEHICLE  A vehicle which is self-propelled including, but not
limited to, automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, scooters, motor bikes and
recreational vehicles, except one which is propelled solely by human power
or any vehicle which is designed for the conveyance of one handicapped
person.
OFF-STREET PARKING  The halting of a motor vehicle in any area beyond
the street right-of-way, whether occupied or not, except momentarily for the
purpose of and while actually engaged in loading or unloading property or
passengers.
OFF-STREET PARKING AREA  An area or structure located beyond the
street right-of-way, which is designed to be used for parking motor vehicles.
OWNER  Any person, operator, firm or corporation having a legal or
equitable interest in the property; or recorded in the official records of the
municipality as holding title to the property; or otherwise having control of
the property, including the guardian of the estate of any such person, and
§ 154-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 154-18
1:481
the executor or administrator of the estate of such person if ordered to take
possession of real property by a court.
VEHICLE  Every device in, upon or by which any person or property is or
may be transported or drawn upon a highway.
§ 154-19. Parking prohibited.
Off-street parking of motor vehicles is expressly prohibited on lawn or
landscaped areas located in residential districts.
§ 154-20. Responsibility of owners/drivers.
The owner and/or driver shall be responsible for complying with the
provisions of § 154-19 of this chapter.
§ 154-21. Notice of field violations.
§ 154-22. Penalties.
On neglect or refusal of the owner and/or driver to comply with the
provisions of this article, he, she or they shall, upon conviction of such
default, neglect, failure or refusal, pay a fine of not less than $50 and not
more than $500, plus costs of prosecution, and in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to undergo imprisonment for not more than five days. The
continuation or reoccurrence of the violation of this article after a period
of 24 hours shall constitute a new and separate offense for each successive
additional twenty-four-hour period.
A. Upon the discovery of any violation under the terms of this Ordinance,
the Borough, through its authorized agents, is authorized to give notice
to the owner and/or driver of a violation either by personal delivery to
such owner and/or driver, by United States mail directed to the last
known address of such owner and/or driver or by leaving the same on
the vehicle which is parked in violation of this article.
B. If such owner and/or driver, within seven days after delivery, mailing or
leaving of such notice, pays to the Borough the sum of $25 for the
violation, the same will constitute full satisfaction for the violation
noted in said notice.
C. Each day that a violation exists shall constitute a separate violation. The
failure of such owner and/or driver to make payment, as aforesaid, with
seven days shall render such owner and/or driver subject to the
penalties as provided herein.
D. If such owner shall, in fact, make payment after such seven-day period
but before the filing of a complaint with the District Magistrate on
account of such violation, the sum of $35 shall be in full satisfaction of
such violation.

individual person, association, partnership or corporation, registered with
the Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or similar
department of any other state or territory or with any department of the
United States or other nation, is the party guilty of the violation and is

contrary is presented; however, this provision shall not apply to those
persons, partnerships, associations or corporations who hold title to a
vehicle solely as security under finance purchase agreements or as security
for loans, and in such cases, the Department of Police shall presume that
the party having control and custody of the vehicle under the finance or loan
agreement is the party guilty of the violation and is subject to the penalties

§ 168-130. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Zoning Ordinance of
the Borough of Baldwin, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania."
§ 168-140. Intent.
The Borough Council adopted "Baldwin Borough Plans: One Vision, One
Baldwin," an update to the Borough Comprehensive Plan (hereinafter
"Comprehensive Plan") on April 21, 2015. The zoning regulations and
zoning districts set forth in this chapter are made in accordance with the
Comprehensive Plan of the Borough of Baldwin for the general welfare
of the Borough residents and are intended to achieve, among others, the
following purposes: to secure safety from fire and other dangers, to provide
adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of the land and avoid
undue concentrations of population, to facilitate adequate provisions for
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public
requirements, as well as the conservation of the value of land and buildings.
These land use regulations were made with reasonable consideration,
among other things, of the existing character of the various areas and
neighborhoods within the Borough, their respective suitability for particular
land uses and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout Baldwin Borough.
Furthermore, the districts established in this regulation are intended to
achieve the following:
A. To provide sufficient space, appropriately located for residential
development to meet the housing needs of the present and expected
future population of the Borough within the range of house types and
densities anticipated.
B. To assure light, air and privacy, as far as possible, by controlling the
spacing and height of buildings and other structures.
C. To protect residential areas against hazards of fire, offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, odors, glare or other objectionable influences.
D. To prevent congestion, as far as possible, by regulating the density of
population and the bulk of buildings, and by providing for sufficient offstreet
parking.
E. To protect residential neighborhoods, as far as possible, from heavy or
through traffic.
F. To make possible provisions of those public and private educational,
recreational, health and similar facilities serving the needs of nearby
residents, which perform most effectively in a residential environment
and do not create objectionable influences.

buildings and to protect the Borough tax revenues.

existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter are contained
specifically in the Comprehensive Plan adopted by Borough Council on

Secretary of the Borough of Baldwin and was adopted for the purposes
of ascertaining future land use, densities of population, location and
function of streets, community facilities and utilities. The community

land which is not in conformity with the regulations for the district in
which it is located shall be deemed as nonconforming and subject to the
regulations of this chapter.
A. In interpreting the language of this chapter to determine the extent of a
restriction upon the use of property, the language shall be interpreted,
where doubt exists as to the intended meaning of the language written
and enacted by the governing body, in favor of the property owner and
against any implied extension of the restriction.
B. The interpretation of the regulations of this chapter is intended to be
such that, whenever these requirements are at variance with any other
lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or
covenants, as particularly refer to area and bulk regulations and impose
higher standards, the most restrictive requirement shall govern.

A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to create an airport district
overlay that considers safety issues around the Allegheny County
Airport, regulates and restricts the heights of constructed structures
and objects of natural growth, creates appropriate zones, establishing
the boundaries thereof and providing for changes in the restrictions
and boundaries of such zones, creates the permitting process for uses
within said zones and provides for enforcement, assessment of violation
penalties, an appeals process, and judicial review.
B. Relation to other zone districts. The Airport District Overlay shall not
modify the boundaries of any underlying zoning district. Where
identified, the Airport District Overlay shall impose certain
requirements on land use and construction in addition to those
contained in the underlying zoning district.
C. Establishment of airport zones. There are hereby created and
established certain zones within the Airport District Overlay Ordinance,
defined in this chapter depicted on Figure 1 and illustrated on the
Allegheny County Airport (AGC) Hazard Area Map (Drawing 6 of 14 of
the AGC Airport Master Plan, as amended) (Figure 1 and Drawing 6 of
14 of the AGC Airport Master Plan are on file in the Borough offices), all
hereby adopted as part of this article, which include:
(1) Approach surface zone.
(2) Conical surface zone.
(3) Horizontal surface zone.
(4) Primary surface zone.
(5) Transitional surface zone.
D. Permit applications.
§ 168-380 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-390
1:529
(1) As regulated by Act 164 and defined by 14 CFR § 77.13(a) (as
amended or replaced), any person who plans to erect a new
structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect and maintain
any object (natural or man-made) in the vicinity of the airport, shall
first notify the Department's Bureau of Aviation (BOA) by
submitting PennDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of
the proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The
Department's BOA response must be included with this permit
application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's
BOA returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the
permit request should be considered in compliance with the intent
of this overlay ordinance. If the Department's BOA returns a
determination of a penetration of airspace, the permit shall be
denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance from such
regulations as outlined in this chapter.
(2) No permit is required to make maintenance repairs or to replace
parts of existing structures which do not enlarge or increase the
height of an existing structure.
E. Variance.
(1) Any request for a variance shall include documentation in
compliance with 14 CFR Part 77 Subpart B (FAA Form 7460-1, as
amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a
variance will depend on the determinations made by the FAA and
the Department's BOA as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of
navigable airspace. In particular, the request for a variance shall
consider which of the following categories the FAA has placed the
proposed construction in:
(a) No objection. The subject construction is determined not to
exceed obstruction standards and marking/lighting is not
required to mitigate potential hazard. Under this
determination a variance shall be granted.
(b) Conditional determination. The proposed construction/
alteration is determined to create some level of encroachment
into an airport hazard area which can be effectively mitigated.
Under this determination, a variance shall be granted
contingent upon implementation of mitigating measures as
described in § 168-390H, Obstruction marking and lighting.
(c) Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is
determined to be a hazard and is thus objectionable. A
variance shall be denied, and the reasons for this
determination shall be outlined to the applicant. Such requests
for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result
in unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be
§ 168-390 BALDWIN CODE § 168-390
1:530
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to
air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in
accordance with the intent of this article.
(2) Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found
that a literal application or the enforcement of the regulations will
result in unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not be
contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air
navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance
with the intent of this chapter.
F. Use restrictions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article,
no use shall be made of land or water within the Airport District Overlay
in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational
signals or radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make
it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others,
impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards
or otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or
maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the Allegheny County Airport.
G. Preexisting nonconforming uses. The regulations prescribed by this
article shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the
regulations as of the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere
with the continuance of a nonconforming use. No nonconforming use
shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher so as to
increase the nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once
substantially abated (subject to the underlying zoning ordinance), may
only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
H. Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
pursuant to the provisions of this article may be conditioned according
to the process to require the owner of the structure or object of natural
growth in question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or
require the person requesting the permit or variance to install, operate
and maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure
both ground and air safety.
I. Violations and penalties. The enforcement and penalties regarding
violations of this article shall be the same as those set forth in this
chapter.
J. Appeals. All appeals from actions taken pursuant to this article shall be
the same as those set forth in this chapter.
K. Conflicting regulations. Where there exists a conflict between any of
the regulations or limitations prescribed in this article and any other
regulation applicable to the same area, the more stringent limitation or
requirement shall govern and prevail.
§ 168-390 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-3100

§ 168-3100. Municipally owned property.
This chapter shall not apply to property owned by Baldwin Borough in the
exercise of its municipal functions. The Borough will develop and control
property in accordance with existing charters and codes, and will have no
obligation to enforce the provisions of this chapter on itself.

as a permissible accessory use a microwave antenna for
satellite communication used or intended to be used for the
propagation or transmission of radio or electromagnetic
waves.

work, including individual home construction, all ground areas
disturbed must be reseeded, in accordance with PennDOT Form
408, Section 804, using Formula E for unimproved areas. No
disturbed area shall remain unseeded for more than six months.
W. Illumination and lighting standards.
(1) Purpose. To require and set minimum standards for outdoor
lighting to:
(a) Provide for and control lighting in outdoor public places where
public health, safety and welfare are potential concerns.
(b) Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of nonvehicular
light sources.
(c) Protect neighbors, the environment and the night sky from
nuisance glare and light trespass from improperly selected,
placed, aimed, applied, maintained or shielded light sources.
(d) Promote energy-efficient lighting design and operation.
(e) Protect and retain the intended visual character of the various
municipality venues.
(2) Applicability.
(a) All uses within the municipality where there is interior or
exterior lighting that creates a nuisance or hazard as viewed
from the outside, including, but not limited to, residential,
commercial, industrial, public and park/sports and institutional
uses, and sign, billboard, architectural and landscape lighting.
(b) The municipality may require lighting be incorporated for
other uses, applications and locations or may restrict lighting
in any of the above uses or applications when health, safety
and/or welfare are issues.
(c) The glare-control requirements herein contained apply to
lighting in all uses, applications and locations.
(d) Temporary seasonal decorative lighting is exempt from all but
the glare-control requirements of this section. Temporary
seasonal decorative lighting is defined as temporary electrical
power and lighting installations to be used for holiday
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:576
decorative lighting and similar purposes. Temporary
decorative lighting shall not be permitted, or exist, for a period
exceeding 60 days.
(e) Emergency lighting, as may be required by any public agency
while engaged in the performance of its duties, or for
illumination of the path of egress during an emergency as
described in NFPA 75 and NFPA 101, are exempt from the
requirements of this section.
(3) Criteria.
(a) Illumination levels. Lighting, where required by this section, or
otherwise required or allowed by the municipality or other
applicable jurisdiction, shall have illuminances, uniformities
and glare control in accordance with the recommended
practices of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America (IESNA), unless otherwise directed by the
municipality.
(b) Luminaire design.
[1] Luminaires shall be of a type and design appropriate to the
lighting application and shall be aesthetically acceptable
to the municipality.
[2] For the lighting of predominantly horizontal surfaces, such
as, but not limited to, parking areas, roadways, vehicular
and pedestrian passage areas, merchandising and storage
areas, automotive-fuel-dispensing facilities, automotive
sales areas, loading docks, culs-de-sac, active and passive
recreational areas, building entrances, sidewalks, bicycle
and pedestrian paths, and site entrances, luminaires shall
be aimed straight down and shall meet IESNA full-cutoff
criteria. Luminaires with an aggregate-rated lamp output
not exceeding 500 lumens, e.g., the rated output of a
standard no directional forty-watt incandescent or 10-watt
compact fluorescent lamp, are exempt from the
requirements of this subsection. In the case of decorative
street lighting, the municipality may approve the use of
luminaires that are fully shielded or comply with IESNA
cutoff criteria rather than full cutoff.
[3] For the lighting of predominantly nonhorizontal surfaces,
such as, but not limited to, facades, landscaping, signs,
billboards, fountains, displays and statuary, when their use
is specifically permitted by the municipality, luminaires
shall be shielded and shall be installed and aimed so as not
to project their output into the windows of neighboring
residences, adjacent uses, past the object being
illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway. Luminaires
with an aggregate-rated lamp output not exceeding 500
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-420
1:577
lumens, e.g., the rated output of a standard no directional
40-watt incandescent or 10-watt compact fluorescent
lamp, are exempt from the requirements of this
subsection.
(c) Control of glare.
[1] All lighting shall be aimed, located, designed, fitted and
maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or
pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely traverse
and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or
reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
[2] Directional luminaires, such as floodlights and spotlights,
when their use is specifically approved by the municipality,
shall be so shielded, installed and aimed that they do not
project their output into the windows of neighboring
residences, adjacent uses, past the object being
illuminated, skyward or onto a public roadway or
pedestrian way. Floodlights installed above grade on
residential properties, except when motion-sensor
actuated, shall not be aimed out more than 45° from
straight down. When a floodlight creates glare as viewed
from an adjacent residential property, the floodlight shall
be required to be re-aimed and/or fitted with a shielding
device to block the view of the glare source from that
property.
[3] Illumination for signs, billboards, building facades and/or
surrounding landscapes for decorative, advertising or
aesthetic purposes is prohibited between 11:00 p.m. and
dawn, except that such lighting situated on the premises
for a commercial establishment may remain illuminated
while the establishment is actually open for business and
until no more than 1/2 hour after closing. Such lighting
shall be automatically extinguished using a programmable
controller.
[4] "Barn lights," aka "dusk to dawn lights," when a source of
glare as viewed from an adjacent property, shall not be
permitted unless effectively shielded as viewed from that
property.
[5] The use of floodlights and wall-mounted luminaires (wall
packs) shall not be permitted to illuminate parking areas
unless it can be proven to the satisfaction of the
municipality that the employment of no other means is
possible.
[6] Parking facility and vehicular and pedestrian way lighting
(except for safety and security applications and all-night
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:578
business operations) for commercial, industrial and
institutional uses shall be automatically extinguished no
later than 1/2 hour after the close of business or facility
operation. When safety or security lighting is proposed for
after-hours illumination, it shall not be in excess of 25% of
the number of luminaires or illumination level required or
permitted for illumination during regular business hours.
When it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
municipality that an elevated security risk exists, e.g., a
history of relevant crime, an appropriate increase above
the 25% limit may be permitted.
[7] Luminaires shall be automatically controlled through the
use of a programmable controller with battery poweroutage
reset, which accommodates daily and weekly
variations in operating hours, annual time changes and
seasonable variations in hours of darkness. The use of
photocells is permitted when in combination with the
programmable controller to turn luminaires on at dusk and
also for all-night safety/security dusk-to-dawn luminaire
operation when such lighting is specifically approved by
the municipality. The use of motion detectors is permitted.
[8] Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the
primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control
shall be achieved primarily through the use of such means
as cutoff luminaires, shields and baffles, and appropriate
application of luminaire mounting height, wattage, aiming
angle and luminaire placement.
[9] The illumination projected from any use onto a residential
use shall at no time exceed 0.1 footcandle, measured lineof-
sight at any time and from any point on the receiving
residential property.
[10] The illumination projected from any property onto a
nonresidential use shall at no time exceed 1.0 initial
footcandle, measured line-of-sight from any point on the
receiving property.
[11] Except as permitted for certain recreational lighting and
permitted elsewhere in this subsection, luminaires shall
not be mounted in excess of 20 feet above finished grade of
the surface being illuminated. Luminaires not meeting fullcutoff
criteria, when their use is specifically allowed by the
municipality, shall not be mounted in excess of 16 feet
above finished grade (AFG). Mounting height shall be
defined as the distance from the finished grade to the
surface being illuminated to the optical center of the
luminaire. Where proposed parking lots consist of 100 or
more contiguous spaces, the municipality may, at its sole
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-420
1:579
discretion, based partially on mitigation of potential offsite
impacts, allow a luminaire mounting height not to
exceed 25 feet AFG. For recreational lighting maximum
mounting height requirements, refer to "recreational uses"
elsewhere in this section.
[12] Only the flags of the United States and the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania shall be permitted to be illuminated past
11:00 p.m. Flag lighting sources shall not exceed 7,000
aggregate lamp lumens per flagpole. The light source shall
have a beam spread no greater than necessary to
illuminate the flag and shall be shielded so that light
source (lamp and reflector) is not visible at normal viewing
angles.
[13] Under-canopy lighting for such applications as gas/service
stations, hotel/theater marquees, fast food/bank/drugstore
drive-ups and the like shall be accomplished using flat-lens
full-cutoff luminaires aimed straight down and shielded in
such a manner that the lowest opaque edge of the
luminaire shall be below the light source and its lightdirecting
surfaces at all lateral angles around the
luminaire. The average maintained illumination in the area
directly below the canopy shall not exceed 20 initial
footcandles, and the maximum shall not exceed 30 initial
footcandles.
(d) Installation.
[1] Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run
underground, not overhead, and shall be in accordance
with the National Electrical Code (NEC) and National Fire
Protection Association 70 (NFPA 70).
[2] Poles supporting luminaries for the illumination of parking
areas and located within the parking area or directly
behind parking spaces, or where they could be hit by
snowplows or wide-swinging vehicles, shall be suitably
protected by being placed a minimum of five feet outside
the paved area or tire stops, or placed on concrete
pedestals at least 30 inches high above the pavement,
shielded by steel bollards or protected by other
municipality-approved means.
[3] Pole-mounted luminaires for lighting horizontal tasks shall
be aimed straight down, and poles shall be plumb.
[4] Poles and brackets for supporting luminaires shall be
those specifically manufactured for that purpose and shall
be designed and rated for the luminaire and mounting
accessory weights and wind loads involved.
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:580
[5] Pole foundations shall be designed consistent with
manufacturer's wind load requirements and local soil
conditions involved.
(e) Maintenance. Luminaires and ancillary equipment shall be
maintained so as to always meet the requirements of this
section.
(f) Billboards and signs. The lighting of new, or the relighting of
existing, billboards and signs shall require a building permit,
which shall be granted when the municipality is satisfied that
excessive illumination, light pollution, glare and light trespass
have been adequately mitigated, and shall be subject to the
following requirements:
[1] Externally illuminated billboards and signs shall have
luminaires mounted at the top of the billboard or sign and
aimed downward. The luminaries shall be designed, fitted
and aimed to shield the lamp and its reflective surfaces
from off-site view and to place the light output onto, and
not beyond, the sign or billboard. Lighting shall be by
linear fluorescent unless it can be demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the municipality that such a mounting
arrangement is not possible. At no point on the face of the
sign or billboard, and at no time, shall the illumination
exceed 30 vertical footcandles during hours of darkness.
[2] Internally illuminated signs shall have a dark field and
light message. The aggregate output of the light sources
shall not exceed 500 initial lumens per square foot of sign
face per side.
[3] Channel letter signs shall have dimming capability to allow
adjustment of sign brightness to meet local ambient
conditions.
[4] The illumination of billboards shall be limited to
commercial and industrial districts, and the illumination of
billboards within 400 feet of a residential use shall not be
permitted.
[5] Off-premises billboards and signs shall be extinguished
automatically by a programmable controller, with
astronomical and daylight saving time control, and spring
or battery power-outage reset, by no later than 11:00 each
evening until dawn, except that signs for establishments
(not companies) that operate or remain open past 11:00
p.m. may remain on no later than 1/2 hour past the close of
the establishment.
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-420
1:581
[6] Rotating, traveling, pulsing, flashing or oscillating light
sources, lasers, beacons, searchlights or strobe lighting
shall not be permitted.
[7] LED billboard and sign lighting shall only be permitted in
commercial and industrial districts, shall be static, shall
not be allowed to operate between 11:00 p.m. and dawn
when located where visible from a residential district or
use, and shall not be located within 1,000 feet of an
approaching interchange or traffic-merging lanes. Except
for time-and-weather signs, the message shall not be
permitted to change more than once each hour. The LED
output shall be automatically reduced to a brightness level
that does not create glare during hours of darkness.
[8] The use of highly reflective signage that creates nuisance
glare or a safety hazard shall not be permitted.
(4) Residential development luminaire placement.
(a) For residential developments where lot sizes are, or average,
less than 20,000 square feet, if the municipality so directs,
street lighting shall be provided at:
[1] The intersection of public roads with entrance roads to the
proposed development.
[2] Intersections involving proposed public or nonpublic
major-thoroughfare roads within the proposed
development.
[3] The apex of the curve of any major-thoroughfare road,
public or nonpublic, within the proposed development,
having a radius of 300 feet or less.
[4] Cul-de-sac bulbs.
[5] Terminal ends of center median islands having concrete
structure curbing, trees and/or other fixed objects not
having breakaway design for speeds of 25 miles per hour
or greater.
[6] Defined pedestrian crossings located within the
development.
[7] Where lot sizes permit the parking of less than three
vehicles on the residential lot, thereby necessitating onstreet
parking.
[8] At other locations along the street as deemed necessary by
the municipality.
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:582
(b) In residential developments with lots of less than 20,000
square feet, where five or more common contiguous parking
spaces are proposed, such spaces shall be illuminated.
(c) In multifamily developments, common parking areas of four
spaces or greater shall be illuminated.
(5) Recreational uses. The nighttime illumination of outdoor
recreational facilities for such aerial sports as baseball, basketball,
soccer, tennis, track and field, and football typically necessitate
higher than normally allowed luminaire mounting heights and
aiming angles, utilize very-high-wattage lamps and potentially
produce unacceptable levels of light trespass and glare when
located near residential properties. Permission to illuminate such
facilities shall be granted only when the municipality is satisfied
that the health, safety and welfare rights of nearby property
owners and the municipality as a whole have been properly
protected. When recreational uses are specifically permitted by the
municipality for operation during hours of darkness, the following
requirements shall apply:
(a) Racetracks and such recreational venues as golf driving ranges
and trapshooting facilities that necessitate the horizontal or
near horizontal aiming of luminaires and projection of
illumination shall not be permitted to be artificially
illuminated.
(b) Sporting events shall be timed to end at such time that all
lighting in the sports facility, other than lighting for safe exit of
patrons and participants, shall be extinguished by 11:00 p.m.,
regardless of such occurrences as extra innings or overtimes.
(c) The municipality reserves the right to limit the number of
illuminated sporting events per week or season.
(d) Maximum mounting heights for recreational lighting shall be
in accordance with the following.
[1] Basketball: 20 feet.
[2] Football: 70 feet.
[3] Soccer: 70 feet.
[4] Lacrosse: 70 feet.
[5] Baseball:
[a] Two-hundred-foot radius: 60 feet.
[b] Three-hundred-foot radius: 70 feet.
[6] Miniature golf: 20 feet.
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-420
1:583
[7] Swimming pool aprons: 20 feet.
[8] Tennis: 20 feet.
[9] Track: 20 feet.
(e) To assist the municipality in determining whether the potential
impacts of proposed lighting have been suitably managed,
applications for illuminating recreational facilities shall be
accompanied not only with the information required under
Subsection U(6) below, but also by a visual impact plan that
contains the following:
[1] Plan views containing a layout of the recreational facility
and showing pole locations and the location of residences
on adjoining properties.
[2] Elevations containing pole and luminaire mounting
heights, horizontal and vertical aiming angles and
luminaire arrays for each pole location.
[3] Elevations containing initial vertical illuminance plots at
the boundary of the site, taken at a height of five feet lineof-
sight.
[4] Elevations containing initial vertical illuminance plots on
the windowed facades of all residences facing and
adjacent to the recreational facility. Such plots shall
demonstrate compliance with the light trespass and glare
control requirements of this section.
[5] Proposed frequency of use of the facility during hours of
darkness on a month-by-month basis and proposed time
when the sports lighting will be extinguished.
[6] A narrative describing the measures proposed to achieve
minimum off-site disturbance.
(6) Plan submission. Where site lighting is required by this section, is
otherwise required by the municipality, or is proposed by the
applicant, lighting plans shall be submitted for municipality review
and approval for subdivision and land development, conditional
use, variance, building permit and special exception applications.
The submitted information shall include the following:
(a) A plan or plans of the site, complete with all structures,
parking spaces, building entrances, traffic areas (both
vehicular and pedestrian), existing and proposed trees, and
adjacent uses that might be adversely impacted by the lighting.
The lighting plan shall contain a layout of all proposed and
existing luminaires, including, but not limited to, area,
architectural, building entrance, canopy, soffit, landscape, flag,
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:584
sign, etc., by location, orientation, aiming direction, mounting
height, lamp, photometry and type.
(b) A ten-foot-by-ten-foot illuminance grid (point-by-point) plot of
maintained horizontal footcandles overlaid on the site plan,
plotted out to 0.0 footcandles, which demonstrates compliance
with the light trespass, illuminance and uniformity
requirements as set forth in this section or as otherwise
required by the municipality. When the scale of the plan, as
judged by the municipality, makes a ten-foot-by-ten-foot grid
plot illegible, a more legible grid spacing may be permitted.
(c) Light-loss factors, IES candela test-filename, initial lamplumen
ratings and specific lamp manufacturer's lamp ordering
nomenclature used in calculating the plotted luminance levels.
(d) Description of the proposed equipment, including luminaire
catalog cuts, photometries, glare-reduction devices, lamps, on/
off control devices, mounting heights, pole foundation details,
pole protection means and mounting methods.
(e) Landscaping plans shall contain luminaire locations,
demonstrating that the site lighting and landscaping have been
coordinated to minimize conflict between vegetation and
intended light distribution, both initially and at vegetation
maturity.
(f) When requested by the municipality, applicant shall also
submit a visual-impact plan that demonstrates appropriate
steps have been taken to mitigate potential consequences of
on-site and off-site glare and to retain the intended character
of the municipality. This plan may require the inclusion of
initial vertical footcandle values at specific off-site venues, e.g.,
bedroom windows of adjacent residential uses.
(g) Plan notes. The following notes shall appear on the lighting
plan:
[1] Post-approval alterations to lighting plans or intended
substitutions for specified lighting equipment on the
approved plan shall be submitted to the municipality for
review and approval prior to installation. Requests for
substitutions shall be accompanied by catalog cuts of the
proposed equipment that demonstrate the proposed
substitution is equal to or exceeds the optical quality and
maintainability of the specified luminaires and
accompanied by a lighting plan, including a point-by-point
plot, which demonstrates that proposed substitutions will
result in a lighting design that equals or exceeds the
quality of the approved plan.
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-420
1:585
[2] The municipality reserves the right to conduct postinstallation
inspections to verify compliance with the
section requirements and approved lighting plan
commitments and, if deemed appropriate by the
municipality, to require remedial action at no expense to
the municipality.
[3] All exterior lighting, including building-mounted lighting,
shall meet IESNA full-cutoff criteria unless otherwise
specifically approved by the municipality.
[4] Installer shall notify municipality to arrange for inspection
and approval of all exterior lighting, including buildingmounted
lighting, prior to its installation.
(7) Compliance monitoring.
(a) Safety hazards.
[1] If the municipality judges a lighting installation creates a
safety hazard, the person(s) responsible for the lighting
shall be notified and required to take remedial action.
[2] If appropriate corrective action has not been effected
within 15 days of notification, the municipality may take
appropriate legal action.
(b) Nuisance glare and inadequate illumination levels.
[1] When the municipality judges an installation produces
unacceptable levels of nuisance glare, skyward light,
excessive or insufficient illumination levels or otherwise
varies from this section, the municipality may cause
notification of the person(s) responsible for the lighting
and require appropriate remedial action.
[2] If the infraction so warrants, the municipality may act to
have the problem corrected as in Subsection U(6)(g)[2]
above.
(8) Nonconforming lighting.
(a) Any luminaire or lighting installation existing on the effective
date of this section that does not conform with the
requirements of this section shall be considered lawful
nonconformance.
(b) A nonconforming luminaire or lighting installation shall be
made to conform with the requirements of this section when:
[1] Minor corrective action, such as re-aiming or shielding,
can achieve conformity with the applicable requirements
of this section.
§ 168-420 BALDWIN CODE § 168-420
1:586
§ 168-430. Nonconforming uses or structures.
[2] It is deemed by the municipality to create a safety hazard
or a nuisance.
[3] It is replaced by another luminaire or luminaires or
abandoned or relocated.
[4] The number of existing luminaires is increased by 50% or
more.
[5] There is a change in use.
(c) Regardless of the requirements above, when requested by the
municipality, nonconforming luminaires and lighting
installations shall be made to conform with the requirements of
this section or removed within three years from the effective
date of this section.
(9) Reporting of violations and penalties.
(a) A violation, or suspected violation, of this section may be
reported to the Borough through any of it officers, agents or
employees, who shall report same to the Code Enforcement
Official, designated as such by the Borough from time to time.
(b) Any person or entity violating any of the requirements of this
section be issued a citation by the proper municipality official
and, upon conviction of same before the District Justice, shall
be subject to a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $500
and/or imprisonment for not more than 30 days. Each day that
a violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense, and a
separate fine may be imposed.
A. Statement of intent.
(1) The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to
guide future use of land in the Borough by encouraging the
development of desirable residential, commercial and industrial
areas, with appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses,
to the end of promoting and protecting the public health, safety,
comfort, prosperity and other aspects of the general welfare.
(2) To achieve this end, lawful existing uses which would be prohibited
or restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments,
and which do not conform to the character and regulations of the
zoning district in which they are located, shall be subject to certain
limitations. The regulations set forth below are intended to provide
a gradual remedy for the undesirable conditions resulting from
indiscriminate mixing of uses, and to afford a means whereby
nonconforming uses can be gradually eliminated and reestablished
in more suitable locations within the Borough.
§ 168-420 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-430
1:587
(3) Similarly, buildings or other structures which do not comply with
one or more of the applicable district requirements as to lot width,
minimum lot area and yard spaces, lot coverages or building height
are deemed to be nonconforming.
(4) Nonconforming uses and structures will be generally permitted to
remain; the purpose of regulating them is to restrict further
investment in uses or structures which are inappropriate to their
location.
(5) To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in plans, construction or intended use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
the effective date or amendment of this chapter and on which
actual building construction has been diligently carried on.
B. Nonconforming use regulations.
(1) Continuation.
(a) Lawful uses located either within a building or other structure,
or part thereof, or on the land or in combination of both which,
at the effective date of this chapter or subsequent amendment
thereto, become nonconforming, may be continued so long as
they remain otherwise lawful, including subsequent sales of
the property.
(2) Alteration or enlargement of nonconforming buildings, structures
or land.
(a) Nonconforming buildings, structures or land shall not be
added to or enlarged upon any manner, unless said building,
structure or land, including additions and enlargements, is
made to conform to all the regulations of the district in which
they are located. No structure alterations may be made other
than those ordered by an authorized public officer to assure
the safety of a nonconforming building or structure.
(b) If a building or structure is conforming as to use, but
nonconforming as to area and bulk regulations or off-street
parking requirements, said building or structure may be
enlarged or added to, provided that the enlargement or
addition complies with the area and bulk regulations and the
existing building and the addition comply with the off-street
parking regulations of the district in which said building or
structure is located.
(c) No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, in
whole or in part, to another location on the lot unless every
portion of said building or structure is made to conform to all
the regulations of the district in which it is located.
§ 168-430 BALDWIN CODE § 168-430
1:588
(3) Discontinuance.
(a) If a nonconforming use of land or building ceases operations
for a continuous period of more than 12 months, then this shall
be deemed to be an intent to abandon such use, and any
subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations of this
chapter.
(4) Change in use.
(a) A nonconforming use of a conforming building or structure
(i.e., residential use of a commercial building) shall not be
expanded into any other portion of such conforming building or
structure nor changed except to a conforming use. If such a
nonconforming use or a portion thereof is discontinued or
changed to a conforming use, any future use of such building,
structure or portion shall be in conformity with the regulations
of this chapter.
(b) Whenever a use district shall be hereinafter changed, any
existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be
continued or changed to another nonconforming use of the
same or higher classification, provided that no structural
alterations are made other than those ordered by an
authorized public officer to assure the safety of the building or
structure.
(5) Damage or destruction.
(a) In the event that a nonconforming use in any district is
destroyed or partially destroyed by fire, explosion or other
cause, or otherwise damaged to the extent of 50% or more or
of its bulk of all buildings, structures and other improvements
on the lot, such nonconforming use shall terminate and the lot
shall thereafter be used only for conforming uses. Nothing in
this article shall be construed to prevent the restoration and
the resumption of a former lawful use of any building that is
damaged or partially destroyed by fire or other calamity or by
act of God to the extent of 50% or less, provided that such
restoration is started within one year and diligently prosecuted
to completion. No nonconforming building that is completely
destroyed or damaged or partially destroyed in any of the
above manners to a greater extent than 50% or voluntarily
razed or required by any law to be razed by the owner thereof
may thereafter be restored except in full conformity with all
the provisions of this chapter as to building and use. The
proportionate extent of damage or partial destruction shall be
based upon the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the
building to its condition prior to such damage or partial
destruction, to the estimated cost of duplicating the entire
§ 168-430 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-430
1:589
building as it existed prior thereto. Estimates for this purpose
shall be furnished by the Borough Engineer.
(b) In any case, whether conforming or nonconforming, the

171. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 168-600 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-600
1:605
grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) A variance from the terms of this chapter shall not be granted by
the Zoning Hearing Board unless and until:
(a) A written application for the variance is submitted that
includes:
[1] Dimensions of all existing and proposed structures.
[2] All required setbacks, yards and existing easements.
(b) The required fees are paid.
(c) Public notice by advertising shall be given at least two weeks in
advance of the hearing. The owner of the property for which
the variance is sought or his agent shall be notified by mail.
(d) The hearing shall be held. Any party may appear in person, or
by agent or by attorney.
(e) The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the
requirements of this section have been met by the applicant for
the variance.
§ 168-600 BALDWIN CODE § 168-600
1:606
(f) The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the
variance, and that the variance is the minimum variance that
will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or
structure.
(g) The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to
the neighborhood, or otherwise detrimental to the public
welfare.
(h) In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity
with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and such
safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter.
(i) Under no circumstances shall the Zoning Hearing Board grant
a variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of
this chapter in the district involved, or any use expressly or by
implication prohibited by the terms of this chapter in said

O. Procedure for landowner curative amendments.
172. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10109.
§ 168-600 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-600
1:609
(1) A landowner and/or developer who desires to challenge on
substantive grounds the validity of this chapter or the Official
Zoning Map or any provision thereof, which prohibits or restricts
the use or development of land in which he has an interest may
submit a curative amendment to the Council with a written request
that his challenge and proposed amendment be heard and decided
as provided in § 916.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, 53 P.S. § 10916.1. The curative amendment and challenge
shall be referred to the Planning Commission and the county
planning agency as provided in § 609 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code and notice of the hearing thereon
shall be given as provided in § 610 and § 916.1 of the Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P. S. §§ 10609, 10610, and 10916.1.
(2) The Council will conduct hearings and make decisions in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code. If
the Borough does not accept a landowner and/or developer's
curative amendment brought in accordance with this subsection
and a court subsequently rules that the challenge has merit, the
court's decision shall not result in a declaration of invalidity for this
entire chapter and Official Zoning Map, but only for those
provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's curative
amendment and challenge.
(3) The Council, if it determines that a validity challenge has merit,
may adopt landowner's curative amendment, with or without
revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will cure
the challenged defects. The Council shall consider the curative
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, school and other public service facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of this
chapter or Official Zoning Map;
(c) The suitability of the lot for the intensity of use proposed by the
lot's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features;
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the lot's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected or
destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts.
P. Procedure for Borough curative amendments.
§ 168-600 BALDWIN CODE § 168-600
1:610
§ 168-610. Enforcement and violations.
(1) If the Borough determines that this chapter, or any portion hereof,
is substantially invalid, it shall take the following actions:
(a) The Borough shall declare, by formal action, this chapter or
portions hereof substantially invalid and propose to prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30
days following such declaration and proposal, Council shall:
[1] By resolution make specific findings setting forth the
declared invalidity of this chapter, which may include:
[a] References to specific uses that are either not
permitted or not permitted in sufficient quantity;
[b] Reference to a class of use or uses which requires
revision; or
[c] Reference to this entire chapter which requires
revisions.
[2] Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to
this chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
(b) Council will conduct hearings and make decisions in
accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.
A. Enforcement notice.
(1) If it appears to the Borough that a violation of this chapter has
occurred, the Borough shall initiate enforcement proceedings by
sending an enforcement notice as provided in this chapter.
(2) The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of the lot on
which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed a
written request to receive enforcement notices regarding that lot,
and to any other person requested in writing by the owner of
record.
(3) An enforcement notice shall state at least the following:
(a) The name of the owner of record and any other person against
whom the Borough intends to take action.
(b) The location of the lot in violation.
(c) The specific violation with a description of the requirements
which have not been met, citing in each instance the applicable
provisions of this chapter.
§ 168-600 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 168-610
1:611
(d) The date before which the steps for compliance must be
commenced and the date before which the steps must be
completed.
(e) That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board within the timeframe as defined by the
enforcement notice.
(f) That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified,
unless extended by appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board,
constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions clearly
described.
B. Remedies.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated
or permitted the violation of the provisions of this chapter shall,
upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more than $500
plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by
the Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the determination of
a violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor
timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation,
unless the district justice determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for
the person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter to
have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there
shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth
day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
district justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues
shall constitute a separate violation. All judgments, costs and
reasonable attorney fees collected for the violation of this chapter
shall be paid over to the Borough.
(2) The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem fine pending a final
adjudication of the violation and judgment.
(3) Nothing contained in this section shall be construed or interpreted
to grant to any person or entity other than the Borough the right to
commence any action for enforcement pursuant to this section.
