PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hanahan, South Carolina. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation that represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE 	CD1:1 
CODE APPENDIX 	CDA:1 
CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES 	CCT:1 
STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE 	SLT:1 
CODE INDEX 	CDi:1 
 
Index 
The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Deborah E. Lewis, Clerk of Council, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that her efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 1-10. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code may be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code.

(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1)  Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2)  Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3)  Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers; 
(4)  Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections ___ to ___" (inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and 
(5)  Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.  
Sec. 1-11. - Altering Code. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever, which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby. Any person violating this section shall be punished as provided in section 1-12. 
(Code 1983, § 1-3-47)  
Sec. 1-12. - General penalty; continuing violations. 
(a)  Whenever in this Code or in any ordinance or resolution any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense, or whenever in the Code, ordinance or resolution the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of this Code or any such ordinance or resolution shall be punished by a fine not exceeding that permitted under state law or by imprisonment not exceeding 30 days. Each day any violation of any provision of this Code or of any such ordinance or resolution shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
(b)  In addition to the penalty provided in subsection (a) of this section, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance or resolution shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated as provided by law, and each day that the condition continues shall be regarded as a new and separate offense. 
(Code 1983, § 1-3-48) 
State Law reference Maximum fine and penalty established by governing body for violation of ordinance cannot exceed $500.00, or imprisonment not exceeding 30 days, or both, S.C. Code 1976, § 5-7-30.

The map of the city showing the territorial limits thereof is hereby designated as the official map of the city, and the corporate limits as known thereon are declared to be the true and correct corporate limits of the city, including all annexations made through and including the date of adoption of this Code. 
(Code 1983, § 1-3-49)  
Sec. 1-14. - Uniform ordinance summons adopted. 
(a)  S.C. Code 1976, § 56-7-80 authorizes municipalities to adopt by ordinance and use an ordinance summons for violation of municipal ordinances. Any person or entity violating any provision of this Code, or any code adopted pursuant thereto, within the corporate limits of the city may be issued a uniform ordinance summons. Issuance of the uniform ordinance summons shall vest jurisdiction in the municipal court to hear and dispose of the charge for which the uniform ordinance summons was issued and served. The uniform ordinance summons may be issued by any city law enforcement officer or by city employees designated by the council as code enforcement officers. The bond amount for violations shall be prescribed by the chief municipal court judge. Code enforcement officers are prohibited from accepting bonds. Bonds are to be posted in the manner prescribed in the uniform ordinance summons. The uniform ordinance summons shall not be used to perform a custodial arrest and/or apply to any ordinances which regulate the use of motor vehicles on the public roads. The form attached to the ordinance from which this section is derived is hereby adopted and referred to herein by reference as the city uniform ordinance summons. 
(b)  Any law enforcement and code enforcement officer who serves an ordinance summons must allow the person served to proceed without first having to post bond or to appear before a municipal judge. Acceptance of an ordinance summons constitutes a person's recognizance to comply with the terms of the summons.

Former ch. 22, § 22-1, pertained to the floodplain management and drainage ordinance incorporated by reference, and derived from the 1983 Code, § 5-5-1. 
 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 22-1. - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code 1976, title 5, chs. 7, 23 and 25 (articles 5 and 7) and title 6, ch. 7, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the mayor and council of the City of Hanahan, South Carolina does ordain as follows. 
( Ord. No. 4-2017 , § 1(100), 11-14-2017)  
Sec. 22-2. - Findings of fact. 
The flood hazard areas of the City of Hanahan are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstruction in floodplains causing increased flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. 
( Ord. No. 4-2017 , § 1(110), 11-14-2017)  
Sec. 22-3. - Statement of purpose and objectives. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health, minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are restricted or prohibited. The provisions attempt to control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters, and control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion. Additionally, the article prevents or regulates the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health, to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. The provisions of the article are intended to minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding. 
Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, and habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands, especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of substantial improvement. 
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the tax or certified appraised value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all cost associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official, and safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions (does not include Americans with Disabilities Act compliance standards); or 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years (ordinary minor repairs do not count towards cumulative permit totals). If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether "substantial improvement" will occur.

Sec. 22-34. - Administrative procedures. 
Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit progresses, the local administrator or his designee shall make as many inspections of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. A minimum of three inspections shall be performed for each permitted development project in the regulated floodplain: 
The first inspection is conducted when the site is staked out or otherwise marked. A "construction drawings" elevation certification is provided to the city. The inspector checks that areas subject to special requirements are clearly marked on the ground. 
The second inspection is conducted when the lowest floor is built for a building or building addition. The builder provides the city with documentation of the surveyed lowest floor elevation ("building under construction" elevation certificate). The inspector checks that: 
a.  The foundation or forms for the structure are correctly located on the site; 
b.  Where buildings have enclosures below the base flood elevation (permitted in AE zones only), the location and size of the openings are as specified on the approved plans; 
The third inspection is conducted when the project is finished; the "finished construction" elevation certificate is submitted, and before the final building inspection. The inspector checks: 
a.  The foundation and floor elevation have not been altered since the second inspection; 
b.  All areas below the required elevation are constructed with materials resistant to flood damage; 
c.  Where buildings have enclosures below the base flood elevation, the location and size of the openings are specified on the approved plans and recorded on the elevation certificate; 
d.  All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning, ductwork, and other equipment is located, elevated, or protected as specified on the approved plans and recorded on the elevation certificate; and 
e.  There has been no alteration of the ground since the second inspection or the ground has been graded according to the approved plans. 
(2)  Stop work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter, the administrator or his designee may order the work to immediately be stopped. The stop work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. Notification of the property owner is also required. The stop work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed. Violation of a stop work order shall constitute a misdemeanor. 
(3)  Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder and owner in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked.

ARTICLE IV. - FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION STANDARDS 
 
Sec. 22-41. - General standards. 
Development may not occur in the special flood hazard floodplain where alternative locations exist due to inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures (and additions) cannot be located out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are required: 
(1)  All new construction, additions and/or substantial improvements shall conform to the requirements contained in the latest adopted International Building Code or International Residential Code, whichever is applicable, reviewed to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  All new construction, additions and/or substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood-resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(3)  All new construction, additions and/or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages. 
(4)  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located at least two feet above the required base flood elevation so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within or on the components during conditions of flooding. This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for showerheads, hoses, etc., as long as cutoff devices and backflow devices are installed to prevent contamination of the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to a structure and contents. 
(5)  New gas containers shall be buried below grade and anchored to prevent flotation. Existing gas tanks, when replaced, shall be strapped to prevent movement and flotation. 
(6)  Noncommercial developable lots located in the X, X shaded, and AE flood zones shall have an average grade of all adjacent lots. A foundation/current conditions survey shall be provided and approved prior to the foundation being poured or piers being filled prior to additional inspections being performed. Adjacent lot grades shall be measured at a minimum of 20 feet into all adjacent lots. 
(7)  Water supply and sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(8)  Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, addition or improvement to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development and structures. 
(10)  Nonconforming structures or uses. Nonconforming structures or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Use of nonconforming ground floor habitable spaces or walls for an addition of a second floor above the base flood elevation shall not be allowed. 
(11)  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in section 22-51 of this chapter as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement. 
(12)  All new construction, additions and/or substantial improvements shall be designed and sealed by a registered design professional as complying with the requirements of the latest adopted International Building Code or International Residential Code, whichever is applicable. 
(13)  Floodproofing or wet-proofing as a flood protection measure shall be prohibited. All structures (including nonresidential) shall be required to elevate to the base flood elevation plus two feet. 
(14)  New septic systems in floodplains are prohibited. 
(15)  Critical facilities: Critical facilities as defined in section 22-22 of this chapter shall be prohibited in the 500-year flood zone. (Note: The 500-year floodplain includes the entire SFHA plus other land that is lower than the 500-year flood elevation). 
(16)  Hazardous velocities. 
Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. Therefore, solid foundation walls shall not be permitted within any special flood hazard area. 
(17)  All fences crossing floodplain boundaries are subject to flood review. The most restrictive zone crossed by the fence will prevail. All fencing material shall be flood-resistant materials. 
(18)  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase potential flood damage. 
(19)  Swimming pools in special flood hazard area: Pools located within the SFHA shall be built to the following standards: 
a.  Swimming pools must meet all applicable requirements set forth in the zoning ordinance. 
b.  Swimming pools must be sited as far away from the regulatory flood boundary as feasible. 
c.  Swimming pools beneath a structure in any SFHA must be flush with the natural grade and must be engineered certifying: 
1.  The swimming pool or other obstruction will not be subject to breaking up or flooding out the ground and affecting the piles or columns of the structure; and 
2.  The swimming pool shall meet the same anchoring requirements as the support system of the building. 
(20)  Recreational vehicles shall not be permitted within the SFHA. 
(21)  Outdoor storage of any kind shall be prohibited within the SFHA. 
(22)  No basements shall be permitted within the city limits.

a.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring and the elevation standards specified in section 22-51(3)c. of this chapter are met. 
b.  Manufactured homes that are substantially improved on sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and movement. 
c.  Manufactured homes as permitted in section 22-51(3)a. of this chapter shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement in accordance with section 19-425.39 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as amended. Additionally, the chassis must be elevated a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation. The chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements at least equivalent strength. 
(4)  Elevated buildings. New construction, addition and/or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include limited enclosures (allowed only in AE flood zones) in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude finished space and designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must be certified by a professional engineer or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening; 
3.  Only the portion of openings that are below the base flood elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area; 
4.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions; and 
5.  Subgrade crawlspaces are not permitted. Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade outside the building on at least one side of the building. 
b.  Enclosures below lowest floor in AE zones (excluding crawlspaces): 
1.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator). Total enclosed area shall not exceed 290 square feet. No other enclosures shall be permitted below the required base flood elevation. 
2.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned or finished into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
3.  One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground fault circuit interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation as specified in section 22-51 of this chapter.

5.  New construction and substantial improvements with enclosed areas under elevated buildings, shall sign a declaration of land restriction (nonconversion agreement); the agreement shall be recorded on the property deed prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy or final inspection. 
c.  Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for debris flow exists. Therefore, solid foundation walls shall not be permitted. 
(5)  Accessory structures. Any detached accessory structure, the cost of which is greater than $3,000.00, must comply with the elevated structure requirements of sections 22-51(2) and (5) of this chapter or constructed completely of flood-resistant materials. When accessory structures of $3,000.00 or less are to be placed in the floodplain, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  Accessory structures shall not be used for human habitation, temporary or otherwise, including office, workshop, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom areas; 
b.  Accessory structures shall be constructed of flood-resistant material designed to have low flood damage potential; 
c.  Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters; 
d.  Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure; 
e.  Service facilities such as electrical shall be installed in accordance with section 22-41(4) of this chapter;

g.  Accessory structures shall comply with city zoning regulations; and 
h.  Detached garages, used for purposes other than parking of vehicles or limited storage, shall meet the requirements of new construction. 
Exception: Swimming pools shall be allowed meeting section 22-41(20) of this chapter. 
(6)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-32 of this chapter are areas designated as floodway. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris and potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall be presented to the local administrator: 
a.  No encroachments, including fill or raised slab foundation, new construction, substantial improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall be presented to the local administrator. Raised slab foundation may be utilized in floodways only when no other practical alternative exists. 
b.  If specified standards in section 22-51(6) of this chapter are satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions. 
c.  Stream crossing for any purpose (i.e., timber harvesting operations), if temporary, shall be permitted. Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions. 
d.  No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring and the elevation standards of section 22-51(3) of this chapter. 
e.  Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming, pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary, game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife and related uses; also, lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, hiking and horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or fill. The uses listed in this section are permissible only if and to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations. 
(7)  Fill. Fill and raised slab construction is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains. Elevating buildings by other methods should be utilized. An applicant shall prove through engineering analysis that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at least two feet above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent properties. Slabs of any kind, including raised slab foundations, or stem walls shall not be utilized in the special flood hazard area. Piers, pilings, or flow-through crawlspaces shall be utilized. The following provisions shall apply to any fill placed in the special flood hazard area: 
a.  Fill may not be placed in a floodway unless it is in accordance with section 22-51(6) of this chapter; 
b.  Fill may not be placed in tidal or nontidal wetlands without the required state and federal permits; 
c.  Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability by a registered professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain; 
d.  Fill used to support structures must be certified by a registered professional engineer for "designed and compacted fill" that meets the criteria of (1) section 1803.5.8 and section 1804.5 of the International Building Code, (2) section 2.4 of ASCE 24, or (3) their equivalent; and must be on fill that has appropriate protection from erosion and scour; 
e.  Fill slopes shall be no greater than two horizontal to one vertical. Flatter slopes may be required where velocities may result in erosion; 
f.  The use of fill shall not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on neighboring properties; and 
g.  Fill may not be used for structural support in the coastal high hazard areas (V, VE, or V130). 
(8)  Any unauthorized or construction inconsistent with plans approved by the city will be required to return the area to original conditions. This requirement includes existing properties.

Sec. 22-52. - Standards for area outside of the special flood hazard area (SFHA). 
Other areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation of floodwaters due to acts of nature, stormwater drainage and other issues. These properties, although outside of the SFHA, need to be protected. The city wishes to minimize any potential loss due to periodic flooding by enforcing certain requirements within the 100-year and 500-year flood zones. These flood zones have no base flood elevation data therefore the following requirements are to be enforced on all new construction and additions: 
(1)  Minimum finished floor elevation. 
a.  All new noncommercial structures, not located in a special flood hazard area, shall have the lowest floor and all mechanical or electrical equipment, such as compressors, air conditioning units, etc., elevated not less than 18 inches above the highest adjacent grade of the lot. Final site grading shall insure that ponding of stormwater will not occur beneath the building, nearer than three feet from the building's perimeter or any mechanical or electrical equipment. 
b.  All new commercial structures, not located in a special flood hazard area, shall have the lowest floor and all mechanical or electrical equipment, such as compressors, air conditioning units, etc., elevated not less than 18 inches above the centerline of the road. Final site grading shall insure that ponding of stormwater will not occur beneath the building, nearer than three feet from the building's perimeter or any mechanical or electrical equipment. 
(2)  Enclosed crawl space construction must be designed and certified by a professional engineer or meet the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Provide a minimum of two flood vents on different walls having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
b.  The bottom of all flood vents shall be no higher than one foot above the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening; and 
c.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
(3)  The installation of outdoor faucets for showerheads, hoses, etc., are permitted as long as cutoff devices and backflow devices are installed to prevent contamination of the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages to a structure and contents; 
(4)  Gas containers shall be strapped and anchored to prevent movement and flotation or buried below grade and anchored to a reinforced footing. 
( Ord. No. 4-2017 , § 1(510), 11-14-2017)  
Sec. 22-53. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and are subject to all applicable standards in these regulations. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. An access road at or above the base flood elevation shall be provided to allow emergency access during flood conditions. 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(3)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all subdivision proposals of 50 lots or more than five acres or greater. 
(4)  All residential subdivision proposals having 50 lots or more shall be required to provide an approved evacuation plan. 
( Ord. No. 4-2017 , § 1(520), 11-14-2017)  
Sec. 22-54. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 22-4 of this chapter are areas designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within all such areas in addition to those requirements set forth in article IV of this chapter: 
(1)  All new construction, addition and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(2)  All new construction, addition and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
(3)  All structures on slopes must have drainage paths around them to guide water away from the structures. 
( Ord. No. 4-2017 , § 1(530), 11-14-2017)  
Sec. 22-55. - Standards for streams with established base flood elevations but without floodways. 
Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE) data is provided but no floodway is identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in the FIS. 
(1)  No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

ARTICLE V. - FILMING 
 
Sec. 34-122. - Filming regulations. 
(a)  Residential areas. A permit is required for any film, video or still photography activity (hereinafter the "filming activity), whether on public or private property, to be conducted within the city limits, with the exception that news coverage and production companies with a cast and crew totaling ten persons or less do not require such a permit. Application shall be on the city's application form to be obtained from the Building and Codes' office, and shall be submitted to the city administrator at least five business days before commencement of the filming activity. Upon the showing of exceptional circumstances which prevent the applicant's timely submission of a permit application, the city administrator shall have the discretion to allow an untimely permit application, taking into consideration the size, scale and potential impact of the proposed activity upon the area, citizens, businesses and residents to be affected. Applicants are advised that early application is encouraged in order to allow necessary time to resolve any difficulties associated with the filming activity. 
No filming activity which involves the use of explosives, pyrotechnics, fire or other special effects which involve flames or incendiary devices may be undertaken unless a permit has been obtained from the state fire marshal's office and approved in writing by the City of Hanahan Fire Chief, or his designee. At the discretion of the City of Hanahan Fire Chief, or his designee, it may be required to have fire/EMS personnel and equipment at the location at an additional cost to the production company. 
Use of public water by way of hydrant hookup shall require coordination with and specific approval by the City of Hanahan Fire Chief, or his designee, and the Charleston Water System. Payment for any such water consumed shall be coordinated with the CWS. 
Residents, their visitors, delivery personnel and/or repair and maintenance personnel shall not be denied access to neighboring homes within the area. 
Filming activities shall not begin prior to 7:00 a.m. and will end by 11:00 p.m. Requests for night scenes extending beyond the designated time window shall require prior approval granted in writing by the city administrator. 
Prior to arrival, a parking plan must be developed and approved by the city administrator and the chief of police or his designee. The plan should detail off-site parking of equipment or support vehicles not in use, as well as any large trucks or trailers used by the company. The plan should detail staging of production vehicles, and should include a statement of approval from any private property owner on whose property those vehicles may be parked. 
Lighting for filming, both during the day and night, shall be oriented away from neighboring residences wherever possible, and shall not interfere with the safe movement of traffic. 
Base camps and dressing room trailers should be parked away from neighboring residences wherever possible. 
Base camps and equipment trucks moving into or out of residential areas shall not do so before 6:00 a.m. or after 11:00 p.m. unless specifically approved in the permit, or by written authorization of the city administrator. 
If a selected zoned residential area is wanting to be used and that area has a governing homeowners association (HOA), a letter must be obtained from the HOA president or governing HOA body and submitted to the city administrator at least five days prior to the filming start date for approval. 
If at any point the filming activity is deemed a nuisance due to the disruption of the peace or poses a safety hazard to people and/or property, the chief of police and/or fire chief, or their designees, may order the immediate ceasing of all filming activity until it is deemed appropriate to resume filming activities. 
(b)  Business/industrial areas. No less than five business days prior to commencement of the filming activity, the filming company shall notify in writing all businesses and residents affected by the proposed activity. The filming company shall provide a signed copy of such notification to the city administrator. Where the planned activity may have a significant and/or prolonged impact on the normal activities of the area (for example, activities impacting parking or traffic in areas zoned as business and/or industrial), the city administrator shall have the discretion to require earlier notification. The city administrator shall be satisfied with the compliance of said notifications before the issuance of the filming permit. 
After commencement of the filming activity, the film company shall provide written notification to the affected businesses and residents of any subsequent changes to the information provided in the original notification and of any additional variances or permits granted by the city to the filming company. 
Base camps and equipment trucks moving into or out of business and/or industrial areas shall not do so before 5:00 a.m. or after 1:00 a.m. unless specifically approved in the permit, or by written authorization of the city administrator. 
Filming activities shall not begin prior to 6:00 a.m. and will end by 1:00 a.m. Requests for night scenes extending beyond the designated time window shall require prior approval granted in writing by the city administrator. 
If at any point filming activity is deemed a nuisance due to the disruption of the peace or interferes with the normal day to day operations of businesses not directly involved with the filming location or poses a safety hazard to people and/or property, the chief of police and/or fire chief, or their designees, may order the immediate ceasing of all filming activity until it is deemed appropriate to resume filming activities. 
(c)  Care of location. All properties utilized for the film activity shall be left clean and orderly and shall be restored to their previous condition, including public and private lands. The city shall be reimbursed by the permit applicant for all costs of restoring and/or repairing public property due to damage resulting from the filming activity. The city administrator may, in his sole discretion, require the filming company to pay a bond to guarantee the restoration of the location if the city administrator determines that the proposed activity may cause damage to or require extensive restoration of public property. 
(d)  Traffic control and street closures. The permit application must specify whether the film activity will disrupt the normal flow of traffic within the affected area. Traffic control, if necessary as determined by the city administrator, shall be handled through a contract with the City of Hanahan Police Department. The city administrator, in consultation with the police chief, or his designee, shall determine the number of officers needed. Intermittent holding of traffic shall not exceed three-minute intervals except when specifically approved in the permit. 
Except in exceptional circumstances, complete closure of streets shall be discouraged. Requests for temporary street closure or diverting of traffic must be approved by the South Carolina Department of Transportation where state streets or rights-of-way are involved. Berkeley County Roads and Bridges and SCDOT must also grant approval for temporary street closures or diverting of traffic if the road/street is maintained by the County of Berkeley or SCOOT. Requests for street closure or diverting of traffic must be made well enough in advance to allow for planning rerouting, or alternate routes, and for proper signage. 
(e)  Notification. The area to be covered by the notification prescribed in (a) above shall be a minimum of one block radius in each direction from the perimeter of the planned activity. Based upon the nature of the planned activity, the city administrator shall have the discretion to specify a wider area of notification as a condition of issuance of the permit. 
Notification will include all available information concerning the location and duration of the filming, prep and wrap activities, the times of day required for each location, proposed parking restrictions and restrictions on public streets, proposed location for all support facilities, as well as specifics regarding the use of lights, noise and any special effects or extraordinary equipment. The notification shall also include the film company's production office telephone number and the location manager's telephone/cell phone/pager numbers, as well as the office/pager number of the city administrator. The notification shall also inform that any concerns, objections or complaints pertaining to the planned activity may be registered the city administrator, the police department or the office of building and codes. 
(f)  Insurance. Filming companies shall be required to have liability insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000.00 covering bodily injury, including death and property, with the City of Hanahan and the "City of Hanahan officials and agents" named as additional insureds in said policy. A larger amount of insurance may be required by the city administrator if, in his sole discretion, he determines that the nature of the proposed film activity necessitates an increased coverage. 
(g)  Indemnity. Filming companies in the city shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the City of Hanahan from all damages, suits, actions or liabilities, including payment of all attorney's fees, resulting from acts of the filming company or its agents during the filming activity or occurring as a result of the use of filming locations by the filming company.

Sec. 36-176. - Response to police request/motorist preference. 
Wreckers shall respond only upon the request of the proper police authority. Response under any other condition may result in the removal of the wrecker service from the rotation list. Unless the owner or driver of a vehicle is incapacitated or unavailable, the investigating officer at the scene will make a determination of the owner's or driver's preference of a wrecker service. The investigating officer will use his discretionary authority to deny request for a specific wrecker service whenever the request will impair the timely restoration of safe traffic movement. In the event the owner or driver of the vehicle does not have a preference or preference cannot be determined, the investigating officer will utilize a wrecker from the rotation list. The wrecker service responding to such call shall provide the vehicle operator with a card containing the wrecker service name, address, telephone number and business hours. 
(Ord. of 4-12-2005, art. D, § 8-3-13)  
Sec. 36-177. - Rotation lists for categorized wrecker service. 
Separate rotation lists will be maintained for each category of wreckers. When the services of a categorized wrecker are needed and when the owner or driver of the vehicle to be towed has no preference as to which wrecker service he desires, a wrecker will be called from the appropriate wrecker rotation list. 
(Ord. of 4-12-2005, art. D, § 8-3-14)  
Sec. 36-178. - Administration and order of calls. 
The wrecker rotation list shall be administered fairly and in a manner designed to ensure that all wrecker services on the list have an equal opportunity for the towing business arising from the city rotation list. As such, the following will apply: 
(1)  Subject to the provisions of section 36-119, wrecker services shall be called from the rotation list in the order in which they appear on the list. If a particular wrecker service is unavailable when called, it shall be passed over and the next wrecker service on the list shall be called to the scene. 
(2)  Wrecker services shall be available to the city and the public on a 24-hour basis. When a wrecker service or wrecker driver is unable to answer a call, the police dispatcher shall be promptly notified of that fact and the reason for unavailability. 
(3)  Per section 36-140(a), a wrecker service shall respond, under normal conditions, in a timely manner. Failure to respond in a timely manner may result in a second rotation wrecker being requested. If the second wrecker is requested before the arrival of the first rotation wrecker, the initially requested wrecker will forfeit the call and will immediately leave the collision/incident scene. 
(4)  Motorists utilizing the police department wrecker rotation list will have the option of paying by major credit card. The wrecker service may request, prior to dispatching, if the motorist intends to pay by major credit card. If the wrecker service does not accept major credit cards, the next wrecker or towing service that does accept credit cards will be utilized. Any wrecker or towing service called that does not accept credit cards will remain on the top of the rotation list. 
(5)  The wrecker service must have a wrecker of sufficient size and strength to handle the job. The police department will have the right not to call a wrecker service that, in its opinion, fails to meet this qualification for a specific job. Under these conditions, the wrecker service not called will remain on the top of the rotation list. 
(6)  A wrecker service may respond with a wrecker of a higher class than requested. However, the wrecker service call is limited to the rates of the requested classification.

A wrecker service may secure assistance from another wrecker service when necessary to complete the recovery; however, this does not supersede section 36-120 nor does it permit wrecker services to accept a rotation call and dispatch the call to secondary wrecker services. Only one bill is to be submitted to the owner or operator for the work performed. 
(Ord. of 4-12-2005, art. D, § 8-3-16)  
Sec. 36-180. - Release of vehicle and personal effects. 
The wrecker service location shall have an agent present during business hours and at the request of the owner of the towed vehicle or his designee, the wrecker service must immediately release personal items such as medicines, medical equipment, keys, clothing, and tools of the trade, child restraint systems and perishable items.

Fees charged for rotation list calls shall be reasonable and not in excess of those rates charged for similar services provided in response to requests initiated by any other public agency or private person. The reasonableness of the fees charged will be determined in the following manner: 
(1)  A wrecker service shall submit proposed fees along with its annual application. Separate fee schedules shall be submitted for each class of wrecker, and, for each class, the fee for standard towing, heavy-duty towing, storage, and special operations. 
a.  A standard tow is defined as responding to the scene, hooking up the vehicle, performing a general cleanup if the call involves responding to a collision scene and providing responsible assistance to the owner to get to a safe location. 
b.  Special operations are operations involving the process of uprighting an overturned vehicle or returning a vehicle to a normal position on the roadway which requires the use of auxiliary equipment due to the size or location of the vehicle and/or the recovery of a load which has spilled, or the offloading and reloading of a load from an overturned vehicle performed to right the vehicle.

For example, if a wrecker service uses a class B wrecker for class A towing requirements, then its fee structure shall be in accordance with the class A standard fees. 
(6)  Failure to submit proposed fees with the annual application will result in utilizing the last proposed fees submitted. 
(7)  Wrecker services that submit fees that are determined to be excessive or unreasonable will be notified and allowed to resubmit fees within five business days of notification. A wrecker service will be allowed to resubmit fees once. Failure to resubmit reasonable fees will disqualify the wrecker service from the police department rotation list until January 1 of the following year.

Each day in which the violation occurs or exists shall constitute a separate offense where the zoning administrator determines that the situation places the public in imminent danger or creates an emergency situation. In a situation that does not place the public in imminent danger or create an emergency situation, if, in the opinion of the zoning administrator, no substantial progress is made toward correcting the violation by the end of the seventh calendar day, each day the violation continues thereafter shall be constitute a separate offense. 
(B)	Enforcement tools. The following steps may be taken by the zoning administrator to ensure compliance with the Zoning Ordinance and/or the land Development Ordinance of the City of Hanahan. 
(1)	Permits. The zoning administrator may withhold any or all zoning permits, building permits, other approvals, or certificate of occupancy for any development that does not comply with the provisions of the zoning and land development ordinances.

(3)	Selection of remedial action. In order to correct a violation of the Zoning Ordinance and/or the Land Development Ordinance or to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from a violation of this ordinance, the zoning administrator has the discretion to select among the following courses of action, as appropriate under the circumstances. The intent of these steps is to allow the non-compliance to be eliminated or mitigated without necessitating legal action by the city or citizens with standing against the violator. Such decision by the zoning administrator may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals; however, during such appeal process, the developer may not proceed in any manner in violation of these ordinances. 
(a)	Require the developer or owner to take specific actions to bring the construction or activity in question into compliance with the Zoning and Land Development Ordinances.

Alternatively, the DCC may request additional information, in which case the DCC may table preliminary design review and continue discussion at its next meeting. 
(2)	If the design control committee finds that the project is eligible for accelerated review, then it may approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the proposed design as final and instruct the zoning administrator to proceed with issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Alternatively, the DCC may request additional information, in which case the DCC may table design review and continue discussion at its next meeting. 
(C)	Action by the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall submit to the developer a written report of the design control committee's findings, with any attached conditions of approval or reasons for disapproval, within ten (10) days of the decision. If the DCC found the project ineligible for accelerated review, then the zoning administrator shall indicate this in the report, which shall instruct the developer to seek final design approval and pay to the city the difference between the accelerated design review fee and the preliminary design review fee upon submittal of documentation for final design approval. 
3.10. - Consideration of project design; partial approval. 
(A)	The approval of an application for the use, development, or subdivision of land by the zoning administrator, planning commission, or board of zoning appeals shall not deprive the design control committee the power granted to it in this chapter or in any manner diminish such powers. 
(B)	At the conclusion of each review, the design control committee shall move to approve, conditionally approve, disapprove, or defer decision on the project in question. 
(1)	In case of conditional approval or disapproval, the DCC Chairperson or the zoning administrator shall state the reasons therefor in a written statement within ten (10) days of the action to the developer. The notification may include a summary of recommendations in regard to appropriateness of design, arrangement, texture, material, color and the like or the property involved, as expressed at the review. 
(2)	Among other grounds for conditionally approving or disapproving a design are the following considerations: 
(a)	Arresting and spectacular effects; appearance; 
(b)	Violent contrasts of materials or colors and intense or lurid colors; 
(c)	A multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance; 
(d)	The absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the dignity and character of the present structure in case of repair, alteration, or expansion; 
(e)	Remodeling or enlargement of an existing building or with the prevailing character of the surrounds in the case of a new building; 
(f)	Overbearing massing; and/or 
(g)	Excessive repetition of design elements, treatments, or module. 
(C)	Partial approval. The design control committee may opt to approve or conditionally approve one (1) or more portions of a project submitted for review. The effect may be to allow the developer to progress with that portion of the project to the next phase of design review or to allow that portion of the project to gain a certificate of appropriateness and authorize the developer to seek zoning or land development approval. 
3.11. - Appeals. 
(A)	Appeal to design control committee. The developer or any person aggrieved by a decision of the zoning administrator regarding the application of design standards in a zoning district over which the design control district has jurisdiction may appeal the decision to the DCC. The appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of written notice of the decision. 
(B)	Application to the City of Hanahan. The applicant appealing to the design control committee shall undertake the following procedure. 
(a)	A completed application, together with the application fee for appeal to the design control committee, shall be filed with the zoning administrator at least twenty-five (25) days prior to the DCC meeting at which the request will be considered. 
(b)	Required information. The applicant shall set forth a detailed description of the request on an application form provided by the zoning administrator. The completed application shall include the following information: 
(i)	A legal description and street address of the subject property, together with a property boundary map if subject property is not explicitly delineated on the zoning map; 
(ii)	Six (6) copies of the site development plan or building plans submitted as part of a zoning permit application reviewed and disapproved by the zoning administrator, where applicable, for the property for which relief is sought, as well as any documentation specified for design review necessary to illustrate conditions pertinent to the appeal. 
(iii)	Name, address, and phone number of applicant; 
(iv)	Name of property owner(s) and applicant's interest in the property if not the owner in fee simple title; 
(v)	Filing date of application; 
(vi)	Any other information deemed relevant by the zoning administrator; and 
(vii)	Applicant and property owner's signature(s). 
(C)	Stay of proceedings. Filing an appeal to the design control committee stays all legal proceedings to enforce the appealed action unless the appealed officer certifies that a stay would cause imminent peril to life and property. In such cases, a court restraining order may stay the action. 
(D)	Hearings. The design control committee shall hold a public hearing within sixty (60) days of receiving written application for appeal, giving public notice thereof at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing by placing notice in a general circulation newspaper in the community. 
(E)	Posting property. City staff must post conspicuous notices on or next to the affected property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. At least one (1) notice must be visible from each street that borders the property. 
(F)	Record keeping. The design control committee shall keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question or, if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its examination and other official actions, all of which shall be filed in the office of the zoning administrator and shall be public record. On all appeals, applications, and other matters brought before the board, it shall inform in writing all the parties involved of its decision(s) and the reason(s) heretofore. 
(G)	Decisions of the design control committee. The concurring majority vote of present members of the DCC shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or determination of the zoning administrator or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to consider under this ordinance. The DCC decision shall be based upon for comparison of the completed application to general design guidelines for the City of Hanahan, Section 3.3, and guidelines specific to the zoning district in which the project is proposed. 
(H)	Order on decision. The design control committee shall, upon decision of approval or denial, submit to the applicant its decision in writing within thirty (30) days and shall notify the zoning administrator of such decision. If the DCC finds in favor of the developer, the zoning administrator shall process the application for a certificate of appropriateness for the reviewed property. 
(I)	Appeals of decisions of the design control committee. Any person who may have a substantial interest in any decision of the DCC may appeal that decision to circuit court, filing with the clerk of such court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly wherein such decision is contrary to law. Such appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the rendering of the decision of the DCC. 
4. - LAND USE 

4.1. - Intent. 
    This chapter of the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance seeks to implement the future land use element of the Hanahan Comprehensive Plan, as amended. The plan provides for several zones to accommodate varying land uses best suited to the existing natural and built environments and available levels of infrastructure and services. These zones are then mapped as districts within Hanahan, as depicted on the zoning map. The zoning districts that appear on the map are described herein. 
4.1.1.   Conventional zones.
(A)	Conservation/Preservation (CP). This zone intends to preserve and protect land, marsh, and waters of Hanahan that (1) serve as wildlife refuges, (2) possess great natural or historical significance, (3) serve recreational purposes, and (4) provide needed green space for the health and general welfare of the city's inhabitants. The zone further intends to prevent encroachment of land uses that would adversely impact areas of these four (4) types. 
(B)	Single-Family Residential-Low-density (RSL). This zone intends to foster, preserve, and protect existing low-density neighborhoods in which the principal uses of land are detached, single-family dwellings and related accessory and support facilities, so as to protect established communities from overdevelopment. The zone should be mapped to encompass those areas of Hanahan that constitute suburban, bedroom communities within the city. 
(C)	Single-Family Residential (RS). This zone intends to foster, preserve, and promote neighborhoods in which the principal uses of land are detached, single-family dwellings and related accessory and support facilities. The zone also provides opportunities for diverse housing choices in planned developments, which shall be held to high standards necessary for compatibility with the surrounding community. The zone should be mapped to encompass those areas of Hanahan that constitute suburban, bedroom communities within the city as well as existing traditional neighborhoods. 
(D)	Single-Family Residential-Moderate-density (RSM). This zone intends to foster, preserve, and promote neighborhoods in which the principal uses of land are detached, single-family dwellings and related accessory and support facilities. The zone also provides opportunities for diverse housing choices in planned developments, which shall be held to high standards necessary for compatibility with the surrounding community. This zone should be mapped on a limited basis and is best suited as a transitional area between RS or RSL zoning districts and higher intensity zoning districts, such as CG (General Commercial). 
(E)	Multi-Family Residential (RM). This zone intends to accommodate existing medium- to high-density residential development and a variety of housing types on small lots or in planned developments. 
(F)	Residential Mobile Home (RT). This zone intends to accommodate manufactured housing development in concert with site-built single-family homes and duplexes in planned developments and cooperative communities. 
(G)	Residential/Office (RO). This zone intends to accommodate office, institutional, and residential uses in areas along collector or arterial roads that will not sustain more intense uses or to transition between more intense zoning districts and residential areas. 
(H)	General Commercial (CG). This zone intends to foster and advance opportunities for economic development, employment, and sales of goods and services in Hanahan in locations with good access to infrastructure on arterial roads or commercial parks where impacts to lower-intensity uses can be successfully mitigated. 
(I)	Industrial (ID). This zone intends to accommodate wholesaling, distribution, storage, processing, and manufacturing in locations with good access to infrastructure on arterial roads or industrial parks where impacts to lower-intensity uses are unlikely. 
4.1.2.   Redevelopment zones.
(A)	Town Residential (TR). This zone intends to provide housing in attached and detached units in a highly interconnected, pedestrian-scale environment near shops, schools, recreation, emergency services, and other public and private services typically provided in a full service community. This district is to provide opportunities for development and redevelopment that contributes to neighborhood and town atmospheres without unduly burdening public infrastructure. To further this intent, very light commerce may also occur in or adjacent to housing units to provide additional services to residents and guests of the Town Residential District. 
(B)	Town Center (TC). This zone intends to promote and protect the economic growth and vitality of the Yeamans Hall Road commercial corridor by encouraging the convenient and coordinated land use and development between the Hanahan Municipal Complex and Remount Road, a major gateway to the city. It is the intent that regulations for land use and development within this district will: 
(1)	Enhance the viability of local businesses by coordinating land uses and site planning in a harmonious, interconnected environment that reduces the need for vehicular transportation to and between establishments; 
(2)	Provide opportunities for medium-density residential development that houses a market for commercial uses in the traditional center of Hanahan and carefully balances the impacts of commerce with the needs of residents-especially those in existing houses-in the district by mitigating negative externalities on site; 
(3)	Create a sense of place in Hanahan cultivated by high-quality outdoor public spaces by using buildings to form an appealing, safe environment that functions for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists; and 
(4)	Build over time a mixed-use built environment that uses land efficiently and generates significant positive revenue for the City of Hanahan. 
4.1.3.   Overlay and Floating Zones.
(A)	Planned developments. 
(1)	Type "A" PD-Conservation Development. The purpose of this tool is to encourage creative and flexible site design that is sensitive to the land's natural features and adapts to the natural topography; protect environmentally sensitive areas of a development site and preserve on a permanent basis green space, natural features, and prime agricultural lands; decrease or minimize non-point-source pollution impacts by reducing the amount of impervious surfaces in site development; promote cost savings in infrastructure installation by reducing the size, length and impact on infrastructure; provide opportunities for social interaction in park space and pedestrian-friendly areas; and promote higher aesthetic standards in land development similar in use and intensity to the standards of the existing zoning district. The planning commission shall have the authority to modify zoning and land development standards as specified in Section 4.6 to further the intent. 
(2)	Type "B" PD-Planned Development District. The purpose of the Planned Development District tool in the City of Hanahan is to encourage variety and flexibility in the use and development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to improve design, character and quality of new development; to facilitate the provision of streets and utilities; to preserve natural and scenic features in open space; to allow the developer to meet changes in technology and demand; to provide a maximum choice in types of housing, shopping, and community environment; and to promote higher aesthetic standards for land development in the City of Hanahan. The developer shall own the responsibility to propose alternate zoning and land development standards that further these objectives and, furthermore, to illustrate the envisioned land development that necessitates alternate standards as an official master plan for review by the planning commission and approval of the city council. The proposed text and master plan shall identify all community facilities necessitated by the development to meet the intent of the Hanahan Zoning and Land Development ordinances, including but not limited to roads and parking, parks and open space, natural and cultural resources, and education and public safety facility sites. 
(B)	Naval Weapons Station compatibility. This zone intends to ensure that the development of land adjacent to the U.S. Naval Weapons Station (NWS) coexists with its military neighbor, an important employer in the Hanahan area as well as a vital component of national defense. The base commander shall be notified and have the opportunity to comment on rezoning and major land development in this federal military installation overlay zone in accordance with Title 6, Chapter 29, Article 13 of South Carolina Code. 
(C)	Design control. The planning commission may recommend and the city council may approve overlay districts within the City of Hanahan in which the developer must propose buildings and land developments to the design control committee for review and approval. A design control overlay district does not modify the zoning standards of the underlying zoning district; rather, it requires the proposal to meet objectives specified by the text of that specific overlay district through qualitative review of the functionality and aesthetic quality of the building or land development design. At a minimum, the proposal shall be reviewed with the considerations specified in Section 3.9 of this ordinance. 
4.2. - Official zoning map. 
(A)	Designation of zoning districts. All land within the corporate limits of the City of Hanahan is hereby divided into districts as described herein and as depicted on the accompanying document, the City of Hanahan Official Zoning Map. The Zoning Map, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared part of this ordinance. 
(B)	Zoning map to be made official. The zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the zoning administrator, and shall bear the words, "Official Zoning Map, City of Hanahan, SC," together with the most recent date of amendment. The zoning map shall be located in the city hall and be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land, water areas, and buildings and other structures in the City of Hanahan. No changes of any nature shall be made on the official zoning map except in conformity with the procedures set forth in Section 2.4 of this ordinance. Any unauthorized change shall be considered a violation of this ordinance and shall be punishable as provided by law. 
(C)	Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, railroads, utility easements, and alleys shall be construed as following such centerlines; 
(2)	Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines and town limits of incorporation shall be construed as following such lines; and 
(3)	Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
(D)	Change of city boundaries. All territory hereafter annexed to the City of Hanahan shall be zoned conservation/preservation unless the petitioner for annexation and the Hanahan City Council agree that another zone may apply upon annexation by ordinance and that such alternative proposed zoning is in compliance with the Hanahan Comprehensive Plan. The process for zoning amendment, Section 2.4, shall apply. 
(E)	City of Hanahan Official Map. The zoning map may be a component of an Official Map, provided for in South Carolina Code § 6-29-340-B-2-c, which the Hanahan Planning Commission may prepare for adoption by city council to illustrate locations of existing and future community facilities. 
4.3. - Land use table. 
    The table beginning on the following page indicates land uses allowed by district. Uses and their function codes (as designated by the American Planning Association) are listed in the two (2) left columns. All unlisted uses that do not fall under a broader category are prohibited. Hanahan zones appear at the table head. One (1) of the following symbols corresponds with each listed use and zone. 
(A)	"-" indicates that the corresponding use is not allowed in the zone. 
(B)	"P" (permitted) indicates that the corresponding use is allowed as the primary use by right in the zone. Only one (1) primary use shall be allowed per tax map number. 
(C)	"C" (conditional) indicates that the corresponding use is allowed with conditions in the zone that are unique to the use. Those conditions are specified in the standards of the zone. 
(D)	"A" (accessory) indicates that the corresponding use may occur only in conjunction with a primary use on a parcel. 
(E)	"SE" indicates that the corresponding use may be allowed by special exception in the zone. The applicant proposing the use must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Hanahan Board of Zoning Appeals that, in developing the use, potential negative impacts of the use will be mitigated.

4.4. - Accessory uses and structures. 
4.4.1.   In general.
(A)	Accessory uses. Uses customary and incidental to the function of the primary use-that for which a zoning permit is sought or in hand-are allowed by right, except as otherwise provided herein. 
(B)	Accessory structures. One (1) or more structures accommodating accessory uses shall be no larger in total floor area than half that of the primary structure (the structure occupied by the primary use), shall occupy no more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the total lot area, and shall not exceed the height of the principal structure on the parcel by more than fifty (50) percent. Structures in excess of these limitations shall be considered primary structures occupied by primary land uses. 
(C)	Accessory vehicle parking. All vehicle parking provided for use by patrons, occupants, or other users of structures on the same parcel of land shall be considered incidental. Parking for a structure located on another parcel shall be considered an accessory use to the structure only when a legal agreement or easement exists that specifies the parking area is for the exclusive use of the structure to which the parking is accessory. Vehicle parking as a primary land use is a personal service (Land Use Code 2600) and is allowed according to the land use table. 
(Ord. No. 5-2010, § 1, 7-13-2010) 
4.4.2.   Accessories for single-family detached residences.
(A)	Accessory structures shall be no larger than fifty (50) percent of the house in gross floor area. Any non-residential use of the structure shall comply with Section 9.4. 
(B)	Pools and tennis courts and their appurtenant or integral structures-including but not limited to walls, equipment rooms, cabanas, decks, and skirts-shall not encroach required yards, except as provided herein. Pools and tennis courts shall be fenced or otherwise protected from human intrusion; such fencing or other screening need not meet setback requirements provided it is not integral to the pool, tennis court, or appurtenant structure. 
(Ord. No. 5-2010, § 1, 7-13-2010) 
4.4.3.   Accessory dwelling unit.
(A)	A dwelling unit accessory to a single-family detached home shall be a permanent structure no larger than six hundred (600) square feet in heated floor area. 
(B)	A dwelling unit accessory to a non-residential use shall be located above the primary use and shall be no larger in heated floor area than the primary use or twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet, whichever is less. 
4.5. - Standards by zone. 
4.5.1.   Administration of standards.
    This section specifies building and lot standards applicable to each zone in the City of Hanahan. All standards found herein are specific to the zone and shall be applied in addition to or, rarely, in place of standards that apply to all property in the city. Each zone includes basic standards, which shall be interpreted and enforced as follows. 
(A)	Minimum lot area: Lots proposed in a zoning district shall meet or exceed the minimum land area required. Non-residential lots may be required to be larger than residential lots in a zoning district. A non-residential land use shall not be proposed on an existing lot smaller in area than that required for a non-residential use. Naturally occurring surface water, wetlands, and land within rights-of-way and ingress/egress easements shall not count toward area required to meet minimum lot size. 
(B)	Minimum lot width: Lots proposed in a zoning district shall meet or exceed the minimum width required from the front boundary of the lot to the rear of the primary structure. The planning commission may allow a reduction in minimum lot width by one-third ( 1/3 ) at the road frontage on the outside of a curved right-of-way boundary, provided the side lot lines are oriented radial to the right-of-way boundary. 
(C)	Minimum setbacks: All structures on a lot shall be sited a distance equal to or greater than the minimum required setbacks from property boundaries for the district, except for the following which may protrude a maximum of twenty-four (24) inches into required setback: an unenclosed, unscreened front porch, portico, or gallery; patios, decks, and balconies; roof eaves, overhangs, and gutters; and stoops and stairs. Other structures not attached to the primary structure, including but not limited to garages, sheds, and other accessory structures shall be located a minimum of five (5) feet from a side or rear property line; provided however that this provision shall neither exempt the builder from meeting the fire code administrated by the City of Hanahan nor allow encroachment of easements on the property. All pools shall be setback a minimum of ten (10) feet, with decking no closer than five (5) feet, from side and rear property lines. 
(D)	Maximum impervious surface ratio: The high ground of the site or land development shall not be covered by structure, paving, and other surfaces impervious to water at a greater proportion than the maximum specified for the zone. Wetlands within a surveyed critical line shall not count toward the pervious proportion of the parcel. 
(E)	Maximum floor/area ratio: The gross floor area of structure shall not exceed the maximum proportion of high ground area specified for the zone in which the site or land development is located. For example, a lot measuring twenty thousand (20,000) square feet in area occupied by structure five thousand (5,000) square feet in gross floor area has a floor/area ratio of twenty-five (25) percent. Wetlands within a surveyed critical line shall not count toward land area for this calculation. 
(F)	Maximum height: The maximum height of structure on the lot shall be measured from mean finished grade to the highest point of structure, with the following exceptions. 
(1)	So as not to penalize a builder proposing a pitched roof, the maximum height shall be measured to the mean height of the roof (mid-span between the roof ridge and eaves). 
(2)	Roof vents, chimneys, cupolas, steeples, belfries, spires, antenna, smokestacks, HVAC equipment, satellite dishes, flagpoles, elevator and stairwell penthouses, an railings required by building code shall be exempt from maximum height limitations. 
(3)	Telecommunications towers shall meet the requirements of Section 5.14. 
(G)	Maximum residential density: The number of dwelling units on a site or land development shall not exceed the maximum per acre of high ground. Wetlands within a surveyed critical line shall not count toward land area for this calculation, except where a permit has been obtained to fill the wetlands.

(f)	Any outdoor storage or overnight parking of commercial vehicles shall be screened from adjoining properties by a landscaped buffer per Section 6.5. 
(E)	Road types. Roads in Town Center zoning districts shall be classified by level and mode of public activity. The purpose is to control the type and frequency of access to the road by motor vehicles and to prioritize the road to be addressed by building façades. Those roads with higher levels of pedestrian activity (existing and planned) must offer greater protection and higher levels of service to pedestrians through restricted access and multi-modal design. Other roads are thus more appropriate for service vehicle access. Roads shall be mapped by type on the official zoning map. New roads proposed in a major land development shall indicate road types in each stage of land development review. Roads shall be classified as follows: 
(1)	Type "A" is the most public road, with heavy traffic, both residential and commercial. It is a central artery of the district and serves as a gathering place within the district. Commercial and institutional uses are most appropriate along this road type. Pedestrian access, mobility, and safety shall be prioritized over vehicular mobility. 
(2)	Type "B" roads are moderately trafficked, primarily by residents and prospective patrons of the district. Office and residential uses are most appropriate along this road type. Pedestrian access, mobility, and safety shall be prioritized over vehicular mobility. 
(3)	Type "C" roads prioritize vehicular access for commercial uses. This road type typically functions in tandem with a Type "A" road to separate needed truck access from the pedestrian environment of the district's gathering place. 
(4)	Type "D" roads are alleys, intended for immediate access to and parking "for all uses. Parcels with alley frontage typically have frontage on a Type "A" or Type "B" road as well. 
(F)	Town Center-A Design District. The Hanahan Design Control Committee, as provided in Chapter 3 of this ordinance, shall have the authority to issue certificates of appropriateness to projects that successfully meet design criteria. In the Town Center zoning districts, many projects are eligible for administrative review and shall conform to a set of quantitative design standards specified. Design review will apply to projects of or greater than a certain size, scale, or use that necessitates higher scrutiny through qualitative consideration, according to the following table: 
Eligible for Administrative Review Design Control Committee (DCC) 
Purview  All projects with a building footprint larger than five thousand (5,000) square feet  Most projects with a building footprint of five thousand (5,000) square feet or less  All projects with more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of floor space  Most projects with ten thousand (10,000) square feet of floor space or less  All projects on more than an acre of land  Most projects on an acre or less of land  Any residential project with more than one (1) dwelling unit  Proposed land uses not specifically assigned to DCC  Motor vehicle rental, sales or service establishments  Any renovation or improvement project worth less than fifty (50) percent of the structure's appraised value  Wholesale trade establishments  Signage with twenty (20) square feet or less of display area  Any establishment with outside sales covering more than two thousand (2,000) square feet  Signage more than fifty (50) square feet of display area  
(G)	Design control committee objectives for the Town Center Zone. 
(1)	Objectives of principle. In addition to those objectives set forth in provisions establishing the design control committee, the committee shall promote the following in Town Center districts: 
(a)	A safe, interconnected transportation system in which motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians can freely and leisurely travel to, from, and within a TC district; 
(b)	Adequate and safe access for commercial vehicles, which may be accomplished via rear alleys to improve the public realm of Yeamans Hall Road in accordance with objective (a), above; 
(c)	An integrated built environment where aesthetics, circulation, and private property frame a cohesive public space, which consists of but is not dominated by Yeamans Hall Road; 
(d)	A comprehensive outdoor environment that is complimented, not dominated or diluted by signage, illumination, landscaping, and stormwater management features; 
(e)	A unified whole whereby the aesthetics of a TC district combine to create a sense of place, as opposed to a disorderly assortment of individual establishments, through coordinated building and landscaping materials; smooth transitions in building scale; and visually expressed arrival points; 
(f)	A quality mixed use environment where land uses are arranged in complimentary fashion so as to reduce conflicts caused by the negative externalities light, noise, odor, and vibration; and 
(g)	A district of Hanahan that not only meets the letter of zoning code but the intent as well. 
(2)	Objectives of practice. In addition to those objectives set forth in provisions establishing the design control committee, the committee shall promote the following in a Town Center district. 
(a)	Pedestrian facilities shall be connected across property boundaries and are not interrupted or rendered uncomfortable or unsafe by design or automobile traffic. 
(b)	Automobile parking shall not dominate the landscape and contribute to visual blight in the district. Parking should appear as well as function as ancillary to the primary use of land on a given parcel. 
(c)	A Town Center district shall be a place people are traveling to rather than through. Streets, driveways, and parking stalls shall be designed around buildings, walkways, and people. 
(d)	Buildings, landscaping, signage, and other improvements shall be in scale with their surroundings and at a scale intended for the pedestrian, not the automobile. Those buildings, which by monolithic or monotonous size or appearance, dominate nearby properties in scale shall be fit into the district with buffers and setbacks that soften the disparity with adjacent conditions. 
(e)	Those land uses generating negative externalities shall be buffered and/or enclosed inasmuch as possible to reduce conflicts with neighboring properties. The use and enjoyment of residential and retail property shall be safeguarded against truck traffic, light, noise, and vibration.

(C)	At least fifteen (15) percent of buildable land shall be dedicated as green space for purposes of natural and cultural resource conservation and/or recreation and social interaction in order to meet the intent of the Type "A" PD-Conservation Development. The planning commission shall be authorized to require a greater percentage of land to be conserved to further the purposes of this planned development tool and the Zoning Ordinance as a whole. The greater percentage of green space shall be commensurate with increased deviation from base zoning standards. 
(D)	The land for which a Type "A" Planned Development is proposed shall retain the underlying zoning district(s). All principal and accessory uses allowed in the zoning district(s) shall be allowed in proposed planned developments. 
(E)	The maximum impervious surface ratio, floor area ratio, and residential density (units per acre), all of which regulate the intensity of development, shall be applied to the entire Land Development rather than to any individual lot.

No modifications and waivers afforded the original planned development shall apply. 
(D)	The developer proposing a conservation subdivision shall make adequate provisions for ownership and maintenance of conserved green space to reasonably ensure that it cannot be re-subdivided in the future. At a minimum, a deed restriction preventing further subdivision of green space shall be noted on the final plat. The planning commission may initiate rezoning of the green space to a conservation/preservation district upon final plat approval. 
4.6.3.   Conservation development architectural design provisions.
(A)	The developer proposing a Type "A" Planned Development shall meet design criteria intended to minimize monotony in development, which is potentially more acute in a development with smaller lots. 
(1)	The applicant shall be encouraged to submit a narrative regarding the originality and innovation of the development, including architectural guidelines, subdivision master planning, and natural and recreational amenities. The narrative should include plans and façade elevations or renderings of prospective structures in the development. The narrative should also illustrate or discuss variations in cladding colors and materials of prospective structures. The narrative, where submitted shall not be a regulatory instrument, but provided to the planning commission for information only. The preliminary land development plan, as approved by the planning commission, shall dictate. 
(2)	The developer shall be encouraged to submit covenants and restrictions proposed for the property owners association that include the design regulations specified herein; although, these shall also be considered for information only. Building design regulations shall be enforced upon application to the City of Hanahan for zoning and/or building permits. 
(B)	Front yards provided in a conservation development shall not be uniform. 
(1)	Façades of multi-unit structures, such as townhouses, offices, and retail spaces, shall fluctuate by a minimum of two (2) feet forward or backward from unit to unit so as to articulate each unit as individual and independent. 
(2)	Front yards of single-family detached residences and duplexes should vary as well. At a minimum, homebuilders should be encouraged to include front porches or porticos to accomplish variation. 
(C)	Garage doors facing the right-of-way shall not be forward of the primary entrance (i.e., "front") door of a residential unit in relation to the right-of-way. This standard shall not apply to alleys. 
(D)	Single-family residential lots less than forty (40) feet wide shall be provided with access via alley to the rear or by shared driveways meeting Hanahan Land Development Ordinance standards. 
(E)	Front and side elevations of all primary buildings shall be at least ten (10) percent void, except where disallowed by fire code, as adopted and enforced by the City of Hanahan.

(H)	For multi-unit structures with pitched roofs and eaves, ridges and eaves shall not continue uninterrupted from unit to unit. 
4.7. - Type "B" PD--Planned Development Districts. 
4.7.1.   General provisions.
(A)	A Planned Development District is a zoning district proposed by the developer in place of existing zoning classifications applied to the land proposed for development. This Type "B" PD differs from a Type "A" PD in that existing zoning standards are replaced rather than modified. The developer may therefore propose alternative land uses and development intensities. Rezoning-legislative action taken by Hanahan City Council-is therefore necessary for final approval of a Type "B" PD, a Planned Development District. 
(B)	The applicant proposing a Planned Development District in the City of Hanahan shall achieve all of the standards of this section in good faith and shall demonstrate intent of achieving such standards and document how they will be achieved in writing and through illustration. 
(C)	It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate why zoning and land development standards of the City of Hanahan otherwise applicable should be modified or replaced by the provisions of the proposed Planned Development District. The applicant shall document exceptions or variations to existing zoning and land development regulations essential to the project in terms of site, design, or dimensional requirements. 
(D)	The proposed land uses, development intensities, and associated standards shall be consistent with all policies and goals of the City of Hanahan Comprehensive Land Use Plan. 
(E)	The proposal shall efficiently and effectively program the use of land in a manner that preserves natural amenities and environmentally sensitive features to the greatest extent possible. 
(F)	The proposal shall not negatively alter the existing prevailing character of an adjacent neighborhood or district by initiating a high concentration of intense uses, a high volume of heavy truck traffic, a scale of the development that dwarfs neighboring properties or disrupts community aesthetics, or degradation and loss of natural resources in and adjacent to the city. 
(G)	The proposed development shall not create any externalities-obtrusive, disruptive, intrusive, or excessive light, odor, noise, or vibration-beyond the boundaries of the Planned Development District. 
(H)	The proposed Planned Development District with residential and/or retail components shall include pedestrian-friendly circulation, building scale, and aesthetics and for future occupants to allow the opportunity to walk within the City of Hanahan and to preempt the necessity of driving within the built-out Planned Development District. 
(I)	The land proposed for development shall adjoin and have full access to all public infrastructure and services available in the City of Hanahan-roads, water and sewer service, stormwater drainage, etc. The responsibility of providing the improvements necessary to serve the development shall be that of the applicant. The proposal shall, where possible, enhance connectivity of infrastructure and minimize dead-end infrastructure lines (roads, water and sewer lines, etc.) by accessing infrastructure networks available along road frontages and adjoining land developments. 
4.7.2.   Minimum requirements for Planned Development Districts.
(A)	the following shall be required for consideration of a tract of land for a Type "B" Planned Development. 
(1)	Minimum district size: Two (2) acres. A Planned Development District may need to be larger than two (2) acres to meet the next standard, "district location." 
(2)	District location. So as to avoid illegal spot zoning, a Planned Development District shall be located in an area that can be justified as a distinct district based on the characteristics of the land, access to infrastructure, and juxtaposition of zoning districts in the vicinity. 
(3)	Minimum public infrastructure. The area proposed for a Planned Development District shall have direct access to public infrastructure systems-roads, potable water, sewer, stormwater drainage, etc.-in a location where the infrastructure systems can adequately accommodate increases in demand reasonably expected to be generated by development within the PDD. Alternatively, the developer shall propose to upgrade the infrastructure systems accordingly. Proposed improvements need not be limited to infrastructure segments abutting the property; the broader system shall be upgraded to offset negative impacts to surrounding districts. 
(B)	The following minimum requirements shall be met by the approved development upon completion. 
(1)	The Planned Development District shall include setbacks and/or buffering from adjoining districts of significantly lower development intensity. Specific dimensions of setbacks and buffering shall be proposed by the applicant and reviewed by the planning commission. 
(2)	The Planned Development District shall include provisions to protect natural and cultural resources, provide adequate buffering thereof, and designate adequate park space for recreation and social interaction as appropriate for the land uses and development intensities proposed. Specific dimensions, acreages, and locations shall be proposed by the applicant and reviewed by the planning commission. 
(C)	Improvements required by the City of Hanahan shall be limited to capital projects necessary to ensure preservation of pre-existing levels of service in Hanahan. In the event that the proposed planned development can be expected to create a proportional need for upgraded capital facilities, Section 5.18 of the Hanahan Land Development Ordinance: "Adequate, Oversized, and Off-site Improvements" shall prevail. 
4.7.3.   Procedures for review and Approval.
(A)	The developer proposing a Type "B" Planned Development is encouraged to prepare a sketch plan per Section 3.1 of the Hanahan Land Development Ordinance. 
(B)	The Developer shall submit a district name (e.g., Crossroads Planned Development District), statement of intent, illustration of existing conditions, Master Development Plan, and set of regulatory provisions for the proposed Planned Development District suitable for adoption by ordinance by the City of Hanahan. These materials shall be submitted to the Hanahan Zoning Administrator as components of the completed application for rezoning per Section 2.4 of this ordinance. 
(C)	The Planned Development District (PDD) shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved as rezoning for the affected property according to the process set forth in Section 2.4. If the Hanahan City Council approves the PDD and adopts it by ordinance, the Master Development Plan shall be considered part of the Hanahan Official Zoning Map by reference. The statement of intent and regulatory provisions shall be the zoning standards for the district and a subsection of the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance. 
(D)	Failure of the applicant to gain approval from the city council as a Planned Development District shall result in the property under consideration remaining in the zoning district existing at the time of application. 
4.7.4.   Requirements for illustration of existing conditions.
    The applicant shall submit ten (10) copies of an illustration of existing conditions for the proposed development, legibly drawn at a scale that clearly communicates the information required, typically no smaller than one (1) inch equals two hundred (200) feet (one (1?) = two hundred (200 ')), that includes the following information: 
(A)	General information. 
(1)	Title block, including the following: 
(a)	Proposed name of development;

(2)	Understorey trees may substitute for up to half of the required overstorey trees, at the discretion of the developer, at a two-to-one ratio (2:1). If the chosen understorey tree is Sabal Palmetto, the ratio shall increase to three to one (3:1). 
(3)	Preservation of existing trees may count toward these requirements. 
6.5. - Landscaping provisions for off-street parking, loading, and vehicular use areas. 
(A)	Trees shall be preserved or planted within and/or around the vehicular use and parking area to ensure that all parking stalls are within fifty (50) feet of a tree. Trees on adjacent property shall not contribute to this requirement. 
(B)	In the event that the above requirement triggers a tree to be planted within a parking area, the tree shall be planted in a bed of at least two hundred (200) square feet in area. The planting area shall be supplemented by at least six (6) small shrubs or twenty (20) ornamental groundcover plants, such as flowers. 
(C)	A landscaped buffer at least eight (8) feet in depth shall be provided along the perimeter of all off-street parking, loading, and vehicular use areas. Minimum required landscaping shall consist of four (4) trees and twenty-five (25) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet of buffer. 
(1)	The landscaped buffer may be reduced to five (5) feet for parking, loading, and vehicular use areas greater than thirty (30) feet from property boundaries. Minimum required landscaping shall consist of two (2) trees and fifteen (15) shrubs per linear feet of buffer. 
(2)	The depth shall increase to ten (10) feet to buffer loading areas and vehicle service areas within thirty (30) feet of property boundaries. Minimum required landscaping shall consist of five (5) trees and thirty (30) shrubs per linear feet of buffer. 
(3)	Sabal palmettos may substitute for required trees at a two-to-one (2:1) ratio. 
(4)	Land between the buffer and property boundaries shall be left in a natural vegetative state or landscaped with turf grass, at a minimum. 
(5)	The buffer may be interrupted by an occupiable structure, walkways accessing the structure, and a driveway providing access to the property. 
(D)	For off-street parking areas with more than forty (40) stalls, the buffer between the off-street parking, loading, and vehicular use areas and the adjacent road right-of-way shall be supplemented by one (1) of the following or a combination thereof.

6.6. - General landscaping standards. 
(A)	The zoning administrator shall be authorized to modify buffer requirements of this ordinance if it [is] determined that: 
(1)	Buffers will not serve any useful purpose due to the fact that masonry walls, berms, or landscaping of at least equivalent height, opacity, and maintenance already exist on the adjacent parcel. 
(2)	The area of required buffer would exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the site proposed for development. 
(B)	A sight triangle shall be maintained at all road intersections or intersections of driveways with roads. Trees shall be allowed as long as, except during early growth stages, only the trunk is visible between the ground and six (6) feet above the ground. Shrubbery or other low growing plants are allowed provided the maximum height at maturity shall not exceed twenty-four (24) inches.

7. - TREE PROTECTION 

7.1. - Intent. 
    Pursuant to authority conferred by the South Carolina Code of Laws, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare; to reduce noise, heat and glare; to reduce air pollution; to prevent soil erosion; to improve surface drainage and minimize flooding; to prevent excessive and unsightly clearing of wooded tracts of land and to promote tree conservation and preservation; to ensure that noise, glare and other distractions of movement on one (1) area not adversely affect activity within other adjacent areas; to beautify and enhance improved and undeveloped land; to provide a protective physical and psychological barrier between pedestrians and traffic; to create special places that are inviting; to create a civic identity; to counteract the heat stand effect; to encourage energy and water conservation; to protect the wildlife habitat and sensitive ecosystems; to enhance real estate and economic values; to ensure that excessive tree cutting does not reduce property values; to minimize the cost of construction and maintenance of drainage systems necessitated by the increased flow and diversion of surface waters; to encourage the proliferation and replacement of trees on public and private property; and to allow trees to attain their natural shape and size while growing to maturity, the city council does hereby ordain and enact into law this tree protection chapter. The provisions herein shall not be interpreted to prohibit or unduly inhibit development of private property. 
7.2. - Business licensing. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person who is being paid a fee for the business of planting, cutting, trimming, pruning, removing, or otherwise modifying trees within the City of Hanahan to conduct such business without first signing an affidavit stating that he/she has received and read the Tree Protection Ordinance and 1995 ANSI A300 Standards. Such affidavit shall be completed and submitted when making application for or renewing a City of Hanahan business license. 
7.3. - Protected Trees. 
(A)	The following trees shall be considered "protected" by the City of Hanahan for the purposes of this ordinance: 
(1)	Trees planted or retained to meet the requirements of the Hanahan Zoning and Land Development Ordinances. 
(2)	All species of trees that are eight (8) inches or more in diameter at breast height (DBH). 
(3)	All trees declared to be "landmark" trees per Section 7.4 below. 
(B)	On the lot of a single-family detached, single-family attached, or individually sited manufactured home, the following trees shall be exempt from the tree protection requirements of this ordinance: 
(1)	All trees in the proposed buildable area or driveway, excluding "landmark" trees. 
(2)	Up to twenty-five (25) percent of "protected" trees, excluding landmark trees, outside of the proposed buildable area or driveway. 
(3)	Pines (pinus), sweet gums (liquidamber styraciflua), wax myrtles (myrica cerifera), and crepe myrtles (lagerstromia indica). 
(4)	Dead trees or trees badly damaged by accident, storm, fire, or infestation. 
(C)	On the lot of multi-family residential and nonresidential uses, the following trees shall be exempt from tree protection requirements of this ordinance; provided that in no instance shall there be fewer than twenty (20) trees per acre or less than twenty (20) trees per acre with a combined DBH greater than or equal to one hundred sixty (160) inches per acre retained. 
(1)	All trees in the proposed buildable area, driveway, or other required site improvements, excluding "landmark" trees and those protected trees located within required setback or buffer areas whichever is greater, not to exceed sixty-five (65) percent of the entire site. 
(2)	Pines (pinus), sweet gums (liquidamber styraciflua), wax myrtles (myrica cerifera), and crepe myrtles (lagerstromia indica). 
(3)	Dead trees or trees badly damaged by accident, storm, fire, or infestation. 
(Ord. No. 7-2012, § 1, 1-8-2013) 
7.4. - Landmark trees. 
(A)	The city hereby declares the following trees greater than or equal to the stated diameter at breast height to be "landmark trees" with the preservation standards provided above those for "protected trees." 
SPECIES COMMON NAME DBH Juniperus virginiana Eastern Red Cedar 24? Magnolia grandiflora Southern Magnolia 24? Quercus virginiana Live Oak 24? Quercus laurifolia Laurel Oak 24? Quercus phellos Willow Oak 24? Acer rubrum Red Maple 24? Taxodium distichum Bald Cypress 24? Ilex opaca American Holly 10? Cornus florida Flowering Dogwood 8? Carya Hickory (except Pecan) 24?  
(B)	All trees not listed above, but greater than thirty-six (36) inches in diameter at breast height and protected under Section 7.3 above, shall be considered "landmark" trees for the purposes of this ordinance. 
7.5. - Preservation of protected and landmark trees. 
(A)	It shall be unlawful to cut or otherwise destroy a protected tree or landmark tree without first obtaining a tree removal permit or, for property development, a zoning permit. 
(B)	Unless specifically authorized by the zoning administrator, no person shall intentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant, or remove any protected or landmark tree; attach any signs with rope, wire, nails, or other contrivance to any protected or landmark tree; allow any substance which is harmful to such trees to come in contact with them or be placed within their drip line over pervious areas; or intentionally set fire or allow any fire to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any protected tree or landmark tree. 
(C)	The developer shall ensure, to the extent practical, that site and land developments are planned, designed, and constructed to maximize retention of existing trees. Protected trees and especially landmark trees shall be located in common areas and in required buffers and yards to the extent practical. 
7.6. - Tree survey required for development. 
7.6.1.   General provisions.
(A)	The developer shall document protected and landmark trees on the property proposed for development. Two (2) survey methods are provided herein. The developer of property ten (10) acres or more in area shall have the option to utilize "standard" or "sampling" survey method for protected trees. Landmark trees shall always be surveyed using the standard method. 
(B)	A required tree survey shall appear on all preliminary land development plans, site development plans, and any engineering and building site plans showing the installation and construction of improvements and structures. 
(C)	Tree surveying shall not be required on tracts reserved for later phases or future development, on residual tracts of land, or in wetlands proposed to remain undisturbed. 
7.6.2.   Standard tree survey.
(A)	All protected and landmark trees shall be surveyed and graphically indicated on the appropriate development plan. The graphic indications shall be labeled by species and diameter at breast height. 
(B)	Critical root zones and drip lines of protected and landmark trees should be surveyed and illustrated as well. In the absence of specific root zones and drip lines, the plan shall illustrate a graphical representation of the drip line, which shall be a circle centered at the trunk of the tree equal in feet to the diameter at breast height in inches. (e.g., a twenty-four-foot-diameter drip line shall encircle a tree labeled "twenty-four-inch live oak".) 
(C)	The survey shall indicate those portions of critical root zones and drip lines of trees on abutting properties that overlap the subject property, to the extent that such drip lines and critical root zones can be determined from the vantage point of the property to be developed. This provision shall not authorize the trespass on other private property abutting the subject site. 
(D)	The development plan shall graphically indicate which trees are proposed to be removed, retained, and retained with pruning. 
7.6.3.   Tree sampling survey.
(A)	The intent of the tree sampling survey of protected trees is to relieve the developer of the burden of a complete tree survey for all protected trees, which may be numerous, but to encourage the preservation of clusters of protected trees of greater value in a specific portion or section of a tract or in a natural state. Typically, those trees with greater value on a given site are mature, bottomland, and hardwood, while immature upland pines are of little value to the City of Hanahan. The planning commission will consider an immature upland pine forest a suitable site for development. 
(B)	The tree sampling survey of protected trees shall supplement the standard survey of landmark trees. The sampling survey shall indicate the type of groundcover present on each acre of property required to be surveyed. Sampling shall therefore occur once per acre, evenly distributed throughout the property. Groundcover types to be documented on the appropriate development plan include, but are not limited to "cleared," "sandy area," "scrub/shrub," "bottomland hardwood forest," "upland hardwood forest," "bottomland mixed forest," "upland mixed forest," "bottomland pine forest," "upland pine forest," and "marshland." 
(C)	Forests shall be surveyed for predominant species types, approximate average age, approximate average tree diameter at breast height, and frequency or density of trees. The sample shall consider all trees, from immature trees to landmark trees. These findings shall be documented per sample and indicated on the development plan. 
(D)	Forested areas shall be indicated on the plan via hatching or other graphic method as whether they are proposed to be cleared or retained. The developer shall tabulate the approximate number of trees in proposed cleared forests, which shall be the basis for the tree removal mitigation strategy set forth in Section 7.7. 
7.7. - Tree removal mitigation. 
(A)	A developer shall propose a tree planting schedule to replace all protected and landmark trees cleared for property development as defined in Sections 7.3 and 7.4. Trees planted shall be proposed in landscaped buffers, common areas, road rights-of-way, and/or other portions of the developed site. To the extent practical, replacement trees shall be the same species and diversity as those removed, and shall be suitable for Botanical Zone 8B (as suggested in Appendix I). The number and size of mitigation trees shall be in accordance with the table below. 
Each Exiting Tree 
Removed... Will Be Replaced By... Replacement Tree Size... 1 tree, 8-16? DBH 3 trees 2? in Caliper 1 tree, over 16-24? DBH (excluding landmark trees as defined per Section 7.4) 5 trees 3? in Caliper 1 tree, over 24-36? DBH (excluding landmark trees as defined per Section 7.4) 8 trees 3? in Caliper *All landmark trees 
(as defined per Section 7.4) 10 trees 4? in Caliper All protected or landmark trees removed without an approved permit shall be mitigated at twice the requirement listed above  
(B)	Existing trees, mitigation trees and/or planted buffer trees required in accord with Section 6.4 shall be applied towards the required minimum of twenty (20) trees per acre or less than twenty (20) trees with a combined DBH greater than or equal to one hundred sixty (160) inches per acre requirement. 
(C)	If planting trees required for mitigation schedule or to meet the minimum in (B) above is not practical due to site constraints, the developer may opt to pay a fee in lieu of required trees, or, at the discretion of the zoning administrator, plant trees at an off-site location identified on the Community Tree Planting Plan adopted by city council. The amount of the fee shall be equivalent to the value of the required tree. The City of Hanahan Community Tree Planting Plan may provide alternate fees that secure adequate funds to plant required trees elsewhere in the city, as provided for in the plan. 
(D)	All newly planted vegetative material shall be guaranteed to meet American Standards for Nursery Stock at time of planting and for one year thereafter. Maintenance and replacement of damaged, destroyed, or dead plant materials shall be the responsibility of the property owner, or in the case of mitigation trees planted off-site, the responsibility of the developer. 
(Ord. No. 7-2012, § 1, 1-8-2013) 
Editor's note- Appendix I has been set out at the end of this chapter. 
7.8. - City of Hanahan Community Tree Planting Plan and Funding. 
(A)	The Hanahan Planning Commission shall prepare and the Hanahan City Council shall adopt a community tree planting plan prior to the collection of any fees in lieu of required tree removal mitigation. At a minimum, the plan shall specify locations proposed for reforestation and aesthetic tree plantings, which may include public parks, schools and other community facilities and rights-of-way. 
(B)	Fees in lieu of trees required in the mitigation plan, per Section 7.7, shall be recorded and maintained in a special account to be known as the City of Hanahan Tree Preservation Account. Monies maintained in this account may accrue interest at short-term rates prevailing in the market. All such funds and accrued interest shall be used, when appropriated by city council, only for the purpose of funding the installation and maintenance of trees within the City of Hanahan, according to the City of Hanahan Community Tree Planting Plan. Funds may be used to obtain trees, other landscaping associated with tree plantings, sprinklers and other items or materials necessary and proper for the preservation, maintenance, relocation, and restoration of tree ecosystems. 
7.9. - Tree protection measures during development. 
    The developer shall take the following measures to protect retained trees during land disturbance, installation of improvements, construction, and other development activities. 
(A)	Clear-cutting shall be prohibited. Clearing of a site for sale or development prior to application for preliminary land development plan approval or a zoning permit shall be prohibited. 
(B)	Protected trees scheduled to remain shall be protected against: 
(1)	Unnecessary cutting, breaking, or skinning of roots; 
(2)	Skinning and bruising of bark; 
(3)	Smothering of trees by stockpiling construction or excavation materials within drip line and critical root zone; 
(4)	Burning of trash or debris within the drip line or critical root zone; 
(5)	Excessive foot or vehicular traffic; 
(6)	Parked vehicles within the drip line and critical root zone; and 
(7)	Grading, filling, ditching, or trenching, except as specifically provided herein. 
(C)	If trees are wounded or stressed during construction, any wounds to the bark should be cleaned to sound wood by removing loose bark and wood, leaving a smooth edge around the wound.

(E)	The developer shall provide water and fertilizer to trees as required to maintain their health during construction work. 
(F)	The developer shall designate one (1) corridor for construction access on the development plan, preferably where the driveway or parking area will be located, and shall limit construction equipment access, material storage, fuel tanks, chemical or cement rinsing, vehicle parking and construction office locations to non-forested areas to the greatest extent practical. 
(G)	No more than thirty (30) percent of the area within the drip line and critical root zone of the tree shall be disturbed for access to the construction site, installation of improvements or other construction, except as specifically approved by the planning commission or the design control committee on a development plan under its purview. 
(1)	The developer shall submit documentation from a professional landscape architect or arborist that any disturbance beyond thirty (30) percent can be mitigated and that the tree will survive and remain healthy despite the intrusion. 
(2)	All segments of roots removed during development shall be severed clean and a two-inch layer of mulch shall be applied over the surface of remaining exposed roots during development. 
(H)	The developer shall erect temporary barricades at the drip lines of all trees or groups of trees, except where approved development plans propose installation of improvements or other construction per subsection (G), above. 
(1)	The barricade is to be at least three (3) feet high and shall be of adequate structure to prevent removal or failure by natural causes. Two-by-four lumber construction of barricades is recommended. Approval by the zoning administrator shall be required for alternate methods. 

(2)	The barricade shall be posted as "tree protection zone" or similarly visibly designated. Orange fencing common to construction sites in the Lowcountry is recommended. 
(3)	Nothing shall be stored within the barricades, including but not limited to construction material, machinery, chemical, or temporary soil deposits. 
(I)	Any actions that cause the death or removal of trees during development for which approval was not received shall result in a violation of this ordinance AND shall necessitate mitigation for the loss of the tree, per Section 7.7. 
7.10. - Issuance of tree removal permits. 
7.10.1.   General provisions.
    A person who seeks to remove a tree outside the context of property development shall apply for a tree removal permit, which shall be required to authorize the removal of the tree. The permit shall be authorized only for the following trees or conditions. 
(A)	Trees that may threaten health or property. 
(B)	Diseased or infectious trees and trees in decline. 
(C)	Trees or their root systems causing visible damage to structures or areas used for pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

(B)	The applicant in receipt of a tree removal permit for forest management shall not be eligible to apply for preliminary land development plan approval or a zoning permit within two (2) years of the authorization date of the tree removal permit. 
7.10.3.   Permit review.
(A)	The person seeking to remove a protected tree shall submit a completed application form available from the zoning administrator, together with the fee for review, to the zoning administrator no fewer than five (5) business days prior to removing the tree(s). 
(1)	The completed application shall include the name of the applicant, the name of the property owner of the tree, if different from the applicant, the addresses of each, and the reason(s) for proposed removal of the tree. A professional certification may be used to substantiate the reason for removal, and may be submitted as part of the completed application. 
(2)	One (1) permit covers all trees proposed for removal in the application. 
(B)	The zoning administrator shall review the application and either approve or deny it within five (5) business days. The dated signature of the zoning administrator on the submitted application shall constitute the tree removal permit. 
(1)	The zoning administrator shall be authorized by receipt of the application to visit the site as he deems necessary to inspect for compliance with this section of the Zoning Ordinance. 
(2)	The zoning administrator shall state in writing the reason(s) for denial. A denied application shall be eligible for appeal to the Hanahan Board of Zoning Appeals, per Section 2.3.

(Ord. No. 7-2012, § 1, 1-8-2013) 
7.11. - Tree pruning. 
(A)	Maintenance pruning allows for the healthy uniform growth of a tree. Tree pruning promotes the health and natural growth of the tree. A tree's habit of growth must be considered ahead of time, and pruning must not interfere with any design intent or landscaping upon the tree's installation. 
(B)	The use of unnatural pruning techniques will be considered an unauthorized removal of a tree unless the tree is designated on approved landscape plan to be shaped or formed in an unnatural pattern or to be maintained at a certain height. Examples of unnatural pruning are topping, stubbing, dehorning, or lopping. 
(C)	In the situation where a protected tree or its limbs present a potential hazard to real property, minimal pruning shall be allowed in an effort to prevent negative impacts to public and private property and to provide for public safety. In the case of a hazardous tree, removal may be allowed, per Section 7.10.

8. - SIGNAGE 

8.1. - Intent. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, property values, and general public welfare and promote traffic safety by controlling the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and maintenance of sign and sign structures. The City of Hanahan requires signs to have a quality design, to be pleasing in appearance, and to be appropriate in size, materials and illumination to the type of activity to which they pertain. Signs are to be designed and installed in a manner that complements both the building and the general streetscape. Unless located on a major highway, signs are to be designed to be pedestrian in scale. Signs are permitted on (a) workplace, storefront, civic, and live/work buildings, and (b) on attached residential building projects under common ownership with units for rent, and single-family residential developments. 
8.2. - Sign review. 
8.2.1.   Zoning permit required for most signs.
    A zoning permit is required for the erection, posting, reposting, placing, replacing or hanging of any sign except where specifically noted below. All signs in Design Control Districts for which a zoning permit is required shall be reviewed by the design control committee, per the requirements of Section 3 of this ordinance, for achievement of the design criteria and standards set forth in this ordinance before a permit for the sign will be issued. The zoning administrator must approve all other signs provided they comply with the requirements of this section before the issuance of a zoning permit. A permit shall not be required for routine maintenance and repair. Minor appearance changes limited to less than twenty (20) percent of the total sign area, including change in text, shall not require a zoning permit. 
8.2.2.   Sign documentation for zoning permit.
    The zoning administrator may review signage for compliance with these standards during site development plan review, per Section 2.6, in which case the zoning permit issued for the development would cover the sign. The applicant shall submit ten (10) copies of a scaled illustration legibly depicting the size and content of the sign and its copy on bond or similar paper. The review process for sign erected independent of a site development for which a zoning permit is required shall nevertheless be that specified for the zoning permit, Section 2.6. 
8.3. - Pedestrian-oriented signs. 
    The following regulations apply to signs proposed on property adjacent to all roads except intercity arterial highways with four (4) or more travel lanes, except where alternate standards for signs for certain purposes and land uses are specified. 

8.3.1.   Wall signs.
    Any sign directly attached to an exterior wall of a building or dependent upon a building for its support shall be considered a wall sign. Signs directly painted on wall shall be considered wall signs. Wall-mounted signs are subject to the standards below.

(2)	Any subdivision of land not classified a minor land development shall be a major land development. 
1.9. - Modification of land development standards. 
(A)	Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships derived from practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations and/or that the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve modifications to these land development regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured, provided that the modification does not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations; further provided, the planning commission shall not approve modifications unless it makes findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that all of the following criteria apply: 
(1)	The granting of the modification will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property; 
(2)	The conditions upon which the request is based are unique to the property for which the relief is sought and are not applicable generally to other property;

(4)	The modification sought will not in any manner be in conflict with the provisions of zoning standards of this ordinance or the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(B)	Procedure. The planning commission shall be empowered to modify land development standards in the course of land development review and approval. The developer shall bear the responsibility to demonstrate to the planning commission that the modification sought meets the criteria for modification stated above.

(B)	Familiarize the developer with the land development approval process of the City of Hanahan; 
(C)	Assess the compatibility of the proposed land development with the Hanahan Comprehensive Plan; and 
(D)	Apprise the developer of city, state, and federal standards related to the development of land and their potential applicability to the developer's proposal, including but not limited to:

5.5. - Blocks. 
5.5.1.   Block conditions.
(A)	For the purposes of this ordinance and planning commission's determination of compliance therewith, blocks shall be any area defined by two (2) or more linear elements of vehicular circulation providing access to residential or non-residential units, lots, offices, storefronts etc., including roads, fire lanes, and other drives providing access to and within residential and non-residential communities, including townhouse developments, apartment complexes, commercial and industrial parks, shopping centers, mobile home parks, and other similar land developments. 
(B)	Alleys, parking lot aisles, and other lanes intended for access to covered or uncovered parking stalls and not relied upon for access to residential or non-residential units, lots, offices, storefronts etc., shall not be considered part of the block perimeter. 
(C)	In the event that vehicular circulation does not constitute the entire perimeter of a block, the block shall be considered bounded by adjacent property boundaries and/or drainage ways, including wetlands, for the purpose of considering the size and scale of the block. 
5.5.2.   Block design, orientation, and scale.
(A)	Blocks shall be oriented to complement natural topography, so as to minimize need for grading and clearing of natural resources such as trees. 
(B)	Blocks shall be oriented to complement natural stormwater drainage patterns and wetlands. 
(C)	Blocks shall be sized in proportion to the speed and volume of vehicular and pedestrian traffic expected within those rights-of-way or easements defining the block. 
(D)	Blocks shall be sized in proportion to existing and/or proposed land uses within the block and in proportion to the scale of structures sheltering such land uses. 
(E)	Dimensions for blocks may be specified in zoning districts to ensure the existing or intended scale of the district is achieved and enhanced. 
5.6. - Roads. 
5.6.1.   General road standards.
(A)	Roads shall meet or exceed all design and construction standards provided in AASHTO Green Book: A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 5th Edition, a publication of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, 2001, or most recent edition. 
(B)	The City of Hanahan accepts no roads for public maintenance. Meeting or achieving land development standards for roads in Hanahan implies no acceptance of such roads for public maintenance. The developer seeking to dedicate roads to a public entity shall meet or exceed road standards required by that entity, which may differ from or conflict with Hanahan standards. 
(C)	The developer may choose to deviate from standards of Berkeley County and South Carolina Department of Transportation with good cause, as determined by the planning commission. The developer shall then propose alternative designs for roads and indicate to the planning commission how the designs further the intent of this ordinance, provide better access for all users, are more compatible with adjacent existing and proposed land uses, and/or promote economic development. 
(D)	Proposed roads shall be designed to serve all users, including truckers, automobile drivers, bicyclists, pedestrians, and wheelchair operators. Where possible conflicts may emerge, the road shall be designed for context and proposed use. For example, road design in industrial areas shall promote truck access, whereas road design in neighborhoods shall promote pedestrian access and safety. 
(E)	Roads shall be located so as to minimize loss of natural resources, including trees and wetlands. 
(F)	Proposed road location and design shall account for soils, floodplains, and other natural conditions and adjust accordingly to ensure the longevity and durability of the road.

(I)	Roads shall be constructed to accommodate the type and weight of vehicles routinely expected within the proposed development once it is occupied by permanent users. 
(1)	Roads in wholesale commercial and industrial areas shall be constructed to accommodate heavy-truck traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)	Roads in neighborhood commercial, office, institutional, and residential areas shall be constructed to accommodate private automobile traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(3)	Alleys serving as secondary access to residences shall accommodate minimal local private automobile traffic and may therefore be constructed with a permeable surface, such as gravel, coquina, or other material that minimizes dust and erosion of the road base. 
(4)	All roads except alleys shall be constructed with a hard surface, except where the Developer can demonstrate specific benefits to the City of Hanahan from the construction of permeable surfaces. 
(J)	All roads proposed for construction and improvement shall be equipped with traffic signage consistent with the SC Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways. 
5.6.2.   Road system design standards.
(A)	Proposed roads shall be part of a circulation plan within the proposed development and coordinated with the existing road system of the surrounding area. 
(B)	Proposed roads shall be integrated into the existing system and, where possible, provide for the continuation of the road system into adjacent undeveloped high lands for future development. Such continuations, called road tubs, shall be dedicated as transportation rights-of-way and/or easements that allow for use by the traveling public and utilities for future development of the adjacent land. Road stubs shall be constructed to the same specifications as those for bulk of the road system within the proposed land development. 
(C)	Criteria for provision of road stubs. 
(1)	The planning commission may require road stubs in any major land development to ensure the possibility of a connection to an adjacent undeveloped tract. 
(2)	The commission should require the construction of an existing road stub adjoining a major land development. The developer shall be responsible for completing the road system connection by constructing the road in the easement or right-of-way provided on adjoining property. The constructed road stub shall be integrated into the proposed road system of the major land development. 
(3)	The commission should require road stubs to ensure that blocks do not exceed eight hundred (800) feet in length. 
(4)	Road stubs shall be provided to ensure that no block length exceeds sixteen hundred (1,600) feet. 
(5)	The planning commission may waive road stub requirements so as not to impose undue hardship on the developer in light of the scale of the proposed land development. The commission may further waive this standard where the presence of natural resources or adjacent land use, whether current or future, make adherence to this standard impractical or undesirable. 
5.6.3.   Intersection standards.
(A)	All roads intersecting other roads shall either intersect directly opposite each other or shall be separated by at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from centerline to centerline. 
(B)	All street intersections shall occur at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from any railroad right-of-way, measured from the centerpoint of the intersection perpendicular to the centerline of the railroad right-of-way. 
(C)	All roads shall intersect at angles no less than seventy-five (75) degrees unless a traffic circle or movement controls are proposed to prevent awkward or unsafe turning movements. 
(D)	Turning movements shall be designed to serve the predominant land uses existing or proposed in the surrounding area. Pedestrian crossing distances shall be minimized to the greatest extent practical in residential and retail areas. Turning radii shall be designed to serve truck traffic in industrial areas. 
5.6.4.   Single-terminus road standards.
(A)	Proposed permanent single-terminus roads shall be no longer than four hundred (400) feet, measured from the centerpoint of its intersection, except to provide access to land accessible by no other means due to natural constraints, such as wetlands. 
(B)	Proposed permanent single-terminus roads shall end in a turn-around at least forty (40) feet in radius. The turn-around may have a traversable island of a durable surface and resistant to ponding bounded by a ribbon or mountable curb to ensure the stability and longevity of the adjacent roadway. The minimum lane width of a turnaround shall be sixteen (16) feet. 
(C)	Proposed temporary single-terminus roads providing access to future phases of the same proposed land development or to an adjacent developable tract shall be equipped with either a turn-around specified above or a hammerhead that enables emergency and service vehicles to perform a three-point turn. 
(D)	Proposed single-terminus alleys shall be equipped with a turn-around or a hammerhead. 
(E)	No turn-around or hammerhead feature is required for a temporary single-terminus road provided that such road is less than two hundred (200) feet long and that provides no access to a lot. 
5.6.5.   Existing roads.
(A)	To avoid undue hardship on small landowners and prospective homeowners, a pre-existing road need not be upgraded to meet current standards for a land development that is in all other respects a minor land development, as defined by this ordinance. 
(B)	A major land development relying upon a pre-existing substandard road shall upgrade the road as practical. The planning commission shall determine the extent of upgrades required in its review of the major land development based on the findings of a traffic study, as set forth in Section 3.3, and a cost estimate of upgrades recommended in the study.

Break-away bollards are recommended at the opening to deter motorists but to allow access by emergency response vehicles. 
5.8. - Sanitation service. 
(A)	Curbside pick-up. Land developments proposed for curbside trash pick-up shall be designed so as to minimize backtracking by sanitation vehicles by limiting single-terminus streets and providing two (2) routes of egress from each lot to the exterior of the land development, as practical. 

(B)	Community pick-up. Land developments proposed for community trash pick-up shall locate the dumpster(s) at convenient point(s) of access for users and sanitation vehicles. To the extent practical, dumpsters shall be located along alleys or internal circulation roads that can be easily accessed by sanitation vehicles but that are not easily visible from public view. Where practical, dumpsters shall be located to the rear, and not near the public face, of structures. Screening and buffering per landscaping standards, Section 6.5 of the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance, shall apply. 
5.9. - Parking. 
5.9.1.   General standards.
(A)	All proposed parking areas shall be designed as part of a unified circulation plan that safely and efficiently provides access to each lot, land use, residence, office, shop, or similar unit. Exclusive of natural constraints, parking areas for separate parcels and land uses in a proposed land development shall be accessible to one (1) another so as to allow motorists to pass from one (1) parking area into another without reentering collector or arterial roads or highways. 
(B)	All proposed parking areas shall be designed so that sanitation, emergency, and other public service vehicles can safely and efficiently serve the development for which parking is proposed. 
(C)	Circulation areas shall be designed so that vehicles can proceed safely without posing a danger to pedestrians or parked vehicles. 
(D)	Parking areas shall be constructed of durable all-weather surfaces resistant to ponding, adequate to accommodate regular use by vehicles routinely generated by the proposed development. 
(E)	Access points. 
(1)	A parcel with less than two hundred (200) feet of road frontage shall provide no more than one (1) access point onto the road(s). For the purpose of this provision, an ingress point and a separate egress point shall be considered one (1) access point. 
(2)	A parcel with two hundred (200) feet or more of frontage shall provide no more than two (2) access points onto the road(s). For the purpose of this provision, an ingress point and a separate egress point shall be considered one (1) access point. 
(3)	Multiple parcels in a proposed land development shall be provided with shared access points, where practical, to minimize encroachments into roads, on-street parking, sidewalks, and any required buffers. 

(F)	Parking area landscaping and canopy. Planting requirements for parking areas shall be those found in Section 6.5 of the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance. 
(G)	Loading zones. The developer of a non-residential land development shall make a parking space available to the development as needed by the proposed land use. 
(1)	Each space shall be at least forty (40) feet long and within two hundred (200) feet of the structure served.

(2)	The point of service (e.g., service window) is not a stacking stall. 
(3)	Restaurants shall provide eight (8) stacking stalls. 
(4)	Other land uses with one (1) point of service shall provide two (2) stacking stalls. 
(5)	Other land uses with more than one (1) point of service shall provide one (1) stacking stall per point of service. 
(I)	Off-site parking. The developer who utilizes off-site parking to satisfy parking allocation requirements shall demonstrate to the City Planner, prior to final plat approval, and the Zoning Administrator, prior to receipt of a zoning permit, that off-site parking is available to the land use proposed. This shall be demonstrated by written, attested agreement or a legal easement on the property on which the parking occurs, or the parking area may be a community parking lot, owned and operated by the City of Hanahan or a private community association in accordance with one (1) of the maintenance vehicles provided in this ordinance. 
(J)	Parking as a land use. A parking lot may be the primary use of land on a parcel, per the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance. As long as nearby land uses rely on the off-site parking area per written, attested agreement or easement approved by the City of Hanahan, necessary parking stalls shall not be eliminated. The City of Hanahan shall not be held liable for a regulatory taking for requiring the parcel to remain in use for parking. 
5.9.2.   Parking allocation requirements.
    Each lot, land use, residence, office, shop, or similar unit shall be provided parking according to the schedule below. Parking stalls to satisfy these requirements shall be provided on site, on street, off site, or some combination thereof, as specified in the schedule. 
(A)	Individual zoning districts, including approved Planned Development Districts, may modify parking allocation requirements in this chapter to meet the needs of that zoning district. 
(B)	Off-site parking shall occur within four hundred (400) feet of the structure for which the parking is required. 
(C)	On-street parking shall occur within six hundred (600) feet of the structure for which the parking is required. 
(D)	Commercial and agency vehicles - trucks and company cars - shall be allotted parking stalls in addition to the required number specified in the allocation schedule. 
(E)	High-school administrators may choose to provide parking for high school students. Administrators shall implement a program to limit parking passes so as not to exceed capacity of parking provided. Documentation of such program shall be submitted to the zoning administrator for zoning permit review and approval. 
(F)	A portion of the required stalls shall be accessible to the handicapped to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. For the purposes of this ordinance, one (1) accessible stall shall be required for each land development. In addition, one (1) of every fifty (50) stalls provided shall be accessible. The developer is encouraged to consult standards promulgated by the Act for full compliance. 
(G)	For a land use not specified in the allocation schedule and for which no similar land use is listed, the minimum required number of parking stalls shall be eighty (80) percent of the maximum number of parked vehicles generated by the land use, as found in "Parking Generation," as amended, published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. Alternatively, the developer may generate a study for parking demand specific to the site, the results of which the planning commission may approve as the required number of stalls for the land development.

Notes: For employers with more than one (1) shift, a requirement of one (1) parking stall per employee shall be achieved by providing the number of spaces equal to the number of employees working the largest shift (that utilizing the most employees). 
Some establishments have more than one (2) component with parking requirements. These shall be totaled. For example, a religious institution may have educational or day care service and an assembly hall. 
(H)	Shared parking. One (1) parking area may serve multiple land uses. One (1) land use sharing a parking area with another, disparate land use shall qualify for a reduction in parking stalls required, according to the sharing ratios in the following table. The reduction shall apply to the land use a lower total number of parking stalls otherwise required.

Instructive example: Five thousand (5,000) SF of retail space shares a parking lot with ten thousand (10,000) SF of office space. Thirty (30) stalls are required for the office space. Twenty (20) stalls would be required for the retail space. The latter can be discounted twenty (20) percent, resulting in sixteen (16) required stalls for the retail space, plus thirty (30) stalls for the office space, equals a forty-six-stall parking area. 
5.9.3.   Parking dimensions.
(A)	Off-street parking shall meet the minimum dimensional standards specified in the following chart, except as elsewhere specified.

(C)	Minimum aisle width specified in the table above may be reduced by one (1) foot per three (3) inches of increased curb length. Maximum aisle reduction shall be two (2) feet. In no event shall a two-way aisle be narrower than twenty (20) feet. 
(D)	The planning commission shall uphold good engineering practices and ensure that wider spaces or aisles are incorporated in or near areas of conflict, such as entrances and curves. 
5.9.4. - Driveways. 
(A)	General standards. 
(1)	This section of the ordinance sets design standards for the facility providing access to private property; therefore the term "driveway" shall apply to an internal circulation road as well as a private single-family residential access for the purposes of this section. 
(2)	All land development proposals shall provide vehicular access to the parcel, which shall be accomplished via private access or community access and parking area. 
(3)	Driveways shall be designed with the minimum width necessary to provide safe and efficient vehicle access to the site so as to limit encroachment into pedestrian facilities, bike lanes, and on-street parking, where applicable. 
(4)	Where applicable, the developer shall obtain an encroachment permit from the entity maintaining the road. Successful receipt of an encroachment permit does not constitute approval by the City of Hanahan, which may require standards that differ from the entity issuing the encroachment permit. 
(5)	Stricter driveway standards may be imposed by zoning district. 
(B)	Standards for residential lot with on-site parking for single unit (including house, manufactured housing unit, and some townhouses). 
(1)	The driveway shall be at least eight (8) feet wide and twelve (12) feet wide at the edge of the road or alley serving the lot. 
(2)	The driveway shall be at least sixty (60) feet from the nearest intersection, measured between centerlines and shall be at least twenty (20) feet from the nearest tangent point of an intersection curb or pavement edge. 
(C)	Standards for off-street parking area with fewer than seven (7) stalls. 
(1)	A one-way driveway shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide, a two-way driveway twenty (20) feet wide. 
(2)	The driveway shall be equipped with turning radii, measured at edge of pavement, of at least ten (10) feet.

(1)	A one-way driveway shall be at least twelve (12) feet wide, a two-way driveway twenty (20) feet wide. 
(2)	The driveway shall be equipped with turning radii, measured at edge of pavement, of at least fifteen (15) feet. 
(3)	The driveway shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet from the nearest intersection, measured between centerlines and shall be at least thirty-five (35) feet from the nearest tangent point of an intersection curb or pavement edge. 
5.10. - Illumination of vehicular and pedestrian facilities. 
(A)	The developer shall propose a system of illumination of all roads and adjacent sidewalks within a major land development. Illumination shall provide lighting for the safety of the traveling public without causing nuisances to adjoining land uses due to glare or intensity. The proposal shall meet or exceed the American National Standard Practice for Roadway Lighting, Illuminating Engineering Society of North America, 2000, as amended. 
(B)	Illumination of vehicular and pedestrian facilities in all proposed land developments shall be provided by fixtures appropriate to the facility and surrounding land uses in size, height, scale, and on-center spacing. 
5.11. - Stormwater and floodplain management. 
5.11.1.   General standards for erosion and sediment reduction and stormwater management.
(A)	The developer shall propose a stormwater management system that prevents damage to structures and land within the proposed land development, that prevents increases in stormwater run-off onto property downstream of the proposed development, and that prevents additional stormwater accumulation upstream of the proposed development. Moreover, the developer shall propose a stormwater management plan that minimizes water pollution discharges from the proposed land development to the extent practical. 
(B)	The land development shall be designed, to the extent practical, to minimize grading, filling, and alteration of land that disrupts natural drainage patterns. 
(C)	To the extent practical, structures shall not be located such that natural or artificial drainage patterns and facilities would be impeded in a manner detrimental to surrounding properties within or adjacent to the proposed land development. In addition, property boundaries shall not be platted such that future structures would impede drainage in the same manner. 
(D)	The proposed land development shall tie into the existing stormwater drainage system, where available, and shall ensure that the volume and pollution level of water drained do not adversely impact the drainage system or the receiving water body to which the system discharges. 
(E)	Primary drainage may be handled in the road system or to the interior of blocks. Bioretention swales are preferred conduits for run-off where drainage is handled to the interior of blocks. Drainage ditches are discouraged but may be used where advantageous for natural resource protection. 
(F)	Measures to promote filtration, percolation, and plant absorption of site run-off are preferred to minimize demand for centralized wet ponds. 
5.11.2.   Stormwater management features.
    In addition to bioretention swales and ditches, acceptable stormwater management devices include bioretention cells, retention and detention ponds, stormwater sewer pipes and box culverts, roadside gutters (valley gutters and gutters with standing or mountable curbs), perforated pipes, trench drains, and related inlet and discharge facilities. Common features appear below. The planning commission may approve other features. 

(A)	Bioretention features should be designed for two-year/twenty-four-hour storm events. Bioretention features should incorporate existing natural vegetation, where practical. 
(B)	Ponds, ditches, and swales should be cleared, grubbed and graded to function properly. Maintenance shelves shall be cleared of underbrush, but protected trees shall remain, where practical. 
(C)	Stormwater management features shall be protected as necessary from erosion with vegetation, rip-rap, or other stabilizing material. 
(D)	Pond banks shall be protected from erosion with vegetation or other stabilizing material which shall, at a minimum, be sod or hydroseed. Littoral vegetation to filter non-point-source pollution is preferred for the banks of wet ponds. Dry ponds shall be vegetated with sod or hydroseed, at a minimum. 
(E)	Land surrounding stormwater sewer pipes shall be cleared of underbrush, but protected trees shall remain and pipes shall be installed to minimize disturbance of tree root systems within required tree protection areas. 
(F)	Ditches and bioretention swales shall have a maximum side slope of 1:3 (three (3) feet of run per foot of rise) and a minimum flat-bottom width of two (2) feet. 
(G)	The bottoms of swales and ditches shall be at least one (1) foot above the water table to prevent stagnant water collection and allow for percolation. 
5.11.3.   Application of Berkeley County Standards.
(A)	Where practical, the proposed land development shall meet or exceed the requirements of the Berkeley County Stormwater Drainage Ordinance, as amended, and the "Berkeley County Engineering, Construction, and Development Standards Manual." 
(B)	The developer may choose to deviate from Berkeley County requirements with good cause, as determined by the planning commission, and in accordance with recognized professional engineering practices. The developer shall then propose alternative means of stormwater management and indicate to the planning commission how these means meet the intent of this ordinance, match or further reduce the risk of inundation from stormwater, and match or further reduce water pollution resulting from inundation and stormwater run-off, including erosion and sedimentation. 
5.11.4.   Application of state standards.
(A)	Where required by the South Carolina Codes and Regulations, the developer shall propose a plan that minimizes erosion and sedimentation during construction. The plan and its implementation shall meet or exceed the standards of the South Carolina Office of Ocean and Coastal Resources Management (OCRM), which has jurisdiction. The approved plans and letter denoting approval from OCRM shall be submitted to the city planner as part of an application for a land disturbance permit. 
(B)	Where applicable, the developer shall meet or exceed OCRM standards for stormwater management, which typically require that the proposed development provide for stormwater management that neither increases nor decreases existing stormwater run-off. The approved stormwater management plans and letter denoting approval from OCRM shall be submitted to the city planner as part of an application for a land disturbance permit. 
5.11.5.   Floodplain management standards.
(A)	The developer shall account for flood hazard areas that occur on the land proposed for development. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to locate boundaries of any floodplains delineated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on the land and to indicate and label them in illustrations submitted during the land development review process. 
(B)	The proposed land development shall meet or exceed the standards of Hanahan City Code Chapter 5: Floodplain Damage Prevention Ordinance. 
(C)	Where practical, development shall be concentrated on land out of floodplains. Type "A" Planned Developments shall locate required open space in floodplains, where practical, to minimize intrusion. Type "B" Planned Developments shall be encouraged to achieve the same and to indicate so in its proposed master plan and text regulating development within the planned development district. 
(D)	Road standard related to flooding. The centerline elevation of proposed roads shall be above the ten-year floodplain. The planning commission may, however, modify this standard where necessary to prevent the filling of land resulting in loss of protected trees. 
5.12. - Water quality protection. 
5.12.1.   State and federal standards for wetlands protection and mitigation.
(A)	The developer shall survey land proposed for development and delineate wetlands where required by standards of S.C. Office of Ocean and Coastal Resources Management and/or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Delineated wetlands shall be indicated on the appropriate development plan submitted to the City of Hanahan for review. 
(B)	The developer shall indicate all measures required by S.C. OCRM and U.S. ACE to protect wetlands or mitigate impacts thereto on the same development plan. 
5.12.2.   Wetlands protection standards.
(A)	Where practical, the developer shall incorporate wetlands and any required wetland buffering, whether by local or state standards, into commonly owned property and not into numerous individually owned lots. 
(B)	Maintenance shall be provided per Section 4.5. Deed restrictions restricting the disturbance and encroachment of wetlands and associated buffers shall be stated on each plat of a parcel containing these features. 
(C)	Rear yard setbacks shall be measured from the highland edge of the wetland buffer, where provided, to prevent encroachment by construction activity. 

5.12.3.   Goose Creek Reservoir Protection.
(A)	A major land development shall designate all land within thirty-five (35) feet of the OCRM-recognized critical line of the Goose Creek Reservoir as a wetland buffer to protect the water quality of the reservoir. State standards may require a deeper buffer. The buffer shall be indicated on the preliminary land development plan. 
(B)	Site redevelopment next to the reservoir. For a major land development proposed on an existing developed site cleared of vegetation, the proposed preliminary land development plan for redevelopment or expansion of the existing development shall propose planting the buffer. 
(1)	The planted buffer shall consist of six (6) canopy trees and thirty-five (35) shrubs per one hundred (100) linear feet, and natural groundcover to inhibit erosion, slow sheet run-off, and encourage permeation of run-off into the ground. 
(2)	The planning commission may modify this standard, where it deems necessary to ensure quality redevelopment that furthers the objectives of this ordinance, modernizes stormwater management, remedies site contamination, and takes alternative steps to mitigate water pollution. 
5.12.4.   Buffer design standards.
(A)	Pre-existing natural vegetation in buffers required by the City of Hanahan shall be preserved. These areas promote filtration of stormwater run-off, which inhibits non-point-source water pollution entering the Goose Creek Reservoir or other protected wetland. 
(B)	Disturbances shall be limited to routine maintenance to remove noxious weeds, invasive species, and litter, to prune trees and undergrowth, and to plant supplemental vegetation, if desired, to improve the buffer aesthetically or functionally. 
(C)	Encroachments into the buffer shall be limited to approved view corridors, which may access docks, and infrastructure that crosses the buffer and wetland, as approved by applicable county, state, and federal authorities as well as the City of Hanahan. 
(D)	View corridors up to twenty (20) feet wide may be cut through the buffer to afford views of wetlands. The corridor shall be cut on an angle of at least thirty (30) degrees relative to the general orientation of the critical line across the parcel to prevent channeling of stormwater run-off in the corridor. The cleared area shall be stabilized with grass, mulch, or other vegetative materials to prevent erosion and sedimentation of the wetland. Docks, where approved by applicable state and federal authorities, may be installed in the view corridor. 
(E)	Trees throughout the buffer may be limbed up, but no higher than one-third ( 1/3 ) of the height of the tree. The removal of lower limbs affords property owners views of the wetland between the trees. Shrubs and other low-lying vegetation may be pruned down to four (4) feet, provided no more than one-third ( 1/3 ) of each shrub is removed, to allow views as well. 
5.12.5.   Buffer design standards for recreational access.

    Buffers fifty (50) feet or more in depth provided voluntarily may be encroached by pervious walkways. 
(A)	Clearing and grubbing of vegetation and grading for the walkway shall be limited to the width of the walkway plus three (3) feet on both sides for shoulders. Twenty (20) feet shall be the maximum allowable width cleared and graded for the walkway. 
(B)	The shoulders of the walkway shall be revegetated, mulched, or otherwise stabilized to prevent erosion. 
(C)	The walkway shall be a pervious surface, including but not limited to a boardwalk with spaced boards, which may be raised for brief wetland crossings, where approved by appropriate state and federal authorities. 
5.13. - Green space. 
5.13.1.   Open space.

    Unencumbered, buildable land prior to proposed land development that is required for or otherwise committed to stormwater management, non-jurisdictional wetlands, wetland buffering, natural and cultural resource conservation, and landscaped common areas, shall be considered open space for purposes of this ordinance and the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance, which may encourage or require open space conservation for land development approval. Wetlands required to be preserved by other entities, including tidal marsh and the Goose Creek Reservoir, shall not be considered open space for these purposes. Land occupied by structures and vehicle circulation and parking is not open space. 
5.13.2.   Park space.

    Unencumbered, buildable land prior to proposed land development that is programmed for passive or active recreation and leisure shall be considered park space for the purposes of this ordinance and the Hanahan Zoning Ordinance, which may encourage or require provision of park space for land development approval. 
(A)	Park space shall include, at a minimum, one (1) of the following two (2) elements: 
(1)	A well-defined trail system for pedestrian access throughout the area indicated as park space, which may include dense vegetation or an open field; or

(D)	Utility equipment location. Equipment related to the transmission of the utility shall be located in discreet locations to the extent practical, such as lot corners. The developer shall ensure that equipment is in no danger of inundation from stormwater and shall not locate equipment in or too near drainage facilities. 
(E)	Major transmission. The standards of this section are intended for the developer installing service within a proposed land development. Major transmission lines and related equipment may be designed and constructed to meet the needs of the utility provider. The proposal shall not violate the objectives of this ordinance. 
5.17. - Rights-of-way and easements. 
5.17.1.   General standards.
(A)	All public improvements shall be incorporated into an easement or right-of-way dedicated to perpetual public use and assigned to an entity responsible for its maintenance per Section 4.5. This shall be noted on the final plat and any record drawing illustrating public improvements.

5.17.2.   Roads and driveways.
(A)	All improvements intended for the traveling public shall be incorporated into a transportation right-of-way dedicated to S.C. Department of Transportation, Berkeley County, or a property owners association, representative of all properties reliant upon the improvements for access, established for the purposes of owning and maintaining the improvements. Exceptions shall be as follows: 
(1)	Land intended for the expansion of a pre-existing road and right-of-way shall be reserved as an easement dedicated for that purpose. Land intended for the future extension of an existing or proposed road and right-of-way shall be reserved as an easement dedicated for that purpose. Once constructed, the improvements may be dedicated and incorporated into a transportation right-of-way. 
(2)	Two (2) neighboring lots with one (1) primary structure each may share a driveway within an ingress/egress easement. The easement shall be centered along the common lot line with a width equal to the width of the driveway and any provided sidewalks plus two (2) feet, minimum, on both sides. 
(3)	Internal circulation roads in attached-unit residential community shall be incorporated into easements dedicated for perpetual access to the traveling public, except where rights-of-way are provided. A property owners association representative of all properties reliant upon the improvements for access shall be charged with responsibility for maintenance of these internal circulation roads. The easements shall occur on land owned by the same. 
(4)	Access management. The planning commission may encourage or the S.C. Department of Transportation or Berkeley County may require the developer of a large land development to implement "access management." The purpose is to coordinate the access to the public right-of-way from multiple parcels in a land development to reduce vehicular conflict points in the right-of-way. 
(a)	To accomplish access management, internal circulation roads in land developments shall be incorporated into easements dedicated for perpetual access to the traveling public, except where rights-of-way are provided. The improvements in the easement shall be maintained by the largest landowner relying on access, such as the anchor of a commercial land development, or by a property owners association representative of all properties reliant upon the improvements for access. 
(b)	Each parcel with frontage on the public right-of-way shall nevertheless provide pedestrian access directly to and along that right-of-way. 
(B)	No property shall be proposed to be solely reliant on an ingress-egress easement for access, except as provided for access management.

(D)	Drainage easements shall be centered along lot boundaries where practical. Drainage easements may be located in required yards. Encroachment of drainage easements into building envelopes shall be minimized to the greatest extent practical. 
5.17.5.   Water and sewer.
(A)	Water and sewer improvements shall be generally located in rights-of-way or easements adequate in width and condition to accommodate the improvements and allow for access for maintenance. Improvements proposed for dedication to public utilities shall meet or exceed the standards thereof. 
(B)	Easements for water and sewer improvements shall be centered along lot boundaries where practical. Such easements may be located in required yards. Encroachment of water and sewer easements into building envelopes shall be minimized to the greatest extent practical. 
5.17.6.   Other utilities.
(A)	Utilities not specified above, including but not limited to telephone, electricity, and television, shall be located in rights-of-way or easements adequate in width and condition to accommodate the improvements and allow for access for maintenance.

5.18. - Adequate, oversized, and off-site improvements. 
(A)	Improvements shall be designed and constructed to serve all current and future phases of the major land development and the planned development district, as applicable. 
(B)	Oversized improvements. The planning commission may require the developer to install capital improvements adequate in size and capacity to serve future development on nearby land where the service provider determines that such improvements are needed to adequately serve future development in the vicinity of the proposed development. 
(1)	Oversized improvements required during development review. The developer shall be notified of the need for oversized improvements prior to approval of the preliminary land development plan, and the requirement shall not delay the development review timeline. The service provider (City of Hanahan, Berkeley County, or other) shall verify the need for oversized improvements and shall commit to accepting and maintaining the improvements upon completion. 
(2)	Infrastructure system connectivity. Road stubs and other improvements designed to ensure interconnected systems of infrastructure in Hanahan shall not be considered oversized improvements and shall be considered basic requirements for proposed improvements. 
(3)	Cost sharing. The developer shall be responsible only for costs associated with improvements needed to serve his development, including future phases and the Planned Development District. The developer shall install oversized improvements required by the planning commission. The service provider shall provide the materials and reimburse the developer for expenses incurred. The service provider and the developer may enter into a voluntary alternative arrangement achieving the goal of complete systems of infrastructure. 
(C)	Off-site improvements. The developer shall be responsible for all capital improvements to existing systems of infrastructure to which the development proposes to connect. 
(1)	The developer shall perform any studies needed (e.g., traffic study) to determine what improvements to systems will be necessitated by the proposed development. The study may be reviewed or performed by the service provider, if it accepts the responsibility, or an independent third party qualified to review or perform the study. 
(2)	The developer shall fully implement improvements that the study concludes are necessitated by the proposed development. 
(3)	The planning commission may require that off-site improvements also be oversized to serve future development outside the proposed Land Development or Planned Development District, in which case oversized improvements standards (above) shall apply. 
(D)	Limitations on city requirements. 
(1)	The City of Hanahan shall not require a developer to rectify pre-existing inadequate levels of service that are unrelated to, or out of scale and proportion with, the proposed land development and expected impacts thereof. The developer shall only be responsible to offset impacts reasonably expected from his proposal at build-out. 
(2)	The developer shall not be required to fund or provide equipment, maintenance, personnel, or other operating costs for public infrastructure or service providers.
