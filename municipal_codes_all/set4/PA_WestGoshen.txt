Police Pension Fund  See Ch. 14, Art. I.
§ 18-1. Legislative intent.
It is the considered opinion of the Board of Supervisors that the extension
of the social security system to employees of West Goshen Township will
be of great benefit, not only to the employees of the township by providing
that said employees and officers may participate in the provisions of the
old-age and survivors insurance system, but will also be of great benefit to
West Goshen Township by enabling it to attract and retain in employment
the best of personnel and thus increase the efficiency of its government.

Law 734, 81st Congress, which designated the Secretary of Labor and
Industry of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to act as the "state agency"
to implement the coverage of employees and officers under the said oldage
and survivor insurance system. The Board of Supervisors of West
Goshen Township is hereby authorized to execute and deliver to the state
agency a plan or plans and agreement, required under Section 6 of said
enabling Act and the Social Security Act,10 to extend coverage to employees
and officers of West Goshen Township and do all other necessary things

§ 22-1. Statement of authority; purpose; findings.
A. Statement of authority and purpose.
(1) Pursuant to the authority granted in the Second Class Township
Code to prohibit nuisances and to promote the health, cleanliness,
comfort and safety of the citizens of West Goshen Township; and to
regulate the time of opening and closing and the conduct which
occurs in places of public entertainment, amusement and
recreation, as well as, the sale, distribution, display and exhibition
of and activities concerning obscene and other sexual material as
provided for in 18 P.S. § 5903(k) and as upheld by the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Brown v.
Pornography Commission of Lower Southampton Township, 620 F.
Supp. 1199 (1985), the Board enacts this chapter for the following
purposes:
§ 18-3 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 22-1
22:36
(a) To minimize and control the adverse effects of adult
entertainment businesses and thereby protect the health,
safety and welfare of the citizens of the Township;
(b) To protect the citizens of the Township from increased crime
associated with adult entertainment businesses;
(c) To preserve the quality of life of the citizens of the Township;
and
(d) To preserve the property values and character of surrounding
neighborhoods and deter the spread of blight.
(2) The Board has determined that location criteria alone does not
adequately protect the health, safety and general welfare of the
people of the Township and that licensing is a legitimate and
reasonable means of accountability to insure that operators of
adult entertainment businesses comply with reasonable
regulations and to insure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
(3) The Board does not intend this chapter to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, but instead to enact a content-neutral ordinance
which addresses the secondary effects of adult entertainment
businesses.
B. Findings. The Board makes the following findings and pursuant to the
authority in City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters. Inc. 475 U.S. 41 (1986),
adopts by reference the results of reports and studies conducted by
other municipalities and states concerning and documenting the
adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses:
(1) The adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment businesses
raise substantial governmental concerns;
(2) Adult entertainment businesses have operational characteristics
which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those
substantial governmental concerns;
(3) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to
place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and
the operators of the adult entertainment businesses;
(4) A licensing procedure will provide an incentive for operators of
adult entertainment businesses to see that the adult entertainment
business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and

§ 37-3. Amplication systems allowed. [Amended 8-12-2015 by Ord.
No. 5-2015; 12-9-2015 by Ord. No. 8-2015]
Buildings and structures which cannot support the required level of radio
coverage as specified in § 37-2 above shall be equipped with either a
radiating cable system or an internal multiple-antenna system with or
without FCC-type accepted bidirectional 700/800 MHz amplifiers as
needed. If any part of the installed system or systems contains an
electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating
on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least
12 hours without external power input. The battery system shall charge in
the presence of an external power input.
§ 37-4. Testing procedures.
(3) The frequency range which must be supported shall be between
763 MHz and 861 MHz;
(4) A 90% reliability factor; and
(5) Signal strength measurements, for the purpose of measuring the
performance of a bidirectional amplifier, shall be based on one
input signal adequate to obtain a maximum continuous operating
output level.
B. The provisions of this § 37-2 shall become applicable upon notification
to the property owner that unacceptable performance levels exist. The
property owner shall have 90 days from the date of his or her receipt of
the written notification from the Township to enhance radio coverage
and bring it within the acceptable limits as required by this § 37-2.
A. Acceptance test procedure.
(1) When an in-building radio system is required, and upon completion
of installation, it will be the building owner's responsibility to have
the radio system tested to ensure that two-way coverage on each
floor of the building is a minimum of 95%. Each floor of the building
shall be divided into a grid of approximately 20 equal areas. A
maximum of two nonadjacent areas will be allowed to fail the test.
In the event that three of the areas fail the test, in order to be more
statistically accurate, the floor may be divided in 40 equal areas. In
such event, a maximum of four nonadjacent areas will be allowed to
fail the test. After the forty-area test, if the system continues to fail,
the building owner shall have the system altered to meet the
coverage requirement of 95%. The test shall be conducted using
the most current portable radio or its equivalent, available to the
West Goshen Township Police and/or Fire Department, talking
through the CCDES as specified by the authority having
jurisdiction. A spot located approximately in the center of a grid
area will be selected for the test, then the radio will be keyed to
verify two-way communications to and from the outside of the
§ 37-2 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 37-4
34:94
§ 37-5. Exemptions.
building through CCDES. Once the spot has been selected,
prospecting for a better spot within the grid area will not be
permitted. [Amended 8-12-2015 by Ord. No. 5-2015;
12-9-2015 by Ord. No. 8-2015]
(2) The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test
measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner
so that the measurements can be verified each year during the
annual tests. In the event that the measurement results become
lost, the building owner will be required to rerun the acceptance
test to reestablish the gain values.
B. Annual tests. When an in-building radio system is required, pursuant to
§ 37-3 above, the building owner shall test all active components of the
system, including but not limited to amplifiers, power supplies and
backup batteries, a minimum of once every 12 months. Amplifiers shall
be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial
installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall
be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will
properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one-hour
test period, in the opinion of the testing technician, the battery exhibits
symptoms of failure, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour
periods until the testing technician confirms the integrity of the battery.
All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are
operating within the manufacturer's specifications for the intended
purpose.
C. Five-year tests. In addition to the annual test, required by § 37-4B
above, the building owner who is required to install an in-building radio
system pursuant to § 37-3 above, shall perform a radio coverage test a
minimum of once every five years to insure that the radio system
continues to meet the requirements of the original acceptance test. The
procedure set forth in § 37-4A above shall apply to such tests. A copy of
accepted tests shall be provided to the Township and to the Chester
County Emergency Services Engineering Department.
D. Qualifications of testing personnel. All tests shall be conducted,
documented and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC
technician license, or a current technician certification issued by the
APCO, NABER, or the PCIA. All test records shall be retained at the
building which was inspected and a copy thereof shall be submitted to
the West Goshen Township Fire Marshal and the West Goshen Police
Department.
E. Field testing. Police and fire personnel, after providing reasonable
written notice to the property owner or his representative, shall have
the right to enter into buildings or structures within the Township to
conduct field testing to be certain that the required level of radio
coverage as required by this chapter is available.
§ 37-4 CURFEW § 37-5

§ 37-6. Existing buildings and structures.
Any building or structure which is not exempt pursuant to the provisions of
§ 37-5 above, which is: existing as of the date of adoption of this chapter;
under construction as of the date of adoption of this chapter; or for which
a building permit application is pending or has been approved as of the
effective of this chapter, shall comply with the requirements of this chapter
if the CCDES, West Goshen Fire Marshal or West Goshen Police Department
determine that adequate radio coverage, as defined in § 37-2 above, does
not exist in the building or structure. The owner of the building or structure
shall be notified in writing that adequate radio coverage, as defined in
§ 37-2, is not provided. The owner shall have a period of 90 calendar days
from the date of his or her receipt of written notice to bring his or her
building into compliance with this chapter by enhancing radio coverage and
bringing it into the acceptable limits of this chapter.
§ 37-7. Appeals.
If an owner of a building or structure receives written notice from the
Township pursuant to § 37-6 above, he or she may file an appeal to the
West Chester Area Council of Governments Board of Appeals (the "Board
of Appeals"). The appeal shall be filed with the Township Engineer within
30 days of receiving written notice from the Township that the building or
structure does not provide adequate radio coverage. The appeal shall state
the following: the property owner's name and address; the address of the
building or structure which does not provide adequate radio coverage; a
brief description of the property; and the reasons why the property owner
can not comply with the terms of the Chapter. Upon receipt of an appeal, the
Board of Appeals shall schedule a public hearing where the applicant shall
be entitled to present evidence and testimony as to why he or she cannot
bring his or her building or structure into compliance with this chapter.
Following the public hearing, the Board of Appeals shall render a written
decision as to whether or not the applicant is entitled to a waiver from the
provisions of this chapter. A copy of the Board of Appeals' written decision
shall be mailed to the applicant by first class mail, postage prepaid. The
applicant shall have the right to appeal the Board of Appeals' decision to
A. As long as none of the following buildings make use of any metal
construction or any underground storage or parking areas, the

judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure.
§ 51-24. Suspension or revocation of permit.
Upon repeated violations by the same permittee (or holder), the permittee's
right to the issuance of a permit or to continue operation of the mobile home
park under such a permit may be suspended for a fixed term or permanently
revoked after hearing and notice, subject to the right of appeal to a court of
competent jurisdiction as by law provided.
§ 51-25. Violation notices, hearings and orders.
A. Notice of violations of the provisions of this chapter or of any
regulations adopted pursuant hereto is subject to the following
procedures:
(1) Notice of the violation shall be given in writing and shall specify the
violations.
(2) Such notice may be served by certified mail or by personal service,
either of which shall be directed to the landowner (permit holder).
(3) Notice shall contain the specific remedial action necessary to
correct the violations, so as to effect compliance with the provisions
of this chapter and with the regulations adopted pursuant hereto.
(4) Such notice shall specify a period of time within which the remedial
action must be taken in conformity with the provisions of Article V
hereof.
B. Subject to the provisions of Article V hereof, any landowner (permit
holder) issued a notice of violation of the provisions of this chapter shall
have a right of appeal to the Board of Supervisors of West Goshen
Township, provided that such appeal is filed within 10 days from the
date of service of such notice setting forth with particularity the
grounds therefor. A hearing thereon shall be had within 30 days of the
conclusion of such hearing or hearings or, where a transcript of the
proceedings is taken, within 30 days of the Board's receipt of such
§ 51-23 MOBILE HOME PARKS § 51-25
51:147
transcript. Upon failure of the landowner (permit holder) to comply
with any order sustaining or modifying the notice of violation, the
license of the mobile home park affected by the order shall be revoked.
C. The proceedings at such hearing, including the findings and decisions
of the Board of Supervisors, together with a copy of every notice and
order related thereto, shall be entered as a matter of public record in

expenses incurred in connection with the appeal shall be charged
against the applicant, including cost of preparation and mailing of
notices of hearings and decisions, cost of legal publication, cost of
appearance fees of court reporters and cost of an original of the
transcript of notes of testimony. If at any time the charge as then made
against the applicant's deposit shall render the balance insufficient to
ensure the payment of all costs, expenses, charges and fees that may
accrue in the disposition of the appeal, the Board of Supervisors may
require additional deposits to be made to assure adequate funds to pay
for the appeal costs and expenses. The Board's failure to demand
additional deposits shall not relieve the applicant of liability for such
costs and charges.
E. Upon the appellant's failure to pay the deposits additionally required
within 10 days or prior to the next scheduled hearing, whichever be the
earlier date, the Board may:
(1) Continue the matter generally until such deposits are paid, in
which event the time within which a decision must be rendered
shall commence to run;
(2) Dismiss the appeal;
(3) Determine the appeal upon the record as it then stands; or
(4) Take such further action as it deems proper under the
circumstances.

not exempted by § 60-6 hereof, who is not the holder of a valid and
unexpired license issued pursuant to this chapter to engage in selling,
purchasing or soliciting the sale or purchase of food, printed matter,
services, goods, wares or merchandise of any description or in soliciting

found, the Police shall authorize the issuance of a license. In the case
where the application is for the sale or solicitation of goods and services

solicitation. If the Zoning Officer determines that such sales are not
permitted from that particular property because of the zoning
classification of the property; conditions of land development approval
will be violated if such sales or solicitation occur from such property;

entitle the licensee to engage in the activities specified, for a period of
one year after the date of issuance. The Police are authorized to reject
the application of any applicant who has previously been convicted of a
misdemeanor or felony criminal offense. [Amended 3-28-2001 by
Ord. No. 5-2001]

determination by the Police that the applicant has not, in the interim
period, been convicted of any misdemeanor or felony criminal offense.
D. The Township Police are also authorized to deny renewal of any license
previously issued to the applicant if they determine that the licensee
has failed to comply with the rules of conduct established by § 60-3
hereof or upon a determination that the licensee has made any material
and false statement in his application for a license hereunder.

pay the prescribed sewer rentals for each property. In addition, it will be
necessary for both property owners to sign an agreement relieving the
Township of any responsibility or obligation caused by or resulting from
installation of a single house sewer. The agreement shall provide that any
disagreement between the two parties concerning future maintenance of
the common house drain and house sewer will be sufficient cause for the
Township to require the installation of additional connections to the sewer
main to provide individual house sewers and service laterals to both houses.
The installation of such separate service lateral from the sewer main to the
curb, as well as the new house sewers from the curb to the property, shall
be made at the joint expense of the property owners signing the agreement.

the Township or its representative who shall have supervision and control
over the same. Any house sewer not so approved shall be relaid at the
expense of the property owner if ordered by the Township or its
representative. During construction of the sanitary sewers, the service
lateral will be installed by the Authority to the curbline, and the house
sewer connection shall be made, by and at the sole expense of the property
owners, to the service lateral heretofore constructed. After completion of
construction of the sewer system any additional service lateral and house
sewer shall be constructed from the street sewer main to the building by
and at the expense of the property owner who has obtained a permit. All
service laterals and house sewers heretofore or hereafter installed shall be
maintained by and at the sole expense of the property owner.

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the current
standard testing procedures mandated by the Department and/or, if
applicable, the current standard methods mandated by the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency. Sampling and analysis shall be
carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and sewage sludge and to
determine the existence of hazards to the environment and to those
systems and applications designated in § 66-25A. Samples for testing
shall be taken at the control sampling manhole and at such other
manholes as determined or required by the Sewer Manager.
D. Industrial wastes may be discharged into the sewer system but only
upon prior written permit issued by the Township. Application for any
such permit shall be accompanied by such information relating to the
nature or character of the industrial waste proposed to be discharged
into the system, including, without limitation, a detailed engineering
report in respect thereto prepared by a registered engineer or
engineering firm, an analysis of the wastes proposed to be discharged
and such other information as the Township by regulation may, from
time to time, require. The reports, analysis and information required by
regulation shall, thereafter, be submitted biannually and/or upon any
change in or addition of the metals or compounds utilized by the
industrial or commercial establishments which are designated and
regulated by resolution as described in Subsection B of this section, or
subsequent resolutions adopted by the Township. Any permit issued
under this section shall be conditioned upon compliance with such
reasonable restrictions as the Township or the Sewer Manager, acting
in his representative capacity, may impose, including, without
limitation, requirements for the establishment of facilities for the
pretreatment and prescreening of wastes, the construction of flowequalization
facilities to assure a uniform rate of discharge and the
installation of the facilities and sampling devices mandated by
§ 66-25B. Interceptors shall be provided before or after the issuance of
a permit or at any time when they are required by the Township for the
proper handling of liquid industrial wastes. All such interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Township and shall be so
located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. All such required facilities and interceptors shall be
maintained continuously in a safe, satisfactory and effective operating
condition at the expense of the owner. The Township may, from time to
time, adopt and promulgate standards and regulations governing
requirements and procedures under this subsection. Operation,
maintenance, recordkeeping and testing of specimen samples of
wastes, including industrial wastes, discharged into the sewer system
shall be the responsibility of the owner at his expense, subject to
certain minimum standards and report procedures promulgated and
adopted, from time to time, by the Township.

N. Direct discharge of process water from an automatic or manually
operated car wash facility for the washing of any type of motorized
vehicles, such as automobiles and trucks, regardless of whether such
facility is operated as a primary commercial enterprise or as accessory
to another principal use, unless the design and operation of the facility
includes and utilizes a recycling filtration system designed and
operated in accordance with manufacturer's specifications to allow the
reuse of wash water as an integral part of the car wash operation. Prior
to discharging recycled process water to the sanitary sewer system, the
owner shall apply for and receive from the Sewer Manager a written
discharge permit, which shall specify compliance with the pollutant
limitations specified in Sewer Resolution No. 15-1984. Sludge
particulates and inert materials captured by the recycling filtration
process shall not be discharged to the sewer system but must be
removed and disposed of by the owner at a site approved by the
regulatory agency having jurisdiction. [Amended 9-27-1994 by Ord.
No. 2-1994]
A. Suspension of wastewater treatment service and/or permits.
(1) Harmful contributions. The Township is empowered herewith to
suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or any permit
issued by the Township pursuant to this chapter when such
suspension is necessary, in the Township's opinion, to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons, to the environment, causes interference with the
Township's sewage collection, processing and disposal system or
causes the Township to violate any condition of a state or federal
permit issued to it in conjunction with the Township's sewage
system or its disposal processes.
(2) Any person notified of a suspension of his wastewater treatment
service or of any permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
prohibited discharge. In the event of a failure of the person to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township shall
take such measures as it deems necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize
interference with or endangerment of its sewer system determined
in § 66-25A or endangerment to any individuals. The Township shall
reinstate the wastewater permit and/or the wastewater treatment
service upon satisfactory proof issued to the Township by the user
of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed
written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of
the harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the Township within 15
days of the date of the occurrence.
§ 66-26 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-26.1
64:221
B. Revocation of permit. Any user who violates any of the following
conditions, any other section or subsection of this chapter or any
applicable state and federal regulations is subject to having the user's
permit revoked in accordance with the procedures of Subsection C of
this section:
(1) Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge.
(2) Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater constituents and characteristics.
(3) Refusal of access to the user's premises for the purpose of
inspection or monitoring, with respect to the provisions and
requirements of this chapter or of any regulations or standards
adopted hereunder.
(4) Violation of conditions of a permit issued hereunder.
(5) Noncompliance with any of the requirements, standards or
regulations imposed by § 66-25 and each of its subsections.
C. Notification of violation and hearing.
(1) Whenever the Township determines or has reason to believe that
any user has violated or is violating this chapter, a permit or the
conditions thereof issued under this chapter or any prohibition,
limitation, standard or requirement contained or adopted pursuant
to this chapter, the Township may serve upon such person a written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days of the date
of such notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
submitted to the Township by the user.
(2) The Township may order any user who causes or allows an
unauthorized discharge to enter the sewer system to show cause
before the Board of Supervisors why a proposed enforcement
action should not be taken. The notice shall be served on the user,
specifying the time and place of the hearing to be held by the Board
regarding the violation, the nature of the violation and the
proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause
before the Board why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. All testimony shall be taken under oath and recorded
stenographically. The transcript, so recorded, will be made
available to any party thereto, at cost. The Board is empowered to
issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the
production of documents in any such hearing.
(3) In any such hearing, the burden of proof to show cause shall be
upon the user. If warranted by the evidence, the Township may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that, following a specified time period not to exceed 30 days, the
sewer service be discontinued unless the violation is completely

§ 66-27. Measuring methods and devices for industrial uses.
corrected within such time as ordered by the Board. Nothing in this
section shall be construed to prohibit the Township's immediate
suspension of wastewater treatment services or the immediate
suspension of any wastewater permit or the disconnection of any
sewer lateral to prevent discharges into the sewer system as
described in § 66-25A or 66-26A through J or for failure to install
the facilities required by § 66-25B.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from a water
supplier discharges sanitary and/or industrial waste into the sewer
system, the volume of water used, as determined from meter
readings made by or made available to the Township, shall be used
in computing the sewer rentals.
(2) In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to
or other than from the water supplier and discharge sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, those
persons may provide a meter on such additional or other source of
supply. The total amount of water used as shown be these meter
readings will be used in computing the sewer rentals. If no such
meter is installed, the Sewer Manager shall estimate the total
amount of water used for the purpose of determining the sewer
rentals.
(3) In cases where persons use water from the water supplier and/or
from any other source such that all or any part of the water so used
is not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer rentals shall be computed by one of the
following methods:
(a) Method No. 1: by placing a meter or measuring device on the
sewer connection. The readings from this meter or measuring
device shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.
(b) Method No. 2: by placing a meter or measuring device on the
effluent not discharging into the sewer system. The reading
from this meter or measuring device will then be deducted
from the total water meter readings and the remainder shall be
used in computing the sewer rentals.
(c) Method No. 3: When, in the opinion of the Sewer Manager, it is
not appropriate or not practical to install devices to
continuously determine the quantity of water not discharged to
the sewer system, the Sewer Manager will determine, in such
manner and by such method as he may prescribe, the
percentage of metered water discharged into the sewer system
and the quantity of water used to compute the sewer rentals
§ 66-26.1 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-27
64:223
§ 66-28. Changes in classification.
If use or classification of any property should change within any quarter,
the difference in sewer rental, prorated on a monthly basis to the nearest
calendar month, will be charged or credited, as the case may be, on the bill
for the succeeding quarter. Additional classifications and additional sewer
rentals may be established by the Township from time to time.
§ 66-29. Time and method of payment of sewer rents.
Sewer rentals or charges shall be paid quarterly, and quarterly billings for
sewer rentals shall be made by bills dated on the first days of January, April,
July and October of each year, for the quarterly calendar period immediately
preceding the date of the bill. The bills for sewer rentals under § 66-23 for
the first quarter during which a property is connected will be prorated on
the basis of the quarterly rate. All bills shall be due and payable on their
respective dates.
§ 66-30. Penalties for delinquent sewer rents and liens, billings and
payments for sewer rents. [Amended 1-26-1982 by Ord. No. 1-1982;
12-12-1989 by Ord. No. 10-1989]
shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to
the estimated amount shall be submitted to the Township after
notice of the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be
final for the current calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices not provided by
the water supplier but otherwise used under the provisions of this
article may be furnished and installed by the Township at the expense of
the property owner and shall be owned by and under the control of the
Township and may be tested, inspected or repaired by Township
employees whenever deemed necessary. The owner of the property
upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for
its maintenance and safekeeping, and all repairs thereto shall be made
by the Township at the property owner's expense, whether such repairs
are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Bills for
such installation and repairs shall be due and payable at the same time
and collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer services.
Such bills from and after their due date shall constitute a lien upon the
property upon which such measuring device is installed.
C. Meter reading. The Township shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or measuring devices, unless such readings are otherwise made
available to the Township by the water supplier, and they shall be made
available to Township employees for meter reading at any reasonable
time.
A. Quarterly charges for sewer rent or other charges shall be subject to a
penalty of 10% if not paid by the last day of the month in which the bill
§ 66-27 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 66-30
64:224
is dated; and if the quarterly installment plus penalty is not paid by the
last day of the second month after the date of the bill, to the aggregate
amount thereof, there shall be added and due an additional penalty
equal to 3/4 of 1% per month, or fraction thereof on the unpaid balance
thereof until paid. Where payment is made by mail, if the payment
bears a United States postmark, the date of payment shall be deemed
to be the postmarked mailing date. The penalties provided for in this
section shall be concurrent with and not exclusive of all other remedies
available to the Township for the collection of such sewer rents and
charges. All unpaid sewer rents and charges, together with penalties
thereon, and all costs incurred by the Township and authorized by
Township ordinance to be imposed and collected in connection with
unpaid and delinquent sewer rents and charges shall be a municipal
claim and, when filed with the proper public office, shall constitute
a lien on the property served for which the sewer rents and charges
have been imposed. Interest at the rate of 9% per annum is hereby
imposed and shall be collected on all sewer rents and charges from
and after the date of the filing of the municipal lien therefor in the
manner provided for in the Pennsylvania Tax and Municipal Lien Law.56
[Amended 7-23-1997 by Ord. No. 13-1997; 9-14-2005 by Ord. No.
10-2005]
B. Bills for sewer rents or charges shall be paid by the owner of the
property and mailed or e-mailed to the address or e-mail address
specified in the application for the permit to make the sewer connection
to the property to be served by sewer service, unless and until a
different address or e-mail address is specified, in writing, by the owner
of such property to the Township, with acknowledgement by the
Township of receipt thereof. Failure of the owner to receive a bill as a
result of an incorrect address, e-mail address or otherwise shall not
excuse payment of sewer rents or charges or extend the time for
payment thereof. It shall be incumbent upon all persons connected to
the sewer system to provide the Township with the correct billing
address or e-mail address, as well as any changes thereto.
C. All sewer rents not paid by the last day of the month on which the bill is
dated shall be deemed to be delinquent. All delinquent sewer rents,
together with penalties, charges and costs thereon, shall constitute a
municipal claim against the property or properties served by the sewer
service from the date the same first became due and payable. If such
sewer rents, penalties and charges are not timely paid, the Township
shall file a municipal lien against the property served pursuant to the
procedure established in the Pennsylvania Tax and Municipal Lien
Law,57 and such lien shall be collected in the manner provided for by
law for the filing and collection of such municipal liens. In addition, the
Township may collect all delinquent sewer rents, penalties and charges
by action in assumpsit, or in any other manner or by any proceeding

which there are occupied buildings more than 150 feet from such sewer
system and persons owning properties not accessible to the sewer
system, who are nevertheless able to arrange for connections thereto
through intermediate properties, shall be permitted to make such
connection.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person owning or occupying a property on
which there is a building required to be connected to the sewer system
under the provisions of § 66-32 hereof to construct or use on such
property any privy, privy vault, cesspool, septic tank or other device for
the disposal of sanitary sewage, and any such prohibited devices shall
be cleaned and filled in with clean soil or gravel within 90 days
following the date on which the connection is required to be made or, in
the case of failure of connection, within 90 days of notice by the
Township, provided that reinforced concrete septic tanks must be
cleaned within said period but need not be filled.
B. Any such privy, privy vault, cesspool, septic tank or other device

[Amended 1-26-1982 by Ord. No. 1-1982]
If any person shall be required to make connection to the sewer system
pursuant to the provisions of this article and fails to do so after reasonable
notice and opportunity, and in any event within 90 days of such notice,
the Township may proceed as permitted by law to enter upon the property,
make such connection and collect the cost thereof by municipal lien or
otherwise. Interest at the rate of 10% per annum is hereby imposed and
shall be collectible on such municipal claim from the date of the completion
of the work after it is filed as a lien.
§ 66-36. Expiration of permits.
§ 66-37. Segregation of sewer revenues.
The funds received by the Township from the collection of the connection
charges and from sewer rentals and all penalties thereon, as herein
provided for, shall be segregated and kept separate and apart from all
other funds of the Township and shall be used only for the purpose of
defraying the expenses of the Township in the operation, maintenance,
repair, alteration, inspection, depreciation or other expenses in relation to
such sewer system and for such payments as the Township may be required
to make under any lease or agreement it may enter into in connection with
A. All sewer permits heretofore or hereafter issued shall expire six months
from the date of adoption of this article or six months from the date of
issuance of such permit, whichever shall first occur, unless a use and

plan to the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user will
connect and to the Pretreatment Coordinator for approval, or
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator they
are not needed, before connection to the sewerage system. Review of
such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility to modify the industrial user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this article.
C. In the case of an accidental discharge or slug load to the sewerage
system of any pollutant, the industrial user shall immediately notify by
telephone both the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial
user is connected and the Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident.
The notification shall include information regarding the location of the
discharge, the kind of pollutants involved, the concentration and
volume of the discharge and corrective actions planned or taken.
[Amended 12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 11-2008]
D. Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug load, unless
waived by the Pretreatment Coordinator, the industrial user shall
submit to the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user is
connected and to the Pretreatment Coordinator a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any liability on
account thereof. [Amended 12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 11-2008]

standards shall apply and are hereby incorporated in this article. The
Township shall notify all affected industrial users of the applicable
[reporting] requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. If an industrial user subject
to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not previously
submitted an application for an industrial waste discharge permit, the
industrial user shall apply for a permit within 90 days of the promulgation
of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
§ 66-44.5. Dilution prohibition.
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement, no industrial user shall increase the
use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The Township may impose
mass limitations on industrial users in cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
§ 66-44.6. State requirements.
State requirements and limitations on industrial wastewater discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those established and imposed in this
article.

municipal ordinances or other requirements.
(3) Issuance of an industrial waste discharge permit in no way relieves
the industrial user from any liability on account of its discharge into
the sewerage system, whether such discharge is permitted thereby
or not.
E. Permit duration and permit fees.
(1) Industrial waste discharge permits shall be issued for an initial oneyear
period and shall expire at the end of that one-year period
unless the Township or the municipality to whose sewer system the
industrial user is connected elects to revoke the permit on or
before its expiration. Upon the user's payment of the requisite
permit fee to the Township, renewal permits shall be issued for a
period not to exceed five years upon written application of the
permittee made at least 60 days prior to the permit's expiration.
Subsequent permits may be issued upon payment to the Township
of the requisite fee for up to five-year periods upon prior written
application made to the Township at least 90 days before the
permit's scheduled expiration. The terms and conditions of the
permit shall be subject to modification by the Township or the
municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user is
connected during the term of the permit. The industrial user shall
be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days
prior to the effective date of the change. However, the Township or
such municipality shall use their best efforts to inform the
industrial user of such change at least 60 days prior to the effective
date of the change, but its/their failure to do so shall not preclude
or delay implementation of the required change. In the event that
§ 66-44.8 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-44.8
64:253
such changes require major changes in pretreatment by the
industrial user, and the industrial user's failure to comply with
the amended discharge requirements does not itself or with other
failures to comply put the Township or the municipality to whose
sewer system the industrial user is connected in substantial danger
of violating any agreement, permit, regulation, ordinance or law,
then the Pretreatment Coordinator may grant the industrial user a
period not to exceed six months from the date otherwise required
for compliance within which to effect such changes to its
pretreatment facilities as are necessary to comply with the permit's
terms and conditions. Upon demonstration of justifiable cause
proven by the permittee within the said six-month period, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may extend the date otherwise required
for compliance for such additional reasonable period of time as
he determines necessary. No extensions shall be considered or
granted unless the industrial user makes written request for a
time extension and submits to the Township and the municipality
to whose sewer system the industrial user is connected an
implementation schedule acceptable to the Township and such
municipality contemporaneously with the extension request.
(2) Permit fees and renewal fees shall be established by resolution
adopted and amended from time to time by the control authority
and shall include but not necessarily be limited to the following: an
application review fee, an administrative fee, a sampling fee, an
analytical costs fee, any surcharges and/or fines and any
miscellaneous expenses incurred from the purchase or utilization
of any sampling apparatus and/or activities. [Amended 9-8-2004
by Ord. No. 20-2004]
F. Permit transfer. Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a
specific industrial user for a specific operation. An industrial waste
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises, different facilities or a new or
changed operation without the approval of the Township and the
municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user is connected.
The succeeding owner or industrial user shall file a new application
and, until permit or modification thereof is issued, shall comply with the
terms and conditions of the existing industrial waste discharge permit
and such additional permit conditions as the Township and such
municipality shall require.
G. Waste characteristic change. Any industrial user who plans or becomes
aware of a change in the method of operation or in the pretreatment
facilities which will increase the concentration of pollutants which are
regulated by this article or the volume of wastewater discharged to the
sewerage system shall notify the Township and the municipality to
whose sewer system the industrial user is connected of the change at
least 90 days prior to such change. If required by the Township or the
municipality, the industrial user shall apply for an industrial waste
§ 66-44.8 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 66-44.8
64:254
§ 66-44.9. Reporting requirements for industrial users.
discharge permit that reflects the proposed changes. The new
industrial waste discharge permit will be subject to a fee to reimburse
the Township and such municipality for all expenses incurred as a result
of the processing of the permit and permit application. Approval or
denial of a new industrial waste discharge permit shall be regulated by
the procedures established hereunder for the issuance of an original
permit.
H. Files. The Township shall maintain files in which copies of all industrial
waste discharge permits, revisions thereto, and supporting data will be
filed for reference. Files shall be maintained for a period of at least five
years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of
any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or when
requested by EPA.
A. Compliance date report under National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the sewerage system, any industrial user subject to
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit to the
Township and the municipality to whose sewer system the user is
connected a written report indicating the nature and concentration of
all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are
limited by categorical standards, and the average and maximum daily
flow from these process units in the user's facility which are limited by
such categorical standards. The report shall state whether the
applicable categorical standards are being met on a consistent basis
and, if not, what additional operations and maintenance and/or
pretreatment are scheduled to bring the industrial user into compliance
with the applicable categorical standards. This statement shall be
signed by an authorized representative of the user and, when requested
by the Township, certified by a qualified professional.
B. Periodic compliance reports. [Amended 12-10-2008 by Ord. No.
11-2008]
(1) Each industrial user shall submit to the Township and the
municipality to whose sewer system it is connected, during the
months of April, July, October and January, or by such date as
otherwise specified in the industrial users industrial waste
discharge permit or otherwise by the Township, a complete and
accurate written report, in form and content as prescribed by the
Township, indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in
the discharge during the reporting period which are regulated by
the industrial waste discharge permit. All monitoring data obtained
for purposes of determining compliance with the industrial waste
discharge permit by certified analytical techniques must be
reported by the industrial user. In addition, this report, where
§ 66-44.8 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-44.9
64:255
applicable, shall include a record of all daily flows which, during
the reporting period, exceeded the maximum daily flow listed in
the industrial user's industrial waste discharge permit. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment
Coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports
shall also contain the following certification statement signed by
the authorized representative of the user:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a procedure designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the facilities proposed to be connected to the sewerage
system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware
that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations relating to unsworn falsifications.
(2) A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial
user by the Pretreatment Coordinator must annually submit the
following certification statement signed by the authorized
representative of the user. This certification must accompany an
alternative report required by the Pretreatment Coordinator:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
under 40 CFR, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, that during the period from __________ to __________ [insert
dates]:
(a) The facility described as [facility name] met the definition of
nonsignificant categorical industrial user as per § 66-42;
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this
reporting period.
This compliance certification is based on the following
information:
(3) The Township may impose mass limitations where the imposition of
mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the periodic
compliance report required by Subsection B(1) shall state the mass
of pollutants regulated in the industrial user's discharge permit to
§ 66-44.9 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 66-44.9
64:256
the sewerage system. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or, where requested by the Township,
production and mass of pollutants contained therein, which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency
of monitoring shall be prescribed in the industrial users industrial
waste discharge permit. All sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA
pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR
136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures
approved by the EPA.
(4) For categorical industries that have mass limits as categorical
standards, the Township may specify equivalent concentrations to
regulate the strength of the industrial user's discharge. If
concentration limits are regulated in lieu of mass discharge limits,
the industrial user must provide the Township with the following
information as part of each written compliance report:
(a) For the reporting period, the rate of production of the process
for which categorical standards have been established.
(b) The average wastewater flow rate generated by the regulated
production activity for the reporting period.
(c) Thirty days' notice of any anticipated change in production.
(5) The industrial wastewater discharged into the sewerage system
shall be sampled and analyzed by and at the expense of the
industrial user, and copies of the original laboratory reports listing
the results of the analyses and the analytical methods used shall be
submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
(6) Except as indicated in Subsection B(7) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Township. Regardless of sampling technique used, the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Township, as appropriate.
In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
§ 66-44.9 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-44.9
64:257
(7) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
authorize a lower minimum. For periodic compliance reporting, the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(8) Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(9) All records and information resulting from the monitoring activities
required by the industrial waste discharge permit, any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities undertaken independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with established best management
practices shall be retained by the industrial user for at least five
years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course
of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or the
Township or when requested by either the Township or the EPA.
C. Baseline monitoring report.
(1) Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted
the baseline monitoring information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b),
as from time to time amended, the industrial user shall, within 180
days after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, provide this information to the Township.
The report shall include all items required by 40 CFR 403.12(b).
(2) A new source, or an industrial user proposing to discharge wastes
into the sewerage system that is subject to a National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, shall submit to the Township the baseline
monitoring report required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) at least 90 days
prior to commencement of discharge from the regulated process or
facility.
D. Noncompliance discharge report. [Amended 12-10-2008 by Ord. No.
11-2008]
(1) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of
this article, an applicable pretreatment standard or the industrial
user's industrial waste discharge permit, the industrial user shall
notify the Pretreatment Coordinator and municipality to whose
sewer system the industrial user is connected within 24 hours of
§ 66-44.9 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 66-44.9
64:258

becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator and to such
municipality within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
(2) Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the Township
performs sampling at the user's between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the
Township receives the results of this sampling, or if the Township
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial
user.
A. When requested by the Township or municipality to whose sewer
system the industry is connected, all industrial users shall provide and
operate, at their own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurements of its industrial waste discharge. The
monitoring facility should normally be situated on the industrial user's
premises, but the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial
user is connected may, when such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the industrial user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, subject to the
issuance of proper permits for such purpose, and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. The monitoring facility shall be constructed in accordance with plans
and specifications approved by the Township and the municipality to
whose sewer system the industrial user is connected or is proposing to
connect. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow
accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the industrial
user. The facility shall be located as to be accessible at all times to
persons authorized by the Township or such municipality. By obtaining
an industrial waste discharge permit, the industrial user consents to the
entry upon its land and facility and agrees to facilitate such entry by
representatives of the Township and such municipality, and further
consents to the use of the monitoring facility for observation, sampling
and measuring of the wastewater discharge at all times. Construction of
the monitoring facility shall be completed within 120 days following
issuance of the industrial waste discharge permit.
C. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facilities in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. [Added 12-10-2008 by Ord. No.
11-2008]
§ 66-44.9 PUBLIC WATER SUPPLY § 66-44.11
64:259
§ 66-44.11. Inspection and sampling.
The Township or the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial
user is connected may inspect the facilities of any industrial user. Persons
or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall
allow the Township or its representative, or such municipality or its
representatives, as a condition of the permit issued by the Township
authorizing any discharge to the sewerage system, ready access at all
reasonable times, and in the event of emergency situations posing an
immediate threat to the sewerage system, to all parts of the premises,
buildings and facilities for the purpose of inspection, sampling records
examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties.
The Township, such municipality and EPA shall have the right to set up
on the industrial user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
Where an industrial user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry onto their
premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Township, such municipality or EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay.
§ 66-44.12. Pretreatment.
A. Industrial users shall provide necessary pretreatment and flowequalizing
facilities as required to comply with this article and shall
achieve compliance with all applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the
appropriate federal regulations, or as otherwise required by the
Township. Any industrial user required to pretreat or flow-equalize
wastewater to a level in compliance with the provisions of this article
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's sole
expense. Detailed plans and other materials and documents showing
the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the Pretreatment Coordinator and the municipality to whose sewer
system the industrial user is connected for review before construction
of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall
in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying
the facility as necessary to produce an effluent in compliance with the
provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities, flow-equalizing facilities or method of operation shall be
reported to and be reviewed and commented on by the Township and
such municipality prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes.
B. The industrial user may allow a bypass which does not cause
pretreatment standards to be violated, but only for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. If an industrial user knows in
advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior written notice to
the Pretreatment Coordinator and to the municipality to whose sewer
system it is connected at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.
§ 66-44.11 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 66-44.12
64:260
§ 66-44.13. Hazardous waste discharge.
The industrial user shall give oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Pretreatment
Coordinator and the municipality to whose sewer system it is connected
immediately after an unanticipated bypass incident is brought under
control, but in no event later than four hours from the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report shall
also be provided to the Pretreatment Coordinator within five working
days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause;
the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected
to continue; and, the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
C. The Township shall annually publish in the daily local newspaper of
largest circulation within the Township's service area a list of industrial
users serviced by the Township which were in significant
noncompliance with any applicable pretreatment standards or
pretreatment requirements during the preceding twelve-month period.
[Amended 9-8-2004 by Ord. No. 20-2004]
D. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and
pretreatment requirements shall be made available to the Township and
the EPA upon request.
E. The Township and the municipality to whose sewer system the
industrial user is connected shall have access to all such pretreatment
facilities and flow-equalizing facilities as required by this article at all
reasonable times for purposes of inspection and testing, and in the
event of an emergency posing a threat to the sewerage system, at any
time.
F. The municipality to whose sewer system an industrial user is connected
shall reimburse the Township within 30 days of receipt of notice from
the Township requiring reimbursement for all of its expenses incurred
as a result of review, monitoring, application processing, sampling or
any other activities conducted by the Township and directly related to
ensuring the industrial user's compliance with the provisions of this
article. The Township shall have the right to collect any unpaid,
delinquent or overdue invoice for such expenses by legal process and,
further, shall have the right to file and enforce a municipal lien against
the industrial user's real property for collection thereof pursuant to the
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Law.62 In
its discretion, the Township shall also have the right to suspend any
such user's discharge permit pending full and complete reimbursement
of the Township.

§ 66-44.14. Confidential information.
A. It shall be a violation of this article and the industrial user's discharge
permit for an industrial user to discharge any quantity of waste to the
sewerage system, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 261.1 et seq., Subparts A
through D, as from time to time amended. In the event of an accidental
discharge, the industrial user shall provide an immediate written
notification of such discharge, but in no event later than four hours
from the time the user becomes aware of or in the exercise of
reasonable prudence should have become aware of the discharge, to
the Township, to the EPA Region III Waste Management Division
Director and to DEP. Failure to provide such notice shall constitute a
violation of this article.
B. The notification required by Subsection A shall include the name of the
hazardous waste as in 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 261.1 et seq.,
Subparts A through D, as from time to time amended, the EPA
hazardous waste number, the type of discharge (continuous, batch or
other), and a certification under penalties of perjury that the industrial
user has a program in place to reduce to compliance levels the volume
and toxicity of hazardous wastes illegally discharged to the sewerage
system. If the industrial user's discharge to the sewerage system
constitutes more than 100 kilograms of such waste, the notification
shall also include an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the waste and an estimation of the mass and concentration
of such constituents.
A. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits, notifications, monitoring
programs and inspections shall be available to the public or any
governmental agency upon written request unless the industrial user
specifically requests in writing and is able to demonstrate to the
Township's satisfaction that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a written report, those
portions of a report that have been accepted by the Township as
confidential shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies
for uses related to this article, the NPDES permit, state disposal system
permits and/or the state or federal pretreatment programs; provided,
however, that such portions of any report shall be available for use by
the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person or industrial user furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.
C. When information accepted by the Township as confidential is
transmitted to any governmental agency by the Township, a written

notification to the industrial user shall be provided by the Township
listing the confidential information transmitted and the governmental
entity requesting the information.
A. The flow volume used to determine wastewater flows and surcharges
shall be specified in the industrial waste discharge permit and be based
on:
(1) Direct wastewater metering;
(2) Metered water use; or
(3) Such other method acceptable to the Township.
B. Both the Township and the municipality to whose sewer system the
industry is connected may, in their discretion, require that each
industrial user connected to its sewer system which has been issued an
industrial waste discharge permit install, calibrate, maintain and use
any meter or measuring device specified therein at the industrial user's
own expense. Such municipality shall be responsible for the reading of
all meters or measuring devices. The Township shall have the absolute
right, but not the duty, of reading the meters, from time to time, at its
discretion. The meters and devices shall be made available for meter
reading at any reasonable time, and in the event of an emergency
posing a threat to the sewerage system, at any time.
A. The municipality to whose sewer system the user is connected shall
order the immediate suspension of discharge of wastewater to the
sewer system by any user when so directed by the Township. The
Township may direct such a suspension when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Township, in order to stop or prevent an
actual or threatened discharge which presents an imminent danger of
harm to people, to the sewerage system or to the environment, or
interference ("dangerous discharge").
B. Any industrial user notified of an order to suspend shall comply
therewith immediately. In the event of a failure of the industrial user to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township or
municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user is connected
shall take such steps as it deems necessary to enforce compliance with
the order to effect the suspension of discharge of the industrial user's
wastewater into the sewerage system, including immediate severance
of the industrial user's sewer connection to the Township's or the

promulgated by the Township pursuant to this article or any enabling
legislation, any resolution promulgated by the Board of Supervisors
pursuant to or related to this article, any applicable state or federal
regulations or an industrial waste discharge permit or any condition thereof
shall be subject, in addition to any civil or criminal penalties which may
be imposed, to severance of its sewer connection to the sewerage system,
termination of its sewage service and revocation of its industrial waste
discharge permit.
§ 66-45.3. Notification of violation.
Whenever the Township or a municipality to whose sewer system an
industrial user is connected finds that the industrial user has violated
or is violating this article, an industrial waste discharge permit or any
prohibition, limitation, condition or requirements contained herein, or has
failed to timely provide the Township with the information needed to
accurately determine compliance with any pretreatment standard or
pretreatment requirement, such municipality or the Township, or both, may
serve upon such person or industrial user who is in violation a written
notice of violation. The notice may require a response in the form of a plan,
explanation, compliance schedule or other appropriate response within
a specified time period. Compliance with any such requirement shall be
mandatory.
municipality's sewer system. The municipality shall permit
reinstatement of the discharge upon proof satisfactory to itself and the
Township of the elimination of the imminent and substantial danger
referred to above. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written
report to the Township describing the causes of the actual or
threatened discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence within 15 days of the date of the first such discharge or
threat of discharge. The Township shall have the concurrent right and
power to suspend discharge by such industrial user to its sewerage
system and to enforce the requirements of this subsection.
C. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Township from
enforcing this article, or any part hereof, or from enjoining and
preventing the discharge of any hazardous waste or any other
discharge deemed unlawful or dangerous to the sewerage system by
any legal process selected by the Township, including but not limited to
an action or actions at law or in equity for injunctive relief and
damages, administrative enforcement proceedings, criminal
enforcement proceedings authorized by any federal or state statute or
law, or through any other authorized legal proceeding. All remedies of
the Township shall be cumulative.

As a precondition to the Township's acceptance of sewage effluent
containing industrial wastewater from another municipality, each such
municipality connected to the sewerage system shall, within 90 days after
adoption of this article, enact regulations imposing the discharge
restrictions (and require compliance with industrial waste discharge
permits), charges, reporting and monitoring requirements no less stringent
than those set forth in § 66-43 et seq. and § 66-45 et seq. hereof on all users
within its jurisdiction, and establishing procedures for compliance with
§ 66-45 hereof. Such requirement shall be embodied in a written agreement
between the Township and such municipality. All such regulations so
adopted shall be amended within 60 days, as necessary, to impose the same
standards and requirements as those imposed by the Township through
amendment of this article. Such municipality shall, upon adoption of the
required regulations, give written notice to all commercial and industrial
dischargers connected to the municipality's sewerage system of all of the
regulatory compliance requirements related to industrial waste discharge
permits.
§ 66-45.6. Civil penalty assessment policy for industrial users.
The Township shall adopt a formal, written civil penalty assessment policy
from time to time and make the same available to the public. Industrial
users participating in the pretreatment program (the "pretreatment
program") established under § 66-44 et seq. of this article shall be given
written notice of the policy. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude
the Township or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction from
bringing a criminal action for a violation of this article.
§ 66-45.7. Procedure for assessment of civil penalties against
industrial users.
The Township may establish by resolution adopted by the Board of
Supervisors a recommend schedule of civil penalties which may be imposed
by the Township against any industrial user who violates a provision of

this article or its industrial waste discharge permit, that is in significant
noncompliance or which fails to respond timely and adequately to any
notice of violation issued by the Township in accordance with the
Township's civil assessment policy. In assessing such penalties, the
Township shall provide the noncomplying industrial user with the
opportunity to show cause why a civil penalty pursuant to § 66-46.3 hereof
should not be assessed. Notice shall be served upon the industrial user
specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Township's
Board of Supervisors, or a hearing officer designated by the Board for
that purpose. Notice of the hearing shall be served by the Township's
administrative staff upon the industrial user and any other party in interest
at least 10 days before the hearing by regular United States Mail, postage
prepaid.
§ 66-45.8. Injunctions against violations of pretreatment standards.
The Township may seek injunctive relief in a proceeding in equity for
the prevention, abatement or termination of any prohibited discharge to
the sewerage system, for a violation of any pretreatment standard or for
violation of any other provision of this article in any of the following
circumstance. In any such proceeding, the Township may seek to collect
any civil penalties assessed, or unpaid, pursuant to §§ 66-45.7 and 66-46.3
hereof.
A. In furtherance of any such proceeding, the Board or hearing officer, as
the case may be, shall have the following powers:
(1) Issue in the name of the Township notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings;
(2) Issue subpoenas and take the evidence; and
(3) Make findings of fact, conclusions of law and render a decision and
order, which may include the imposition of a civil penalty or such
other order as the Board shall direct.
B. Testimony at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded
stenographically. A transcript shall be made available to any party to
the proceeding upon payment of the charges therefor. All other
administrative costs of the proceedings, including but not limited to
stenographer attendance fees, advertising, postage and notices and
similar costs, shall be paid for by the user, who shall deposit with its
request for hearing a deposit escrow fee of $1,000 from which the
administrative fees shall be paid. Any balance remaining after payment
of all such costs shall be returned to the user requesting the hearing.
A. A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent danger of
substantial harm to the sewerage system, Township personnel, the
environment or the public or imperils or results or may result in a

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 71-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "West Goshen Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 71-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed
increases flooding, flows and velocities; contributes to erosion and
sedimentation; overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers;
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage
stormwater; undermines floodplain management and flood reduction
efforts in upstream and downstream communities; reduces infiltration
and groundwater recharge; increases nonpoint source pollution to
waterways; and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can
harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of stream beds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of new development, redevelopment, and other
earth disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and
loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration
and groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the
volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that
maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality,
infiltration, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. Cost-effective
and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be
achieved through the use of nonstructural site design techniques that
minimize impervious surfaces, reduce disturbance of land and natural
resources, avoid sensitive areas (i.e., riparian buffers, floodplains, steep
§ 71-1 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 71-2
69A:303
§ 71-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, safety and general
welfare, property and water quality by implementing drainage and
stormwater management practices, criteria, and provisions included herein
for land development, construction and earth disturbance activities, to
achieve the following throughout the municipality:
slopes, wetlands, etc.), and consider topography and soils to maintain
the natural hydrologic regime.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require the municipality to implement a
program of stormwater controls. The municipality is required to obtain
a permit and comply with its provisions for stormwater discharges from
its separate storm sewer system under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth.
A. Reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater
impacts affecting people, property, infrastructure and public services.
B. Sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water
quality of groundwater and surface waters.
C. Protect natural resources, including riparian and aquatic living
resources and habitats.
D. Maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and
their receiving watersheds.
E. Minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural
hydrologic features, drainage patterns, infiltration, and flow conditions
within land development site designs.
F. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated, and manage
and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible.
G. Provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to
protect groundwater supplies and stream baseflows, prevent
degradation of surface water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise
protect water resources.
H. Reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the
chemical, physical, and biological quality of ground and surface waters.
I. Reduce scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream channels.
J. Reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying
capacity of streams and their floodplains.
§ 71-2 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 71-3
69A:304
K. Protect adjacent and downgradient lands from adverse impacts of
direct stormwater discharges.
L. Minimize impervious surfaces and connected impervious surfaces to
promote infiltration and reduce the volume and impacts of stormwater
runoff.
M. Provide proper long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities, BMPs and conveyances that are
implemented within the municipality.
N. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed land undergoing
redevelopment while encouraging new development and
redevelopment in urban areas and areas designated for growth.
O. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses nonstormwater discharges.
P. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on
watershed-based stormwater management planning.
Q. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES stormwater permit
requirements.
R. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
S. Implement the requirements of total maximum daily load (TMDLs)
where applicable to waters within or impacted by the municipality.
T. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
U. Fulfill the purpose and requirements of PA Act 16777 (PA Act 167,
Section 3):
"(1) Encourage planning and management of stormwater runoff in
each watershed which is consistent with sound water and land use
practices.
(2) Authorize a comprehensive program of stormwater management
designated to preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of
commonwealth streams; to preserve to the maximum extent
practicable natural stormwater runoff regimes and natural course,
current and cross-section of water of the commonwealth; and to
protect and conserve groundwaters and groundwater recharge areas.

§ 71-6. Exemptions and modified requirements.
volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater runoff in a
manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property, and
water quality of waters of the commonwealth.
C. Phased and incremental project requirements.
(1) Any regulated activity (including but not limited to new
development, redevelopment, or earth disturbance) that is to take
place incrementally or in phases, or occurs in sequential projects
on the same parcel or property, shall be subject to regulation by
this chapter if the cumulative proposed impervious surface or earth
disturbance exceeds the corresponding threshold for exemption (as
presented in Table 70-6.1, "Thresholds for regulated activities
Exempt from Chapter Provisions").
(2) The date of adoption of this chapter shall be the starting point from
which to consider tracts as parent tracts relative to future
subdivisions, and from which impervious surface and earth
disturbance computations shall be cumulatively considered. For
example:

construction of a six-hundred-square-foot garage, that project
would be exempted from the requirements of this chapter as
noted in Table 70-6.1. If, at a later date, an applicant proposes to
construct a nine-hundred-square-foot room addition on the same
property, the applicant would then be required to implement the
stormwater management and plan submission requirements of
this chapter for the cumulative total of 1,500 square feet of
additional impervious surface added to the property since
adoption of this chapter.
D. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of Article XIII, titled "Prohibitions," shall apply to every
person in the Township regardless of whether they are engaged in a
regulated activity.
A. Requirements for exempt activities.
(1) An exemption from any requirement of this chapter shall not
relieve the applicant from implementing all other applicable
requirements of this chapter or from implementing such measures
as are necessary to protect public health, safety, and welfare,
property and water quality.
(2) An exemption shall not relieve the applicant from complying with
the requirements for state-designated special protection waters

A. Applicants proposing regulated activities in the municipality which are
not exempt under § 71-6 shall submit a stormwater management site
plan (SWM site plan) to the municipality for review and approval in
accordance with Articles III and IV. SWM site plans approved by the
municipality shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated
activity.
B. The stormwater management and runoff control criteria and standards
in this chapter shall apply to the total proposed regulated activity, even
if it is to take place in stages. The measurement of impervious surfaces
shall include all of the impervious surfaces in the total proposed
regulated activity even if the development is to take place in stages.
C. No regulated activity within the municipality shall commence until:
(1) The municipality issues approval of a SWM site plan, which
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this chapter;
and
(2) The applicant has received a letter of adequacy or approval for the
erosion and sediment control plan review by the municipality and
the Conservation District (if required), and has received all other
local, state and federal permit approvals required for the project
involving the regulated activity.
D. Neither submission of an SWM site plan under the provisions herein
nor compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall relieve any
person from responsibility for damage to any person or property
otherwise imposed by law.
E. The applicant shall design the site to minimize disturbances to land, site
hydrology, and natural resources, and to maintain the natural
hydrologic regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions. The
applicant shall apply the procedures set forth in § 71-16 for the overall
site design and for selection, location and design of features and BMPs
to be used to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
F. To the maximum extent practicable, postconstruction stormwater shall
be discharged within the drainage area of the same stream or water
body receiving the runoff prior to construction of the proposed
regulated activity.
G. Existing drainage peak rate discharges up to and including the onehundred-
year storm onto or through adjacent property(ies) or
downgradient property(ies), including diffuse drainage discharge, shall
not be altered in any manner without written permission from, and,

§ 71-13 SPEED-TIMING DEVICES § 71-13
69A:327
agreement with, the affected landowner(s) for conveyance of
discharges onto or through their property(ies). Such discharge shall be
subject to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
H. Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated
activity) that drain through a proposed site are not subject to water
quality and volume control, infiltration, stream channel protection, or
peak flow rate control requirements (as presented in §§ 71-17, 71-18,
71-19 and 71-20). Drainage facilities located on the site shall be
designed to safely convey flows from outside of the site through the site.
I. If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from limited portions of the
disturbed area for achieving water quality volume control standards,
stream channel protection standards, and the two-year storm event
peak runoff rate reduction standards for new development required by
this chapter, the applicant shall propose alternate methods to mitigate
the bypass of the BMPs, subject to the approval of the Municipal
Engineer. In no case shall resulting peak rate be greater than required
in Table 71-20.1.
J. For all regulated activities, erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during the regulated
activities (i.e., during construction) as required to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter, to meet the erosion and sediment
control requirements of the municipality, if applicable, and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean
Streams Law.91
K. For all regulated activities, permanent BMPs and conveyances shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under

Storm Water Management Act.93
L. The design of all BMPs and conveyances shall incorporate sound
engineering principles and practices in a manner that does not
aggravate existing stormwater problems as identified by the
municipality. The municipality reserves the right to disapprove any
design that would result in construction in an area affected by existing
stormwater problem(s) or continuation of an existing stormwater
problem(s).
M. Existing wetlands, either on the site or on an adjacent property, shall
not be used to meet the minimum design requirements for stormwater
management or stormwater runoff quality treatment. Stormwater
discharges to existing wetlands shall not degrade the quality or
hydrologic integrity of the wetland.

O. Contaminated and brownfield sites. Where BMPs may contribute to the
migration of contaminants in groundwater, the water quality and runoff
volume, stream channel protection, and peak rate control standards
shall be met; however, at the Municipal Engineer's discretion, the
minimum infiltration requirement may be reduced or eliminated
commensurate with the contaminated area and the required water
quality and runoff control measures may be increased to mitigate the
reduced infiltration requirement for the contaminated area.
P. Additional water quality requirements. The municipality may require
additional stormwater control measures for stormwater discharges to
special management areas including, but not limited to:
(1) Water bodies listed as "impaired" by PADEP.
(2) Any water body or watershed with an approved total maximum
daily load (TMDL).

susceptible to the formation of sinkholes and other karst features, the
location, type, and design of infiltration BMPs shall be based on a site
evaluation conducted by a qualified licensed professional and based on
the PA BMP Manual or other design guidance acceptable to the
Municipal Engineer.
S. All regulated activities located within a special flood hazard area
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
shall comply with Article XIX, Flood Hazard District, of the West Goshen
Township Zoning Ordinance94 and shall be designed to maintain the
flood carrying capacity of the floodway such that the base flood
elevations are not increased, either upstream or downstream. The
natural conveyance characteristics of the site and the receiving
floodplain shall be incorporated into the stormwater management
practices proposed for the site.
T. Disturbance of existing ground cover during construction of the
proposed regulated activity is prohibited within 100 feet of top-of-bank
of all perennial and intermittent waterways, water bodies (lakes, ponds,
etc.) and wetlands, except for activities otherwise approved by state or
local agencies (e.g., stream restoration projects, road crossings,
subsurface utility projects, etc.). At the Municipal Engineer's discretion,
and with Conservation District and PADEP approval where necessary,
the nondisturbance buffer may be reduced because of setback or other
site constraints, but never be less than 10 feet.
U. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 100 feet
to either side of the top of the bank of the channel. The buffer area shall
be maintained with appropriate native vegetation. If an existing buffer
is legally prescribed (e.g., deed covenant, easement, etc.) and it
exceeds the requirement of this chapter, the existing buffer shall be
maintained.

§ 71-18. Infiltration requirements.
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime
is required to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs
when the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created
or expanded. The applicant shall achieve the following infiltration
requirements:
control through other techniques or practices but shall not be
discharged from the site.
F. Runoff from the disturbed area shall be treated for water quality prior
to entering existing waterways or water bodies. If a stormwater
management practice does not provide water quality treatment, then
water quality BMPs shall be utilized to provide pre-treatment prior to
the runoff entering the stormwater management practice.
G. The municipality may require additional water quality and runoff
control measures for stormwater discharging to special management
areas such as those listed in § 71-13P.

areas, the water quality and runoff volume shall be separately
addressed for each drainage area.
I. Weighted averaging of runoff coefficients shall not be used for manual
computations or input data for water quality and runoff volume
calculations.
J. Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated
activity) may be excluded from the calculation of the water quality and
runoff volume requirements.
K. Water quality and volume control practices shall be selected and
designed to meet the criteria of § 71-16C that apply to water quality and
volume control.

accomplished, then the applicant shall be responsible for
demonstrating with data or calculations to the satisfaction of the
Municipal Engineer why this infiltration volume cannot be physically
accomplished on the site (e.g., shallow depth to bedrock or limiting
zone, open voids, steep slopes, etc.) and what alternative volume can be
infiltrated; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of runoff
volume should be infiltrated.
E. Only if a minimum of at least 0.5 inch infiltration requirement cannot be
physically accomplished on the site, shall a waiver from § 71-18 be
considered by the municipality.
F. If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from portions of the
impervious surfaces, the infiltration volume for the remaining area shall
be increased an equivalent amount to offset the loss.
G. When a project contains or is divided by multiple watersheds, the
infiltration volume shall be separately addressed for each watershed.
H. Existing impervious surfaces located in areas outside of the site (i.e.,
outside of the regulated activity) may be excluded from the calculation
of the required infiltration volume.
I. A detailed soils evaluation of the site shall be conducted by a qualified
professional and at a minimum shall address soil permeability, depth to
bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general process for designing the

infiltration practices. In areas where development on fill material is
under consideration, conduct geotechnical investigations of
subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
(2) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or other
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the elevation of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Standard septic/sewage percolation tests are not
acceptable for design purposes.
(3) Design the infiltration facility for the required retention
(infiltration) volume based on field-determined infiltration capacity
(and apply safety factor as per applicable design guidelines) at the
elevation of the proposed infiltration surface.
(4) On-lot infiltration features are encouraged; however, it shall be
demonstrated to the Municipal Engineer that the soils are
conducive to infiltration on the identified lots.

reach the infiltration system, appropriate permanent measures to
prevent or collect sediment shall be installed prior to discharge to the
infiltration system.
O. Where roof drains are designed to discharge to infiltration practices,
they shall have appropriate measures to prevent clogging by unwanted
debris (for example, silt, leaves and vegetation). Such measures shall

§ 71-20. Stormwater peak rate control requirements.
The applicant shall comply with the following peak flow rate control
requirements for all regulated activities including those that involve new
development and redevelopment that are not located in the Chester Creek
watershed.
A. The peak flow rate of the postconstruction two-year, twenty-four-hour
design storm shall be reduced to the predevelopment peak flow rate of
the one-year, twenty-four-hour duration precipitation, using the SCS
Type II distribution.
B. To the maximum extent practicable, and unless otherwise approved by
the Municipal Engineer, the postconstruction one-year, twenty-fourhour
storm flow shall be detained for a minimum of 24 hours and a
maximum not to exceed 72 hours from a point in time when the
maximum volume of water from the one-year, twenty-four-hour storm is
stored in a proposed BMP (i.e., when the maximum water surface
elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can begin at the
start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the orifice is at the invert of the
proposed BMP).
C. For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions
shall be determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions
presented in § 71-21D of this chapter.
D. The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter unless otherwise approved by the Municipal
Engineer, and a trash rack shall be installed to prevent clogging. For
sites with small drainage areas contributing to the BMP that do not
provide enough runoff volume to allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation
with the three-inch orifice, the calculations shall be submitted showing
this condition.
E. When the calculated orifice size is below three inches, gravel filters (or
other methods) are recommended to discharge low-flow rates subject to
the Municipal Engineer's satisfaction. When filters are utilized,
maintenance provisions shall be provided to ensure filters meet the
design function.
F. All proposed stormwater facilities shall make use of measures to extend
the flow path and increase the travel time of flows in the facility.
G. When a regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage
areas, the peak flow rate control shall be separately addressed for each
drainage area.
A. Postconstruction peak flow rates from any regulated activity shall not
exceed the predevelopment peak flow rates as shown for each of the
design storms specified in Table 71-20.1.

B. For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions
shall be determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions
presented in § 71-21D of this chapter.
C. For regulated activities involving only redevelopment, no peak flow rate
controls are required when and only if the total proposed impervious
surface area is at least 20% less than the total existing impervious
surface area to be disturbed by the regulated activity. In all cases where
this requirement is not met, the redevelopment regulated activity shall
achieve the peak flow rate controls presented in Table 71-20.1, using
the redevelopment ground cover assumptions presented in § 71-21D.
D. Only the area of the proposed regulated activity shall be subject to the
peak flow rate control standards of this chapter. Undisturbed areas for
which the discharge point has not changed are not subject to the peak
flow rate control standards.
E. Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated
activity) that drain through a proposed site are not subject to peak flow
rate control requirements. Drainage facilities located on the site shall
be designed to safely convey flows from outside of the site through the
site.
F. When a regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage
areas, the peak flow rate controls shall be separately addressed for
each drainage area.
G. The effect of structural and nonstructural stormwater management
practices implemented as part of the overall site design may be taken

(6) In the event that the Supervisors approve a final plan subject to
conditions, the applicant shall notify the Supervisors, in writing,
within 30 days of the date of the Supervisors' decision, of his
acceptance of all of the conditions. Upon such acceptance, the
conditional final plan approval shall become an approved final plan,
subject to the accepted conditions, as of the date of the
Supervisors' conditional final plan approval. Should the applicant
not notify the Supervisors within said thirty-day period of his
acceptance of all of the conditions, the Supervisors' decision shall
be deemed to be a rejection, which shall constitute a final rejection
by the Supervisors of the final plan as of the date of the
Supervisors' initial conditional approval decision. The developer's

attached by the Supervisors to a conditionally approved final plan. The
final plan shall not be signed by the Supervisors nor recorded until all
required security agreements have been fully executed by both the
applicant and, where required, the financial institution issuing or
providing the financial security and the financial security is delivered or
secured to the Township and is in place irrevocably guaranteeing the
completion of the required improvements. The letter of contingent

§ 72-19.1. Public water supply.
public improvements costs otherwise provided for in this
chapter.
(c) The required traffic study affirmatively demonstrate: [Added
9-27-1994 by Ord. No. 4-1994]
[1] That the level of service at unsignalized and signalized
intersections contiguous to the applicant's property
necessary to serve the proposed development by providing
egress and ingress thereto (intersections through which at
least 35% of the development's traffic must flow to gain
access to the development) shall not as a consequence of
the proposed use fall below Level of Service D, as specified
in the Transportation Research Board, Special Report 209,
Highway Capacity Manual 1985, published by the
Transportation Research Board, Washington, D.C., 1985 or
latest edition, provided that the Supervisors may grant
relief from this criteria upon recommendation of the
Township Engineer following a traffic study supplied by
the applicant justifying waiver of this provision and proof
by the applicant that the waiver will not be contrary to
public safety. This provision shall not be reconstrued to
preclude improvement of such intersections to retain at
least a Level of Service D or better.
[2] The effect of the proposed development on the reserve
capacity of public roads and road intersections providing
access to the development and to and in the area of the
development property shall not have the effect of
materially increasing traffic congestion on those roads or
at those road intersections.
[3] That improvements to the roads contiguous to the
applicant's property proposed as part of the improvements
for the development, such as road widening, acceleration/
deceleration lanes, traffic control devices and similar
improvements, shall be sufficient to accommodate the
additional traffic generated by the proposed development
consistently with recognized traffic engineering design
principles, including but not limited to those promulgated
by PennDOT.
A. Purpose. The regulations established in this section have been adopted
to require that:
(1) Each dwelling unit and each commercial or industrial building in all
subdivisions and land developments hereafter granted approval
shall have an adequate supply of potable water for domestic use.
§ 72-19 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 72-19.1
72:421
(2) Each unit or building shall have an adequate supply of water for
purposes of fire protection.
(3) In each case where water is to be supplied to a subdivision or land
development by means of a public water supply system, such
system meets minimum standards controlling water storage and
production capabilities for domestic and fire use for the protection
of the health, safety and welfare of all Township residents affected.
B. Requirements. If the applicant for subdivision or land development
approval proposes that the subdivision or land development be served
by public water, the applicant shall:
(1) File with the preliminary subdivision application or, when no
preliminary plan is filed, the final plan application, a report from
the public water company proposing to provide public water which
describes the volume of flow, static pressure and residual pressure
at the fire hydrant nearest to the proposed subdivision.
(2) Based upon the foregoing information, submit a hydraulic study
which demonstrates what volume of water and pressures are to be
provided at the most critical points within the subdivision. Critical
points shall be determined by the developer's engineer, following
consultation with the public water company, determined on the
basis of the intensity of development and all other applicable
engineering criteria.
(3) Contemporaneously with submission of the final plan only, submit a
plan, provided by the public water company, showing the design of
the water distribution system.
C. Review procedure for proposed public water supply system.
(1) The submissions required by Subsection B of this § 72-19.1 shall be
reviewed by the Township Engineer in conjunction with the
subdivision or land development application, who shall make a
recommendation to the Board of Supervisors with respect to the
applicant's compliance with the requirements of this section and
the adequacy of the public water supply system. The Board
expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to require the
applicant, at the applicant's cost and expense, to provide an
independent engineering study and report verifying the adequacy
of the proposed public system to supply adequate public water for
the purposes described in Subsection A of this § 72-19.1 to the
proposed subdivision or land development.
(2) Submission by the applicant of the required report, hydraulic study
and plan shall be considered essential, and no subdivision or land
development application, whether preliminary or final, shall be
accepted for review or granted approval without such submission.
Modifications required by the Township Engineer to any proposed
water distribution system or required as a result of an independent
§ 72-19.1 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 72-19.1
72:422
engineering study shall, if based upon reasonable engineering or
design criteria, be a condition of any subdivision or land
development approval.
D. Minimum water supply requirements.
(1) In all subdivisions and land developments served by public water,
the following water pressure and gallonage requirements shall
apply:
(a) Residential use. A minimum domestic pressure of 30 pounds
per square inch shall be provided at each house to be
connected to the water supply main. The system to which the
residential unit is connected shall have sufficient capacity to
supply a minimum of 300 gallons of water per residential unit
per day within the subdivision or land development.
(b) Commercial or industrial use. A minimum domestic pressure of
30 pounds per square inch shall be provided at each
commercial or industrial building connected to the water
supply main. When a building wishes to connect to a public
water system, a study will be made to determine if there is
adequate water supply in the system to supply the building and
use.
(2) For purposes of fire protection in residential districts, the system
shall be demonstrably capable of providing fire flow water
requirements for a minimum duration of two hours of not less than
500 gallons per minute at residual pressures of 20 pounds per
square inch. Fire hydrants shall be spaced every six-hundred-foot
radius along the public water supply system within the subdivision
or land development.
(3) For purposes of fire protection in commercial and industrial
districts, a 1,000 gallons per minute (G/M) at 20 pounds per square
inch (psi) residual pressure is required. Spacing of hydrants should
be within 400 feet of all properties.
E. Approvals conditioned upon adequacy of public water supply. No
subdivision or land development application proposing a public water
supply system shall be granted preliminary or final approval unless the
applicant demonstrates by a fair preponderance of the credible
evidence full compliance with the provisions of this § 72-19.1.

dwelling units or in those residential subdivisions where
application of the requirements of Subsection A are impracticable
in terms of the criteria and standards established in Subsection C
of this section or in those instances where the Board of
Supervisors, in the exercise of its discretion, shall require, the
Board's general policy is to require a fee in lieu of the minimum
acreage otherwise required by application of Subsection A of this
section.
(3) The Supervisors may require the public dedication of land by the
developer for all POR, the payment of fees in lieu thereof or the
private reservation of land for such purpose, or combination
thereof, in accordance with the formally adopted West Goshen
Township Recreation Plan. In such instance, the required POR
areas and facilities shall be in accordance with the principles and
standards otherwise provided for in this chapter or in Chapter 84.

(4) The amount of any fee in lieu of the dedication or reservation of
land and provision of recreational facilities shall be fixed from time
to time by the Supervisors in a resolution designated for that
purpose. All fees so collected shall, upon their receipt by the
Township, be deposited in the West Goshen Township Park, Open
Space and Recreation Reserve Fund, which shall be an interestbearing
account. Such fees shall be expended only for the
acquisition of land or recreation facilities within West Goshen
Township at such locations as shall be selected by the Supervisors
for the establishment, enlargement or improvement of community
or neighborhood parks and recreational facilities accessible to the
subdivision or land development for which such fees have been
paid. [Added 10-9-1990 by Ord. No. 7-1990]
(5) Funds from such accounts shall be expended for only and properly
allocable portions of the costs incurred to acquire or construct the
recreational land and facilities for which the fees were collected.
Upon request of the developer who has paid such fees, the
Township shall refund such fees, plus interest accumulated thereon
from the date of payment, if the Township fails to utilize the fees so
paid for such purposes within three years from the date on which
such fees were paid, unless the developer specifically waives, in
writing, the requirement that such fees be expended within such
time or waives, in writing, that such fees be repaid. [Added
10-9-1990 by Ord. No. 7-1990]
C. In designating areas for POR within a subdivision or land development,
the following criteria and standards shall be followed by the subdivider
or land developer. All land designated for the foregoing purposes shall
be:
(1) Suitable for both active and passive recreational uses to the extent
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission and Board of
Supervisors, without interfering with adjacent dwelling units,
parking, driveways and roads. Active recreational uses include but
are not necessarily limited to playfields, ball fields, tennis and
racquetball courts, basketball courts, fitness trails, picnic areas,
recreational buildings and similar facilities. The minimum area
required for active recreational open space use, which shall be
comprised of ground suitable for development and construction of
such uses thereon, shall not be less than 50% of the total required
POR located as determined reasonably necessary by the Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors.
(2) Comprised of no more than 30% environmentally sensitive lands,
including floodplains, woodlands, surface waters and steep slopes.

wherever possible, including provisions for pedestrian pathways
for general public use to create a linked pathway system within the
Township. The POR shall be accessible to all dwelling units within
the development, either by abutting the POR or over easements
expressly dedicated for that purpose, but must, nevertheless, be
accessible by one or more public streets.
(5) Provided with sufficient parking when determined reasonably
necessary by the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors
for the residents' safe and convenient access and utilization for the
POR, and with safe and convenient access by adjoining street
frontage or other rights-of-way or easements capable of
accommodating pedestrian, bicycle, maintenance and vehicle
traffic, and containing customary and appropriate access
improvements.
(6) Free of all buildings and structures, except those related to POR
use.
(7) Suitably landscaped, either by retaining existing natural cover and
wooded areas and/or by a landscaping plan designed to enhance
POR areas by utilization of plantings which are consistent with the
purposes of this section, which minimize maintenance costs and
which comply with § 84-55C, as applicable.
(8) Made subject to such declarations, restrictions and covenants and
other requirements as specified in § 72-40 of this chapter.
[Amended 10-9-1990 by Ord. No. 7-1990]

and protect all natural features, such as trees, watercourses, steep
slopes, natural drainage areas, historic areas and structures and similar
community assets, which will add attractiveness and value to the
remainder of the subdivision. Trees shall not be disturbed or removed
without the designated approval of the Planning Commission, made a
part of the subdivision and land development plan approval, unless in
strict compliance with § 69-9N of Chapter 69. Wherever feasible, in the
opinion of the Planning Commission and the Board, natural vegetation
shall be retained and protected and natural grade alterations shall be
kept to a minimum.

may be required to facilitate the location of lots and streets. All lot comer
markers shall be so located that the individual properties may be readily
ascertained after development of the subdivision. Markers shall be set in
the ground one inch above finished grade. Any certificate of occupancy shall
be conditional until markers are clearly located.
§ 72-38. Agreements and performance guaranties. [Added
10-9-1990 by Ord. No. 7-1990130]
A. No plan shall be finally approved unless all improvements required by
this chapter have been installed, constructed, completed and approved
by the Township or, as a condition of final plan approval, the developer
has provided for the deposit with the Township of financial security and
Township inspection fees in an amount sufficient to completely pay for
the costs of any such improvements and necessary Township
inspections and has executed the agreements specified in Subsection
A(1). Where public sanitary sewer lines are to be installed in any
subdivision or land development subject to the jurisdiction of the West
Goshen Sewer Authority, the financial security to assure proper
completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of that Authority and need not be included within the
financial security posted with the Township.
(1) The developer shall execute the Township's standard form
subdivision and land development agreement, in which he shall
agree to timely complete the approved plan and to lay out and
improve the roads, streets, alleys and all other traffic facilities and
to construct all of the other required improvements, including but
not limited to grading, paving, curbs, gutters and other road
improvements, walkways, bicycle trails, streetlights, fire hydrants,
water mains and water systems, storm systems, stormwater
detention and/or retention basins and other related drainage
facilities, sanitary sewers and sewer systems and related facilities,
recreational facilities, open space improvements, buffer and screen
plantings and all other improvements as shown on the approved
plan and as represented on the application and related documents
submitted to the Township for approval with the plan and any
improvements required as a condition of approval of the plan by the
Supervisors.
(2) The developer shall agree to install all electric and telephone
utilities underground and to provide sufficient easements and
130. Editor's Note: This ordinance repealed former § 72-38, Curbs.
§ 72-37 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 72-38
72:439
rights-of-way for such installation and maintenance by the
respective utility companies. In all cases where sanitary sewer
trunk facilities are available, the developer shall be required to
install sanitary sewers and to connect the same to the public sewer
facilities, irrespective of the size of the lots, units or buildings
designated on the plan. If the facilities are not available but will
become available within a reasonable time or if mandated by the
Supervisors, such sewers, together with all necessary laterals
extended from the main sewer to the street curb, shall be installed
and capped.
(3) The developer and the financial institution issuing the financial
security guaranteeing completion of the required improvements
shall execute the Township standard form financial security
agreement, specifying the terms and conditions under which such
security shall be held, dispersed and released, and the developer
shall execute the Township's standard form developer's
performance bond as additional security to guarantee the
completion of required improvements. The terms and conditions of
these agreements shall not be amended or modified except as
approved by the Township Solicitor and the Supervisors.
(4) The developer shall also post with the Township at the time the
financial security is posted such amount as established by
resolution of the Supervisors to reimburse the Township for the
reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the Township for
the Township Engineer's inspection of and reports about the
required improvements. Such fees shall include the fees of those
acting under the direct supervision and control of the Township
Engineer for such purpose, including consultants and the
Municipal Authority's engineer. The fees so established shall be
reasonable and shall be the ordinary and customary fees charged
by the Township when such fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on developers. The Township Engineer or consultant shall
periodically bill the Township for all inspection fees and shall send
a copy of the bill to the developer. In the event that the developer
disputes the amount of any such fee, the procedure established in
MPC Section 510(g)(1) through (5)131 shall be mandatory for the
resolution of any such dispute.
B. The types of financial security acceptable to the Township include
federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution irrevocable
letters of credit, a restrictive account or an escrow account in such
lending institutions or such other security as the Supervisors, in their
sole discretion, deem acceptable financial security for the purposes of
this section. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding
company or federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
chosen by the developer, provided that said institution is authorized to
131. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10510(g)(1) through (5).

conduct business within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The
developer shall also execute and post an unsecured bond which secures
to the public the completion of all improvements required by the final
plan on or before the date fixed by the Supervisors in approving the
plan or in the subdivision and land development agreement.
C. The amount of financial security to be posted for completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the costs of
completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for
completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the
amount of the financial security by comparing the actual costs of the
improvements which have been completed and the estimated costs for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of
the 90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the
Township may require the developer to post additional security in
conformity with this section in order to assure that the financial
security equals 110% at all times.
D. If the developer requires more than one year from the date of posting of
financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount
of financial security determined pursuant to § 72-15B(3) shall be
increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the
first anniversary date from the posting of the financial security or to an
amount not exceeding 110% of the costs of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period.
E. When definite stages of work of installation of the required
improvements have been completed, the developer may make written
request to the Supervisors to release or authorize release, from time to
time, of such portions of the financial security as are necessary for
payment to the contractor or subcontractors performing such stages of
work. The Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such request
within which to permit the Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to
the Supervisors that such portion of the work for which release is
sought has been completed in accordance with this chapter and the
approved final plan. Upon such certification, the Supervisors shall
authorize release or reduction by the financial institution issuing the
financial security of an amount as estimated by the Township Engineer
which fairly represents the value of the completed improvements. If the
Supervisors fail to act within 45 days, the Supervisors shall be deemed
to have approved the release or reduction as requested; provided,
however, that prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by the Township Engineer, the Board shall require
retention of 10% of the estimated costs of the improvements.
§ 72-38 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 72-39
72:441
A. When the developer has completed all of the required improvements,
the developer shall give written notice to the Supervisors, by certified
or registered mail, of such completion and shall send a copy of such
notice to the Township Engineer. The Supervisors shall, within 10 days
after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Township Engineer
to inspect all of the public improvements. The Township Engineer shall
file a written inspection report with the Supervisors and shall promptly
mail a copy of the report to the developer by certified or registered
mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt
by the Township Engineer of the Board's written authorization to him to
inspect the improvements. The Township Engineer's report shall be
reasonably detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of the
improvements, either in whole or in part. If any of the improvements or
any portion thereof are not approved or are rejected by him, his report
shall contain a statement of the reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection. Within 15 days of the Supervisors' receipt of the Township
Engineer's report, the Supervisors shall give written notice to the
developer by certified or registered mail of their action with relation
thereto. Failure of the Supervisors or the Township Engineer to act
within these time limitations shall constitute a deemed approval that
the improvements are acceptable and a release of the financial security.
B. If any portion of the improvements shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to complete
those improvements and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification as outlined in Subsection A shall be followed.
C. Where the Supervisors accept dedication of all or some of the required
improvements following their completion and approval by the
Township, the Supervisors shall require the posting of financial security
to secure structural integrity and functioning of those improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the
approved final plan and in the supplementary data and documents
approved as a part thereof for a term of 18 months from the date of the

construction and completion of such improvements, and the amount of
the required financial security shall equal 15% of the actual costs of
installation of said improvements as finally calculated.
D. The Supervisors may require dedication to the Township of one or more
elements of the required improvements but shall not be required to
accept dedication, except as the Supervisors determine necessary for
the promotion and protection of the public welfare. Prior to acceptance

with the Township Secretary as a condition precedent to any offer of
dedication.
E. Whenever a developer proposes to establish or continue a street which
is not offered for dedication or not required to be offered for dedication,
prior to the release of the final plan for recording he shall enter into an
agreement with the Township in form suitable for recording, approved
by the Township Solicitor, binding himself, his heirs, successors,
administrators and assigns, which shall establish the conditions under
which the street may later be offered for dedication. This agreement
shall contain and require the following and shall be recorded in the
office of the Recorder of Deeds, together with the final plan:

this chapter and shall require that the owners of the lots along the
street agree to include with the offer of dedication sufficient
financial security, as estimated by the Township Engineer, to
restore the street to Township specifications and thereafter
maintain the street for a period of 18 months from the date of such
dedication.
(3) The method of assessing such repair and maintenance costs among
the various owners along the street shall be stipulated in the offer
of dedication.
(4) A copy of the developer's agreement offering future dedication
shall be and become a part of each deed with respect to each lot
sold by the developer along the proposed street to be dedicated,
binding the owners of said lots to the terms of the agreement. The
existence of this agreement shall appear on the face of the final
plan, as approved and recorded.
A. The final plan shall be accompanied by the declaration of covenants,
easements and restrictions to which the subdivision or land
development will be subject, together with the bylaws of any legal
entity or organization by which such entity or organization will be

pedestrian access, drainage or similar easements required to be
depicted on the final plan shall be described by metes and bounds and
incorporated in and made a part of the declaration in form suitable for
public recordation. If no declaration is required for the development,
such easements shall be separately recorded in suitable form so as
to bind each affected lot in the development. The declaration and/or
easements, which shall be in form and content reasonably acceptable to
the Township Solicitor, shall be recorded with the final plan in the office
of the Recorder of Deeds of Chester County, Pennsylvania. [Amended
12-8-1999 by Ord. No. 6-1999]
B. The following methods may be used to preserve, own and maintain
common open space, community recreation facilities, community

72:445
(a) Any common facilities so dedicated are accessible to the
residents of the Township;
(b) There is no cost to the Township of easement acquisition; and
(c) A satisfactory maintenance agreement is reached between the
developer and the Township.
C. Maintenance and operation of common facilities.
(1) Each preliminary plan application shall be accompanied by a
narrative description of the maintenance and operation of common
facilities which shall define ownership; establish necessary regular
and periodic operation and maintenance responsibilities; estimate
staffing needs, insurance requirements and associated costs; and
define the means for funding such facilities on an ongoing basis. In
form and content approved by the Supervisors, upon approval of
and as a condition of the final plan, the Supervisors may require the
establishment of an escrow fund by the applicant, under the control
of the Supervisors and the homeowners' association or other entity
formed to own and maintain common facilities, to guarantee that
sufficient capital is available at all times for their maintenance,
upkeep and replacement. The amount of such fund shall be
determined by the Supervisors upon recommendations of the
Township Engineer based upon the size and extent of such common
facilities and may be funded as lots or buildings are initially sold off
by the developer. Dispute about such amount shall be resolved by
the procedure established in § 72-15B(3). Funds so established
shall be segregated in a separate account in the name of the
Township and such entity, and no funds shall be released from such
account without the written authorization of the Chairman of the
Supervisors, who shall be the accounts authorized signatory.
(2) In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
the common facilities or any successor organization shall at any
time after its establishment fail to maintain, repair or replace all or
any portion of them, the Township may serve written notice upon
such organization describing the deficiencies with respect to the
common facilities, and said notice shall include a demand that such
deficiencies of maintenance, repair or replacement be cured within
30 days thereof and shall state the date and place of hearing
thereon, which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At such
hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within
which said deficiencies shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set
forth in the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not
be corrected within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the
Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the premises
and to prevent the common facilities from becoming a public
nuisance, may enter upon the premises on which the common
facilities are located and maintain them for a period of one year.

72:446
§ 72-41. As-built plans. [Added 10-9-1990 by Ord. No. 7-1990135]
Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a taking of the
common facilities except when they are voluntarily dedicated to
the public by the residents and owners and such dedication is
acceptable to the Township. Before the expiration of said year,
the Township shall, upon its initiative or upon the request of the
organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of the
common facilities, call a public hearing upon notice to said
organization or to the residents and owners of the dwelling units
attendant thereto, at which hearing such organization or the
residents and owners of the aforesaid dwelling units shall show
cause why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the
election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the
Township shall determine that such organization is ready and able
to maintain said common facilities in a reasonable condition, the
Township shall cease to maintain said common facilities. If they
are not ready and able to maintain the common facilities in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, in its discretion, continue
to maintain them during the next succeeding year and, subject to
a similar hearing and determination, in the year thereafter. The
decision of the Township in any such case shall constitute a final
administrative decision subject to judicial review.
(3) The cost of such maintenance, repair and replacement and the
enforcement proceedings by the Township shall be assessed
ratably, in accordance with tax assessments, against the properties
that have the right of enjoyment of the common facilities and shall
become a lien on said properties. The Township, at the time of
entering upon such common facilities for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a lien in the office of the Prothonotary of
Chester County upon those properties to recover all such costs and
expenses.
A. Upon completion of a subdivision or land development,
contemporaneously with the filing by the developer of the maintenance
agreement and maintenance escrow, but in no event later than 90 days
from substantial completion of the development, the developer shall file
of record with the Township an as-built plan and profile sheets, which
shall be drawn at the same scale as the final plan. The plan shall be
dated and clearly labeled "as-built plan" and shall indicate the actual
location, dimensions and/or elevations of all completed improvements,
including but not limited to:
(1) Concrete monuments and iron pins.
(2) Cartway edges or top of curbs for both sides of each street.

submitted to the Township Engineer, who shall review and approve the
same. Upon the Township Engineer's approval of the as-built drawings,
the developer shall submit one digital copy of the complete as-built plan
set in either a .DXF or .DWG format (must be same as previous digital
submissions). The digital plans shall be submitted on a compact disc
(CD) and shall not be compressed or zipped. The submission shall not
include externally referenced (X-ref) drawings and all raster images

[Amended 5-7-1985 by Ord. No. 5-1985; 10-9-1990 by Ord. No.
7-1990]
§ 72-42. Enforcement and preventive remedies.
A. In the event that any improvements required by any final plan approval
have not been timely installed and completed as provided in this
chapter or in accord with the approved final plan, the developer shall be
in default, and the Supervisors shall enforce any corporate bond,
financial security agreement or other security by any appropriate legal
or equitable remedies. Upon the Supervisors' written notice of default
to the financial institution posting the financial security or corporate
bond guaranteeing installation, construction and completion of any
required improvement or maintenance thereof, said financial institution
shall forthwith pay over to the Township any amount or amounts
demanded by the Township comprising the bond or financial security. If
the proceeds of any corporate bond or other financial security are
insufficient to pay the costs of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all of the improvements covered by the security, the
Supervisors may, at their option, install all or part of the improvements
in all or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute
appropriate legal or equitable actions to recover the moneys necessary
to complete the remainder of these improvements, including
proceeding against the developer on the developer's performance bond.
All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any
legal or equitable action brought against the developer, or both, shall be
used solely for the installation or maintenance, as applicable, of the
improvements covered by such security and the recovery of all court
costs and legal fees incurred by the Township in any such action or
actions.
B. In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain
appropriate actions at law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations of this chapter, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover
damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or
premises. The description by metes and bounds in the instrument of
transfer or other documents used in the process of selling or
transferring lots or parcels of ground in any subdivision or land
development shall not exempt the seller or transferor from any such
penalties or from the remedies herein provided for.
C. The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property within a
subdivision or land development which has been developed or which
has resulted from a subdivision or land development of real property in
violation of this chapter or any ordinance adopted pursuant to the
MPC136 or other statute. This authority to deny such permit or approval
shall apply to any of the following:

fee to cover the administrative cost for the Township's review of plans and a
fee to be placed in escrow to cover the Township's professional consultants'
costs relating to the review of the application and any supporting
documents and materials, and report to the Township on the same. The term
"professional consultants" shall include any persons who provide expert
or professional advice, including but not limited to, architects, attorneys,
certified public accountants, engineers, geologists, land surveyors,
landscape architects or planners. Any amount in the escrow funds which
exceeds the Township's professional consultants' review costs shall be
returned to the applicant, without interest. If the amount in the escrow
fund is not sufficient to meet all of the Township's professional consultants'
review costs, the applicant shall be billed therefor and shall pay the amount
due within 30 days of such billing. The filing fees and escrow fees shall be
as established or amended from time to time by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors.
§ 72-44. Modifications of requirements.
The Supervisors may grant a modification of one or more of the
requirements of this chapter if the literal enforcement thereof will exact
undue hardship upon the developer because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land which is the subject of the application. The granting
of such modification shall be discretionary with the Supervisors who must
be satisfied that the undue hardship results from the circumstances
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation, without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee has
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation, without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of the violation, without regard
as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
D. As an additional condition for the issuance of a permit or the granting of
an approval to any owner, current owner, vendee or lessee described in
the preceding subsection for any such property, the Township shall
require compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable
to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such
real property.

contrary to the public interest and welfare and will not be contrary to the
purposes and intent of this chapter. All requests for modification shall be in
writing and must accompany and be a part of the application for subdivision
or land development. Such request shall state in full the grounds and facts
of unreasonableness or hardship upon which the request is based, cite the
provision or provisions of this chapter involved and describe the minimum
requested modification. The Supervisors shall keep a written record of their
action with respect to any such request, but the failure of the Supervisors
to act on any such request shall not result in a deemed approval thereof.
§ 72-45. Violations and civil enforcement proceedings.
§ 72-46. Amendments and regulations.
A. Any person, partnership, corporation or other legal entity who or which
has violated the provisions of this chapter shall, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500, plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result
thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice.
If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of
civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the District Justice, determining that there
has been a violation, further determines that there was a good faith
basis for the person, partnership, corporation or other entity violating
this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in which
event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until
the fifth day following the date of the determination of violation by the
District Justice, and, thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation.

chapter by appropriate action taken at a scheduled public hearing held

505 and 506, as those sections may be changed, renumbered or
amended from time to time.138

regulations adopted at a public meeting to implement any provision of
this chapter or to establish additional development and design
standards pursuant to Article V.

§ 74-20. Governmental bodies exempt.
The United States, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or any of their
instrumentalities, agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from
payment of the tax imposed by this article. The exemption of such

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend or
limit existing record legal title or interest.
E. A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration of

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in value

(1) To control the size, location and illumination of signs in the
Township in order to reduce hazards to pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.
(2) To encourage signs which are well designed and pleasing in
appearance and to provide incentive and latitude for variety, in
order to enhance the economic value as well as the visual character
of the Township.
(3) To establish criteria designed to encourage signs which are
compatible with their surroundings, appropriate to the type of
activity to which they pertain, expressive of the identity of
individual proprietors and legible in the circumstances in which
they are seen.
(4) To prohibit sign or advertising distractions and obstructions that
may contribute to traffic accidents or hazards caused by signs
overhanging or projecting over public rights-of-way.
(5) To prohibit the construction of and provide for the removal of signs
which constitute a hazardous or blighting influence.
(6) To establish criteria for the regulation of billboards along Route
202, to prevent the proliferation of billboards within the Township
and to provide for a maximum area for billboards sufficient to allow
§ 84-50 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-52
72:681
motorists in vehicles on Route 202 to safely detect, read and react
to messages set forth thereon. [Amended 1-24-2007 by Ord. No.

A.1. Legislative findings. The Board of Supervisors, having studied
and considered fully various information and data with regard
to the nature and character of the Township including,
without limitation, that certain report by the Township's
Special Traffic Consultant, Traffic Planning and Design, Inc.,
entitled "Billboard Ordinance Review TPD No.
WGOT.A.00004," finds as follows: [Added 1-24-2007 by
Ord. No. 3-2007]
(1) The Township is primarily residential in nature with long
established and centralized commercial and industrial
areas.
(2) The Township is traversed by U.S. Route 202 from the
Township's southwestern border with the Township of
Westtown to a point on the Township's eastern border
with the Township of East Goshen.
(3) U.S. Route 202 is a primary regional roadway with not
less than six grade-separated interchanges and one
signalized four-way intersection along its course through
the Township.
(4) Within the Township, and due in part to the presence of
the aforementioned interchanges and intersection, traffic
traveling on U.S. Route 202 proceeds at a rate of speed
slower than traffic on portions of that roadway outside of
the Township.
(5) Approximately 45,000 vehicles per day utilize U.S. Route
202 at its point of intersection with Matlack Street.
(6) Industrially zoned properties in the Township with
frontage on U.S. Route 202 are logical and proper places
within the Township at which billboards may be located.
(7) Outdoor signs, including billboards, are important and
valuable tools by which individuals, companies and other
organizations communicate commercial and
noncommercial messages to the general public.
(8) Notwithstanding their function and regardless of the
content of the messages displayed thereon, outdoor signs,
including billboards, have adverse secondary effects upon
the communities in which the same are located,
including, without limitation, detracting from the
aesthetic value of such communities and creating the
potential for traffic hazards.
§ 84-52 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-52
72:682
(9) The proliferation of outdoor signs within the Township,
including billboards, would have the effect of cluttering
viewscapes from public roadways and would have
adverse effects upon the aesthetic values of properties
within the Township.
(10)The Board of Supervisors has a significant government
interest in preserving the aesthetic values of the
Township and properties located in the Township,
including, without limitation, viewscapes from public
roadways.
(11)The Board of Supervisors has a significant government
interest in preventing the cluttering effect that would
result from the proliferation of outdoor signs.
(12)The Board of Supervisors has a significant government
interest in preventing the creation of dangerous trafficrelated
conditions.
(13)The proliferation of outdoor signs within the Township,
including billboards, would have the effect of distracting
motorists, and such signs, if too small or too large in size,
would create the potential for motorists to direct their
attention away from the roadway in order to safely detect,
read and react to messages set forth on such signs.
(14)The regulations set forth at § 84-52 of the Zoning Chapter
are narrowly tailored to serve the Board of Supervisors'
significant government interests.
(15)Though the regulations set forth at § 84-52 of the Zoning
Chapter operate to prohibit certain off-site signs, the
Board of Supervisors does not intend to, and by § 84-52
of the Zoning Chapter does not, regulate the content
of the messages displayed on signs within the Township
including, without limitation, billboards.
(16)Notwithstanding the immediately preceding subsection,
to the extent that the regulations set forth at § 84-52
of the Zoning Chapter operate to regulate the content of
messages displayed on signs within the Township, such
is declared to be an unintended secondary effect of such
regulations and, in any event, the Board of Supervisors
finds that ample alternative channels exist within the
Township for such content, including, without limitation,
local cable and broadcast television, local print media and
radio.
§ 84-52 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-52

(17)The Board of Supervisors incorporates herein that certain
report by the Township's Special Traffic Consultant,
Traffic Planning and Design, Inc., dated July 5, 2006,
and entitled "Billboard Ordinance Review TPD#
WGOT.A.00004" as if the same were set forth here in its
entirety.

§ 84-55. Design standards.
Design standards for all areas shall be as follows.
agencies, agents or employees for any damage that may result pursuant
thereto.
A. Screening. A completely planted visual barrier, consisting of a double
row of evergreen plantings having a minimum height of eight feet (after
planting) and placed no more than 16 feet apart on center, shall be
provided and continually maintained within a planting area reserved for
that purpose, having a minimum width of 16 feet, between any
industrial, commercial or multi-use district and a contiguous residential
district or residential use, and, in a residential district, between an
apartment use and a contiguous single or multifamily residential use.
The required plantings shall be staggered so as to provide as complete
a visual barrier as is possible. A stockade-type fence having a minimum
height of six feet and constructed without gaps or breaks shall be
substituted for one of the two required rows of plantings when
determined necessary by the Zoning Officer to adequately shield the
residential district or use from artificial light, glare, noise, odors,
intrusion or any other cause detrimental to the health, safety and
general welfare of such residential district or use. All uses permitted by
special exception shall be screened as required by this section from
other uses, regardless of the zoning district in which those uses are
located, when so directed by the Zoning Hearing Board as a condition
of special exception approval. [Amended 6-14-1983 by Ord. No.
4-1983; 8-12-1986 by Ord. No. 10-1986; 10-27-1987 by Ord. No.
13-1987; 12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 10-2008]
B. Storage. All storage shall be completely screened from view from any
public right-of-way and any residential district which abuts the district.
Screening shall consist of evergreen planting or an architectural
screen. All organic rubbish or storage shall be contained in airtight,
vermin-proof containers which shall also be screened from view from
any public right-of-way or abutting residential district.
C. Landscaping requirements. Landscaping shall be provided in and
around off-street parking areas and loading areas in accordance with
the standards of this section in order to provide a visual and acoustical
buffer for adjacent properties, to provide a visual buffer for adjacent
streets, to define traffic routes and pedestrian paths through the
parking area, to control erosion, to slow and filter stormwater runoff, to
moderate microclimatic effects and to provide aesthetic benefit for the
users of the lot, users of nearby properties and passersby. [Amended
6-14-1988 by Ord. No. 7-1988]
(1) Functions of parking lot and loading area landscaping.
Landscaping of parking lots and loading areas shall perform certain
functions depending upon its arrangement and the type of space
occupied, as described below. Aesthetic considerations are
§ 84-54 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-55
72:704
secondary to these functions. Where screening is required, such
screening need not be opaque but must be of sufficient density and
height to obstruct casual observation.
(a) Perimeter of area, abutting street. Landscaping materials so
located shall visually define the parking area, shall emphasize
points of ingress and egress to and from the street and shall
visually screen the parking or loading area from the street so
that headlights shining into or out of the area will not irritate
other drivers. Effectiveness of this landscaping may be
enhanced by earthen berms.
(b) Perimeter of area, abutting other properties. Landscaping so
located shall provide a windbreak as well as a visual and
acoustical buffer for adjoining properties, particularly of any
residential properties which may abut the parking area. When
a parking or loading area abuts a residential property, a dense
screen of living matter, designed to be an effective screen year
round, shall be provided to a minimum height of six feet from
the ground at time of planting. Earthen berms may be used to
enhance the effectiveness of landscaping elements.
(c) Landscaping within the interior of the parking area.
Landscaping located within the parking area shall be designed
to promote pedestrian safety by defining walkways, to enhance
driver safety by defining traffic lanes and discouraging crosslot
taxiing, to act as a windbreak trapping trash and dust, to
provide shade, to reduce stormwater runoff and to enhance the
appearance of the parking area. Interior landscaping shall be
designed to preserve sight distances and not obstruct the
vision of motorists or pedestrians and shall in no way create a
hazard to safety.
(2) Applicability of standards.
(a) Perimeter landscaping along abutting properties shall be
required for all off-street parking areas with more than 10
parking spaces and for all loading areas, regardless of size.
(b) Interior landscaping and perimeter landscaping along abutting
properties and the street shall be required for all off-street
parking areas with more than 20 parking spaces.
(3) Minimum landscaped area; minimum size of landscaped area.
(a) Perimeter landscaping shall occupy a strip at least five feet in
width.
(b) Interior landscaping shall occupy no less than 5% of the
parking lot area, exclusive of perimeter landscaping.
§ 84-55 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-55
72:705
(c) Each individual plot of landscaping shall occupy an area of no
less than 50 square feet and shall have no side dimension of
less than five feet.
(4) Landscaping plan. A parking lot landscaping plan shall be included
as an element of both the preliminary plan and final plan for all
developments for which landscaping is required, to be reviewed
with those plans in accordance with the process defined in the West
Goshen Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.236
The landscaping plan may be featured with other elements on a
single sheet of the submission to the extent that that sheet remains
legible.
(5) Sight distances. No landscape elements or other objects may
obstruct vision above the height of two feet and below 10 feet
measured from the center-line grade of the driveway and the
intersecting street. Such clear sight triangle shall be bound by two
points 200 feet on either side of the point of intersection of the
driveway and street center lines along the street, and the third
point shall be 12 feet back from the street right-of-way on the
center line of the driveway.
(6) Permitted landscaping materials. Landscaping materials intended
to form a screen shall create a reasonably dense, although not
necessarily opaque, screen, adequate to obstruct casual
observations to a height of eight feet within three years of planting,
except as required in § 84-55C(1)(b). All landscaping elements
within the parking lot area and all perimeter landscaping shall be
in place upon occupancy of the facility served by the parking area.
[Amended 12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 10-2008]
(a) Nonliving materials. The following materials are permissible as
landscape elements: stones, pebbles, sand, wood chips or other
decorative mulch, water or art. Under no circumstances shall
artificial plants or bare earth be considered landscape
elements.
(b) Nonliving buffers. Fences, walls and earthen berms, preferably
covered with plant material, may be used as buffers. The Board
of Supervisors may reject such nonliving buffers as it may
deem to be incompatible with the aesthetic function of
landscaping.
(c) Living material. All living materials used for parking area
landscaping shall be appropriate for this climate, hardy, longlived,
salt-tolerant, heat-tolerant, pollution-resistant and
require low maintenance. The following requirements shall
apply:

F. Purpose. This section sets forth minimum criteria for the installation,
use and maintenance of exterior lighting, the purposes of which are to
require lighting in outdoor public places where safety and security are
concerns; protect drivers and pedestrians on nearby streets from
disabling glare from non-vehicular light sources that shine directly into
their eyes and thereby impair safe travel; shield neighboring properties
from nuisance glare resulting from excessive light sources and from
nonexistent or improperly directed or shielded light sources; limit the
height of light standards to preclude or lessen light pollution; and
promote efficient design and operation with regard to energy
conservation. As used herein, the term "glare" means distracting, harsh
or blinding or uncomfortably bright light originating from or reflecting
off man-made objects. [Amended 6-14-1988 by Ord. No. 7-1988;
9-12-2001 by Ord. No. 11-2001].
(1) Lighting standards: applicability. Lighting facilities shall be
required for all off-street parking areas and off-street loading areas
and for all driveways providing ingress and egress thereto for all
subdivisions and/or land developments for business, commercial,
personal service, industrial, multifamily, recreational, institutional
and public uses. In the approval of any subdivision or land
development plan, the Supervisors shall have the authority to
require lighting to be incorporated for other uses or locations
where in their reasonable discretion such lighting is warranted. In
addition, the provisions of this section shall apply to signs,
architectural lighting and landscape lighting.
(2) Plan submission.
(a) Lighting plans shall be submitted for review and approval for
all subdivisions and land developments and for all uses
identified in Subsection (3)(b) of this § 84-55F, and shall
include a schematic lay-out of all proposed exterior fixture
locations, ISO footcandle data and a plat demonstrating
intensities and uniformities within the limitations established
in Subsection F(3) of this section, and manufacturer's
description of the equipment (catalog cuts), glare control
devices, lamps, mounting heights and means, proposed hours
§ 84-55 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-55
72:713
of operation of the lighting and maintenance schedule.
Illumination intensities shall be plotted on a 10 feet by 10 feet
grid.
(b) When required by the Township Engineer, the applicant shall
submit a visual impact photometric plan that demonstrates
both light coverage and light spillage resulting from the
proposed lighting plan and the provision for adequate
measures to mitigate nuisance from light pollution and
disabling glare, both on the use or development site and on
adjacent properties.
(3) Design standards and illumination standards.
(a) Lighting facilities located in off-street parking areas and
loading areas for uses and developments governed by this
§ 84-55F, or in connection with signs and recreational and
institutional activities, shall provide an illumination level
utilizing the current recommended practice and/or standards
of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America
(IESNA), unless otherwise recommended by the Zoning Officer,

NOTE:
135.0 MFC is the maximum permitted and is limited to the
first 100 feet of outdoor display or parking along any street
frontage, subject to otherwise applicable setbacks mandated
by the district regulations. The remainder of the property
shall be limited to 20.0 MFC, except for the rear yard, which
shall be limited to 10 MFC.
(c) In the application of the above standards, the following
regulations shall apply:
[1] Illumination levels shall be defined as maintained
horizontal footcandles on the task; for example, the
pavement or area surface. A footcandle is defined as a unit
of light intensity stated in lumens per square foot and
measurable with an illuminance meter, also known as a
footcandle or light meter. Illuminance is defined to mean
the quantity of light measured in footcandles or lux. Lux is
defined to mean a unit of light intensity stated in lumens
per square meter. There are approximately 10.7 lux per
footcandle.
[2] Uniformity ratios dictate that average illumination values
shall not exceed minimum values by more than the product
of the minimum value and the specified ratio. For example,
§ 84-55 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-55
72:715
in the case of commercial parking high activity, the
average footcandles shall not be in excess of 3.6 (0.9 x 4).
[3] In no case shall illumination exceed 0.2 footcandle
measured at the property lines, except at driveway
entrances, provided the illumination at the cartway
centerline of the contiguous street shall not exceed 1.0
footcandle, unless a more stringent standard is required
by another provision of this § 84-55F; and the amount of
illumination projected onto a residential zoned property or
use from another property shall not exceed 0.1 footcandle
at the property line.
[4] Lighting standards in parking areas shall be located no
more than 100 feet apart; provided that the Zoning Officer,
Township board or commission having jurisdiction shall
apply the standards of this § 84-55F by prohibiting the
location of lighting standards in such close proximity to
each other as would result in a violation of the footcandle
and light spillage restrictions imposed by this § 84-55F.
[5] Lamp types and colors shall be in harmony within the
adjacent community, any special circumstances existing on
the site and with surrounding installations. Lamp types
and colors shall be consistent with the task and setting,
and shall not create a mix of colors unless otherwise
approved by the Zoning Officer, Township board or
commission having jurisdiction for cause shown.
[6] Canopy lighting shall be located on the undersurface
(ceiling) of the canopy and shall be limited to flush lens
fixtures mounted on the canopy ceiling. Drop lens fixtures
are prohibited. Up-lens lighting fixtures mounted on the
canopy structure above the level of gas pumps are
permitted if they have the effect of reducing glare from the
lighting fixtures mounted on the canopy ceiling. In no
event shall any other lighting fixtures be located on or
otherwise attached to or used to light a canopy or any area
of the property adjacent to the canopy. Outdoor canopies
include, but are not limited to, the following applications:
[a] Fuel island canopies associated with service stations
and convenience stores;
[b] Exterior canopies above storefronts in shopping
centers and malls;
[c] Exterior canopies above driveways and building
entrances;
[d] Pavilions and gazebos.
§ 84-55 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-55
72:716
[7] All other lighting proposed for use after 10:00 p.m. for
commercial, industrial, institutional and recreational
applications shall be reduced by 75% from then until
dawn, unless supporting a specific purpose and approved
by the Zoning Officer, Township board or commission
having jurisdiction.
(4) Glare control. For purposes of these regulations, "glare" is defined
as the sensation produced by lighting that causes an annoyance,
discomfort or loss in visual performance and visibility to the eye.
(a) All lighting fixtures shall meet IESNA cut-off criteria. No
lighting shall be permitted which shines directly into
residential units, or results in glare beyond an angle of 30°
from a vertical plane, measured from the light source.
(b) Light fixtures, including mounting base, shall not exceed 25
feet in height above finished grade.
(c) All lighting sources shall be effectively shielded and shall be
installed and/or aimed so as to shield nearby public or private
streets and neighboring properties from direct glare light
radiation, or light pollution which may create a safety hazard
or a nuisance.
(d) All lighting sources shall be completely shielded from any
public right-of-way.
(e) Illuminated signs shall have an indirect lighting source or
shielded source.
(f) The Zoning Officer, Township board or commission having
jurisdiction may require that lighting be controlled by
automatic timing devices to extinguish light sources during
specific periods to mitigate the adverse consequences of light
pollution when such action is necessary to protect adjacent
properties and uses.
(g) Glare control shall be accomplished primarily through the
proper selection and application of lighting equipment. Only
after those means have been exhausted shall vegetation,
fences and similar screening methods be considered
acceptable for reducing glare.
(h) Fixtures used for architectural lighting, such as facade, feature
and landscape lighting, shall be aimed or directed so as to
preclude light projection beyond the immediate objects
intended to be illuminated. All such lighting shall be
extinguished between the hours of midnight prevailing time
and dawn.
§ 84-55 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-55
72:717
(i) In all residential districts or in connection with residential
uses, floodlighting, spotlighting and other high-intensity
lighting over 100 watts shall be located so that glare or
reflection is not greater than 0.2 footcandle at the lot line of
the receiving land. Such lighting fixtures shall be installed and/
or aimed so that they do not project their output into windows
of neighboring residences, adjacent uses, skyward or onto a
public street. All such lighting shall be extinguished after
10:00 p.m. prevailing time, except in case of emergency use.
(j) Unless otherwise approved by the Zoning Officer, or Township
board or commission having jurisdiction for purposes of safety
or security or all-night operations, lighting for commercial,
industrial, public recreational and industrial applications shall
be controlled by automatic switching devices such as time
clocks or combination motion detectors and photocells, to
permit extinguishing outdoor lighting fixtures between 10:00
p.m. and dawn, to mitigate nuisance glare and sky-lighting
consequences.
(5) Installation and maintenance.
(a) The applicant/landowner shall install or cause to be installed
all lighting fixtures and facilities at his/its expense. Light
fixtures and poles shall be in accordance with a lighting plan
approved by the Supervisors upon recommendation of the
Planning Commission and Township Engineer, in compliance
with this § 84-55F. The landowner shall be responsible for all
costs involved in the maintenance, upkeep and operation of all
lighting of parking and loading areas and other areas required
by this § 84-55F.
(b) Electrical feeds to lighting standards shall be run
underground, not overhead.
(c) Lighting fixtures shall be maintained by the landowner so as to
always meet the requirements of this § 84-55F.
(6) Compliance.
(a) Board of Supervisors' approval of a lighting plan upon the
recommendation of the Planning Commission and/or Township
Engineer does not relieve the landowner of responsibility
should any light standards or light fixtures, after construction,
fail to conform or continue to conform to the provisions of this
§ 84-55F. The Township reserves the right to conduct a postinstallation
nighttime inspection to verify compliance with the
requirements of this § 84-55F and, if appropriate, to require
remedial action at the expense of the landowner.
(b) Authority for determination of correct lighting installation shall
rest with the Zoning Officer, with advice from the Township
§ 84-55 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-55
72:718
Engineer. If the Zoning Officer determines that any lighting
installation creates a safety or personal security hazard due
to insufficient illumination levels or produces unacceptable
levels of nuisance glare, light pollution or skyward light, the
landowner or other person/entity then responsible for the use,
maintenance and operation of the lighting shall be so notified
and required to take timely remedial action at the expense of
the landowner or other responsible person.
(c) If appropriate remedial or corrective action has not been
effected within 30 days of notification, the landowner or other
responsible person/entity shall be issued an enforcement
notice and shall be subject to the penalty provisions of this
Chapter 84.

surface.
[2] Reserved parking areas may be asphalt, grasscrete or,
with approval of the Township Engineer, oil-sealed gravel
or grass, depending upon the degree of use anticipated.
(b) In those cases where parking space areas, direction of traffic
flow or traffic lanes are not readily apparent, they shall be
clearly delineated by reflective, painted lines in primary
parking areas. Additional signage shall be as required by the
Township Engineer, depending upon the necessities of each
individual situation.
(c) Concrete bumper blocks or concrete curbing shall be provided
for all parking spaces in primary parking areas.

(4) In any zoning district, if a single lot is developed with multiple uses
which are permitted in such district, the required number of
parking spaces for such development shall be computed by totaling
the number of parking spaces required for each discrete use
specified in Subsection I(2) of this § 84-55. When any discrete use
within the development is replaced with another use, the parking
requirements for the entire development shall be recomputed, and
such additional number of parking spaces shall be added as is
necessary to comply with the parking requirements for that new
discrete use. Should the single lot containing the multiple uses (or
the ownership thereof) be subdivided, parking may continue to be
shared, provided proof of necessary cross-easements to facilitate
said shared parking are provided as may be required by the
Township. [Added 5-25-1993 by Ord. No. 2-1993; amended

(b) The owners shall submit an agreement in a form satisfactory to
the Solicitor signed by the owners of the lots which guarantees
that the parking spaces shall be available for the uses
proposed. The agreement shall be recorded and must remain
in effect for as long as the uses require the off-site parking.
(c) Some portion of the off-site parking area designated for a
particular use shall lie within 300 feet of a building entrance
regularly used by patrons of the use.
(d) The lot(s) used for off-site parking must have cross access

description of the type and manufacturer of the proposed
transmission/radio equipment, the frequency range
(megahertz band) assigned to the applicant, the power in
watts at which the applicant transmits, the design gain of
§ 84-57.03 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-57.03
72:740
the applicant's antenna(s), the subscriber equipment
sensitivity expressed in dBm, the design dBm of the
transmission and receiving equipment and the results of
the drive test conducted by the applicant in determining
the need for the proposed site and installation.
[4] The conditional use application shall also be accompanied
by documentation demonstrating that the proposed towerbased
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and
regulations concerning aviation safety.
[5] Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the applicant shall present
documentation to the Board that the owner of the property
has granted an easement for the proposed WCF and that
vehicular access will be provided to the facility.
[6] Tower-based WCFs shall employ stealth technology,
subject to the Board's approval, as part of the conditional
use approval process. All wireless communications
equipment buildings and other accessory facilities shall be
aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the
surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a
like facade to blend with the existing surroundings and
neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible.
[7] The Board of Supervisors shall consider whether its
decision and conditions placed upon any conditional use
approval will promote the harmonious and orderly
development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by
preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of
the community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at
the site to the greatest possible extent; and encourage
sound engineering and land development design and
construction principles, practices and techniques.
[8] An application for a new tower-based WCF shall not be
approved unless it is shown by the applicant that the
wireless communications equipment planned for the
proposed tower-based WCF cannot be accommodated on
an existing or approved structure or building, or on
Township property. The Board of Supervisors may deny an
application to construct a new tower-based WCF if the
applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the
antenna(s) on an existing structure as set forth in this
section. The applicant shall demonstrate that it contacted
the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers within
a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed, sought
permission to install an antenna on those structures,
§ 84-57.03 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-57.03
72:741
buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the
following reasons:
[a] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[b] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
cause radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or
tower, and the interference cannot be prevented at a
reasonable cost.
[c] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not
have adequate location, space, access, or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
[d] A commercially reasonable agreement could not be
reached with the owner of such building, structure, or
tower.
[9] An applicant for a tower-based WCF must demonstrate
that a significant gap in wireless coverage exists with
respect to all wireless operators in the applicable area and
that the type of WCF being proposed is the least intrusive
means by which to fill that gap in wireless coverage. The
existence or nonexistence of a gap in wireless coverage
shall be a factor in the Township's decision on an
application for approval of tower-based WCFs.
(d) Development and design regulations.
[1] Compliance with the following regulations shall be shown
during the conditional use process, or prior to issuance of
building permits, and remain applicable to the towerbased
WCF during its lifetime of use:
[a] Engineer inspection. Prior to the Township's issuance
of a permit authorizing construction and erection of a
tower-based WCF, a structural engineer registered in
Pennsylvania shall issue to the Township a written
certification of the proposed WCF's ability to meet the
structural standards offered by either the Electronic
Industries Association or the Telecommunication
Industry Association and certify the proper
construction of the foundation and the erection of the
structure.
[b] Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all
tower-based WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide
§ 84-57.03 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-57.03
72:742
the Township with a written commitment that it will
allow other service providers to co-locate antennas
on tower-based WCFs where technically and
economically feasible. The owner of a tower-based
WCF shall not install any additional antennas without
obtaining the required permits from the Township.
[c] Permit required for modifications. To the extent
permissible under applicable state and federal law,
any applicant proposing the modification of an
existing tower-based WCF which increases the overall
height of such WCF shall first obtain a zoning permit
from the Township. Nonroutine modifications shall be
prohibited without a zoning permit.
[d] Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be
designed to withstand the effects of wind according to
the standard designed by the American National
Standards Institute as prepared by the engineering
departments of the Electronics Industry Association
and the Telecommunications Industry Association
(ANSI/EIA-222-E, as amended).
[e] Site plan. A full site plan shall be required for all
tower-based WCFs, showing all existing and proposed
structures and improvements, including but not
limited to the antenna(s), antenna support structure,
building, fencing, buffering and ingress and egress.
[f] Height. All tower-based WCF applicants must submit
documentation to the Township justifying the total
height of the structure. The maximum total height of
any tower-based WCF which is not located in the
public ROW shall not exceed 120 feet, as measured
vertically from the ground level to the highest point on
the structure, including antennas and subsequent
alterations. Should the applicant prove that another
provider of wireless communications services has
agreed to co-locate antennas on the applicant's towerbased
WCF and requires a greater tower height to
provide satisfactory service for wireless
communications than is required by the applicant, the
total height of such tower-based WCF shall be
permitted to extend to, but not exceed, 150 feet.
[g] Related equipment. Either one single-story wireless
communications equipment building not exceeding
500 square feet in area or up to five metal boxes
placed on a concrete pad not exceeding 10 feet by 20
feet in area housing the receiving and transmitting
equipment may be located on the site for each

unrelated company sharing antenna space on the
tower-based wireless communications facility.
[h] Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF
shall interfere with public safety communications or
the reception of broadband, television, radio or other
communication services enjoyed by occupants of
nearby properties.
[i] Maintenance.
[i] Any tower-based WCF shall be fully automated
and unattended on a daily basis and shall be
visited only for maintenance or emergency repair.
[ii] Maintenance shall be performed to ensure the
upkeep of the facility in order to promote the
safety and security of the Township's residents.
[iii] All maintenance activities shall utilize nothing
less than the best available technology for
preventing failures and accidents.
[j] Radio frequency emissions. No tower-based WCF
shall, by itself or in conjunction with other WCFs,
generate radio frequency emissions in excess of the
standards and regulations of the FCC, including, but
not limited to, the FCC Office of Engineering
Technology Bulletin 65 entitled "Evaluating
Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure
to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields," as
amended.
[k] Historic buildings or districts. No tower-based WCF
shall be located on a property, building or structure
that is listed on either the National or Pennsylvania
Register of Historic Places, or eligible to be so listed,
or is included in the official historic structures and/or
historic districts list maintained by the Township.
[l] Signs. All tower-based WCFs shall post a sign in a
readily visible location identifying the name and
phone number of a party to contact in the event of an
emergency. The only other signage permitted on the
WCF shall be those required by the FCC, or any other
federal or state agency.
[m] Lighting. No tower-based WCF shall be artificially
lighted, except as required by law. If lighting is
required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan
for sufficient lighting, demonstrating as unobtrusive
§ 84-57.03 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-57.03
72:744
and inoffensive an effect as is permissible under state
and federal regulations.
[n] Noise. Tower-based WCFs shall be operated and
maintained so as not to produce noise in excess of
applicable noise standards under state law and the
Township Code, except in emergency situations
requiring the use of a backup generator, where such

basis only.
[o] Aviation safety. Tower-based WCFs shall comply with
all federal and state laws and regulations concerning
aviation safety.
[p] Retention of experts. The Township may hire any
consultant(s) and/or expert(s) necessary to assist the
Township in reviewing and evaluating the application
for approval of the tower-based WCF and, once
approved, in reviewing and evaluating any potential
violations of the terms and conditions of this section.
The applicant and/or owner of the WCF shall
reimburse the Township for all costs of the Township's
consultant(s) in providing expert evaluation and
consultation in connection with these activities.

§ 84-57.9 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-57.10
72:770
(1) It is the intention of this section to regulate educational uses and
accessory uses thereto and the expansion/extension of educational
uses existing on the effective date of this amendment which are
proposed to be located or are located within the zoning districts
where such uses are permitted by this chapter. In those cases
where an educational use is determined to be a nonconforming use
or is otherwise nonconforming with respect to any nonconformity
governed by Article XV of this chapter, in granting any relief
authorized by Article XV, the Zoning Hearing Board shall require
the applicant to conform to the regulations specified in this
§ 84-57.10 to the greatest extent reasonably possible.
(2) The Township recognizes that educational uses, of necessity, are
intensive land uses that have special needs associated with them,
such as, but not necessarily limited to, athletic facilities, student
housing, student and faculty parking, event parking, the adequacy
of the existing and proposed streets, intersections and driveways to
accommodate vehicular traffic, pedestrian access, and the
integration and compatibility of such uses with contiguous and
nearby established uses.
(3) Because of their intensity, educational uses are, for various
reasons, often incompatible with many other permitted uses within
the Township, especially in relation to the impact of such
educational uses upon surrounding uses caused by substantial
traffic, large concentrations of people, either transient or resident,
and heavy pedestrian and vehicular access.
(4) It is the intent of the Township to establish land use regulations
that foster educational uses and accessory uses associated with
them, while at the same time protecting existing land uses,
especially residential uses, and making adequate provision for the
protection and enhancement of the public health, safety and
general welfare of all of the Township's residents.
(5) All educational uses shall be subject to the requirement that the
applicant file a conditional use application with the Board of
Supervisors and that the Board approve such use in accordance
with the conditional use procedures specified in this chapter,
subject to such terms and conditions imposed by the Board
consistent with the provisions of this § 84-57.10, the other
applicable provisions of this chapter, and the effects of the
proposed use upon the community, the existing street
infrastructure, and nearby land uses.
B. Use regulations. In those zoning districts where educational uses are
permitted by conditional use subject to the provisions of this § 84-57.10,
a building may be erected, altered or used and a lot may be used for any
of the following purposes and for no other when approved as a
conditional use, subject to the area and bulk regulations, design
standards and other regulations of this § 84-57.10.
§ 84-57.10 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-57.10
72:771

(3) Dormitory, private.
(4) Athletic fields.
(5) Athletic/field house.
(6) Stadium.
(7) Gymnasium.
(8) School parking garage.
C. Accessory use regulations. The following are permitted accessory uses
in those zoning districts where educational uses are permitted by
conditional use when approved by the Board of Supervisors as a
conditional use in conjunction with either a proposed new educational
use permitted by § 84-57.10B, or an educational use existing on the
effective date of this amendment, when such accessory uses constitute
a component of such educational use.
(1) Cafeteria.
(2) Student theater/performing arts.
(3) Student union building.
(4) Parking lots.
(5) Geothermal pump house. [Added 8-10-2011 by Ord. No.

D. Existing/future facilities. In those zoning districts where educational
uses are permitted by conditional use, all existing buildings, structures
and facilities and accessory buildings, structures and facilities of an
established educational use, lawfully existing on the effective date of
this amendment, are herewith recognized and protected as existing
permitted uses to the extent provided by law. Provided, however, any
addition to or expansion or enlargement of any such buildings,
structures, or facilities, and any new buildings, structures or facilities
constructed after the effective date of this amendment shall be subject
to the granting of a conditional use approval by the Board of
Supervisors and shall comply with the requirements of this § 84-57.10,
the other applicable provisions of Chapter 84, and any additional
conditions imposed by the Board as warranted by the facts and
circumstances of the particular application for which approval is
sought. In any case where the Zoning Hearing Board is called upon to
grant an approval or relief from the applicable provisions of this
§ 84-57.10 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-57.10
72:772
chapter to any use permitted by § 84-57.10B or C or with respect to
any nonconformity governed by Article XV of this chapter, in granting
such approval or relief, the Zoning Hearing Board shall require the
applicant to conform to the regulations specified in this § 84-57.10
to the greatest extent reasonably possible. [Amended 6-11-2003 by
Ord. No. 10-2003]

72:774
regulation or regulations in addition to or in place of those required by
either the sections of Chapter 84 cited in this § 84-57.10F, any other
applicable design standard or general performance standard imposed
by the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is
located, or other applicable provision of Chapter 84, the more stringent
and/or additional regulation(s) specified herein shall apply and shall
be considered mandatory. In all other respects, the design standards
and general performance standards for the zoning district in which the
property is located shall apply.
(1) When the use is proposed for development along an existing street
opposite, adjacent to, or within the immediate area (100 feet) of
existing residential dwellings, the following special regulations
shall apply unless otherwise approved by the Board during the
conditional use process.
(a) Sidewalks. A sidewalk not less than five feet in width shall be
installed and permanently maintained on the property parallel
to each adjacent street abutting the property for the full length
of the lot unless the applicant is able to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that pedestrian access will not
occur in that area.
(b) Fencing. Unless a sidewalk is not required to be installed per
Subsection F(1)(a) above, a wrought iron or equivalent
aluminum fence at least six feet in height shall be installed and
permanently maintained on the property along the sidewalk
(on the property side of the street line) of such use for the full
length of the lot. Two or more gated walkways for pedestrian
access not exceeding six feet each in width shall be permitted,
as approved by the Board.
(c) Screening. In addition to the requirements specified in
§ 84-55A and C, the following regulations shall apply.
[1] A planted landscape bed having a minimum width of 30
feet, within which area the sidewalk and any contiguous
green area may be included, shall be required. The
landscape bed shall be measured from property side of the
street line and shall be installed and permanently
maintained on the property between the sidewalk and any
proposed parking lot, parking stalls or other parking areas
or, when no parking is proposed in that area, the nearest
wall of any building or structure.
[2] Trees shall have a minimum planted height of eight feet at
the time of planting. The Board may grant a conditional
use to approve an alternate landscape plan not meeting
the requirements of § 84-55A if it determines that such
completely planted visual barrier is unnecessary to protect
adjacent property owners and that the proposed landscape
§ 84-57.10 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-57.10
72:775
plan creates an adequate landscape enhancement of the
project.
(d) Vehicular and street access. In addition to the requirements
specified in § 84-55D, the following regulations shall apply.
[1] Purpose. To minimize traffic congestion and hazard,
control street access, and encourage orderly development
of street frontages, where the proposed use is located
opposite or adjacent to or in the immediate area (100 feet)
of existing residential development and to limit vehicular
access to the development property from contiguous
residential streets which serve existing houses unless no
other access is possible.
[2] Unless otherwise approved by the Board during the
conditional use process, where the lot abuts two or more
streets, such use shall have direct access only to and from
a street of greater functional classification, unless
otherwise approved by the Board. The Board may approve
an emergency access not more than 12 feet in width,
controlled by a locked gate, from the street of lesser
functional classification if the applicant proves it is
necessary for such purpose.
[3] Where the proposed use abuts only one public street, no
more than one vehicular access street or driveway shall be
permitted on the street frontage for any lot, except in the
case of a lot with more than 500 continuous feet of street
frontage, in which case a second vehicular access street or
driveway may be permitted when approved by the Board if
separated by at least 300 feet of otherwise undisturbed
frontage from the first such access, as measured from
center line to center line. The Board may by conditional
use permit a variation from this requirement if the
applicant proves that such is required for public safety.
[4] To avoid congestion on existing residential streets, where
possible and appropriate, the Board may require one or
more new vehicular access streets or driveways serving
the proposed use be constructed either on the
development property or on a contiguous property with
the written approval of the owner thereof, the use and
access of which shall be provided by means of a permanent
written and recorded easement or land acquisition
dedicated to such purpose. Such access(s)shall have its
direct access to one or more other existing public streets
as the Board determines will avoid congestion on
contiguous residential streets only at such location(s) as is/
are approved by the Board during the conditional use
process.

shall apply in addition to the following regulations:
(a) No parking lot or parking spaces shall be permitted within a
front yard or side yard along an existing street opposite
existing residential dwellings unless separated by the
landscape buffer required by § 84-57.10F(1).
(b) When a parking lot or parking spaces are proposed to be
constructed and maintained in any other location, the parking
lot shall be set back the minimum distance required by
§ 84-57.10E(16) from the abutting property, existing
residential dwellings, or street line, as the case may be, and
shall be buffered by a planted landscape screen for a minimum
width of 30 feet meeting the requirements of § 84-55C(1)(a)
and (b) measured from the street line.
(c) When one or more buildings are proposed to be constructed,
all parking lots and parking spaces shall be located principally
behind such buildings or within a triangle or quadrangle
formed by the buildings, unless otherwise approved by the
Board as a conditional use.
(d) The adequacy and safety of vehicular and pedestrian access to
parking lots and parking spaces from existing contiguous or
adjacent public streets, and the capacity of the existing street
system to accommodate the proposed conditional use shall be
demonstrated by the applicant's submission of the traffic study
required by § 84-57.10G with the conditional use application.
(e) Individual parking spaces shall have a minimum paved
dimension of nine feet wide and 18 feet long, excepting
required handicapped spaces, which shall meet the standard of
§ 84-55E(1)(b). The Board shall have the power during the
conditional use process to require compliance with
§ 84-55E(1)(a) if it determines in the exercise of its reasonable
discretion that such compliance is necessary under the specific
facts presented by an application.
(3) School parking garage.
(a) A parking garage shall be set back a minimum distance of 50
feet from the abutting property line, existing residential
dwellings, or street line, as the case may be, and shall be
buffered by a planted landscape screen for a minimum width of
30 feet meeting the requirements of § 84-55C(1)(a) and (b)
measured from the street line or, where there is no abutting
street, the property boundary line.
§ 84-57.10 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-57.10
72:777
(b) The adequacy and safety of vehicular and pedestrian access to
parking lots and parking spaces from existing contiguous or
adjacent public streets, and the capacity of the existing street
system to accommodate the proposed conditional use shall be
demonstrated by the applicant's submission of the traffic study
required by § 84-57.10G with the conditional use application.
(c) The access requirements of this § 84-57.10D shall apply.
(4) Loading. The requirements of § 84-55H shall apply in addition to
the following regulations:

Ord. No. 5-1991]
(1) In passing upon any application for a special exception made with
respect to the provisions of this article, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall require the applicant to strictly comply with the provisions of
this article. No special exception shall be granted in violation of the
area and bulk regulations or design standards of this chapter,
except as expressly provided for in this article or unless a variance
is granted from any applicable area and bulk regulation or design
standard otherwise applicable. The owner of a nonconformity has
no inherent right to build in gross conflict with setback, side and
rear yard requirements, coverage requirements or other area and
bulk regulations or design standards of the district in which the
property is located. For purposes of these provisions, the term
"area and bulk regulations" shall mean the lot size, lot width at
building line, lot width at street right-of-way line, lot coverage,

setback regulations within a lot in which a building or structure
may be located.
(2) In those districts in which the district regulations establish
different area and bulk regulations for uses permitted as of right
and for uses permitted by special exception or by conditional use,
no lot shall be construed to be nonconforming, for purposes of the
regulations established in this article, which complies with the
minimum lot size requirement applicable to uses permitted as of
right. Uses by special exception and/or conditional use shall not be
permitted on any such lot, and the area and bulk regulations
applicable to special exception and/or conditional use shall not
render the lot nonconforming unless the applicant demonstrates
that the lot cannot reasonably be used for any use permitted as of
right in such district or unless the area and bulk regulations
applicable to such uses permitted by special exception or
conditional use are the same as those applicable to uses as of right.
(3) No provision of this article which establishes a twenty-five-percent
limitation on the expansion of a nonconforming use shall be
construed to automatically authorize an expansion to such twentyfive-
percent maximum. It shall be incumbent upon the applicant to
§ 84-58 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-58
72:809
§ 84-59. Change of use; abandonment of use; restoration. [Amended
10-27-1981 by Ord. No. 10-1981]

principles of law. When such expansion has been permitted, no
further expansion shall be allowed either by action of the Zoning
Officer or the Zoning Hearing Board.
O. If the residential use of a single-family detached residential dwelling is
rendered nonconforming by an amendment to this chapter adopted
after the construction and residential use and occupancy of such
dwelling changing the zoning classification of the lot on which the
dwelling is located to any commercial or industrial zoning district
classification provided for in § 84-4 of this chapter, such dwelling may
be extended and enlarged on the lot held in single and separate
ownership at the time of such amendment subject to compliance with
the area and bulk regulations and design standards applicable to the
R-3 Residential Zoning District and to the owners' execution of a
covenant running with the land, in form suitable for recordation,
binding and enforceable by the Township against the owners, their
heirs, successors, administrators and assigns, in which the owner
agrees on his or their behalves that, upon cessation of the residential
use and occupancy, the lot and dwelling shall be used and occupied only
in compliance with the use and area and bulk regulations and the
design standards of the underlying commercial or industrial zoning, as
the case may be, and that the extension/enlargement authorized by this
subsection shall be removed. [Added 10-25-1994 by Ord. No.
3-1994]
A. Change of use. A lawful nonconforming use of land or of a building or
other structure shall not be changed to another nonconforming use but
may only be changed to a use permitted by the applicable zoning
regulations for the district in which the land, building or structure is
located. [Amended 1-28-1992 by Ord. No. 1-1992]
B. Abandonment of use. Whenever a nonconforming use of land or of a
building or other structure or any portion thereof is abandoned or
discontinued for a continuous period of one year or more, such
abandonment or discontinuance shall be presumed to constitute an
intention to abandon or discontinue such use and any subsequent use of
such land, building or structure shall be in conformity with the
provisions of this chapter. [Amended 1-28-1992 by Ord. No. 1-1992]
C. Restoration. Any lawful nonconforming building or other structure
which has been involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion,
windstorm or other similar act or cause or a nonconforming building
which has been legally condemned may be reconstructed and used for
the same nonconforming use, provided that the reconstructed buildings
shall not exceed in height, area and volume the building destroyed or
condemned and the building reconstruction shall be commenced within

Zoning Officer shall give notice of the registration or refusal to register in
the manner provided in § 84-62B(5) and, in addition, shall send notice of
such action to the property owner and any occupant or user thereof. Any
person aggrieved by the Zoning Officer's registration or refusal to register
any nonconforming use or structure shall appeal in the manner and within
the time limits provided in § 84-72 of this chapter or be forever barred
therefrom.
one year from the date the building was destroyed or condemned and
shall be carried on without interruption.
A. Any sign, signboard, billboard or advertising device existing at the time
of the passage of this chapter that does not conform with the
regulations of the district in which it is located shall be considered a
nonconforming sign and may be used in its existing location, provided
that it is maintained in good condition and repair at all times.
B. Nonconforming signs once removed may be replaced only with
conforming signs; however, legal nonconforming signs may be
repainted or, after issue of a permit, repaired or modernized, provided
that such repaired or modernized sign does not exceed the dimensions
of the existing sign.

shall be accompanied by six copies of the plans, attachments, and
explanatory materials describing the use or development proposed
by the landowner in lieu of the use or development permitted by
this chapter or the Zoning Map. Such plans shall be sufficiently
specific so as to provide reasonable notice of the proposed use or
development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the challenged
provision of this chapter or Map in conjunction with such plans.
The Board shall commence a hearing thereon within 60 days after
the request is filed. The curative amendment and challenge shall
be referred to the Township Planning Commission and Chester
County Planning Commission as provided in § 84-70D(1) hereof,
and public notice of the hearing thereon shall be given and shall
include notice that the validity of this chapter or Map is in question
and identify the place where and times when a copy of the request,

the public. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with

the Zoning Hearing Board shall, for purposes of this section, be
references to the Board of Supervisors. [Amended 4-24-2002 by

governing body shall consider the plans and explanatory materials
submitted by the landowner as well as the following factors:
(a) The impact of the proposed amendment upon roads, sewer
facilities, water supply, schools and other public service
facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of this chapter or the
Zoning Map;271
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, floodplains, aquifers,

destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to development and
any adverse environmental impacts; and
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(3) If the Board of Supervisors determines that a validity challenge has
merit, it may accept the landowner's curative amendment, with or
without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which
will cure the challenged defects.
(4) The landowner's request for a curative amendment is denied when:
(a) The Board of Supervisors fails to commence the public hearing
within 60 days after the request is filed;
(b) The governing body notifies the landowner that it will not
adopt a curative amendment;
(c) The governing body adopts another amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner; or
(d) The governing body fails to act on the request 45 days after the
close of the last public hearing on the request, unless the time
is extended by mutual consent by the landowner and the
Township.
E. Procedure for Township curative amendments.
(1) If the Township determines that this Zoning Ordinance or any
portion hereof is substantially invalid, it shall take the following
actions:
(a) Declare by formal action this chapter or any portion hereof
affected substantially invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such validity.
(b) Within 30 days following such declaration and proposal, the
Board of Supervisors shall:
[1] By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the
declared invalidity thereof which may include references
to specific uses which are either not permitted or not
permitted in sufficient quantity, reference to a class of use
or uses which require revision and reference to the
provision(s) of this chapter which requires revision.
[2] Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to
this chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
(2) Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Board of Supervisors shall enact a curative amendment to validate
§ 84-70 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-70
72:824
or reaffirm the validity of this chapter in order to cure the declared
invalidity of this chapter.
(3) Upon initiation of the procedures set forth in this subsection,
neither the Board of Supervisors nor the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative
amendment filed under MPC Section 609.1, 909.1 or 916.1272
subsequent to the declaration and proposal based upon the
grounds identical to or substantially similar to those specified in
the resolution required by Subsection E(1)(b)[1] of this § 84-70.
Upon completion of the procedures as set forth in Subsection E(1)
and (2) of this § 84-70, no rights to a cure pursuant to the
provisions of MPC Sections 609.1 and 916.1273 shall, from the date
of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the
basis of the substantive invalidity of this unamended chapter for
which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
section.
(4) Following the date of the enactment of a curative amendment or
reaffirmation of the validity of this chapter pursuant to Subsection
E(1) and (2), the Township may not again utilize this procedure for
a thirty-six-month period; provided, however, that if after the date
of declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty or
obligation imposed upon the Township by virtue of a change in
statute or by virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the
Township may utilize the provisions of this section to prepare a
curative amendment to this chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.
F. Public hearing.
(1) Before voting on the enactment of an amendment to this chapter,
the Board of Supervisors shall fix the time and place of a public
hearing on the proposed amendment, which hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice. In addition, if the proposed amendment
involves a Zoning Map change, notice of said public hearing shall
be conspicuously posted by the Zoning Officer at points along the
perimeter of the lot or tract sufficient to notify potentially
interested citizens. Such posting shall be accomplished at least one
week prior to the date of the hearing. In addition to the
requirement that notice be posted on the property, if the proposed
amendment involves a Zoning Map change, notice of the public
hearing shall be mailed by the Township at least 30 days prior to
the date of the hearing by first class mail to the addresses to which
real estate tax bills are sent for all real property located within the
area being rezoned, as evidenced by tax records within the
possession of the Township. The notice shall include the location,
date and time of the public hearing. This public notice shall not be
required when the rezoning constitutes a comprehensive rezoning

member provided in this chapter and by law. Any alternate may
participate in any proceeding or discussion of the Board but shall
not be entitled to vote as a member of the Board nor be

rate of compensation authorized to be paid to the members of the
Board of Supervisors.

5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]:
(1) Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance,

§ 84-71 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-72
72:828
(3) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but
not limited to the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act
on the application therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist
order or enforcement notice or the registration or refusal to
register any nonconforming use, structure or lot.

Zoning Officer with reference to the administration of any
floodplain or flood hazard ordinance or such provisions within this
chapter or any land use ordinance.
(5) Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter, including
the floodplain regulations of Article XIX, pursuant to § 910.2 of the
Municipalities Planning Code.277 [Amended 7-19-2017 by Ord.
No. 5-2017]
(6) Applications for special exceptions under the terms of this chapter,
including the floodplain regulations of Article XIX, pursuant to §
912.1 of the Municipalities Planning Code.278 [Amended
7-19-2017 by Ord. No. 5-2017]
(7) Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under MPC
Section 916.2.279
(8) Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or the
Township Engineer in the administration of this chapter or any land
use ordinance or provision thereof with reference to sedimentation
and erosion control and stormwater management, insofar as the
same relates to development not involving subdivision and/or land
development applications under Chapter 72 of the West Goshen
Code.
(9) Any other application authorized by law to be taken to the Zoning
Hearing Board.
B. Zoning Hearing Board's functions; variances. Upon denial of a permit
by the Zoning Officer, the Board shall hear a request for variances
where it is alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary
hardship upon the applicant. The Board may grant a variance, provided
that all of the following findings are made where relevant in a given
case: [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape or
exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to
276. Editor's Note: Former Subsection A(2), which gave the Zoning Hearing Board exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and render final adjudications on challenges to the validity of a land
use ordinance raising procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment
or adoption, was repealed 12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 10-2008.
277. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10910.2.
278. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10912.1.

§ 84-72 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-72
72:829
the particular property, and the necessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of this chapter, and the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
(3) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
C. Zoning Hearing Board's functions. [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No.
3-1990]
(1) Special exceptions. In those instances in which this chapter
provides for special exceptions to be granted or denied by the
Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express standards and criteria
established in this chapter, the Board shall hear and decide
requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such
standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition
to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter and the provisions of the
MPC.280
(2) Substantive challenge.
(a) A landowner who, on substantive grounds, desires to challenge
the validity of this chapter or the Zoning Map281 or any
provision thereof which prohibits or restricts the use or
development of land in which he has an interest may submit
the challenge to the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with
§ 84-72A(1) hereof.
(b) Persons aggrieved by a use or development permitted on the
land of an owner by this chapter or the Zoning Map or any
provision hereof who desire to challenge its validity on

§ 84-72 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-72
72:830
substantive grounds shall first submit their challenge to the
Hearing Board for a decision thereon pursuant to § 84-72A(1)
hereof.
(c) The submissions referred to in Subsection C(2)(a) and (b) of
this section shall be governed by the provisions of and
procedures established in MPC Section 916.1282 and § 84-72L
of this chapter; provided, however, that if, following hearing
thereon, the Zoning Hearing Board fails to act on the
landowner's request within 45 days after the conclusion of the
last hearing, a denial of the request is deemed to have
occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last hearing.
D. Parties appellant before the Board. [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No.
3-1990]
(1) Appeals to the Zoning Hearing Board under § 84-72A(1), (2), (3),
(4), (7), (8) and (9) may be filed with the Board, in writing, by the
landowner affected, any officer or agency of the Township or any
person aggrieved. Requests for variances under § 84-72B and for
special exception under § 84-72C(1) may be filed with the Board by
any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner.
(2) Upon filing an appeal under this section and during its pendency
before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged
ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or of any agency
or body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed unless the
Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property, in which case the development or official
action shall not be stayed otherwise then by a restraining order,
which may be granted by the Board or by a court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly
approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the
approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the
applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition
to continuing the proceedings before the Board.
E. Appeals, applications or challenges shall be initiated before this Board
by filing with the Zoning Officer a petition which shall state:
(1) The name and address of the applicant.
(2) The name and address of the owner of the real estate to be affected
by the proposed relief.
282. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.1.
§ 84-72 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-72
72:831
(3) A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by
such proposed relief.
(4) A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question, the date of acquisition thereof and the present use
thereof.
(5) A statement of the section of this chapter under which an exception
is requested or variance sought or to which challenge as to the
validity is made and a statement of the specific relief sought and
the provisions applicable thereto.
(6) A reasonably accurate description of the present improvements
and the additions intended to be made shall accompany the
application, indicating the size of such proposed improvements,
materials and general construction thereof and sufficient
information to display compliance with the area, bulk and setback
requirements and design standards of this chapter, together with
six copies of the plot plan of the real estate to be affected, prepared
by a registered engineer or registered land surveyor, indicating the
location and size of the lot and size of the improvements now
erected and proposed to be erected showing all dimensions,
computations, areas, percentages and measurements necessary to
demonstrate compliance with all the applicable zoning regulations
and six copies of the application for building permit, showing the
Zoning Officer's action with respect thereto. [Amended
3-10-2004 by Ord. No. 3-2004]
F. Time limitation. [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board
later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate
Township officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to
secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such
person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound
by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. The failure of
anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse
decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of this
chapter or the Zoning Map283 pursuant to MPC Section 916.2284
shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case
where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved preliminary approval.
283. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the office of the Township Secretary.
284. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10916.2.
§ 84-72 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-72
72:832
(2) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
G. Application deposits and charges against deposits. [Amended
8-22-1989 by Ord. No. 8-1989]
(1) Upon submission of any application to the Zoning Hearing Board,
the applicant shall deposit as part of the application with the
Township Zoning Officer or other administrative officer receiving
the application the filing fee designated by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors then in effect.
(2) Additional deposits. If at any time the charges then made against
the applicant's deposit shall render the balance insufficient to
insure the payment of all costs, expenses, charges and fees that
may accrue in the disposition of the pending application, the
Zoning Hearing Board may require additional deposits to be made
from time to time to assure adequate funds to pay such charges,
costs, expenses and fees as they may accrue. The failure of the
Zoning Hearing Board to demand additional deposits from time to
time shall not relieve the applicant of liability for costs, charges,
fees and expenses in excess of deposits, hereinafter called
deficiencies.
(3) Upon failure of the applicant to pay the deposits, additional
deposits or deficiencies within 30 days or prior to the next
scheduled hearing (whichever be the earlier date), the Board may:
(a) Continue the matter generally until such deposits, additional
deposits or deficiencies are paid, in which case the record shall
remain open and the time within which a decision must be
rendered shall not commence to run;
(b) Dismiss applicant's appeal in which case no new appeal may be
filed if the time for filing an appeal as set forth in § 84-72F
above has expired;
(c) Determine the appeal upon the record as it then stands; or
(d) Take such other action as it deems proper under the
circumstances.
H. Representation before the Board. Any applicant may appear in propria
persona or may be represented by an attorney at law, duly admitted to
practice in the Courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. No
persons not admitted to practice before the Courts of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as an attorney at law shall represent
any other person, firm or corporation before the Board; provided,
however, that representation of a corporate applicant by its responsible
officers shall be deemed for the purpose of this provision
§ 84-72 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-72
72:833
representation in propria persona. The Board shall have power in its
discretion to waive this rule.
I. Notice of public hearing. The Board shall give public notice of its
hearing as follows: [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]
(1) By conspicuously posting written notice of the hearing on the
affected lot at least one week prior to the hearing.
(2) Mailing of notice.
(a) By mailing notice thereof to the following;
[1] The applicant.

[8] Each Township Supervisor.
[9] Each member of the Zoning Hearing Board.
[10] Each member of the Township Planning Commission.
[11] The County Planning Commission.
[12] The Township Zoning Officer.
(b) The failure to send notice to any of the above-named or
designated persons shall not invalidate any action taken by the
Board.
J. Notices of decisions of the Zoning Hearing Board shall be sent to all
persons designated in Subsection I(2)(a)[2], [3], [4], [5], [8], [10] and
[11]. The notices shall state the matter under consideration, the nature
of the decision rendered and the place within the Township where a
true and correct copy of the decision may be examined by any person
interested.
K. True and correct copies of the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board
shall be sent to those persons designated in Subsection I(2)(a)[1], [6],
[7], [9] and [12]. True and correct copies of the decision shall also be
sent to any person who has formally appeared as a party to such
§ 84-72 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-72
72:834
proceedings and to the attorney of any such person who has appeared
as a party to such proceedings. The decision shall be rendered and
served upon the persons herein described and as required in
accordance with the provisions of MPC Section 908(9) and (10).285
[Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]
L. Procedure before the Board. The Board shall conduct hearings and
make decisions in accordance with the provisions of MPC Section
908286 and in accordance with such rules of procedure as may be
adopted by the Zoning Hearing Board and in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter. [Amended 5-8-1990 by Ord. No.
3-1990]
M. Expiration of special exceptions and variances. Unless otherwise
specified by the Zoning Hearing Board, a special exception or variance
shall expire if the applicant fails to file a subdivision application, a land
development application, a building permit or, if no building permit is
required, a use and occupancy permit, as applicable, within six months
from the date of authorization of the Board. [Amended 11-13-1979 by
Ord. No. 5-79; 3-10-2004 by Ord. No. 3-2004]
(1) Where such application is made within six months, the same shall
be prosecuted with due diligence by the applicant, and the sixmonth
time limitation shall be deemed extended only during the
pendency of such application.
(2) The applicant may apply to the Zoning Officer for a single extension
not to exceed six months from the date said special exception or
variance would have otherwise expired, provided that the
application is made within the six-month period after the grant by
the Zoning Hearing Board of the original variance or special
exception and not thereafter.
(3) If, upon such application to the Zoning Officer, the Zoning Officer
determines that there has been no change in the applicable
ordinances or the conditions existing at the time of the grant of the
original special exception and/or variance, he may grant such
extension to a date certain.
(4) Upon taking any action on such application, the Zoning Officer
shall send written notice to the applicant, the Township Engineer,
the Township Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors, the
Township Solicitor, the Zoning Hearing Board and any person who
appeared in the original proceeding as a party of record.
(5) Any person to whom such notice is required to be sent may appeal
to the Zoning Hearing Board from the action of the Zoning Officer
in granting or denying such extension, provided that such appeal is

286. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10908.
§ 84-72 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-72
72:835
duly filed with the Zoning Hearing Board within 30 days of such
action by the Zoning Officer.
N. Appeals to court. Land use appeals from decisions of the Board or from
any determination within the Board's jurisdiction shall be governed by
the provisions of Article X-A of the MPC.287 [Amended 5-8-1990 by
Ord. No. 3-1990]
O. Standards for review of proposed exception or variance.
(1) In any instance where the Board is required to consider a request
for a special exception or variance in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter, the Board shall, to the full extent
permitted by law, consider the following factors where appropriate:
(a) The statement of community objectives of the Zoning
Ordinance.
(b) The size, scope, extent and character of the exception or
variance desired and assure itself that such requests are
consistent with the spirit, purpose and intent of the Zoning
Ordinance.
(c) The suitability of the property for the use desired and the
extent to which the new or expanded use is susceptible to
regulation by appropriate conditions and safeguards.
(d) The effect of the proposed use upon the public health, safety,
morals and general welfare of the community.
(e) Where pertinent, the effects of the proposed change with
respect to conserving the value of buildings; safety from fire,
panic and other dangers; adequacy of light and air; the
overcrowding of land; and the congestion of population.
(f) The character and type of development in the area surrounding
the location for which the request is made and determine that
the proposed change or modification as permitted will
constitute an appropriate use in the area and will not
substantially injure or detract from the use of surrounding
property or from the character of the neighborhood.
(g) Guide the development of highway frontage insofar as possible
so as to limit the total number of access points, reduce the
need for on-street parking and encourage the frontage of
buildings on parallel marginal roads perpendicular to the
highway.
(h) Consider the probable effects of proposed development on
highway congestion and ensure that adequate access

§ 84-72.1. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion. [Added
5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990]
In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that this chapter or the Zoning Map288 under which he proposes
to build is free from challenge, such landowner may advance the date from
which time any challenge to this chapter or the Zoning Map will run under
§ 84-72F(1) (MPC Section 914.1289) by the following procedure:
arrangements are provided in order to protect major highways
from undue congestion and hazard.
(2) In the case of a variance in addition to any applicable standards of
the subsections above, the more specific requirements or criteria
contained in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code shall
apply.
(3) In granting any variance or special exception, the Board may attach
such reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to those
expressed in this chapter as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of the Planning Code and Zoning Ordinance, which
conditions and safeguards may relate to but not be limited to
aesthetics, screening, lighting, noise, safety and the minimization
of noxious, offensive or hazardous elements. Each special exception
shall be clearly authorized by a provision of this chapter and shall
comply with any more specific standards relating to such exception
contained in this chapter.
(4) In the case of a request for a special exception or variance, it shall
be the responsibility of the applicant to present such evidence as is
necessary to demonstrate that the proposed use or modification
complies with the pertinent criteria or standards set forth in this
section or adoption by reference to the Municipalities Planning
Code. The applicant for a special exception shall have the burden of
proof that his application falls within the provisions of this chapter
and that granting his application will not be contrary to the public
interest.
A. The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion as to their compliance with this chapter. Such plans and other
materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed for
preliminary or final approval or for the issuance of a building permit so
long as the Zoning Officer is satisfied that they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance.

B. If the Zoning Officer determines that the use or development complies
with this chapter, notice thereof shall be published once each week for
two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Township. The notice shall include a general description of the
proposed use or development and its location and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under § 84-72F(1) and the time
therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board shall run from the time when the second notice thereof
has been published.

ARTICLE XVIII
Jurisdiction of Board of Supervisors
[Adopted 5-8-1990 by Ord. No. 3-1990290]
§ 84-73. Jurisdiction.
The Board of Supervisors shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and
render final adjudications in the following matters:
§ 84-74. Conditional uses. [Amended 10-25-1994 by Ord. No.
3-1994]
A. Applications for conditional use as provided in this article.
B. Applications for curative amendment to this chapter or the Zoning
Map291 as provided in § 84-70D of this chapter.
C. Petition for amendments to this chapter or the Zoning Map, provided
that any action on such petition shall be deemed a legislative act.
D. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or the Township
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or the
provisions thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control
and stormwater management insofar as the same relate to application
for land development under Chapter 72 of the West Goshen Code.
E. Applications for a special encroachment permit pursuant to MPC
Section 405 and applications for a permit pursuant to MPC Section
406.292
A. Statement of intent. This chapter provides for certain uses which are
conditionally permitted within the Township as conditional uses,
designated as such based upon the Supervisors' recognition that such
uses may or may not be appropriate within such specific zoning districts
where they are otherwise allowed. The Supervisors have therefore
determined that procedures, standards and criteria as established in
this section are appropriate to enable the Supervisors to evaluate and
decide upon conditional use applications. Conditional uses are so
classified because they have the potential for substantial impact upon
the West Goshen Township community as it has developed.
Consequently, these uses must comply with the minimum standards for
conditional uses herein described in addition to the area and bulk
regulations, design standards and general regulations stipulated as
controlling within the zoning district in which the proposed conditional
use is authorized. Failure of any proposed conditional use to comply
with any of these standards and criteria shall be grounds for denial of a
290. Editor's Note: This ordinance repealed former Art. XVIII, Rules of Procedure of Board of
Supervisors.
291. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the office of the Township Secretary.
292. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10405 and 10406, respectively.
§ 84-73 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-74
72:839
conditional use application. If there is a conflict between the standards
set forth in this section and the other applicable criteria and standards
elsewhere established in this chapter or other applicable Township
ordinances, it is the legislative intent of the Supervisors that the more
stringent standards shall always apply. It is not the intent of this section
to abrogate or impair any other such standards or requirements.
B. Application submission procedure.
(1) Content of application.
(a) An application for conditional use approval shall be submitted
on a form provided by the Township and shall be accompanied
by the application fee, the amount of which shall be established
by resolution of the Supervisors.
(b) Whenever a conditional use permit is required by this chapter
for any use proposed or inherent in any proposed subdivision
or land development, six copies of the conditional use
application, accompanied by six copies of the conditional use
plan, attachments and explanatory materials shall be filed with
the Township contemporaneously with the filing of a
preliminary plan for subdivision and/or land development, as
applicable, complying with the West Goshen Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, codified in
Chapter 72 of the West Goshen Code. [Amended 3-10-2004
by Ord. No. 3-2004]
(c) Where a preliminary subdivision or land development plan is
not required because the conditional use does not occur within
the context of a development requiring subdivision or land
development approval, the application for conditional use shall
include a plan meeting the preliminary plan specifications
established in Chapter 72 of the West Goshen Code.
C. Administrative application review procedure. The Zoning Officer shall
review the application to determine if it is complete. If deficient in any
required component, the Zoning Officer shall notify the applicant of the
deficiencies in writing. If such identified deficiencies are not remedied
promptly by the applicant, they shall constitute sufficient grounds for
denial by the Supervisors of the application subsequent to public
hearing should the Board deem such deficiencies to be substantially at
variance with the requirements of this or other applicable Township
ordinances.
D. Review and decision process for conditional use applications.
(1) Notice of the hearing shall be provided by the Township in
accordance with the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.293 The Board shall schedule the first
293. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. 10101 et seq.
§ 84-74 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-74
72:840
hearing within 60 days from the date of the Township's receipt
of the applicant's application, unless the applicant has agreed in
writing to an extension of time. Each subsequent hearing shall be
held within 45 days of the prior hearing, unless otherwise agreed
to by the applicant in writing or on the record. An applicant should
complete the presentation of his case-in-chief within 100 days of
the first hearing. Upon the request of the applicant, the Board or
Hearing Officer shall assure that the applicant receives at least
seven hours of hearing within the 100 days, including the first
hearing. Persons opposed to the application shall complete the
presentation of their opposition to the application within 100 days
of the first hearing held after the completion of the applicants casein-
chief. An applicant may, upon request, be granted additional
hearings to complete his case-in-chief, provided the persons
opposed to the application are granted an equal number of
additional hearings. Persons opposed to the application, may, upon
the written consent or consent on the record by the applicant
and municipality, be granted additional hearings to complete their
opposition to the application, provided the applicant is granted
an equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal. [Amended
7-23-1997 by Ord. No. 10-97; 2-12-2003 by Ord. No. 3-2003;
12-10-2008 by Ord. No. 10-2008]
(2) The hearing shall be conducted by the Board or the Board may
appoint any member or an independent attorney as a hearing
officer. The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the findings
shall be made by the Board. However, the appellant or the
applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the Township, may,
prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by
the Board and accept the decisions or findings of the hearing
officer as final. [Added 4-24-2002 by Ord. No. 4-2002294]
(3) Any substantial revisions to the application or plan made by the
applicant subsequent to filing of the application or plan or its
review by the Planning Commission shall be subject to review and
recommendation by the Planning Commission as specified in
Subsection D(1) of this section prior to the Supervisors' public
hearing. In such event, the Zoning Officer shall secure from the
applicant a written extension of the date within which the
Supervisors must hold a public hearing pursuant to Subsection
D(1) of this section. If the applicant fails to execute the extension,
the Supervisors shall decide the conditional use application on the
basis of the plan and application as originally filed.
(4) A stenographic record of the hearing shall be made by a certified
court reporter, whose appearance fee shall be shared equally by
the applicant and the Township. The cost of the original transcript
shall be paid by the Supervisors only if they order it or by any party
294. Editor's Note: This ordinance also renumbered former Subsections D(2) through (7) as
Subsections D(3) through (8), respectively.
§ 84-74 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-74
72:841
requesting an original transcript or by the person appealing from
the decision of the Supervisors in the event of an appeal. In either
case, the cost of additional copies shall be paid by the party or
person requesting such copies.
(5) The Supervisors shall render a written decision or, when no
decision is called for, make written findings on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before the
Supervisors. The date for the Supervisors' decision may be
extended by the applicant either on the record or in writing
addressed to the Supervisors. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact or
conclusions based thereon, together with any reasons therefor.
Conclusions based upon this chapter, the PaMPC or any rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and
the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light
of the facts found. A copy of the decision or, where no decision is
called for, of the findings, shall be delivered to the applicant
personally or mailed to him no later than the day following its date.
If, after the conclusion of the public hearing(s), the application is
amended or revised, the Supervisors shall hold one or more public
hearings thereon as may be necessary and shall issue a new
decision thereon in conformance with the procedure established in
this section. In the event that the Supervisors fail to commence the
required hearing within 60 days from the date of the applicant's
request for a hearing, or fail to complete the hearing no later than
100 days after the completion of the applicant's case-in-chief,
unless extended for good cause upon application to the Court of
Common Pleas, the decision shall be deemed to have been
rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing or on the record, to an extension of time. [Amended
4-24-2002 by Ord. No. 4-2002]
(6) In granting or denying a conditional use or establishing conditions
will respect thereto, the Supervisors shall determine compliance
with the standards and criteria established in this section to be
mandatory. The burden shall be upon the applicant to prove his
case by a fair preponderance of the credible evidence unless any
rule of law shifts that burden to protestants. The standard required
by this subsection shall be deemed a part of the definitional aspect
under which a conditional use may be granted, and the failure of
the applicant to establish his compliance with all of the standards
shall constitute sufficient basis for denial of the application. In
allowing a conditional use, the Supervisors may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards in addition to those
otherwise expressed in this section as they deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this chapter and any other applicable
Township ordinances.

§ 84-75. General standards for conditional use approval. [Added
10-25-1994 by Ord. No. 3-1994296; amended 9-25-2002 by Ord. No.
11-2002]
(7) Unless otherwise specified by the Board of Supervisors in the
conditional use decision, a conditional use approval shall expire if
the applicant fails to apply for a building permit or, if no building
permit is required, a use and occupancy permit within one year
from the date of the Board's decision approving the conditional use.
In instances where the development which requires conditional use
approval also requires subdivision or land development approval,
the conditional use approval shall be valid for as long as the
subdivision or land development plans are valid pursuant to
Section 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,295
provided that the subdivision or land development plans are filed
within one year after receiving conditional use approval. If the
subdivision or land development plans are not filed within one year
from the date of conditional use approval, the approval shall expire
one year from the date of the Board's decision. [Amended
4-14-2010 by Ord. No. 02-2010]
(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve the applicant
for a conditional use approval from obtaining all other required
approvals mandated by this chapter and other applicable Township
ordinances or regulations and the laws and regulations of state and
federal regulatory authorities.
A. The following standards shall apply in every conditional use application,
and the burden of proof by a fair preponderance of the credible
evidence to demonstrate compliance with these standards shall be upon
the applicant. In reviewing and acting upon a conditional use
application, the Supervisors shall, in addition to requiring compliance
with the express standards and criteria established in the applicable
zoning district for the use proposed, require the applicant's compliance
with the following standards:
(1) No conditional use shall be approved unless the Supervisors find as
a fact from the evidence the following:
(a) That improvements to streets and highways contiguous to the
applicant's property as part of the improvements for the
proposed conditional use development, such as road widening,
acceleration/deceleration lanes, traffic control devices and
similar improvements, shall be sufficient to prevent adverse
traffic impacts caused by the proposed use.
(b) That buffer areas are provided within the applicant's property
to effectively screen the proposed conditional use from

72:843
adjoining uses and properties whether similar or dissimilar in
type or character. Where, in the opinion of the Supervisors,
the proposed screening otherwise required by this chapter or
Chapter 72 of the West Goshen Code is insufficient to create a
visual barrier, additional screening consisting of a mixture of
plant materials and trees, both deciduous and coniferous, shall
be required.
(c) That building, structure, parking and street setbacks from
adjoining properties are sufficient to remove any potential
adverse impact or interference with adjoining uses, whether
similar or dissimilar. The Supervisors may require a reasonable
increase in setbacks and/or buffer areas otherwise mandated
by the applicable zoning district regulations.
(d) That the proposed conditional use shall be served by adequate
and effective public sewer facilities and public water for
domestic and fire supply.
(e) The applicant shall establish that the capacity of the road
network providing access to the premises in question shall not
lower the level of service of any intersections determined
critical to the proposed use below a level of service C when the
incremental increase in traffic attributable to the proposed use
is superimposed upon the existing use of the road. [Amended
4-14-2010 by Ord. No. 02-2010]
(f) The applicant shall establish that the interior traffic circulation
for the proposed use at the proposed location, including but
not limited to acceleration and deceleration lanes where
required at the proposed entrances to the location, shall be
adequate to provide safe and convenient circulation for users
of the facility, visitors to the facility, employees of the facility
and all emergency vehicles that may require entrance thereon.
(g) The applicant shall establish that the facility provides safe and
convenient pedestrian access and internal circulation within
the grounds of the facility and particularly for points of access
from the facility to the parking areas.
(h) The applicant shall establish that adequate screening and
buffering is provided between the lands in question and
surrounding residential uses and residentially zoned districts
to screen the facility from view and preclude any glare from
lighting or noise from being ascertainable beyond the
boundaries of the property.
(i) The applicant shall establish that the fire company which will
provide fire protection services to the proposed use has
adequate equipment to reach the highest points of the
proposed building with ladders and hoses or, in the alternative,
§ 84-75 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-75
72:844
§ 84-76. (Reserved)
§ 84-77. (Reserved)
that the owner or operator of the facility will provide such
equipment. [Amended 4-14-2010 by Ord. No. 02-2010]
(j) 297The applicant shall establish the adequacy and availability of
sanitary sewer facilities and the availability of capacity within
the public sanitary sewage system, if applicable, to service the
proposed facility or such other adequate provision for such
service as complies with the regulations of governmental or
quasigovernmental authorities having jurisdiction.
(k) The applicant shall establish that there will be no increase in
surface water runoff at the boundaries of the premises beyond
that runoff presently existing, as required by state law and
Township regulations.
(l) Public water availability and adequacy shall be demonstrated.
B. In granting a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors shall have the
power to attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition
to those expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to
implement the purposes and provisions of this chapter.
C. The standards required in this section and those applicable standards
established elsewhere within this chapter shall be deemed a part of the
definitional aspect under which a conditional use may be granted, and
the failure of the applicant to establish its compliance with all of the
standards shall, in the reasonable discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, be deemed either a basis for the establishing of conditions
or limitations on a conditional use approval or, where warranted, the
basis for a determination that the applicant has not brought himself
within the requirements for which a conditional use may be granted.
297. Editors Note: Former Subsection A(1)(j), which required that the applicant establish that
adequate water storage was available at the facility for fire-fighting purposes, was
repealed 4-14-2010 by Ord. No. 02-2010. This ordinance also provided for the
redesignation of former Subsection A(1)(k) through (m) as Subsection A(1)(j) through (l),
respectively.

ARTICLE XIX
Floodplain Regulations
[Added 7-19-2017 by Ord. No. 5-2017298]
§ 84-78. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,299 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of
its citizenry. Pursuant to such authority and the authority granted by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Code, the Board of Supervisors (the "Board")
of West Goshen Township (the "Township") does hereby adopt the within
floodplain regulations.
§ 84-79. Intent.
The intent of this article is to:
§ 84-80. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation
to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any construction or development
anywhere within any identified floodplain area in West Goshen Township
unless a permit has been obtained from the floodplain administrator.
§ 84-81. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This article supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in
effect in identified floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance
provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this article, the more restrictive shall apply.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting the water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents by preventing excessive development in areas
subject to flooding.
E. Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
298. Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the repeal of former Art. XIX, Flood Hazard
District, adopted 5-17-1973 by Ord. No 2-1973, as amended.
299. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. AA 679.101 et seq.

§ 84-82. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
§ 84-83. Designation of floodplain administrator.
§ 84-84. Permits required.
A permit shall be required before any construction or development is
undertaken within any identified floodplain area of West Goshen Township.
§ 84-85. Duties and responsibilities of floodplain administrator.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is
considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This article shall not create liability on the part of West Goshen
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
A. The Zoning Officer is hereby appointed to administer and enforce this
article and is referred to herein as the "floodplain administrator." The
floodplain administrator may:
(1) Fulfill the duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations;
(2) Delegate duties and responsibilities set forth in these regulations
to qualified technical personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and
other employees; or
(3) Enter into a written agreement or written contract with another
agency or private sector entity to administer specific provisions of
these regulations. Administration of any part of these regulations
by another entity shall not relieve the community of its
responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of
Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
B. In the absence of a designated floodplain administrator, the floodplain
administrator duties are to be fulfilled by the Township Engineer.
A. The floodplain administrator shall issue a permit only after it has been
determined that the proposed work to be undertaken will be in
conformance with the requirements of this and all other applicable
codes and ordinances.
§ 84-82 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-85
72:848
B. Prior to the issuance of any permit, the floodplain administrator shall
review the application for the permit to determine if all other necessary
government permits required by state and federal laws have been
obtained, such as those required by the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities
Act (Act 1966-537, as amended);300 the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and
Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as amended);301 the Pennsylvania
Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended);302 and the United
States Clean Water Act, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1344. No permit shall
be issued until this determination has been made.
C. In the case of existing structures, prior to the issuance of any
development/permit, the floodplain administrator shall review the
proposed cost of improvements or repairs and the preimprovement
market value of the structure, so that a substantial improvement/
substantial damage determination can be made, in accordance with
FEMA's Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference.
D. During the construction period, the floodplain administrator or other
authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine that the work
is progressing in compliance with the information provided on the
permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and
ordinances. He/she shall make as many inspections during and upon
completion of the work as are necessary.
E. In the discharge of his/her duties, the floodplain administrator shall
have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises or
development in the identified floodplain area, upon presentation of
proper credentials, at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of
this article.
F. In the event the floodplain administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the floodplain administrator shall
revoke the permit and report such fact to the Board of Supervisors for
whatever action it considers necessary.
G. The floodplain administrator shall maintain in perpetuity, or for the
lifetime of the structure, all records associated with the requirements of
this article, including, but not limited to, finished construction elevation
data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
H. The floodplain administrator is the official responsible for submitting a
biennial report to FEMA concerning community participation in the
National Flood Insurance Program as requested.
I. The responsibility, authority and means to implement the commitments
of the floodplain administrator can be delegated from the person

the proposed plan.
§ 84-88. Review of application by others.
A copy of all plans and applications for any proposed construction or
development in any identified floodplain area to be considered for approval
may be submitted by the floodplain administrator to any other appropriate
agencies and/or individuals (e.g., Planning Commission, Municipal
Engineer, etc.) for review and comment.
§ 84-89. Changes.
After the issuance of a permit by the floodplain administrator, no changes
of any kind shall be made to the application, permit or any of the plans,
specifications or other documents submitted with the application without
the written consent or approval of the floodplain administrator. Requests for
any such change shall be in writing, and shall be submitted by the applicant
to the floodplain administrator for consideration.
§ 84-90. Placards.
In addition to the permit, the floodplain administrator shall issue a placard,
or similar document, which shall be displayed on the premises during

of the permit, the date of its issuance, and be signed by the floodplain
administrator.
§ 84-90.1. Start of construction.
A. Work on the proposed construction or development shall begin within
180 days after the date of issuance of the development permit. Work
shall also be completed within 12 months after the date of issuance of
the permit or the permit shall expire unless a time extension is granted,
in writing, by the floodplain administrator. The issuance of a
development permit does not refer to the zoning approval.
B. The "actual start of construction" means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied
as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial
improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration
of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

72:854
§ 84-90.5. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by West Goshen Township and
declared to be a part of this article.
A. The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include Floodway Areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any Floodway Area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
B. The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(1) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
(2) The AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided but no floodway
has been determined.
(a) No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted in an
AE Zone without floodway, unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that the

§ 84-90.6. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such
change to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months
after the date such information becomes available, the Township shall
notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting
technical or scientific data.
proposed development, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, would not result in an increase in
flood levels of more than one foot within the entire community
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional
office.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site.
D. The AO and AH Area/District shall be those areas identified as Zones
AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to
inundation by one-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding where
average depths are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH,
drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters around and
away from structures on slopes.
E. In lieu of any of the analysis or methods set forth above, the Township
may require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic
and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the municipality. In the
absence of any of the above data or documentation, the Township may
require elevation of the lowest floor to be at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade.

72:856
§ 84-90.7. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the floodplain administrator, with
input from the Township Engineer, and any party aggrieved by this decision
or determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 84-90.8. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the Township
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The Township shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
§ 84-90.9. General technical provisions.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse:
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's
regional office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When West Goshen Township proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base flood
elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones
A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a
rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including, but not limited to, installing culverts
and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the FEMA Administrator's conditional approval of
map change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a

ARTICLE XXIII
Airport Zoning Regulations
[Added 6-14-1983 by Ord. No. 2-1983]
§ 84-108. Purpose and intent.
This article is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by the Airport
Zoning Act, Act of April 17, 1945, P.L. 237, as amended.317 It is hereby found
that obstructions have the potential for endangering the lives and property
of users of the existing airport located in the Township and property or
occupants of land in its vicinity; that obstructions may affect existing and
future instrument-approach minimums of the airport; and that obstructions
may reduce the size of areas available for landing, takeoff and maneuvering
of aircraft, thereby creating a danger to the health, safety and general
welfare of the users thereof and the property or occupants of land in the
vicinity thereof. Accordingly, it is declared that:
§ 84-109. Definitions.
For the purpose of this article, the terms used herein are defined as follows:
AIRPORT  See "commercial airport" per § 84-8.
AIRPORT ELEVATION  The highest point of an airport's usable landing
area measured in feet from sea level, which is 465 feet.
APPROACH SURFACE  A surface longitudinally centered on the extended
runway center line, extending outward and upward from the end of the
primary surface and at the same slope as the approach zone height
limitation slope set forth in § 84-111 of this article. In plan, the perimeter of
the approach surface coincides with the perimeter of the approach zone.
APPROACH, TRANSITIONAL, HORIZONTAL AND CONICAL ZONES 
These zones as set forth in § 84-110 of this article.
CONICAL SURFACED  A surface extending outward and upward from
the periphery of the horizontal surface at a slope of 20:1 for a horizontal
distance of 4,000 feet.
A. The creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of
being a public danger or nuisance;
B. It is necessary in the interest of the public health, safety and general
welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a
hazard to air navigation be prevented; and
C. The prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the
extent legally permissible, by the exercise of the police power without
compensation.
317. Editor's Note: See 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5911 et seq.
§ 84-108 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-109
72:891
HAZARD TO AIR NAVIGATION  An obstruction determined to have a
substantial adverse effect on the safe and efficient utilization of the
navigable airspace.
HEIGHT  For the purpose of determining the height limits in all zones set
forth in this article and shown on the Zoning Map, the datum shall be mean
sea level elevation unless otherwise specified.
HORIZONTAL SURFACE  A horizontal plane 150 feet above the
established airport elevation, the perimeter of which in plan coincides with
the perimeter of the horizontal zone.
NONPRECISION INSTRUMENT RUNWAY  A runway having an existing
instrument-approach procedure utilizing air navigation facilities with only
horizontal guidance or having area-type navigation equipment for which a
straight-in nonprecision-instrument-approach procedure has been approved
or planned.
OBSTRUCTION  Any structure, growth or other object, including a mobile
object, which exceeds a limiting height set forth in § 84-111 of this article.
PRIMARY SURFACE  A surface longitudinally centered on a runway. When
the runway has a specially prepared hard surface, the primary surface
extends 200 feet beyond each end of that runway; when the runway has
no specially prepared hard surface or planned hard surface, the primary
surface ends at each end of that runway. The width of the primary surface
is 500 feet. The elevation of any point on the primary surface is the same as
the elevation of the nearest point on the runway center line.
RUNWAY  A defined area in an airport prepared for landing and takeoff of
aircraft along its length.
STRUCTURE  As defined in § 84-8, but also to include any object,
including a mobile or immobile object, constructed or installed by man,
including but without limitation buildings, towers, cranes, smokestacks,
earth formation and overhead transmission lines.
TRANSITIONAL SURFACES  These surfaces extend outward at ninetydegree
angles to the runway center line and the runway center line
extended at a slope of seven feet horizontally for each foot vertically from
the sides of the primary and approach surfaces to where they intersect the
horizontal and conical surfaces.
TREE  Any object of natural growth.
§ 84-110. Airport zones.
In order to carry out the provisions of this article, there are hereby created
and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath
the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces and conical
surfaces as they apply to the airport. Such zones shall be depicted on an
Airport Zoning Map to consist of one sheet and to be adopted as part of
and on the effective date of this article. Such map shall be attached to the
Township Zoning Map and become a part thereof. In addition, those areas
§ 84-109 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-110
72:892
designated as airport zones may also, in addition or substitution, be shown
on the Township Zoning Map. An area located in more than one of the
following zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive
height limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as
follows:
§ 84-111. Height limitations.
A. Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner edge of
this Approach Zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and
is 500 feet wide. The Approach Zone expands outward uniformly to a
width of 2,000 feet at a horizontal distance 5,000 feet from the primary
surface. Its center line is the continuation of the center line of the
runway.
B. Transitional Zones. The Transitional Zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
C. Horizontal Zone. The Horizontal Zone is established by swinging arcs of
five-thousand-foot radii from the center of each end of the primary
surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing
lines tangent to those arcs. The Horizontal Zone does not include the
Approach and Transitional Zones.
D. Conical Zone. The Conical Zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the Horizontal Zone and extends
outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, no structure shall be
erected, altered or maintained and no tree shall be allowed to grow in
any zone created by this article to a height in excess of the applicable
height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height
limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as
follows:
(1) Nonprecision Instrument Runway Approach Zone: slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 5,000 feet along the extended runway center
line.
(2) Transitional Zones: slopes seven feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and the approach surface and extending to a height of 150
feet above the airport elevation, except that a building may be
constructed within the Transitional Zone to a maximum height of
up to 50 feet (subject to the height limitations imposed by other
provisions of this chapter with respect to the permitted height of
buildings in any zoning district, which provisions shall apply) as
provided in Subsection E of this section. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven feet
§ 84-110 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-111
72:893
§ 84-112. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this chapter, no use may
be made of land or water within any zone established by this article in
such manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for
pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the
eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere
with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the
airport.
§ 84-113. Nonconforming uses.
outward for each foot upward beginning at the side of and at the
same elevation as the approach surface and extending to where
they intersect the conical surface, which is 465 feet above mean
sea level.
(3) Horizontal Zone: established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
or at a height of 615 feet above the mean sea level.
(4) Conical Zone: slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the periphery of the Horizontal Zone and at 150 feet
above the airport elevation and extending to a height of 350 feet
above the airport elevation.
B. Excepted height limitations. Nothing in this article shall be construed
as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or
growth of any tree to a height up to 50 feet above the surface of the
land, except within the primary surface area, where no permanent
structure or tree shall be permitted above the elevation of the primary
surface, subject to the other applicable height regulations of this
chapter for the applicable zoning district.
A. Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this article
shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change
or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this article or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall
require any change in the construction, alteration or intended use of
any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior
to the effective date of this article and is diligently prosecuted.
B. Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this
section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is
hereby required to permit the installation, operation and maintenance
thereon of such marker and lights as shall be deemed necessary the
Zoning Officer to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of
the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and
§ 84-111 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-113
72:894
§ 84-114. Permits.
lights shall be installed, operated and maintained at the expense of
West Goshen Township.
A. Future uses.
(1) Except as specifically provided in Subsection A(1)(a), (b) and (c)
hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no
structure shall be erected, altered, extended or otherwise
established and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created
unless a permit there for shall have been applied for and granted.
Each application for a permit shall indicate is desired with
sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the
resulting use, structure or tree would conform to the regulations
herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the
permit shall be granted, subject to the other requirements and
conditions of this chapter. No permit for a use inconsistent with the
provisions of this article shall be granted unless a variance has
been approved in accordance with Subsection D of this section.
(a) In the area lying within the limits of the Horizontal Zone and
Conical Zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
(b) In areas lying within the limits of the Approach Zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of
the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground,
except when such tree or structure would extend above the
height limit prescribed for such Approach Zones.
(c) In the areas lying within the limits of the Transitional Zones
beyond the perimeter of the Horizontal Zone, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than 75 feet of
vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or
structure, because of terrain, land contour or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for
such Transitional Zones.
(2) Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be
construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction or
alteration of any structure or growth of any tree in excess of any of
the height limits established by this article except as set forth in
§ 84-111B.
B. Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming
§ 84-113 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-114
72:895
§ 84-115. Conflicting regulations.
Where there exists a conflict between any of the regulations or limitations
prescribed in this article and any other regulations applicable to the same
area, whether the conflict be with respect to the height of structures or
trees or the use of land or any other matter, the more stringent limitation or
requirement shall govern and prevail.
§ 84-116. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this
article should be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction for
any reason whatsoever, such declaration shall not affect the remaining
portions of this article which shall remain in full force and effect. To that
end, the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable.
use, structure or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than
it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or
than it is when the application for a permit is made.
C. Nonconforming uses. The extension, restoration, cessation or
abandonment of nonconforming trees or structures shall be governed
by the nonconforming use regulations set forth in Article XV of this
chapter; provided, however, that no permit shall be granted that would
permit such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations provided for in this
article.
D. Variances. Any person who desires to erect or increase the height of any
structure or permit the growth of any tree or use property in a manner
which is not in strict accordance with the regulations prescribed in this
article must apply to the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance from such
regulations. The application for a variance shall be accompanied by a
determination made by the Federal Aviation Administration of the affect
of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable air space within the area affected by this
article. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a
literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in
unnecessary hardship and that the relief granted will not jeopardize the
public health, safety and general welfare or create a hazard to air
navigation.
E. Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
article, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure, tree
or other obstruction in question to install, operate and maintain, at the
owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If
deemed proper by the Zoning Hearing Board, this condition may be
modified to require the owner to permit the Township, at its expense, to
install, operate and maintain the necessary markings and lights.

ARTICLE XXIV
RGC Residential Golf Course District
[Added 10-11-1988 by Ord. No. 9-1988]
§ 84-117. Intent; purpose.
§ 84-118. Administration; applications to be treated as conditional
use applications.
It is not the intention of the Board of Supervisors by the adoption of
this article to provide for the establishment of a Planned Residential
Development controlled by Article VII of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code.318 Rather, the Board shall hear and consider applications for
development within the RGC Residential Golf Course District as conditional
use applications, the approval of which shall be subject to such reasonable
conditions as the Board shall, in its discretion, determine necessary.
§ 84-119. Conditions for development.
The following are prerequisite conditions of a development plan within
the RGC Residential Golf Course District, and no development shall be
approved that does not strictly comply with the following requirements:
A. The intent of this district is to further the objectives of this chapter by
permitting the coordinated development of residential dwellings as an
integral part of a golf course community, which provides a high ratio of
open space to land development, while at the same time providing for a
variety of housing types, subject to the provision for public sewer and
public water.
B. This article establishes performance criteria to permit a residential golf
course development, and such development will result in a more
desirable environment, provide for the sufficient use of land, encourage
the reservation and intelligent use of open space, enhance recreation
opportunities and amenities and better the overall appearance of the
community.
C. Single-family detached residential cluster development pursuant to the
open space design option regulations of Article XXV is permitted when
property within the RGC District is not developed as part of a golf
course pursuant to Subsections A and B of this section, when
authorized as a conditional use by the Board of Supervisors. [Added
5-23-1995 by Ord. No. 4-1995]
A. Any tract of land, hereinafter known as the "development tract,"
proposed to be developed shall be in single and separate ownership or,
in the case of multiple tracts and separate ownership proposed to be
combined for such development, at the time the application is filed with
the Board, there shall be submitted therewith a written agreement in
318. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10701 et seq.
§ 84-117 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-119
72:897
§ 84-120. Use regulations.
The following principal uses shall be permitted when authorized as a
conditional use, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of this
article and the imposition of such reasonable conditions as the Board shall
determine necessary:
the form of a declaration of restrictions, covenants and easements, in
a form suitable for recordation, which imposes upon all such tracts
the condition that they be developed in accordance with a single plan,
with common authority and common responsibility, so that the tracts so
combined are developed as a single development tract in accordance
with the zoning regulations of this district and the subdivision and land
development regulations established in Chapter 72 of this Code.
B. The development tract shall be a contiguous minimum area of 115
acres, provided that, if the applicant proposes to develop a
championship golf course, as that term is defined by the Professional
Golfers Association, the minimum development tract area shall be 175
contiguous acres. If an existing golf course is proposed to be expanded
and will be utilized and integrated as a part of the expanded golf
course, that area of ground comprising the existing golf course may be
included as forming a part of the required minimum development tract
area; provided, however, within the area comprising the expanded golf
course area there shall be not less than 6.3 acres per hole for a
nonchampionship golf course and 9.7 acres per hole for a championship
golf course.
C. The tract shall be served by public sanitary sewers and by a public
water supply system.
A. A unified development of single-family detached dwellings, attached
single-family dwellings or any reasonable combination thereof, when
planned, designed and constructed in conjunction with and as part of a
golf course, with residential units located throughout the course, along
and integrated with the course's fairways.
B. Any of the following accessory uses shall be permitted:
(1) Customary residential accessory uses.
(2) Customary golf course accessory uses, including clubhouse,
maintenance buildings and structures, recreational uses, such as
tennis courts, swimming pool, multipurpose courts, sports field,
hiking, walking and bicycle paths, and other active and passive
recreational facilities.
C. A unified development of single-family detached dwellings and
customary residential accessory uses when designed and developed as
a cluster development pursuant to the open space design option
regulations of Article XXV of this chapter, when approved by the Board
of Supervisors as a conditional use pursuant to § 84-123 of this Article
§ 84-119 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-120
72:898
§ 84-121. Area and bulk regulations.
The following area and bulk regulations shall apply and shall govern the
design, approval and implementation of any development permitted within
this district:
XXIV. The R-3 Residential District shall be considered an overlay
district on the RGC District for purposes of the applicability of the
Article XXV regulations to the use and development permitted by this
Subsection C; provided, however, that only the regulations of §§ 84-124
through 84-129 of Article XXV shall apply to the use and development
permitted in the RGC District by this Subsection C. No other uses
or development otherwise permitted by the R-3 Residential District
regulations shall be permitted in the RGC District. The provisions of
§§ 84-119, 84-121 and 84-122 of this article shall not apply to a use and
development permitted by this Subsection C in the RGC District.
D. Forestry shall be permitted by right, subject to the standards in
§ 84-57.8. [Added 5-9-2001 by Ord. No. 6-2001]
A. Density. The following standards shall govern the density of dwelling
units permitted on the development tract:
(1) The maximum number of dwelling units allowable on the
development tract shall be calculated by multiplying the total
number of acres located wholly within West Goshen Township in
the development tract by 1.0.
(2) The Board, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, may, but
shall not be required to, increase the allowable density to not more
than 1.2 dwelling units per acre, calculated in accordance with
Subsection A(1), if the Board determines that:
(a) The objectives of this article can be achieved by permitting
such maximum density.
(b) The developer agrees to such development restrictions,
whether greater than and/or additional to the minimum
development standards imposed by this chapter, as the Board
shall require.
(c) The developer proves by clear and convincing evidence that a
greater density will preserve, rather than destroy, the
environmental features of the development tract.
(d) Compliance with the area and bulk regulations and the design
standards are demonstrated.
B. Maximum development tract coverage: 30%.
C. Maximum building height: three stories, not to exceed 30 feet.
§ 84-120 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 84-121
72:899
D. Minimum building setback line: 40 feet; provided, however, that where
the developer proposes that the streets throughout the development
tract not be dedicated to the Township as public streets but remain
under the ownership and control of the homeowners' association
proposed to be established for the development, the required right-ofway
width may be reduced to 40 feet and the required cartway width
may be reduced to 22 feet. No parking shall be permitted in the
cartway. In that latter instance, the minimum building setback may be
reduced to 15 feet from the cartway surface, except where a frontloading
garage fronts on the street, in which case the minimum setback
shall be 25 feet from the edge of the cartway.
E. Minimum development tract perimeter setback. All buildings and
structures shall be setback a minimum of 40 feet from the development
tract perimeter. The required setback shall be doubled along that part
of the development tract perimeter which abuts existing residential
uses, except when a single continuous common tract/residential
boundary does not exceed by five times the length of all building faces
proposed to be constructed along any such portion of the tract
perimeter. Thus, if the common tract/residential boundary length is 300
feet and the building faces proposed to be constructed along that
portion of the perimeter exceed a total of 60 feet, the required
minimum setback shall be 80 feet. For purposes of this provision, a
"building face" is defined as the front, side or rear of any building or
structure.
F. Maximum number of attached units: three.
G. Minimum building separation. No building or structure, except
landscape walls, shall be erected within 25 feet of any other building or
structure, provided that a building separation of not less than 10 feet
between buildings or structures shall be permitted if no more than 30%
of the buildings housing residential units are separated by not less than
a twenty-five-foot building separation on each side.
H. Required open space. At least 50% of the development tract shall be
designated as a golf course and shall be deed-restricted to that use. On
each development plan, the open space shall be identified and
designated as common open space, which shall include that portion of
the open space not dedicated and part of the golf course, and the golf
course area itself, which shall include all tees, greens, fairways,
pathways and other necessary and integral parts of the golf course. If
an existing golf course is to be expanded and no uses permitted by
§ 84-120A and B(1) are proposed to be constructed upon the ground
occupied by the existing golf course, only the expanded golf course area
shall be required to be deed-restricted. With respect to all such open
space, the following regulations shall apply:
(1) No such open space shall be accepted for dedication to the
Township, unless specifically so required by the Board.
§ 84-121 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § 84-121
72:900
§ 84-122. Design standards.
The following design standards shall apply:
(2) The developer shall provide for and establish an organization for
the ownership and maintenance of both the non-golf course and
golf course open space, and such organization shall not be
dissolved nor shall it dispose of the common open space, by sale or
otherwise, except to an organization conceived and established to
own and maintain the common open space; provided, however, that
the golf course open space may be owned by a public or private
organization or entity separate and apart from the homeowners'
association for the residential development. In the case of the
expansion of an existing golf course, this requirement shall apply
only to that portion of the development tract constituting the
expanded golf course area and not to the ground occupied by the
existing golf course.
(3) Both the homeowners' association documents and the declaration
of restrictions, covenants and easements or other recordable
document by which the golf course is restricted to use as a golf
course and from further subdivision or land development shall give
the Township the powers provided for in Section 705(b)(2) and (3)
of the Municipalities Planning Code.319
(4) The developer shall be required to set aside and dedicate for park,
open space and recreation use generally accessible land based on a
formula of one acre for each 20 dwelling units or part thereof. This
land need not be located on the site but must be acceptable to the
Supervisors. In lieu of the requirements of this subsection, the

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ A87-1. Title.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "West Goshen
Township Cable Communications Regulatory Ordinance."
§ A87-2. Purpose.
The Township of West Goshen finds that the development of cable television
and communication systems has substantial benefits and impacts upon
West Goshen Township and its residents. Rapidly changing and complex
technologies associated with cable television require that public
convenience and the general welfare be protected, which can best be served
by vesting the township and its designees with regulatory powers. It is
the intent of this ordinance to provide for and specify the means by which
the public interest and welfare will be protected, furthered and preserved.
As a consequence, any franchise issued pursuant to this ordinance shall
be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof. Further, it
is recognized that cable television systems have the capacity to provide
not only entertainment and information services to the township and its
residents, but also to provide a variety of cable television and interactive
communication services to institutions and individuals by providing
governmental, educational and health-care communications. For these
purposes, the regulations contained herein are established upon the belief
and with the goals that:
A. Cable communication services should be provided to the maximum
number of township residents.
B. The cable system should be capable of accommodating the
communications needs of the township, both for the present and in the
reasonably foreseeable future.
C. The cable system shall be constructed and maintained during any
franchise term so that new components may be integrated into the
cable system to the maximum extent possible with existing facilities.
D. The cable system authorized by this ordinance shall be responsive to
the needs and interests of the local community.
E. The cable system operator shall be dedicated to the inherent philosophy
of providing quality public, educational and governmental access to the
township's residents.

the submission of the application.

inappropriate to deny it a franchise under Subsection
C(3)(a)[2] or [5] by virtue of particular circumstances
surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to
cure all harms flowing therefrom, the lack of involvement of
the applicant's principals or the remoteness of the matter from
the operation of cable systems.

including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of
planned capital additions, with all significant assumptions
explained in notes or supporting schedules.

for the township.

franchise in West Goshen Township, including signal quality,
response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like,
has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the
communities served.
§ A87-5 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § A87-5
72:928
(3) Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal
qualifications to provide cable service.

cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into
account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
(5) Whether, to the extent not considered as part of § A87-5D(4) of this
article, the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial
support.
(6) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-ofway
and private property which would be used by the cable system,
including the extent to which installation or maintenance as
planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services, the public rights-of-way; the
effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the cable system to
meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and
the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing proposals.
(7) Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the township, or whether grant
of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the
delivery of cable service or telecommunications service in the
township.
E. If the township finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise
considering the factors set forth above, it shall issue a franchise,
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise
agreement. If the township denies a franchise, it shall issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding
whether to issue or not to issue a franchise, the township may hold one
or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which
comments from the public on an applicant's proposal may be received.
The township also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on
its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject
any application which is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This
ordinance is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any
applicant or existing franchisee standing to challenge the issuance of a
franchise to another.
F. If the township grants a franchise subject to the applicant's entry into a
franchise agreement, the township and the franchisee shall agree on
the terms of a franchise agreement within 30 calendar days from the
date of the township resolution granting the franchise. This period may
be extended for good cause by the township. If agreement is not
reached with the township within 30 calendar days from the date of the
township resolution granting the franchise, or if the period is not
extended by the township, the franchise will be null and void without

identifying future cable-related community needs and interests,
including the costs of meeting such needs and interests, and reviewing
compliance by the franchisee with the then current franchise. Such
proceeding shall be completed within 12 months from the date begun.
The township shall submit a copy of its findings, if any, in writing to the
franchisee within said twelve-month period.
B. Upon the expiration of the twelve-month period set forth in Subsection
A above, the franchisee may submit to the township a proposal for
renewal.
C. Upon receipt of the renewal application, the township shall publish a
notice of its receipt once in a newspaper of general circulation within
the township and make copies available for review by the public.
D. Within four months of the date it receives the proposal for renewal, and
based on the standards set forth in § A87-5D of this article, the
township will either:
(1) Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise, subject to the
negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the township
and the franchisee; or
(2) Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment that the
franchise should not be renewed;
(3) Provided that, if the township and a franchisee cannot reach a
franchise agreement within four months after the proposal is
received, such passage of time shall constitute and be deemed a
preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed.

Upon acceptance of the franchise, a franchisee shall be bound by all of
the terms and conditions of this ordinance and all future revisions of this

B. The franchisee shall construct and maintain the cable system so as not
to interfere with other uses of the streets. The franchisee shall

construction work prior to commencement of that work.
C. Notwithstanding the above grant to use of streets, no streets shall be
used by any franchisee if the township determines that such use is
inconsistent with the terms, conditions or provisions by which such
street was created or dedicated or is presently used.
§ A87-8 WEST GOSHEN TOWNSHIP CODE § A87-12
72:932
§ A87-13. Franchise term.
A franchise shall commence upon written acceptance by the franchisee as
required by this ordinance and shall remain in full force and effect for a
period agreed to by the township and franchisee in a franchise agreement;
provided, however, that such term shall not be less than five years.
§ A87-14. Area covered.
A franchise granted under this ordinance shall include such portions within
the territorial borders of the township as the Board shall approve. In the
event of annexation by the township, the franchisee shall use every
reasonable effort in its best business judgment to provide service to the
new territory unless such territory is already being serviced by another
franchise.
A. A franchise granted pursuant to this ordinance shall be nonexclusive.
By entering into a franchise agreement with the township under this
ordinance, the franchisee automatically acknowledges the Board's right
to grant additional franchises upon such terms and conditions as the
Board deems appropriate; provided, however, that if the township
grants an additional franchise for construction and operation of a cable
system or open video system (OVS) to another franchisee, the township
may not impose material obligations, as that term is defined herein,
which are more favorable or less burdensome than those in any existing
franchise agreement, or impair any existing franchisee's ability to

purposes of this section, material obligations are limited to the
following:
(1) A franchisee's obligation to pay Annual Franchise Fees as set forth
in Article IX, § A87-48 herein;

impose increased obligations upon the franchisee, must take into
account any additional franchise(s) previously granted and find that the
proposed increased obligations in the renewal, if they are more
burdensome and less favorable than those contained in the additional
franchise(s), are reasonable under Section 626 of the Cable Act, taking
into account the costs and burdens of meeting such noncomparable
obligations.

ARTICLE IX
General Financial and Insurance Provisions and Security Fund
§ A87-47. Finding.
The township finds that the streets and public rights-of-way of the county,
state and township to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a
cable system within the boundaries of the franchise area granted by the
township's issuance of a franchise are valuable public property acquired
and maintained by the county, state and township at great expense to the
taxpayers. The township further finds that the grant of a franchise to use
such streets and public rights-of-way is a valuable property right without
which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital.
§ A87-48. Payment to township.
The administration of this ordinance and the franchise imposes upon the
township substantial and additional regulatory responsibilities and expense.
Accordingly, each franchisee receiving the approval of the Board for the
grant of a franchise shall pay to the township a franchise fee in the amount
designated by the Board when the franchise is granted, which amount shall
in no event be less than 5% of its gross annual revenues, or the maximum
amount permitted under applicable federal law, state or local law. If such
maximum is greater than 5%, the franchisee shall pay the increased fee
allowed by law to the township within 60 days after the effective date of
a resolution or ordinance by the township authorizing the imposition of
the increased franchise fee. Immediately after its enactment, the township
shall provide the franchisee with a copy of the resolution or ordinance
authorizing the imposition of the increased franchise fee.
A. The franchise fee is in addition to taxes and payments that the
franchisee may be required to pay under any federal, state or local law
and to any tax, fee or assessment imposed by utilities and cable
operators for the use of their services, facilities and equipment.
B. Payment of the franchise fee made by franchisee to the township is not
and shall not be considered in the nature of a tax.
C. Acceptance by the township. No acceptance of any payment by the
township shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction
of any claim the township may have for further or additional sums
payable as a franchise fee under this ordinance or for the performance
of any other obligation of the franchisee.
D. Failure to make required payment. In the event any franchise payment
or recomputation amount is not made on or before the date specified
herein, franchisee shall pay additional compensation and interest
charges computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the
commercial prime interest rate of the township's primary depository
bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed.
§ A87-47 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § A87-48
72:951
§ A87-49. Damages and defects.
E. Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other costs
assessed by the township against the franchisee shall be paid quarterly
to the township and shall commence as of the effective date of the
franchise, unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. The
township shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a
statement verified by a financial representative of the franchisee
reflecting the total amount of gross revenues for the payment period.
Said quarterly payments shall be made to the township no later than 45
days following the end of each calendar quarter, except for the payment
for the last quarter, which shall be paid within 60 days following the end
of the calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last days
of the months of March, June, September and December.
F. The township right of inspection. The township shall have the right to
inspect and copy, exclusive of proprietary information, the franchisee's
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts
determined to be payable pursuant to this ordinance for a period of four
years from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of the
township unless the audit discloses an underpayment in excess of 5%,
in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the franchisee as a
cost incidental to the enforcement of the franchise agreement. Any
additional amounts due to the township as a result of the audit shall be
paid within 30 days following written notice to the franchisee by the
township of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the
audit report, unless written notice of disagreement is filed by the
franchisee with the township within such time period. In the case of a
dispute, the issue shall be resolved through binding arbitration in
accordance with the procedures of the American Arbitration
Association.
G. Franchisee financial records. Upon request by the township, the
franchisee shall provide the township with a copy of its SEC Form 10-K
Annual Report within 30 days after it is submitted to the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC).
A. Township not liable. The township and the Board shall not be liable for
any injury, damage, costs, either direct or consequential, to any person

defamation of any person, firm or corporation or the violation or

written notice of any claim, suit or demand requiring the franchisee's
indemnification of the township under the foregoing paragraphs. The

equity, the Board reserves the right to revoke, terminate or cancel this
franchise, and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event
that:
(1) Franchisee breaches any material term or condition of the
franchise agreement or this ordinance and, after written notice and
an opportunity to cure, has failed to cure said breach within 90

§ A87-52. Revocation procedures.
In the event that the township determines that the franchisee has violated

state or local law, the township may make written demand on the franchisee
that it remedy such violation and that continued violation may cause
revocation.
§ A87-53. Security fund.
Franchisee shall post a bond issued by a bonding company that is
authorized to conduct business within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

B. Provided, however, that if the township seeks to revoke the franchise
under Subsection A(2) and (3) above, it shall do so in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Article X herein.
A. A public hearing shall be held by the Board upon 14 days' prior written
notice to the franchisee. The notice to the franchisee shall specify with
particularity the time and place of the hearing and shall afford the
franchisee a full and complete opportunity to be heard in person and by
counsel. The grounds upon which the pending revocation is based shall
be alleged with particularity in the written notice to the franchisee.
B. If notice is given and, at franchisee's option, a full public proceeding is
held, the township determines that a violation, breach, failure, refusal
or neglect by franchisee exists, the township shall direct franchisee to
correct or remedy the same within such reasonable additional time, in
such a manner and upon such terms and conditions as the township
may direct.
C. If, after notice is given, and, at township's option, a full public
proceeding is held, the township determines there was a violation,
breach, failure, refusal or neglect, then the township may declare, by
resolution, the franchise revoked and canceled and of no further force
or effect. The township shall have the right in its discretion to take
ownership of the cable system and all associated equipment and
facilities under ownership of the franchisee pursuant to the township's
power of eminent domain.
D. The issue of revocation shall automatically be placed upon the
Township Board agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for
compliance. The township then may terminate the franchise forthwith
upon finding the franchisee has failed to achieve the plans or may
further extend the period, at its discretion.
E. If the township, after notice is given and, at franchisee's option, a full
public hearing is held and appeal is exhausted, declares the franchise
breached, the parties may pursue their remedies pursuant to the

to any applicable provisions of state law, including the Bankruptcy Act, 120
days after the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the conduct

ARTICLE XI
Removal, Transfer and Purchase
§ A87-57. Removal after relocation or expiration.
At the expiration of the present and all subsequent renewal terms for which
a franchise is granted, or upon its revocation, as provided for herein, the
franchisee shall have the right to remove, at its expense, all or any portion
of the cable system from all streets and public rights-of-way within its
franchise area. In doing so, the franchisee shall return all disturbed areas to
their condition existing prior to franchisee's installation of its cable system,
including but not limited to necessary refilling and compacting all disturbed
areas. All such work shall be done at the franchisee's sole cost and expense
and shall be subject to inspection and approval by the township, whose
inspection fees shall be paid by the franchisee.
§ A87-58. Sale and transfer of franchise.
A. Transfer. A franchise granted under this ordinance shall not be sold,
assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased or sublet in
any manner, nor shall title hereto, either legal or equitable, or any right,
interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without full
compliance with the procedures set forth in this section and the
expressed approval of the Board.
(1) Parties to the sale or transfer shall make written request to the
township for the approval of a sale or transfer. An application for a
transfer shall provide complete information on the proposed
transaction, including details of the legal, financial, technical and
other qualifications of the transferee.
(2) The township shall reply in writing within 60 days of the application
and shall indicate approval of the application or its determination
that a public hearing is necessary due to potential adverse effect on
the franchisee's subscribers.
(3) If a public hearing is deemed necessary, it shall commence within
60 days of such determination pursuant to public notice setting
forth the purpose of the hearing. Written notice shall be given to
the applicant and to any person who has registered his name and
address with the township requesting to be given notice of any such
proceedings.
(4) Within 45 days after the close of the record following the
conclusion of the public hearing(s), the township shall issue its
determination.
B. Determination by township. In making a determination as to whether to
grant, deny or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer
of a franchise, the township shall consider the legal, financial and
technical qualifications of the transferee to operate the cable system;
§ A87-57 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § A87-58
72:959
whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its
franchise agreement and this ordinance and, if not, the proposed
transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the
transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the township,
or whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the township; and
whether operation by the transferee or approval of the transfer would
adversely affect subscribers, the township's interest under this
ordinance, the franchise agreement, or other applicable law, or make
it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost.
C. Transferee's agreement. No application for a transfer of a franchise
shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will
abide by and accept all terms of this ordinance and the franchise
agreement, and that it will assume the obligations and liabilities known
and unknown of the previous franchisee under this ordinance and the
franchise agreement.
D. Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the township of a
transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of
the rights of the township under this ordinance or the franchise
agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.
E. Processing fee. As a condition of considering a transfer, the township
may impose a fee upon the transferee to cover its estimated out-ofpocket
expenses in considering the application for transfer of a
franchise, provided that such fee does not exceed $1,000. Any amount
collected in excess of the estimated amount shall be returned to the
transferee.
F. Filing of transfer document. Within 30 days of any transfer, franchisee
shall file with the township a copy of the deed, agreement, mortgage,
lease or other written instruments evidencing such sale, transfer of
ownership or control, or lease, certifying and sworn to be correct by the
franchisee.
