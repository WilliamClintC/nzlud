Board, the Township shall, upon its initiative or upon request of a fire

for further action related to the emergency. In certain instances, when
responding to emergency calls initiated by a remote dialing automatic
detection or suppression system, entrance may be gained without forceful
entry in to the structure. To improve emergency response time and
minimize the need for forcible entry of a structure, the purpose of this
chapter is to require certain nonresidential structures to have secured
key lock box systems installed at the entrance of the structure to enable
members of the West Hanover Volunteer Fire Company to securely enter the
structure during an emergency occurrence detected by a remote response
dial-up automatic fire detection or suppression system and/or a 911 call.

§ 158-4. Sewage permit requirements.
A. No person shall install, construct or request bid proposals for
construction or alter an individual sewage system or community
sewage system or construct or request bid proposals for construction or
install or occupy any building or structure for which an individual
sewage system or community sewage system is to be installed without
first obtaining a permit indicating that the site and the plans and
specifications of such system are in compliance with the provisions of
the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act (hereinafter called "Act 537" or
"Act") and the standards adopted pursuant to that Act.49
B. No system or structure designed to provide individual or community
sewage disposal shall be covered from view until approval to cover the
same has been given by the Municipal SEO. If 72 hours have elapsed,
excepting Sundays and holidays, since the SEO issuing the permit
received notification of completion of construction, the applicant may
cover said system or structure, unless permission has been specifically
refused by the SEO.
C. The township may require applicants for sewage permits to notify the
township's certified SEO of the schedule for construction of the
permitted on-lot sewage disposal system so that inspection(s) in
addition to the final inspection required by Act 537 may be scheduled
and performed by the township's certified SEO at the cost of the
applicant.
D. No building or occupancy permit shall be issued by the township or its
CEO for a new building which will contain sewage-generating facilities
until a valid sewage permit has been obtained from the township's
certified SEO.
E. No building or occupancy permit shall be issued and no work shall
begin on any alteration or conversion of any existing structure, if said
alteration or conversion will result in the increase or potential increase
in sewage flows from the structure, until the township's CEO and the
structure's owner receive from the township's SEO either a permit for
alteration or a replacement of the existing sewage disposal system or
written notification that such a permit will not be required. In
accordance with Chapter 73 regulations, the certified SEO shall
determine whether the proposed alteration or conversion of the
structure will result in increased sewage flows.
F. Sewage permits may be issued only by a certified SEO employed by the
township for that express purpose. The DEP shall be notified by the
township as to the identity of its currently employed certified SEO
G. No sewage permit may be issued unless proof is provided that the
owner of record has owned the lot since May 15, 1972, or that Act 537
planning for that lot has been provided by the township.

hatch shall be constructed so as to enable easy access to the waste disposal
tank, and prevent odors from escaping and to prevent children from
removing the hatch.
§ 158-6. Replacement areas.
H. No final Act 241 approval on a subdivision plan may begin until Act 537
planning is approved by the township.
A. Requirements.
(1) After the effective date of this article, a replacement area for an
individual on-lot sewage system shall be required for all lots or lots
to be created which are not serviced or to be serviced by a
community sewage system, or for which a valid permit for
installation of an individual on-lot sewage system has not been
issued. All proposed and existing lots (created prior to the effective
date of this article) requiring a sewage permit to be issued shall be
required to show that the lot can provide areas for both a primary
and secondary system. [Amended 4-3-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-01]
(2) The replacement area provided shall comply with the Act and with
all regulations issued by the DEP as incorporated into this article
concerning individual on-lot sewage systems, including isolation
distances, and with the terms of this article and any other
applicable township ordinances.
B. Identification of replacement area.
(1) Each applicant who shall submit a plan for the subdivision or
development of land or who shall apply for a permit for the
installation of an individual on-lot sewage system, or who shall
request approval of a planning module for land development or the
adoption of a revision, exception to revision or supplement to the
official plan shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the SEO that a
suitable area exists on the lot or on each lot to be created for an
initial individual on-lot sewage system and for the replacement
area. The SEO shall perform or observe all tests required for the
location of an individual on-lot sewage system to confirm the
suitability of the replacement area. Allowance of open land for the
replacement area without testing performed or observed by the
SEO shall not constitute compliance with the requirements of this
section.
§ 158-4 WEST HANOVER CODE § 158-6
144:138
(2) The location of the initial individual on-lot sewage system and the
replacement area as confirmed by the SEO shall be identified on
the plot plans and diagrams submitted as part of the permit
application.
(3) If the application has been submitted as a part of an application for
subdivision or land development approval or as part of a request
that the township approve a planning module for land development
or amend its official plan, or a request for an exception to the
revision of the official plan, the location of each initial individual onlot
sewage system and each replacement area shall be noted upon
the plans. If the application is for subdivision or land development
approval, a note constituting a permanent easement shall be added
to the plans stating that no improvements shall be constructed
upon the replacement area, and the deed to be recorded for each
lot created as part of the subdivision or land development shall
contain language reflecting this limitation.
(4) Any revisions to a permit or plan affecting a replacement area
which previously has been approved pursuant to the provisions of
this article shall be reviewed for approval by the Board or its
authorized agent.
C. Construction restrictions.
(1) The easement for the replacement area noted upon the plan and
recorded with the Dauphin County Recorder of Deeds shall state
that no permanent or temporary improvements of any character,
other than shallow-rooted plant matter, shall be constructed upon
the replacement area.
(2) This provision shall be enforced by the township unless the person
who desires to construct such improvements shall demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the SEO that an alternate replacement area
which complies with all applicable regulations of the DEP, this
article and all other applicable township ordinances, exists upon
the lot. If such an alternate replacement area shall be identified,
the alternate replacement area may be considered to be the
replacement area required by this article and shall be designated
as the replacement area. The newly designated replacement area
shall thereafter be considered the replacement area for the
purposes of this article.
D. Relief from replacement area requirement.
(1) If any lot held in single and separate ownership as of the effective
date of this article does not contain land suitable for a replacement
area, the applicant submitting a land development plan or a
planning module for land development or desiring to install an
individual on-lot sewage system may request that the Board grant
an exception to the requirement of providing a replacement area.
The applicant for such an exception shall present credible evidence
§ 158-6 PLUMBING § 158-6
144:139
§ 158-7. Inspections.
to the Board demonstrating that the lot was held in single and
separate ownership on the effective date of this article; the size of
the lot; inability of the applicant to acquire adjacent land or the
unsuitability of adjacent land which might be able to be acquired;
and the testing conducted to determine that the lot is not suitable
to provide a replacement area.
(2) At all times the burden to present credible evidence and the burden
of persuasion shall be upon the applicant for an exception from the
terms of this article. In no case shall any lot be exempted from the
requirements of § 158-4 of this article.
A. Any on-lot sewage disposal system may be inspected by the township's
authorized agent at any reasonable time as of the effective date of this
article.
B. The inspection may include a physical tour of the property, the taking of
samples from surface water, wells, other ground water sources, the
sampling of the contents of the sewage disposal system itself and/or the
introduction of a traceable substance into the interior plumbing of the
structure served to ascertain the path and ultimate destination of
wastewater generated in the structure. A copy of the inspection report
shall be furnished to the owner and current resident which shall include
all of the following information which is reasonably available to the
individual or agency responsible for pumping the septic tank: date of
inspection; name and address of system owner; description and
diagram of the location of the system, including location of access
hatches, risers and markers; size of tanks and disposal fields; current
occupant's name and number of users; indication of any system
malfunction observed; results of any and all soils and water tests; and
any remedial action required.
C. The township's authorized agent shall have the right to enter upon land
for the purposes of inspections described above. In the event that
access to inspect the property is denied, the following steps shall be
taken:
(1) The matter will be officially referred to the Board for action.
(2) The Board may schedule a review at the next scheduled meeting of
the Board, or, if the situation threatens the health or safety of the
residents of the township, the Board may commence an immediate
procedure to obtain a search warrant from the District justice.
(3) Upon receipt of a search warrant to inspect the property, the
authorized agent of the township shall be accompanied by an
officer of the County or State Police, and the inspection shall be
completed in accordance with this section.

D. A schedule of routine inspections may be established by the township, if
necessary, to assure the proper function of the systems in the township.
E. The township's authorized agent shall inspect systems known to be, or
alleged to be, malfunctioning. Should said inspections reveal that the
system is malfunctioning, the township shall take action to require the
correction of the malfunction. If total correction is not technically or
financially feasible in the opinion of the township and a representative
of the DEP, action by the owner to mitigate the malfunction shall be
required.
F. There may arise geographic areas within the township where numerous
on-lot sewage disposal systems are malfunctioning. A resolution of
these area-wide problems may necessitate detailed planning and a
township-sponsored revision to that area's Act 537 Official Sewage
Facilities Plan. When a DEP authorized Official Sewage Facilities Plan
Revision has been undertaken by the township, mandatory repair or
replacement of individual malfunctioning sewage disposal systems
within the study area may be delayed, at the discretion of the township,
pending the outcome of the plan revision process. However, the
township may compel immediate corrective action whenever a
malfunction, as determined by township officials and the Pennsylvania

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 168-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "West Hanover
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 168-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Township finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases nonpoint
source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns; accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation);
destroying aquatic habitat; and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater issues.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 168-1 PLUMBING § 168-2
144:173
§ 168-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
West Hanover Township, by minimizing the harms and maximizing the
benefits described in § 168-2 of this chapter through provisions intended to:
§ 168-4. Statutory authority.
G. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
B. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems
close to their source, by regulating activities that cause these problems.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems to the maximum extent
practicable.
D. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise protect water
resources.
E. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
F. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams and prevent
scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, with a minimum
of structures and a maximum use of natural processes.
H. Provide procedures, performance standards, and design criteria for
stormwater planning and management.
I. Provide proper operations and maintenance of all temporary and
permanent stormwater management facilities and best management
practices (BMPs) that are constructed and implemented.
J. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program
within MS4 permitted urbanized areas to address non-stormwater
discharges into the Township's separate storm sewer system.
A. Primary authority. West Hanover Township is empowered to regulate
these activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864
(Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Storm Water
Management Act.
B. Secondary authority. West Hanover Township also is empowered to
regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act
§ 168-2 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-4
144:174
§ 168-5. Applicability.
§ 168-6. Repealer.
Any ordinance, ordinance provision(s), or regulation of West Hanover
Township inconsistent with any of the provision(s) of this chapter is hereby
repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 168-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section(s) or
provision(s) of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity
of any of the remaining section(s) or provision(s) of this chapter.
§ 168-8. Compatibility with other ordinance requirements.
of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended.52
A. This chapter shall apply to all areas of the Township, any regulated
activity within the Township, and all stormwater runoff entering into
the Township's separate storm sewer system from lands within the
boundaries of the Township.
B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
C. See § 168-13 of this chapter for exemption/modification criteria.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken pursuant to this chapter do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to comply with or to secure
required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other
applicable codes, laws, rules, statutes, or ordinances. To the extent that
this chapter imposes more rigorous or stringent requirements for
stormwater management, the specific requirements contained in this
chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
Township's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do not
conflict with the provisions of this chapter, such as local stormwater
management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection
system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting
provisions in other Township ordinances or regulations shall be
construed to retain the requirements of this chapter addressing state
water quality requirements.

§ 168-4 PLUMBING § 168-8
144:175
§ 168-9. Duty of persons engaged in development of land.
Notwithstanding any provision(s) of this chapter, including exemptions, any
landowner or any person engaged in the alteration or development of land
which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics shall implement such
measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety,
or other property. Such measures also shall include actions as are required
to manage the rate, volume, direction, and quality of resulting stormwater
runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately protects health, property,
and water quality.
§ 168-10. Other approvals.
Compliance with this chapter does not preclude the need to obtain other
permits and approvals as required by West Hanover Township, Dauphin
County, the Dauphin County Conservation District, the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the federal government and other agencies. Other permits
and approvals may include zoning and building permits from the Township,
an erosion and sedimentation pollution control plan, National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System permit (NPDES), water obstruction and
encroachment permit, dam safety permit, submerged lands license
agreement, Sections 401 and 404 of the Clean Water Act and others. The
most stringent of all pertinent requirements shall apply.
C. The degree of stormwater management sought by the provisions of this
chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of West Hanover Susquehanna
Township, any appointed or elected official of West Hanover Township,
the Dauphin County Conservation District or any officer, engineer or
employee thereof for any erosion, sedimentation or flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

activities are complete, these characteristics can be impacted by
addition of pollutants, such as sediment, and changes in habitat
through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes
in land surface area from those activities. Therefore, permanent
discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect the
stream bank, streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway,
to prevent these impacts.

A roof with no roof drain is sheet flow. Where the municipality
believes that conditions present in the receiving area (slope, soil
type, existing problems, etc.) warrant additional separation
distance, the municipality may require additional separation
distance or require stormwater management controls.
(a) Minimum separation.
[1] New impervious cover must be separated from the
features listed in § 168-13D(2)(a)[2] below and in
accordance with minimum separation distances listed in
the table above.
[2] Minimum separation distance is the shortest distance from
the edge of the proposed new impervious cover, or roof
drain discharge point, in the flow direction of runoff, to any
of the following:

[b] Swales or ditches.
[c] Wetlands.
[d] Lakes, ponds and other surface water bodies.
[e] Storm sewer or combined sewer systems.
[f] Public roads.
[g] Property lines.

other agricultural land unless the area meets the
requirements of § 168-13D(2)(d)[2]
[i] Other features deemed relevant by the municipality.
(b) Multiple impervious areas.
[1] If the proposed new impervious area receives runoff from
an existing contiguous impervious area or contributes
runoff to an existing contiguous impervious area, the total
impervious area to be considered for this exemption shall
be the new impervious area only.
[2] If the existing and proposed new impervious area are not
contiguous, the total impervious area to be considered for
§ 168-13 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-13

this exemption shall be the new impervious area only.
In this case, the total separation area may include the
distance between the two impervious areas.
[3] Separation from the features listed in § 168-13D(2)(a)[2]
shall be determined from the edge or roof drain(s)
discharge, of either the existing or the proposed new
impervious area, whichever is most downslope.
[4] The municipality reserves the right to consider existing
conditions and runoff issues in determining the needed
separation area under this section.
(c) Discharge.
[1] With the exception of roof drains, runoff from the proposed
new impervious cover may not be concentrated. Roof
drains:
[a] Must discharge to a stabilized separation area
meeting the criteria in the above table for minimum
separation distance shown above and § 168-13D(2)(d).
[b] May not discharge to concentrated flow areas.
[c] Separation shall be determined from the roof drain
discharge point, unless the discharge is to an
impervious area. In this case the separation shall be
determined from the edge of the pervious area.
(d) Separation area.
[1] The area separating the proposed new impervious
discharge from any features such as those listed in
§ 168-13D(2)(a)[2] must at all times meet the following
criteria:
[a] Be maintained in stable vegetative cover.
[b] Eroded areas in the separation area must be
immediately repaired.
[c] No new impervious cover may be installed in the
separation areas unless the requirements of this
subsection are met.
[d] Runoff in the separation area must be maintained as
unconcentrated flow.
[2] The separation area may contain cropland, pasture land,
manure storage areas and other agricultural land,
provided that the land is in compliance with Title 25,
Section 102.4(a) (relating to erosion and sediment
pollution control on agricultural land) and Title 25, Section
§ 168-13 PLUMBING § 168-13
144:197
91.36(a) (relating to pollution control at agricultural
operations) of the Pennsylvania Code.
(3) Requirement for additional stormwater management controls. The
municipal governing body reserves the right to require additional
stormwater management controls if an exempted project is
determined to be causing adverse impacts of any kind.
(4) Obligation to meet other requirements. Nothing in this subsection
shall relieve the applicant of any responsibility under other
regulations, such as, but not limited to, municipal ordinances or
codes and state and federal regulations related to stormwater
management, NPDES permitting requirements for erosion and
sediment pollution control and post-construction stormwater
management, stream and wetland encroachment or floodplain
management.
E. The purpose of this section is to ensure consistency of stormwater
management planning with NPDES permitting (when required) and to
ensure that the applicant has a single and clear set of stormwater
management standards to which the applicant is subject. The Township
may accept alternative stormwater management controls, provided
that:
(1) The applicant, in consultation with the Township, PADEP and/or
DCCD, states that meeting the requirements of the volume controls
or Rate Controls of this chapter is not possible or creates an undue
hardship;
(2) The alternative stormwater management controls, proposed by the
applicant, are documented to be acceptable to the Township,
PADEP and/or DCCD for NPDES requirements pertaining to postconstruction
stormwater management requirements; and
(3) The alternative stormwater management controls are in
compliance with all other sections of this chapter, including but not
limited to § 168-13A, B, and C.
F. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from rate and
volume control requirements and SWM site plan preparation
requirement of this chapter, provided that the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102. It should be
noted that temporary roadways are not exempt.
G. Agricultural activities are exempt from the requirements of this
chapter, provided that the activities are performed according to the
requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
H. Linear roadway improvement projects that create additional
impervious area are not exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
However, alternative stormwater management strategies may be
applied at the joint approval of the Township and the Dauphin County
§ 168-13 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-13
144:198
§ 168-14. Volume controls.
Conservation District (if an NPDES permit is required) when site
limitations (such as limited right-of-way) and constraints (as shown
and provided by the applicant) preclude the ability of the applicant to
meet the enforcement of the stormwater management standards in this
chapter. All strategies must be consistent with PADEP's regulations,
including NPDES requirements.
I. Modification of requirements.
(1) The Township may, after an applicant has demonstrated
compliance with § 168-13A, B and C, grant a modification of the
requirements of one or more provisions of this chapter if the literal
enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that such
modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that the
purpose and intent of this chapter are observed.
(2) All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall state in
full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of this
chapter involved, and the minimum modification necessary.
A. The low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual
and in Appendix B of this chapter shall be utilized for all regulated
activities to the maximum extent practicable.57
B. Stormwater runoff volume controls shall be implemented using the
Design Storm Method or the Simplified Method. Both methods are
described below. For regulated activities equal to or less than one acre,
this chapter establishes no preference for either method; therefore, the
applicant may select either method on the basis of economic
considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.
(1) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is applicable
to any-sized regulated activity. This method requires detailed
modeling based on site conditions.
(a) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume
when compared to the pre-development total runoff volume for
the two-year/twenty-four-hour storm event.
(b) For hydrologic modeling purposes:
[1] Existing non-forested pervious areas must be considered
meadow (good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations.
57.Editor's Note: Appendix B is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 168-13 PLUMBING § 168-14
144:199
§ 168-15. Rate controls.
[2] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present
on the proposed project site, and contained within the new
proposed limit of disturbance, shall be considered meadow
(good condition) for pre-development hydrologic
calculations for redevelopment.
(2) The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) is independent of
site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is
not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities
greater than one acre. For new impervious surfaces:
(a) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches
of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(b) At least the first one-inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow,
i.e., it shall not be released into surface waters of the
commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation,
transpiration, and infiltration.
(c) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
C. All applicable worksheets from Chapter 8 of the BMP Manual must be
used when establishing volume controls.
D. Actual field infiltration tests at the location of the proposed elevation of
the stormwater BMPs are required when 5,000 square feet or greater of
new impervious surface is added. Infiltration test shall be conducted in
accordance with BMP Manual. The Township shall be notified three
working days prior to infiltration tests being conducted as to provide an
opportunity for the Township to witness the tests.
A. Lands contained within West Hanover Township that have had release
rates established under an approved Act 167 stormwater management
plan:
(1) Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates for the one-year, fifty-year, and onehundred-
year storms.
(2) For the two-year, ten-year, and twenty-five-year storms, the postdevelopment
peak discharge rates shall be in accordance with the
approved release rate map for the individual watershed.
(3) Watersheds. West Hanover Township is divided into five
watersheds, including Beaver Creek, Manada Creek, Kellock Run
and Fishing Creek and Stony Creek. The map indicating the
§ 168-14 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-15
144:200
watershed boundaries is available for inspection at the Township
office.
(4) Stormwater management districts.
(a) Specified release rate districts. For all districts in this category,
the future runoff must be controlled to the specified release
rate for the design storm. That is, the post-development runoff
rate must be less than or equal to the predevelopment rate
multiplied by the specified release rate for that district. The
stormwater management specified release rate districts for the
Fishing Creek, Beaver Creek, Manada Creek, Kellock Run and
Stony Creek watersheds are identified in their respective Act
167 stormwater management plans, as amended, and adopted
by Dauphin County and approved by the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection. The maps indicating
the specified release rate districts are available for inspection
at the Township office.
(b) General criteria.
[1] The exact location of any given development site, or
activity regulated by this chapter, relative to the release
rate district boundaries shall be determined by mapping
the release rate district boundaries using two-foot
topographic contour mapping provided as part of the SWM
site plan and report.
[2] For a proposed development site located entirely within
one release rate district, the runoff from each discharge
point shall meet the required release rate criteria.
[3] For a proposed development site which is located within
two or more release rate districts, the maximum runoff
discharged at any point shall be equal to the release rate
for the district in which the discharge point is located.
[4] Each development site shall be considered separately and
shall conform to the criteria of the district in which it is
located. In no case may the release rate for an area be
exceeded as credit for a reduction below the criteria or
any other restrictions on a separate site.
[5] Regional detention facilities will be permitted, provided
that adequate conveyance is available or provided from
the site to the facility. The acceptability and discharge
characteristics of the facility will be reviewed on a case-bycase
basis.
B. Off-site areas that drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
§ 168-15 PLUMBING § 168-15
144:201
rate; however, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site.

ARTICLE V
Design Criteria
§ 168-18. Design criteria for stormwater management and drainage
facilities.
A. General design guidelines:
(1) Stormwater shall not be transferred from one watershed to
another, unless:
(a) The watersheds are subwatersheds of a common watershed
which join together within the perimeter of the property;
(b) The effect of the transfer does not alter the peak rate discharge
onto adjacent lands; or
(c) Easements from the affected landowner(s) are provided.
(2) Consideration shall be given to the relationship of the subject
property to the drainage pattern of the watershed. A concentrated
discharge of stormwater to an adjacent property shall be within an
existing watercourse or confined in an easement or returned to a
pre-development flow type condition.
(3) Stormwater BMPs and recharge facilities are encouraged (e.g.,
rooftop storage, dry wells, cisterns, recreation area ponding,
diversion structures, porous pavements, holding tanks, infiltration
systems, stream channel storage, in line storage in storm sewers,
and grading patterns). They shall be located, designed, and
constructed in accordance with the latest technical guidance
published by PADEP, provided that they are accompanied by
detailed engineering plans and performance capabilities and
supporting site-specific soils, geology, runoff and groundwater and
infiltration rate data to verify proposed designs. Additional
guidance from other sources may be accepted at the discretion of
the Township Engineer (a preapplication meeting is suggested).
(4) All existing and natural watercourses, channels, drainage systems
and areas of surface water concentration shall be maintained in
their existing condition unless an alteration is approved by the
appropriate regulatory agency.
(5) No outlet structure from a stormwater management facility, or
swale, shall discharge directly onto a Township or state roadway.
(6) The invert of all infiltration/storage facilities shall be located a
minimum of two feet above the seasonal high groundwater table or
other soil limiting zone. The invert of stormwater facilities may be
lower if they do not adversely alter the existing water table level.
(7) Any stormwater management facility may be required to be fenced
with a minimum four-foot-high fence of material acceptable to the
§ 168-18 PLUMBING § 168-18
144:205
Township. Gates with a minimum opening of 10 feet shall be
provided for access.
(8) Stormwater management facilities excavated to carbonate rock
must either be fitted with an impervious clay liner or overexcavated
four feet and refilled with a suitable material mix. Suitable backfill
material is subject to the approval of the Township Engineer.
(9) The type, location, and number of landscaping and planting
specification shall be provided for all stormwater management
facilities and be specific for each type of facility.
B. Stormwater management facilities (with a depth of water equal to or
greater than three feet measured from the lowest point inside a facility
to the crest of the emergency spillway).
(1) Any stormwater management facility designed to store runoff and
requiring a berm or earthen embankment shall be designed to
provide an emergency spillway to handle peak rate of stormwater
runoff up to and including the one-hundred-year post-development
flow, with a blocked primary outlet structure. The height of
embankment must be set as to provide a minimum one foot of
freeboard through the spillway, above the maximum water surface
elevation, computed when the spillway functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow, with a blocked outlet
structure when no storage is available. The primary outflow
structure must be designed to pass all design storms (up to and
including the one-hundred-year event) without discharging through
the emergency spillway. The maximum water depth within any
stormwater management facility shall be no greater than eight feet
when functioning through the primary outlet structure.
(2) Emergency spillways shall be armored to prevent erosion during
the one-hundred-year post-development flow, with blocked primary
outlet structure. Synthetic liners or riprap may be used, and
calculations sufficient to support proposed armor must be
provided. An earthen plug must be used to accurately control the
spillway invert if riprap is the proposed armoring material.
Emergency spillway armor must extend up the sides of the spillway
and continue at full width to a minimum of 10 feet past the toe of
slope.
(3) A stormwater management facility berm cross sections must be at
least five feet wide at the top and eight feet wide through the
emergency spillway. For fill embankments, the side slopes shall be
no steeper then 3:1 on the inside of the facility and 2:1 on the
outside of the facility. For cut slopes, the side slopes shall be no
steeper than 2:1.
(4) A cutoff and key trench of impervious material shall be provided
under all embankments four feet or greater in height.
§ 168-18 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-18
144:206
(5) Soils used for the construction of stormwater management
facilities shall have low-erodibility factors ("K" factors) (refer to
E&S Manual) and be identified on the SWM site plan.
(6) Trash racks must be provided to prevent clogging of primary
outflow structure stages for all orifices equivalent to 12 inches or
smaller in diameter.
(7) Antiseep collars must be provided on all outflow culverts in
accordance with the methodology contained in the latest edition of
the E&S Manual. An increase in seepage length of 15% must be
used in accordance with the requirements for permanent antiseep
collars.
(8) Conventional, non-BMP stormwater management facilities (i.e., dry
detention basins) must empty over a period of time not less than 24
hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the facility's
inflow hydrograph. Infiltration tests performed at the facility
locations and proposed basin bottom depths, in accordance with
the BMP Manual, must support time-to-empty calculations if
infiltration is a factor in the sizing of the stormwater management
facility.
(9) Impervious low-flow channels are not permitted within stormwater
management facilities to promote water quality and groundwater
recharge for frequent storm events. Facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs may have a bottom slope of zero. Minimalmaintenance,
saturation-tolerant vegetation must be provided in
basins designed as water quality/infiltration BMPs. Water storage
below the lowest outlet structure stage (i.e., dead storage) is
permitted in stormwater management facilities designed as water
quality/infiltration BMPs.
(10) Stormwater management facilities' bottom elevations must be
greater than adjacent floodplain elevations (FEMA or HEC-RAS
analysis). If no floodplain is defined, bottom elevations must be
higher than existing ground elevations 50 feet from top of stream
bank in the facilities vicinity.
(11) Basin outflow culverts discharging into floodplains must account
for tailwater. Tailwater corresponding to the one-hundred-year
floodplain elevation may be used for all design storms, or the
applicant may elect to determine flood elevations of the adjacent
watercourse for each design storm. The floodplain is assumed to be
50 feet from top of stream bank in areas where a floodplain is not
designated or where no other evidence is provided.
(12) The riser pipe shall be designed to withstand buoyancy forces if it
becomes clogged.
(13) For stormwater detention ponds designed without infiltration or
without using vegetative means to improve water quality, the
§ 168-18 PLUMBING § 168-18
144:207
minimum slope of any surface on the bottom of the pond shall be
1.5%. Also, low-flow channels shall be constructed from any pipe or
swale leading into the pond to the principal spillway.
(14) The height of embankment shall not exceed 14 feet as measured
from the lowest point in the pond to the top of berm.
(15) Access. All facilities shall have stabilized access roads, gates,
fences and easements where necessary for the proper
maintenance, repair and utilization of the stormwater facilities.
(16) Seasonal high groundwater table. The invert of all stormwater
ponds and underground infiltration/storage facilities shall be
located a minimum of two feet above the seasonal high
groundwater table.
(17) Topsoil and seeding. All pond areas, including bottoms of nonwater
quality ponds, side slopes and top of berms, shall be provided
with a minimum four inches of topsoil and shall be mulched and
seeded with Formula B in accordance with PennDOT Publication
408, Section 804.
C. Storm sewer facilities.
(1) Pipes (concrete, metal or plastic) shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications as set forth in the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Publication 408 or current edition.
All metal pipes, except for structural plate pipes, shall be
aluminum-coated (Type 2) and conform to the current AASHTO
M247 (and ASTM A819) material specification or equal or better as
approved by the Township Engineer. Structural plate pipes shall be
galvanized steel and conform to the current AASHTO M167 (and
ASTM A761) material specification or equal or better as approved
by the Township Engineer. Durability calculations that include
corrosiveness and abrasion must be supplied to assure an average
service life of at least 100 years for the galvanized structural plate
pipes.
(2) Pipes, trenching and backfill shall be in accordance with RC-30M of
Roadway Construction Standard Drawings, current edition, or
other detail approved by the Township Engineer.
(3) Pipe thickness and reinforcement shall be in accordance with
approved engineering calculations.
(4) Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from
the design storm based on the Manning equation and without
surcharging inlets. When connecting to an existing storm sewer
system, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed system
will not exacerbate any existing stormwater problems and that
adequate downstream capacity exists. Provisions such as building
locations and easements shall be provided to convey storms in
§ 168-18 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-18
144:208
excess of the design storm up to the one-hundred-year event. In
addition, provisions must be made to convey at least the onehundred-
year storm as surcharge flow to detention ponds that are
required as part of this chapter.
(5) Pipe sizes shall be in accordance with that shown on approved
drawings. A minimum pipe size for drainage facilities shall be 15
inches if specifying smooth-lined pipe or 18 inches if specifying
corrugated piping for on-site collection. Pipes utilized for upstream
conveyance of off-site flows shall have a minimum size of 18 inches.
Pipes shall be designed to provide a minimum velocity of 2 1/2 feet
per second when flowing full, but in all cases, the slope shall be no
less than 0.5%. Arch pipe of equivalent cross-sectional area may be
substituted in lieu of circular pipe where cover or utility conflict
conditions exist.
(6) Pipes shall be constructed and set to line and grade as shown on
approved drawings. Provide six inches minimum cover from top of
pipe to subgrade in roadways and one-foot minimum cover from top
of pipe to top of ground in lawn areas where there will be no
vehicular or similar loads.
(7) Endwalls or end sections shall be used at all pipe inlets and outlets
in accordance with RC-31M.
(8) In proposed curbed roadway sections, the maximum encroachment
of water on the roadway pavement shall not exceed half of a
through travel lane or one inch less than the depth of curb during
the ten-year design storm of five-minute duration. Gutter depth
shall be verified by inlet capture/capacity calculations that account
for road slope and opening area. The maximum distance between
inlets in curbed roadway sections shall be no more than 450 feet;
however, access to underground pipes shall be provided every no
more than 300 feet.
(9) Inlets shall be constructed in accordance with the specifications as
set forth in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation,
Publication 408, current edition, and as detailed on the Roadway
Construction Standard Drawings (RC-45M) or other detail
approved by the Township Engineer.
(10) Inlet curbs shall be compatible with the type of curbing installed.
(11) Standard Type "C" inlets with eight-inch hoods shall be used along
vertical concrete curbs roadway networks. Type "C" inlets with teninch
hoods that provide a two-inch sump condition may be used
with direction from the Township Engineer when roadway
longitudinal slopes are 1.0% or less.
(12) For inlets containing a change in pipe size, the elevation for the
crown of the pipes shall be the same, or the smaller pipe's crown
shall be at a higher elevation.
§ 168-18 PLUMBING § 168-18
144:209
(13) All inlets shall provide a minimum two-inch drop between the
lowest inlet pipe invert elevation and the outlet pipe invert
elevation.

of sag vertical curves, or an inlet shall be placed at the low point
and on each side of the low point at a distance not to exceed 100
feet, or at an elevation not to exceed 0.2 foot above the low point.
(15) At all roadway low points, swales and easements shall be provided
behind the curb or swale and through adjacent properties to
channelize and direct any overflow of stormwater runoff away from
dwellings and structures. The swales should be designed to
accommodate a flow equal to that being collected by the inlets at
the low point plus any additional drainage that may be directed to
or collected by the swale itself.
(16) Inlets shall be placed so drainage cannot cross intersections or
street center lines, taking into consideration inlet capacity and
bypass flow.
(17) All inlets in paved areas shall have heavy-duty bicycle-safe grating
consistent with PennDOT Publication 72M. A note to this effect
shall be added to the SWM site plan or inlet details therein.
(18) Inlets must be sized to accept the specified pipe sizes without
knocking out any of the inlet corners. All pipes entering or exiting
inlets shall be cut flush with the inlet wall. A note to this effect shall
be added to the SWM site plan or inlet details therein.
(19) Inlets shall have weep holes covered with geotextile fabric placed
at appropriate elevations to completely drain the subgrade prior to
placing the base and surface course on roadways.
(20) Inlets, junction boxes, or manholes greater than five feet in depth
shall be equipped with ladder rungs and shall be detailed on the
SWM site plan.
(21) Inlets shall not have a sump condition in the bottom (unless
designed as a water quality BMP). Pipes shall be flush with the
bottom of the box, or concrete channels shall be poured.
(22) Inlets, manholes, pipes, and culverts shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications set forth in PennDOT's
Publication 408, latest edition, and as detailed in the PennDOT's
Publication 72M - Standards for Roadway Construction (RC), latest
edition, or as approved by the Township Engineer. All material and
construction details (inlets, manholes, pipes, pipe trenches and
miscellaneous structures, etc.), must be shown on the SWM site
plan, and a note added that all construction must be in accordance
with PennDOT's Publication 408 and PennDOT's Publication 72M,
latest edition. A note shall be added to the plan stating that all
§ 168-18 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-18
144:210
frames, concrete top units, and grade adjustment rings shall be set
in a bed of full mortar according to Publication 408.
(23) Accessible drainage structures shall be located on continuous
storm sewer system at all vertical dislocations, at all locations

Publication 408, Section 804, or current edition.
A. All calculations shall be consistent with the guidelines set forth in the
BMP Manual.
B. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or a Soil Cover Complex methodology.
Methods shall be selected by the qualified professional based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular
site.
C. Rainfall values.
(1) Rational Method. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Drainage Manual, Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves,
Publication 584, Chapter 7A, latest edition, shall be used in
conjunction with the appropriate time of concentration and return
period.
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method. The Soil Conservation Service Type II,
twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution shall be used in conjunction
with rainfall depths from NOAA Atlas 14 or consistent with the
following table:
Return Interval
(year)
24-hour Rainfall Total
(inches)
1 2.40
2 2.90
10 4.36
25 5.43
50 6.38
100 7.48
D. Peak flow rates:
(1) Rational Method.
(a) May be used for drainage areas up to 20 acres for storage
facilities and up to 200 acres for conveyance facilities. Extreme
caution should be used by the qualified professional if the
watershed has more than one main drainage channel, if the
watershed is divided so that hydrologic properties are
significantly different in one versus the other, if the time of
§ 168-18 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-19
144:212
concentration exceeds 60 minutes, or if stormwater runoff
volume is an important factor. The combination of Rational
Method hydrographs based on timing shall be prohibited.
(b) The use of the Modified Rational Method to design stormwater
management facilities must be approved by the Township
Engineer.
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method: May be used for drainage areas
greater than 20 acres. This method is recommended for design of
stormwater management facilities and where stormwater runoff
volume must be taken into consideration.
(3) For comparison of peak flow rates, flows shall be rounded to a tenth
of a cubic foot per second (cfs).
E. Runoff coefficients/curve numbers.
(1) Rational Method: Use Table C-1 (Appendix C).60
(2) Soil Cover Complex Method: Use Table C-2 (Appendix C).
(3) For the purposes of pre-development peak flow rate and volume
determination, existing non-forested pervious areas conditions
shall be considered open space or meadow (good condition).
(4) Any regulated activities submitted within five years of forest
management activities shall use pre-construction ground cover for
stormwater runoff based upon forested land in good condition.
(5) For the purposes of pre-development volume determination, 20% of
existing impervious area, when present on the project site, and
contained within the new proposed limit of disturbance, shall be
considered open space or meadow (good condition) for predevelopment
hydrologic calculations for redevelopment.
F. Design storm.
(1) All drainage facilities (inlets, pipes, and swales) shall be designed
to safely convey the ten-year storm.
(2) All stormwater management facilities shall be verified by routing
the proposed one-year, two-year, ten-year, twenty-five-year, fiftyyear,
and one-hundred-year hydrographs through the facility using
the storage indication (Modified Puls) method. The design storm
hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that
produces a full hydrograph.
(3) The stormwater management and drainage system shall be
designed to safely convey the post-development one-hundred-year
60.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 168-19 PLUMBING § 168-19
144:213
storm event to stormwater detention facilities, for the purpose of
meeting peak rate control.
(4) All structures (culvert or bridges) proposed to convey runoff under
a Township road shall be designed to pass the fifty-year design
storm with a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the
lowest point along the top of the roadway.
(5) All design within state or federal rights-of-way or that falls under
the design criteria of any higher authority must meet the
requirements of that agency in addition to meeting the minimum
requirements of this chapter.
G. Time of concentration.
(1) Time of concentration shall be computed using the NRCS
Segmental Method as described in TR-55 (SCS 1986 or most
current update). The length of sheet flow shall be limited to
100-feet. The Manning's "n" roughness coefficient for TR-55 sheet
flow can be found in Table C-4 (Appendix C).61 The length of flow
path for sheet flow shall not exceed 100 feet and the length of flow
path for shallow concentrated flow shall not exceed 1,000 feet.
Time of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed
using Manning's equation.
(2) For sites with insignificant channelized flow and less than twentypercent
imperviousness coverage, the time of concentration may
be computed using the NRCS equation for lag time:
Time of Concentration = Tc = [(Tlag/0.6) * 60] (minutes)
Where:
Tlag = Lag time (hours)
L = Hydraulic length of watershed (feet).
Y = Average overland slope of watershed (percent).
S = Maximum retention in watershed as defined by S =
[(1,000/CN)  10].
CN = NRCS curve number for watershed as defined by the
NRCS Loss Method.
(3) Additionally, the following provisions shall apply to calculations for
time of concentration:
61.Editor's Note: Appendix C is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 168-19 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-19
144:214
(a) The post-development time of concentration shall never be
greater that the pre-development time of concentration for any
watershed or subwatershed.
(b) The minimum time of concentration for any watershed shall be
five minutes.
(c) The designer may choose to assume a five-minute time of
concentration for any post-development watershed or
subwatershed without providing any computations.
(d) The designer must provide computations for all predevelopment
time of concentration paths. A five-minute time of
concentration cannot be assumed for pre-development.
(e) Undetained fringe areas (areas that are not tributary to a
stormwater facility but where a reasonable effort has been
made to convey runoff from all new impervious coverage to
best management practices) may be assumed to represent the
pre-development conditions for purpose of time of
concentration calculations.
H. Drainage areas tributary to sinkholes or closed depressions in areas
underlain by limestone or carbonate geologic features shall be excluded
from the modeled point of analysis defining pre-development flows. If
left undisturbed during construction activities, areas draining to closed
depressions may also be removed from peak runoff rates in the postdevelopment
analysis. New, additional contributing runoff shall not be
directed to existing sinkholes or closed depressions.
I. Where uniform flow is anticipated, Manning's equation shall be used for
hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open
channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Manning's equation should not be
used for analysis of pipes under pressure flow or for analysis of
culverts. Manning's "n" values shall be obtained from Table C-3
(Appendix C).62 Inlet control shall be checked at all inlet boxes to
ensure the headwater depth during the ten-year design event is
contained below the top of grate for each inlet box.
J. The Township may approve the use of any generally accepted full
hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff
volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces
a full hydrograph.
K. The Township has the authority to require that computed existing
runoff rates be reconciled with field observations, conditions and site
history. If the designer can substantiate, through actual physical
calibration, that more appropriate runoff and time of concentration
values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate
variations may be made upon review and approval of the Township.

D. Facilities dedicated to Township D/SWM-BMP Fund. If stormwater
management facilities and related BMPs are offered and accepted by
the Township for dedication, the Township shall require persons
installing stormwater BMPs to pay a specified amount to the Municipal
Stormwater D/SWM-BMP Fund to help defray costs of operations and
maintenance activities. The amount may be determined as follows:
(1) The applicant's engineer shall determine and calculate the
maintenance costs on an annual basis of all stormwatermanagement-
related facilities to be dedicated.
(2) The applicant's engineer shall also calculate the amount of money
(the deposit amount) that, if invested at an interest rate of 3% per
annum, would produce sufficient interest income per year to pay
the annual operations and maintenance costs of the facilities for 10
years. The deposit amount shall then be converted to present worth
of the annual series values. The applicant shall provide the deposit
amount and the basis of the calculation to the Township Engineer
for review and approval.
(3) As a condition of approval of the subdivision or land development
and approval of any SWM permit, the Township may require the
applicant or developer, within seven days of approval of the amount
of deposit, to pay the Township the approved amount. If the
Township requires this payment, it is obliged to accept the
dedicated drainage and stormwater facilities when all other
improvements of the plan have been completed and provided that
the owner has dedicated to the Township a minimum twenty-foot
right-of-way to provide a means of ingress and egress to said
facilities where such ingress and egress is not otherwise practically
available.
(4) If a BMP is proposed that also serves as a recreation facility (e.g.,
ball field, lake), the Township may adjust the amount due
accordingly upon approval by the Board of Supervisors.
E. Facilities maintained by private organization. In the event that the
Township does not require dedication of drainage and stormwater
facilities to the Township, the applicant shall provide for and establish
an entity for the ownership and maintenance of the drainage and
§ 168-30 PLUMBING § 168-30
144:229
stormwater facilities, and such organization shall not be dissolved nor
shall it dispose of drainage facilities owned by it by sale or otherwise
(except to an organization conceived and established to own and
maintain the drainage and stormwater facilities).
(1) The organization for the ownership and maintenance of drainage
and stormwater facilities shall be a nonprofit homeowners'
organization operating under recorded land agreements that are
covenants running with all the land encompassed within the
development and shall be governed according to the following
regulations:
(a) The organization is organized by the developer and operating
with financial subsidization by the developer, if necessary,
before the sale of any lots within the development.
(b) Membership in the organization is mandatory for all
purchasers of lots therein and their successors.
(c) The organization shall be responsible for maintenance of said
drainage and stormwater facilities and insurance and taxes on
drainage and stormwater facilities owned by the organization.
(d) The members of the organization shall share equitably the
costs of maintaining and developing drainage and stormwater
facilities in accordance with the terms set forth in the
documents establishing the organization and the covenants
running with the land.
(e) The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to
administer common facilities and maintain the drainage and
stormwater facilities.
(f) The Board of Supervisors shall retain the right to review and
approve the articles of incorporation or other documents
creating the organization and bylaws and all declaration of
covenants, conditions and restrictions of the homeowners'
organization as the same relates to the responsibility for
ongoing ownership and maintenance. Additionally, the
Township shall have a right of inspection of drainage and
stormwater facilities.
(2) Failure to maintain.
(a) In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain drainage and stormwater facilities or any successor
organization shall, at any time, fail to maintain the drainage
and stormwater facilities in reasonable order and condition in
accordance with the development or subdivision plan, the
Township may serve written notice on such organization or on
the residents and owners of the development setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
§ 168-30 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-30
144:230
drainage and stormwater facilities in reasonable condition, and
said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of
maintenance be cured within 30 days thereof and shall state
the date and place of a hearing hereon which shall be held
within 14 days of the notice.
(b) At such hearing, the Township may modify the terms of the
original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension
of time within which the same shall be cured.
(c) If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or the
modifications thereof shall not be cured within said 30 days or
any extension thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the
taxable values of the properties within the development and
prevent the drainage and stormwater facilities from becoming
a public nuisance, may enter upon said drainage and
stormwater facilities and maintain the same for a period of one
year. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the public
any rights to use the drainage and stormwater facilities except
when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the
residents and owners.
(d) Before the expiration of said year, the Township shall, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore
responsible for the maintenance of the drainage and
stormwater facilities, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization or to the residents and owners of the
development, at which hearing such organization or the
residents and owners of the development shall show cause why
such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the election of
the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township
shall determine that such organization is ready and able to
maintain said drainage and stormwater facilities in reasonable
condition, the Township shall cease to maintain said drainage
and stormwater facilities at the end of said year. If the
Township shall determine such organization is not ready and
able to maintain said drainage and stormwater facilities in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, at its discretion,
continue to maintain said drainage and stormwater facilities
during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar
hearing and a determination, in each year thereafter. The
decision of the Township in any such case shall constitute a
final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
(3) The costs of such maintenance by the Township shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the development and shall
become a lien on said properties. The Township, at the time of
entering on said drainage and stormwater facilities for the purpose
of maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the
Prothonotary of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, upon the properties
affected by the lien within the development.
§ 168-30 PLUMBING § 168-30
144:231
§ 168-31. Maintenance agreement for privately owned stormwater
facilities.
F. Facilities maintained by individual lot owner.
(1) Where the plan indicates that the drainage and stormwater
facilities are to be located on an individual lot and are to be
maintained by the owner of the lot, the plan shall contain language
in a form satisfactory to the Township Solicitor that the owner of
the lot, or any succeeding owner or any succeeding owner(s), has a
legal duty to maintain the stormwater and drainage facilities in
accordance with the standards of the Township and that the legal
duty to maintain the drainage and stormwater facilities may be
enforced at law or in equity by the Township or by owners of other
lots on the plan.
(2) In the event that the owner fails to maintain the facilities in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development or subdivision plan, the Township may serve the
owner of the lot on which the facilities are located a notice setting
forth the deficiencies in maintenance and giving the owner 30 days
within which to cure said deficiencies. If the owner fails to cure
said deficiencies within the 30 days or any extension thereof
granted by the Township, the Township may enter upon the
property and remedy the deficiencies. The costs of remedying the
deficiency shall be a lien on the lot upon which the facilities are
located.
G. The Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, shall
make the final determination on the continuing maintenance
responsibilities prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report.
The Township may require an offer of dedication of such facilities as
part of the requirements for approval of the SWM site plan. Such a
requirement is not an indication that the Township will accept the
facilities. The Township reserves the right to accept or reject the
ownership and operating responsibility for any portion of the
stormwater management controls.
H. If the Township accepts ownership of stormwater BMPs, the Township
may, at its discretion, require a fee from the applicant to the Township
to offset the future cost of inspections, operations, and maintenance.
I. It shall be unlawful to alter or remove any permanent stormwater BMP
required by an approved SWM site plan, or to allow the property to
remain in a condition, which does not conform to an approved SWM site
plan, unless the Township grants an exception in writing.
A. Prior to final approval of the SWM site plan and report, the applicant
shall sign the operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement (Appendix
A67) covering all stormwater control facilities that are to be privately
§ 168-30 WEST HANOVER CODE § 168-31
144:232
owned. The operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be
recorded with the SWM site plan and made a part hereto.
B. Other items may be included in the operation and maintenance (O&M)
agreement where determined necessary to guarantee the satisfactory
operation and maintenance of all BMP facilities. The operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Township and the Township Solicitor.
C. The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance of the
stormwater BMPs. If the owner fails to adhere to the operation and
maintenance (O&M) agreement, the Township may perform the
services required and charge the owner appropriate fees. Nonpayment
of fees may result in a lien against the property.

§ 170-4. Street openings prior to reconstruction or resurfacing.
A. Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any person to make any street
opening without first securing a permit therefor from West Hanover
Township; provided, however, that any person maintaining pipes, lines
or underground conduits, in or under the surface of any street by virtue
of any law, ordinance or franchise, may proceed with an excavation or
opening without a permit when emergency circumstances demand the
work be done immediately for the preservation of the public health,
safety or welfare, or provided that the permit could not reasonably and
practically have been obtained beforehand. Such person, however, shall
thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which
the office of the township is open for business, and said permit shall be
retroactive to the date when work was begun.
B. Conditions of approval. The approval of any street opening permit shall
confer a right upon the permittee, subject to the terms and conditions
of the permit, to temporarily occupy and use the street surface during
the course of construction work covered by the permit and to thereafter
occupy the space within which the work is to be located, subject in
every case to the specific right of the township to require temporary or
permanent relocation or removal of any of the facilities entirely at the
permittee's expense in the event that said facilities are in conflict with
the township's interest or the public interest in the use of the street.
C. Special conditions. In approving any permit, the township may attach
such special conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to
protect the public and private property.
D. Acceptance of permit. By accepting the permit, the applicant agrees to
perform the work in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
permit, and of any special conditions which way be attached thereto,
and to save the township, its officers, employees and agents from any
costs, damages and liabilities which may accrue by reason of the work.
E. Expiration of permit. Every permit issued hereunder shall expire within
one year from the date of issuance. If the permittee shall be unable to
complete the work within one year from the date of issuance, he shall,
prior to expiration of the permit, present, in writing, to the township a
request for an extension of time, setting forth therein the reasons for
the requested extension. If in the opinion of the township such an
extension is necessary, the permittee may be granted additional time
for the completion of the work.
F. Revocation of permits. The township may revoke any permit issued
hereunder after notice of violation of any condition of the permit.
A. When the township reconstructs or resurfaces any street, the township
shall first serve written notice by certified mail of such improvements to
all persons owning property abutting the street about to be improved
and to all public utilities companies operating within the township.

RIGID PAVEMENT TRENCH RESTORATION
Not to scale
(13) Temporary restoration of a pavement may be required by the
township prior to pavement restoration in accordance with the
following:
(a) The base shall consist of compacted select granular material
with a surface of two-inch bituminous material. If the existing
pavement structure includes a course of subbase material, it
shall be replaced to a depth equal to the existing course depth
with material meeting the requirements of Section 350.2 of
Publication 408.
§ 170-4.2 WEST HANOVER CODE § 170-4.2
144:256
(b) Temporary pavement restoration shall be completed before
traffic is allowed to travel on the disturbed area.
(c) The temporary pavement shall be immediately removed and
permanent restoration performed as soon as possible. The
temporary pavement may be kept in place for up to six months
or as specified in the permit, if it is properly maintained.
(14) In all cases where the application for a permit proposes
construction or installation of electric wires across a public rightof-
way, the application shall show that the electrical wires are to be
contained in an approved electrical conduit.
D. Special restoration requirements. Whenever unusual conditions exist,
or arise during construction, the township may change the permanent
restoration requirements from those given therein. In all cases, marks
of construction beyond the area of actual trench shall be satisfactorily
restored. In cases where a substantial portion of the original street
paving is removed or damaged, the township may require the permittee
to resurface the entire street area, in addition to constructing the final
paving repairs over trench areas. The township may also elect to accept
payment from the permittee to the township for final paving repairs, in
a sum to be determined by the township based upon then current costs
for such work plus 15%, and to apply the sum so paid toward the cost of
reconstruction of the entire street.
E. Inspection during construction. [Amended 5-3-2004 by Ord. No.
2004-4]
(1) The Township Road Master and the Township Engineer shall be
notified by the permittee four working days in advance of any
intended date of construction. The provisions stated herein shall be
construed as mandating periodic inspections, and the undertaking
of periodic inspections shall not be construed as an acceptance of
the work during construction or as a final inspection of the
construction.
(2) The applicant shall reimburse the township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements by
the township or Township Engineer. Such reimbursement shall be
based upon time and material costs for the referenced inspections.
Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the
ordinary and customary fees charged by the Township Engineer for
work performed for similar services in the community, but in no
event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the
Township Engineer to the township when fees are not reimbursed
or otherwise imposed on applicants. If the inspection fees exceed
the basic fee established in § 170-4.1B(1), then the Township may
invoice the permittee for costs incurred by the Township for the
Inspection of improvements. Improvements shall not be finally
approved until the invoice is paid.
§ 170-4.2 PLUMBING § 170-4.2
144:257
§ 170-4.3. Administration. [Amended 5-3-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-4]
(3) The Township, at the expense of the permittee, reserves the right to
require tests of the improvement to determine whether the
improvement complies in all respects with the requirements of the
Township.
F. Future maintenance. The permittee shall be responsible to correct any
trench settlement or deterioration in the final paving work or failure of
any other work associated with the permit. Such responsibility is
without limitation during the first two years after the date of the final
completion certificate. Thereafter, settlement of the trench area and
any other repair work shall remain the responsibility of the permittee to
repair, unless the Township gives a specific release. [Amended
5-3-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-4]
A. Computation of improvement financial guarantee.
(1) The amount of improvement guarantee shall be equal to 110% of
the cost of completion of street improvements estimated as of 90
days following the date scheduled for completion by the permittee.
Annually, the township may adjust the amount of the financial
security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements which
have been completed and estimated cost for the completion of the
remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day after
either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled
date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the township
may require the permittee to post additional security in order to
assure that the financial security equals said 110%. Any additional
security shall be posted by the permittee in accordance with this
article.
(2) The amount of financial guarantee required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required street
improvements, submitted by the applicant. The township, upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept
such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant and the
township are unable to agree upon an estimate, the estimate shall
be recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer
licensed as such in this commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
township and the applicant. The estimate certified by the third
engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the
final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees
for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the
township and the applicant or permittee.
(3) If the party posting the financial guarantee requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial guarantee to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from posting of financial security to an
§ 170-4.2 WEST HANOVER CODE § 170-4.3
144:258
amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one-year period by using the above procedure.
B. Form of financial security for improvement/performance and/or
maintenance guarantee. The financial security may be in the form of
cash, certified treasurer's or cashier's check, letter of credit or surety
bond made payable to the township. Although the township may accept
an alternative type of financial security, commonly used forms such as
irrevocable letters of credit and escrow accounts will be accepted. Such
financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federal or
commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided that said bonding company or
lending institution is authorized to conduct such business in the
commonwealth, subject to review by the Township Solicitor for
adequacy.
C. Release of improvement/performance financial security.
(1) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release, from time to time,
such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests
shall be in writing addressed to the Township, and the Township
shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to
allow the Township Road Master or Township Engineer to certify
that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
completed in accordance with the approval of the road cut/street
opening permit or amendments and adjustments approved by the
Township. Upon such certification, the township shall authorize
release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount
as estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the
value of the improvements completed or, if the Township fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Township shall be deemed to
have approved the release of funds as requested. The Township
may, prior to final release at the time of completion and
certification by its engineer, require retention of 10% of the
estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(2) When the permittee has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the permittee shall notify the Township,
of the completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a
copy thereof to the Township Engineer. The Township shall, within
10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Road
Master and/or the Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid
improvements. The Township Road Master and/or Township
Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing, with the
township and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
permittee. The report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval
or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part and, if
§ 170-4.3 PLUMBING § 170-4.3
144:259
said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved
or shall be rejected by the Road Master Township Engineer, said
report shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection.
(3) If any portion of said improvement shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the township, the permittee shall proceed to complete
the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification,
as outlined herein, shall be followed.
(4) If any portion of said improvements are not approved or are
rejected by the township, the applicant shall proceed to complete
the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification
outlined herein shall be followed.
D. Final completion certificate. After final inspection and acceptance of
the work, and after payment of any release or collection of any
insufficiency due, the township shall issue a final completion certificate.
The date of such final completion certificate shall fix the two-year time
period during which the permittee absolutely is responsible for
maintenance of permanent pavement repairs and trenches.
E. Release of financial guarantee for maintenance.

ARTICLE IV
Plan Specifications and Processing Procedures
§ 173-8. General requirements.
Whenever a subdivision of land or land development is desired to be
effected in West Hanover Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, a plan of
the layout of such subdivision or land development shall be prepared, filed
and processed according to the requirements of this chapter as follows.
§ 173-9. Sketch plans. [Amended 5-3-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-8]
A. Purpose.
(1) Prior to the filing of a subdivision or land development plan for
review and approval, the submission of an informal sketch plan for
such subdivision or land development is strongly recommended.
(2) The purpose of the sketch plan is for the applicant to present
general information regarding the proposed subdivision and to
receive comments from Township boards and commissions on the
necessary requirements to achieve conformity with the standards
of this chapter and other applicable ordinances, as well as being
alerted to other factors which must be considered, prior to the
expenditure of substantial sums of money on surveying, wetland
delineation and engineering.
(3) The Township agrees to act in good faith and confidentiality
regarding sketch plans submitted for review. To encourage sketch
plan submissions, the Township agrees to not apply a proposed
change of the Zoning Ordinance78 that would adversely affect the
density or use allowed on a property that has submitted a sketch
plan for review. However, once the Planning Commission
undertakes Comprehensive Plan revisions required by the MPC
(Municipal Planning Code),79 the protection afforded by this section
shall not apply until after any amendments are made to the Zoning
Ordinance in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan update.
This protection shall apply for a period of 90 days from the date of
plan review and shall not be available again for a period of one year
for the same property from the end of the ninety-day protection
period.
B. Procedure. The applicant is encouraged to submit a sketch plan and
make a verbal presentation regarding the site and proposed
subdivision. It is an informal meeting prior to the submission of an
application.
78.Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Zoning.
79.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 173-8 PLUMBING § 173-9
144:311
(1) Pre-sketch-plan meeting. A meeting is strongly recommended
between the Township's Zoning Officer and the applicant to
introduce the applicant to the Township's zoning and subdivision
regulations and procedures, to discuss the applicant's objectives,
introduce the applicant to the four-step design process for
subdivisions, and to schedule site visits prior to plan reviews.
(2) Site inspection. Applicants are encouraged to arrange for a visit to
the property by the Planning Commission and/or other municipal
officials (applicants, their site designers, and the landowner are
encouraged to accompany the Planning Commission). The purpose
of the visit is to familiarize local officials with the property's
existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site
design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss
site design concepts, including the general layout of designated
required open space (if applicable) and potential locations for
proposed buildings and street alignments. Comments made by
municipal officials or their staff and consultants will be interpreted
as being only advisory. It will be understood by all parties that no
formal recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions
can be made at the site visit.
(3) Sketch plan submission.
(a) The sketch plan should show in simple freehand pencil sketch
form, the proposed project, providing sufficient information to
clearly indicate the character and extent of the proposed
subdivision or land development and its relationship to existing
conditions and facilities within the area in which it is to be
located.
(b) It is recommended that the sketch plan submission include a
map covering sufficient area to establish the location of the
site, existing resources and elements of the Four-Step Process,
as described below.
(4) Sketch plan review. The Township will not in any case construe
presentation of a sketch plan as an official submission for plan
review. Because of its unofficial status, the sketch plan will not be
subject to the time limitations for plan review specified by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,80 nor will the
presentation of a sketch plan be considered a formal application,
commencing the time limitation specified by Section 508 of said
Code for approval of a preliminary plan or final plan. No fee will be
required by the Township for the presentation of a sketch plan.
C. Sketch plan information. To provide a full understanding of the site's
potential and to facilitate the most effective exchange with the Planning
Commission and other boards and commissions, it is recommended the
80.Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 173-9 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-9
144:312
sketch plan include, but is not limited to, the information listed below.
None of the sketch plan data requirements go beyond what is required
as part of a preliminary plan in § 173-12. Many of these items are
available in published data, and as part of the Township's
environmental resource inventory, and GIS mapping.
(1) Name and address of the legal owner, the equitable owner, and/or
the applicant;
(2) Name and address for the person responsible for preparing the
plan;
(3) Plan shall be clearly labeled "Sketch Plan";
(4) North arrow;
(5) Approximate tract boundaries, sufficient to locate the tract on a
map of the municipality;
(6) Location map;
(7) Zoning district;
(8) Streets on and adjacent to the tract;
(9) Approximately one-hundred-year floodplain limits;
(10) Existing resources and site conditions. Topographic, physical, and
cultural features including soil types, wooded areas, ditches,
drains, dumps, storage tanks, ponds, streams within 200 feet of the
tract, and existing rights-of-way and easements; cultural features
such as all structures, foundations, walls, wells, trails, and
abandoned roads; and
(11) Proposed methods of water supply, sewage disposal, and
stormwater management.
D. Four-step design process for subdivisions. It is highly recommended
that a sketch plan be developed from the Four-Step Design Process in
determining the layout of proposed conservation lands (open space, as
defined in Article XVII, § 195-85), house sites, streets and lot lines,
(1) Step 1: Delineate potential open space lands to be preserved;
include floodplains, environmental protection overlay districts and
conservation features, as defined in § 195-85. The actual minimum
percentage and acreage of required open space lands should be
calculated by the applicant and submitted as part of the sketch
plan.
(a) Primary open space lands include all constrained lands:
wetlands, floodplains, hillsides and steep slopes, streams,
ponds and lakes (as defined in Articles XV and XVI of the
Zoning Ordinance81).
§ 173-9 PLUMBING § 173-9
144:313
§ 173-10. Preapplication conference.
(b) Secondary open space lands include those parts of the
remaining buildable lands that might be considered for
conservation. These include: mature woodlands, large
individual trees of 15 inches in diameter or greater or of
botanic significance, tree masses, trails, prime farmland,
hedgerows, natural meadows, critical wildlife habitats and
travel corridors, scenic viewsheds, sites listed on the
Pennsylvania Natural Resource Inventory, rock outcroppings,
historic structures and sites, and culturally or archeologically
significant areas.
(c) The remaining part of the property should be shown as the
"potential development area."
(2) Step 2: Location of house sites. Potential house sites should be
tentatively located, using the proposed open space lands as a base
map as well as other relevant factors such as topography and soils.
House sites should generally be located in relationship to the
environmental protection overlay districts as defined in Article XVI,
taking into consideration the potential negative impacts of
residential development on such areas as well as the potential
positive benefits of such locations to provide attractive views and
visual settings for residences.
(3) Step 3: Alignment of streets. Upon designating the house sites, a
street plan should be designed to provide vehicular access to each
house, complying with the standards in Article XXI and bearing a
logical relationship to topographic conditions. Impacts of the street
plan on proposed conservation (open space) lands shall be
minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally
sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding
15%. Street connections shall generally be encouraged to minimize
the number of new culs-de-sac to be maintained by the municipality
and to facilitate access to and from homes in different parts of the
tract and adjoining parcels.
(4) Step 4: drawing in the lot lines. Upon completion of the proceeding
three steps, lot lines can be drawn in accordance with good
planning design to delineate the boundaries of individual
residential lots.
A. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to:
(1) Foster informal plan review between the applicant and the
municipality.

ARTICLE V
Improvement and Maintenance Guaranties
§ 173-16. General requirements.
§ 173-17. Financial security for improvement guaranty.
The administration of the financial security shall comply with the provisions
of this article, the MPC, Act 247, as amended,100 and other applicable laws
of the commonwealth.
A. No project shall be considered in compliance with this chapter until the
public improvements, including streets, streetlights, all street signs,
sidewalks, curbs, landscaping, stormwater management facilities,
storm drainage for dedication or which affect adjacent properties or
streets, sanitary sewer facilities for dedication, water supply facilities,
fire hydrants, lot line markers, survey monuments, recreational
facilities, open space improvements and other such public improvement
have been installed in accordance with this chapter, other applicable
Township ordinances and the rules and regulations of a public utility or
the Township Water and Sewer Authority.
B. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with apparatus or
facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the jurisdiction and
pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or the Township
Water and Sewer Authority, financial security to assure proper
completion and maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with
the regulations of the controlling public utility or Township Water and
Sewer Authority and shall not be included within the financial security
as otherwise required by this section.
C. No final plan shall be signed by the Board of Supervisors for recording
in the office of the Dauphin County Recorder of Deeds unless:
(1) Financial security in accordance with § 173-17 is accepted by the
Board of Supervisors;
(2) Financial security is accepted by a public utility or the Township
Water and Sewer Authority, if necessary; and/or
(3) The improvements required by this chapter have been installed.
D. Such financial security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the
completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying
agreement for completion of the improvements.
A. Submission of improvement guaranty. Final plan applications that
include public improvements that have not been installed shall include
an improvement guaranty in the form of financial security. No financial
100. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 173-16 PLUMBING § 173-17
144:337
security shall be required or provided for improvements where financial
security is provided to the State Department of Transportation.
[Amended 11-4-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-9]
(1) Type of financial security. Although the Board of Supervisors may
accept an alternative type of financial security, commonly used
forms such as irrevocable letters of credit and escrow accounts will
be accepted. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding
company or federal or commonwealth chartered lending institution
chosen by the party posting the financial security, provided that
said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to
conduct such business in the commonwealth, subject to review by
the Township Solicitor for adequacy.
(2) Amount of financial security.
(a) The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the
cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date
scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the
Township may adjust the amount of the financial security by
comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have
been completed and estimated cost for the completion of the
remaining improvements as of the expiration of the 90th day
after either the original date scheduled for completion or a
rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said
adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security
equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by
the developer in accordance with this chapter.
(b) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon
an estimate of the cost of completion of the required
improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a fair and
reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to
accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an
estimate, the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by
another professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township and the
applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the third
engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable, and shall be
the final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so
chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
(c) If the party posting the financial security requires more than
one year from the date of posting of the financial security to
complete the required improvements, the amount of financial
§ 173-17 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-17
144:338
security may be increased by an additional 10% for each oneyear
period beyond the first anniversary date from posting of
financial security to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost
of completing the required improvements as reestablished on
or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by
using the above procedure.
(d) In the case where development is projected over a period of
years, the Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of
final plans by phases, sections or stages of development
subject to such requirements or guaranties as to improvements
in future sections or stages of development as it finds essential
for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
(3) Security agreement. The developer shall declare the intent to
provide an improvement guaranty by executing the security
agreement included in this chapter.101 The security agreement shall
be submitted at the time application is made for approval of a final
plan.
B. Plan approval conditioned upon financial security. When requested by
the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the Township Board of
Supervisors shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plan or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of
contingent approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the
financial security agreement is not executed within 90 days unless a
written extension is granted by the governing body; such extension
shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be placed in writing at the
request of the developer. The extension must be requested by the
applicant in writing.
C. Release of financial security.
(1) As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of
Supervisors to release or authorize the release of, from time to
time, such portions of the financial security necessary for payment
to the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to the Board of Supervisors,
and the Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of
such request within which to allow the Township Engineer to
certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of
the work upon the improvements has been completed in
accordance with the approval of the plan. Upon such certification
the Board of Supervisors shall authorize release by the bonding

144:339
company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to
act within said forty-five-day period, the Board of Supervisors shall
be deemed to have approved the release of funds as requested.
The Board of Supervisors may, prior to final release at the time of
completion and certification by its engineer, require retention of
10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(2) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
Supervisors in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the Township Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall,
within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the
Township Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements.
The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a report, in writing,
with the Board of Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a copy of the
same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report
shall be made and mailed within 30 days after receipt by the
Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board of
Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate
approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in
part, and if said improvements or any portion thereof shall not be
approved or shall be rejected by the Township Engineer, said report
shall contain a statement of reasons for such nonapproval or
rejection.
(3) The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer within 15 days
of receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or
registered mail, of the action of the Board of Supervisors with
relation thereto.
(4) If the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer fails to
comply with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all
improvements will be deemed to have been approved and the
developer shall be released from all liability, pursuant to its
performance guaranty bond or other security agreements.
(5) If any portion of said improvement shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall proceed
to complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification, as outlined herein, shall be followed.
(6) Documents for all permit transfers for access and maintenance of
stormwater control systems shall be provided prior to the final
release of improvement guarantee funds. [Added 6-4-2012 by
Ord. No. 2012-06102]

§ 173-18. Dedication of improvements. [Amended 12-1-2008 by Ord.
No. 2008-17]
All improvements shall be deemed to be private improvements and only for
the benefit of the specific project until such time as the same have been
offered for dedication and formally accepted by the Board of Supervisors.
No responsibility of any kind with respect to improvements shown on the
final plan shall be transferred until the improvements have been formally
accepted. No roads shall be accepted for dedication until a minimum of 80%
of the dwelling units are completed by phase. Dedications shall include all
public improvements at one time and not piecemeal, i.e., no separation of
sidewalks from roads, unless the plan was approved as such by the Board of
(7) If any portion of said improvements are not approved or are
rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification outlined herein shall be followed.
D. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event that any
improvements which may be required have not been installed as
provided in this article or in accord with the approved final plan, the
Board of Supervisors is hereby granted the power to enforce any
financial security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If
proceeds of the financial security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements
covered by said security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its option,
install all or part of such improvements and may institute appropriate
legal or equitable action to recover the funds necessary to complete the
remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether resulting
from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought against
the applicant, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such security, and not for any other municipal
purpose.
E. Other effects of financial security. If financial security has been
provided in lieu of the completion of the improvements required as a
condition for the final approval of the plan as set forth in this article, the
Township shall not condition the issuance of building, grading or other
permits relating to the erection or placement of improvements,
including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted upon the final
plan upon actual completion of the improvements depicted upon the
approved final plan. Moreover, if said financial security has been
provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be erected
shall not be withheld following the improvements of the streets
providing access to and from existing public roads to such building or
building as to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable condition,
as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon
the approved plan, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in
question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of
or occupancy of the building or buildings.

[Added 9-8-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-16103]
B. Prior to the initiation of construction, the developer shall notify the
Township so that an inspection schedule can be coordinated with the
construction schedule. Additionally, the Township and the Township
Engineer shall be notified four working days in advance of any intended
date of construction. The provisions stated herein shall be construed as
mandating periodic inspections and the undertaking of periodic
inspections shall not be construed as an acceptance of the work during
construction or as a final inspection of the construction.
C. The applicant shall reimburse the Township for the reasonable and
necessary expense incurred for the inspection of improvements. Such
reimbursement shall be based upon time and material costs for the
referenced inspections. Such expense shall be reasonable and in
accordance with the ordinary and customary fees charged by the
Township Engineer for work performed for similar services in the
community, but in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost
charged by the Township Engineer to the Township when fees are not
reimbursed or otherwise imposed on applicants. When fees are
disputed, the applicant and Township shall adhere to the procedure
described in Section 510(g) of the MPC, Act 247,104 and the professional
resolving the fee dispute shall be of the same profession as the
consultants whose fees are being disputed. [Amended 11-4-2002 by
Ord. No. 2002-9]
D. The Township, at the expense of the developer, reserves the right to
require tests of the improvement to determine whether the
improvement complies in all respects with the requirements of the
Township.

developed with the provision that the developer construct all
buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in
accordance with this and any other laws and ordinances
regulating such development.
(b) If the Township determines that only a part of a proposed plan
can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part
and shall require that development proceed consistent with
this determination.
(c) When a developer does not intend to develop the plan himself
and the Township determines that additional controls are
required to ensure safe development, it may require the
developer to impose appropriate deed restrictions on the land.
Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and
noted on every recorded plan.
(2) Streets. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall not be
more than the one foot below the regulatory flood elevation. The
Township may require profiles and elevations of streets to
determine compliance with the requirements. Drainage openings
§ 173-24 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-24
144:348
§ 173-25. Street systems.
shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows without unduly
increasing flood heights.
(3) Sanitary sewer facilities. All sanitary sewer systems, whether
public or private, shall be floodproofed up to the 1 1/2 feet above
the regulatory flood elevation. The installation of sewage disposal
facilities requiring soil absorption systems shall be prohibited
where such systems will not function due to high groundwater,
flooding or unsuitable soil characteristics or if these systems are
within designated floodplain areas or districts. The Township may
require that the developer note on the face of the plan and in any
deed of conveyance that soil absorption fields are prohibited in
such area or district.
(4) Water facilities. All water systems, whether public or private, shall
be floodproofed up to 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood
elevation.
(5) Other utilities and facilities. All other public and private utilities
and facilities, including gas and electric, shall be elevated or
floodproofed up to 1 1/2 feet above the regulatory flood elevation.
A. General. All streets proposed to be constructed within the Township
shall conform to the following general design requirements:
(1) The Township encourages creative design methods to minimize the
number of access points onto Township and state roads for the
safety and convenience of public travel. Whenever possible, the
Township strongly encourages the use of shared driveways, service
roads and other methods to minimize the number of road access
points.
(2) Proposed streets shall be planned with regard to the existing street
system, public convenience in terms of fire protection and
pedestrian traffic, probable volumes of traffic, existing and
proposed use of land on abutting properties and future
development extensions of the street system.
(3) The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
existing or platted streets and for proper access to adjoining
undeveloped parcels suitable for future development. Right-of-way
access for future streets is required where practicable. [Amended
12-1-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-17]
(4) Streets shall be logically related to topography so as to produce
reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building
sites.
(5) The finished elevation of proposed streets shall not be more than
one foot below the regulatory flood elevation. The Township may
§ 173-24 PLUMBING § 173-25
144:349
require profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance
with this requirement.
(6) The streets must be properly located and constructed with regard
to the proposed traffic functions, including the minimization of
through traffic on minor streets and the protection of major street
capacities from excessive marginal access.
(7) The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of
all streets and highways must conform to the Comprehensive Plan
and/or Official Map, as amended.
B. Road classifications. All Township roads are grouped into the following
classifications based upon function:
(1) Freeway. A freeway is a limited access roadway.
(2) Highway. A highway is usually a state or interstate highway which
provides intermunicipal up to interstate traffic of substantial
volumes. A highway usually accommodates operating speeds up to
55 miles per hour (mph).
(3) Arterial. An arterial is a high-volume street that should have no
access other than by way of a collector street. Its function is to
conduct traffic between communities and activity centers and to
connect communities to highways and freeways. The design speed
is typically 45 mph or more. (See Illustration 1.105)
(4) Collector. As the principal traffic artery within residential or
commercial areas, the collector carries relatively high traffic
volumes and conveys traffic from arterial streets to lower-order
streets. Its function is to promote the free flow of traffic.
Consequently, the Township does not encourage parking or
residences along a collector. The collector's secondary function is
to serve abutting land uses. A collector street may also
accommodate public transit such as buses. The design speed is
typically 40 mph. (See Illustration 1.)
(5) Subcollector. The subcollector provides passage to access streets
and conveys traffic to collectors. Like the access street, the
subcollector provides frontage and access to residential lots but
also carries some through traffic to lower-order (access) streets.
The subcollector is a relatively low-volume street. The design speed
is typically 30 mph. (See Illustration 1.)
(6) Access street. The access street is designed to conduct traffic
between dwelling units and higher-order streets. As the lowestorder
street in the hierarchy, the access street carries no through
traffic and includes short streets, culs-de-sac and courts.
Subcollectors usually serve more dwellings and carry a small
105. Editor's Note: Illustration 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 173-25 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-25
144:350
volume of through traffic to one or more access streets. The design
speed is typically 20 mph. (See Illustration 1.)
(7) Alley (service street). Alleys are special-purpose service roads that
provide secondary means of access to lots.
(8) Nonresidential street. These streets serve nonresidential areas
such as retail, office or industrial. The design speed is typically 40
mph.
(9) Roadway subcollectors. Following is an illustrative figure
classification of roads in the Township: [Amended 12-1-2008 by
Ord. No. 2008-17]

alley or nonresidential.
C. Street and right-of-way widths. Following are the minimum street and
right-of-way widths. A minimum four-foot shoulder shall be provided on
each side of the road when curbing is not provided. Required widths
may be increased or decreased by the Township based upon projected
traffic counts and needs of public health, safety and convenience.

NOTES:
AIf residences front on the collector, then the pavement width can be
increased up to 36 feet to provide two travel lanes and two parking
lanes.
BThe width of access roads can be reduced to 20 feet if on-street
parking will not be required. The developer must provide "no parking"
signs and adequate off-street parking areas that will accommodate
four parking spaces per unit.
(1) For access streets, a twenty-six-foot-wide pavement provides two
travel lanes or one travel lane with two parking lanes. For
subcollectors, a twenty-eight-foot-wide pavement provides two
travel lanes and one parking lane. [Amended 12-1-2008 by Ord.
No. 2008-17]
(2) Additional street width and right-of-way may be required when
determined to be necessary by the Township in specific cases for:
(a) Public safety and convenience.
(b) Parking in commercial and industrial areas and in areas of
high-density development.
(c) Widening of existing streets where the width does not meet the
requirements of the above table.
(d) To accommodate installation of utilities, to accommodate
ponding of runoff, to provide storage of plowed snow, to
provide emergency parking, to accommodate temporary
roadway adjustments during maintenance and accidents and to
accommodate future improvements.
§ 173-25 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-25
144:352
(3) The applicant shall certify, prior to final approval of a subdivision or
land development plan, that title to any street rights-of-way are
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and that no prior rightof-
way has been granted to any utility or any other person.
(4) When the subdivision or land development is proposed to front on
an existing Township street, the required additional right-of-way
shall be dedicated for the lots or land development proposed, and
the dedication shall not be required for the remaining portion of
the property except where the remaining portion of the property is
less than one required lot width. The required right-of-way for all of
the property fronting the existing street shall be shown on the plan
and the signed dedicatory statement shall be shown on the final
plan.
(5) In the case of a plan for a land development fronting on an existing
or proposed public street, the Township may require the developer
to improve the portion of the roadway on which the proposed
development fronts to meet the minimum roadway standard as
specified above. This shall include shoulders, embankments,
gutters, berms, sidewalks and/or curbing.
D. Street design.
(1) Horizontal curves.
(a) Where connecting street lines deflect from each other at any
one point, the lines must be connected with a true, circular
curve. (See Table 3 for the minimum radius of the center line
for the curve.)
Table 3. Minimum Radius
Type of Street
Minimum Radius
(feet)
Collector 450
Subcollector and
nonresidential
250
Access 100
(b) Straight portions of the street must be tangent to the
beginning or ending of curves. Except for access streets, there
must be a tangent of at least 100 feet between reverse curves.
For curves on freeways, arterials and collector streets, proper
superelevation must be provided as required by the Township
and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Brokenback
curves shall be avoided.
(c) Proper sight distance must be provided with respect to
horizontal alignment, measured along the center line, from
height of eye (3.5 feet above grade) to the height of an object
§ 173-25 PLUMBING § 173-25
144:353

(b) Sight distance shall be measured along the center line, from
height of eye (3.5 feet) to height of an object on the roadway
(0.5 feet).
(3) Grades.
(a) The center-line grades of streets must meet the following
requirements: [Amended 12-1-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-17]
Table 6. Grades of Streets
Type of Street Minimum Grade Maximum Grade
Collector 1% 6%
Subcollector and
nonresidential
1% 8%
Access 1% 10%
(b) In all grades exceeding 1%, vertical curves must be used and
must be designed for proper sight distance.
(c) Crown. The slope of the crown on streets shall be at least 1/4
inch per foot but not more than 3/8 inch per foot as directed by
the Township Engineer. This applies only to straight sections of
road. Where a curve is superelevated to reduce lateral
vehicular acceleration as required by the design speed of the
road, the crown requirement is eliminated.
(d) Slope of embankments. Embankment slopes shall be a
maximum 3:1 fill and 2:1 cut or be designed in accordance with
Roadside Design Guide by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), current
edition. Slopes shall be suitably planted with perennial grasses
or other vegetation to prevent erosion.
E. Intersection design.
(1) Angle of intersections. Intersections must be as nearly at right
angles as possible. However, in no case should they deviate from
the standards in Table 7.

(2) Intersection grades. Intersections must be approached on all sides
by leveling areas. These leveling areas must have a minimum
length of 50 feet (measured from the intersection of the center
lines) within which no grade may exceed a maximum of 4%.
(3) Intersection curve radii.
(a) Design of curb or edge of pavement must take into account
such conditions as types of turning vehicles (including buses
and emergency vehicles), likely speeds of traffic, angle of turn,
number of lanes and whether parking is permitted. However,
curb or edge of pavement radii must not be less than the
following: [Amended 12-1-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-17]

than two streets shall be prohibited.
(6) Clear sight triangles.
(a) Proper sight lines must be maintained at all street
intersections. Measured along the center line of the street,
there shall be a clear sight triangle with sides in accordance
with Table 10. D is measured from the intersection of the street
center lines along the center line of each street. [Amended

for use and development as a recreation area.
(d) Recreation areas shall consist of one contiguous tract of land
with a minimum size of two acres.
(e) Site or sites necessary for public park use shall be suitable for
development as a particular type of park may warrant. The
Township will categorize park sites using the standards
established by the National Recreation and Parks Association,
as amended, and the Township's Park and Recreation Plan
[e.g., Park, Recreation, Open Space and Greenway Guidelines
(1996), Park Planning Guidelines (2000)].
(f) Applicants designing and developing public recreation areas

dedication, the applicant shall improve it (e.g., grading, topsoil
replacement, seeding, etc.) as near as possible to the condition
acceptable to the Township for use as public parkland.
E. Dedication of public recreational land to the Township.
§ 173-37 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-37
144:388
(1) The West Hanover Township Board of Supervisors shall determine
whether the land to be dedicated for public use is suitable for
public dedication and use. Prior to Board of Supervisor approval of
public recreation areas to be dedicated to the Township, the
Township Park and Recreation Board shall make its
recommendation in writing to the Board of Supervisors as whether
the dedication should be accepted by the Township based on the
following standards:
(a) Recreation land dedicated to the Township shall serve a valid
public purpose and shall be suitable for recreational purposes
by reason of size, shape, location topography and access.
(b) Recreation land dedicated to the Township shall meet the
recreation land criteria of § 173-37D(1) of this chapter and
other relevant recreational guidelines adopted by reference or
adopted by the Township in the West Hanover Township
Comprehensive Recreation, Park and Open Space Plan, as
amended.
(2) When the Board of Supervisors deems it to be in the public interest
to accept dedicated land, such acceptance shall be by means of a
signed resolution to which the property deed and description of the
dedicated recreation area shall be attached.
F. Private reservation of recreational land.
(1) As provided in § 173-37G of this chapter, the Board of Supervisors
may accept the private reservation of recreation areas as a
percentage of the required acreage of park and recreation land in
lieu of public land dedication. The private land set aside for these
purposes shall be suitable in size, dimensions and topography in
relation to the relation to the proposed use and shall meet all the
requirements of § 173-37D(1) of this chapter.
(2) The applicant shall satisfy to the Board of Supervisors that
adequate provisions are in place to assure permanent retention of
all parkland and that all future maintenance of such parkland or
common areas is appropriately addressed by the owner of the
property or a bona fide organization or by providing for and
establishing an organization responsible for the ownership and
maintenance of recreation areas.
(3) Such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose of the
private recreation area by sale or otherwise, except to an
organization conceived and established to own and maintain the
recreation area, without first offering to dedicate the same to the
Township.
G. Fee in lieu of public park and recreation land dedication.
§ 173-37 PLUMBING § 173-37
144:389
(1) In accordance with § 173-37B(2) and (3) of this chapter or upon
recommendation of the West Hanover Township Park and
Recreation Board, or where the Board of Supervisors agrees with
the applicant that because of size, shape, location, access,
topography or other physical features; or there is nonconformance
with the Township's Park and Recreation Plan; or that it is
impractical to dedicate recreation land to the Township or set aside
recreation land as required by this article, the Board of Supervisors
shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such land.
The fee in lieu of land dedication shall be based on the fair market
value (FMV) of improved buildable lots on the property. [Amended
5-3-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-05]
(2) Standards for determining the fair market value (FMV) of buildable
lots.
(a) Where a fee contribution is made in lieu of required land
dedication, the value or amount of such contributions shall be
based upon "fair market value" (FMV) of buildable residential
land at the time of the filing of the final plan with the Township
or the first final plan phase of a subdivision or land
development plan consisting of multiple phases. [Amended
5-3-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-05]
(b) The Board of Supervisors shall determine the "fair market
value" (FMV) based upon a written appraisal report prepared
by the developer or applicant and signed by an appraiser
licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
certified by such appraiser to be a fair and reasonable
appraisal of such land. The FMV appraisal report shall be
submitted with the final plan application. The appraisal shall
be made prior to the filing of the final plan or final plan phase.
However, in no case shall a FMV appraisal be conducted more
than 120 days from the date of plan submission to the
Township. If more than one year lapses from the filing of the
final plan, the applicant/developer shall submit a new
appraisal.
(c) Fair market value (FMV) shall be based upon an appraisal of a
buildable acre of land, where "buildable" is defined for this
purpose as a typical area of land within the subdivision or land
development with a slope of less than 7%, and not located in an
area subject to flooding, containing stormwater management
facilities, easements, or other similar environmental
restrictions; and as though approved utilities are present.
[Amended 5-3-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-05]
(d) In accordance with § 173-37G(2)(b) above, the approved FMV
for a buildable acre shall be adjusted with each phased final
plan submission to keep current with actual land value if the
subdivision and land development is planned in development
§ 173-37 WEST HANOVER CODE § 173-37
144:390
phases over multiple years as permitted by this chapter.
[Amended 5-3-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-05]
(e) The Township, upon the recommendation of the Board of
Supervisors, may refuse to accept any FMV appraisal from any
developer or applicant for good cause shown. If the applicant
or developer and the Township are unable to agree upon a
FMV appraisal, the appraisal shall be submitted to and
recertified by another professional appraiser licensed as such
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and chosen mutually by
the Township and the applicant or developer. The appraisal
certified by the second appraiser shall be presumed fair and
reasonable and shall be the final FMV appraisal. In the event
that a second appraiser is chosen, fees for the services of said
appraisal shall be paid equally by the Township and the
applicant or developer. [Amended 5-3-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-05]
(3) Determining the amount of fee in lieu of land dedication. The
amount of fee to be paid in lieu of dedication of land shall be based
on the results of the applicant's FMV appraisal report and the
following formula, where "N" equals the required number of acres
of parkland as per § 173-37C of this chapter: [Amended 5-3-2010
by Ord. No. 2010-05]
"N" x (FMV of one buildable acre) = Fee
Examples:
SF Residential Development with 72 homes on 72 lots
(4.32 acres required) x (FMV per acre of $25,000) = $108,000
MF Residential with 48 units
(2.88 acres) x (FMV per acre of $25,000) = $72,000
(4) Any fees authorized under this subsection shall, upon its receipt by
the Township, be deposited in an interest bearing account, clearly
identifying the specific recreation facilities for which the fee was
received. Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of
that account. Fees-in-lieu of public park and recreation land shall
be paid in one lump sum prior to recording the phase of the final
plan for which the fees are calculated. Funds from such accounts
shall be expended only in properly allocable portions of the cost to
construct the specific recreation facilities for which the funds were
collected.
(5) Upon request of any person who paid any fee under this subsection,
the Township shall refund such fee, plus interest accumulated
thereon from the date of payment, if the Township has failed to
utilize the fee paid for the purposes set forth in this section.
[Amended 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-07]
§ 173-37 PLUMBING § 173-37
144:391
H. Use of fee-in-lieu of public park and recreation land dedication. Upon
agreement by the applicant, the Township may accept fees-in-lieu of
public or private park and recreation land dedication. See Exhibit
XIII.117 The fees paid from the subdivision and/or land development
should be used for recreational purposes, which are reasonably
accessible to the inhabitants of the development that is the source of
the fees-in-lieu of land dedication. In addition, if determined by the
Board of Supervisors that the neighborhood area for which the fees
were collected is adequately served by recreation land and facilities,
the fees may be used for: [Amended 5-21-2018 by Ord. No.
2018-06; 8-20-2018 by Ord. No. 2018-07]

preliminary plan stages of the plan review process.
(2) The transfer of all land to be dedicated or reserved shall be
concluded immediately following final plan approval or approval of
the first final phase of a subdivision or land development plan
consisting of multiple phases. On the approved final plan, or the
approved first final plan phase of a subdivision or land development
plan consisting of multiple phases, the applicant shall include an
irrevocable statement of dedication guaranteeing that the required
park and recreation land described on the subdivision will be
dedicated to the Township.
(3) Where land dedication or private reserves are required, the
proposed deed(s) or dedication shall include the legal description
of the area and shall be submitted to the Township Solicitor for
review and approval during the final plan review process. Title to
the land to be dedicated shall be good and marketable and free of
all liens and encumbrances, construction debris, or other defects.
Following the approval by the Solicitor of the legal documents
related to the land dedication and all other aspects of the plan, the
Board shall accept the land dedication and approve the final
subdivision and land development and proceed with the recording
of the plan.
(4) Fees to be paid in lieu of land dedication and any other combination
of fees and agreed-upon recreational facility improvements shall be
agreed to in writing prior to final plan approval or approval of the
first final plan phase of a subdivision or land development plan
consisting of multiple phases. If the fees are to be paid in phases by

144:396
(3) The subdivision shall be designed to preserve existing native trees
and vegetation along roadways, property lines and lines occurring
within a site such as streams, swales, stone fences and hedgerows.
Such lines and the native vegetation associated with them shall be
preserved as buffers between adjacent properties and between
areas being subdivided within a property. Preservation shall
include ground, shrub, understory and canopy vegetation.
(4) Trees, with a caliper of six inches or more as measured at a height
of 41/2 feet above existing grade, shall not be removed unless they
are located:
(a) Within the proposed cartway or sidewalk portion of the street
right-of-way.
(b) A distance of 25 feet within the foundation area of a proposed

(6) In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level shall be
maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb trees.
(7) No clearing or earth disturbance (except for soil analysis for
proposed sewage disposal systems) shall be permitted on a site
before the completion of subdivision and land development
agreements. The determination of sight distance along roadways
shall be made graphically and not by clearing on-site prior to final
plan approval.
(8) During construction, no clearing shall be permitted on a site
beyond that minimally necessary for the specific construction
activity to be undertaken.
(9) Areas of a site which are to be preserved and areas which do not

vehicular and pedestrian circulation, including the avoidance of
unessential intersections with major public streets.
(4) Thoughtful and innovative design to create an attractive
community.
B. There shall be no minimum or maximum requirements for length of
blocks, except that the length(s) proposed shall not result in
inappropriate traffic patterns, unnecessary disturbance to topography
or other natural constraints, or any other conditions deemed
unsatisfactory and/or unsafe by the Township.
C. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two tiers
of lots, except where reverse frontage lots are required along a major
public street, or where prevented by the size, topographical conditions
or other inherent conditions of property, in which case the Township
may approve a single tier of lots.
A. Environmental self-sufficiency. Each new dwelling created within the
Township shall be individually self-sufficient for both water supply and
sewage disposal.
B. General standards.
(1) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate to the
type of development and use contemplated. The average length to
width ratio for new lots shall be no greater than 4 to 1. Regarding
flag lots, only the "flag" area and not the "pole" portion shall be
required to meet this standard. Flag lots are not permitted except
in accordance with § 195-88L of Chapter 195, Zoning.
(2) Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
public street lines or radial to curved public street lines.

space for a well and on-site sewage disposal, on-site parking,
loading and unloading, setbacks and landscaping as required by
Chapter 195, Zoning.
(5) If, after subdividing, there exist substandard remnants of land, they
shall be incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to
public use, if acceptable to the Township. Agreements dedicating
such remnants of land shall be approved by the Township Solicitor.
C. Lot frontage.
(1) Minimum lot frontage, width and area shall be controlled by the
provisions of Chapter 195, Zoning.
(2) All lots shall have direct access or access held in fee simple to a
public or private street and shall have frontage as required by
provisions of Chapter 195, Zoning.
(3) Lots utilizing driveways shall, in general, not have direct vehicular
access onto freeway, highway, arterial or collector streets. Reverse
frontage lots shall be used, wherever practical, along such streets
in order to limit traffic hazards and to provide for the efficient
movement of traffic.
(4) Double or reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where
required to prevent access onto arterial and collector streets or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography.
D. Building setback lines. The minimum building setback lines shall be in
accordance with Chapter 195, Zoning, and the applicable sections of
this chapter.
E. Private streets. The subdivision of lots with access on private streets is
prohibited unless the private street conforms to the standards and

A transportation impact study shall be submitted regarding subdivision and
land developments which meet the following criteria:
§ 173-68. Preparation of study by engineer.
The study shall be prepared by a professional engineer registered in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania with sufficient prior traffic study
experience to qualify the engineer to perform the study and render any
opinions and recommendations set forth therein.
§ 173-69. Study area boundaries.
Study area boundaries shall be determined in accordance with the
publication referenced in § 173-70 and through discussion with the
Township Planning Commission and Township Engineer. A pre-study
conference between the applicant's traffic engineer and the Township is
encouraged.
A. To identify the adequacy of the existing transportation network and
potential impacts on the proposed subdivision and/or land
development.
B. To determine roadway improvements necessary to mitigate any impacts
resulting from the development.
A. Residential: involving 25 or more dwelling units.
B. Nonresidential: involving 100 or more new peak-hour trips.
C. Preapplication meeting: The Township Engineer may determine that a
traffic study or narrative is needed to demonstrate that the existing
traffic generated from the site will not require a modification of the
existing transportation network.
D. Other: whenever the Planning Commission or Board of Supervisors
shall find that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the existing
transportation network may be inadequate to handle the volume or
character of traffic likely to result from the proposed subdivision or
land development.

applicable. If school crossings are to be used, pedestrian volumes
shall be assigned to each crossing. Any characteristics of the site
that will cause particular trip generation problems shall be noted.
(3) Background growth and projected traffic from adjacent land
development shall be included in the projection of future traffic.
E. Transportation impacts.
(1) The study area roadway network is to be analyzed for safety and
capacity sufficiency for future network conditions without the
proposed development and future network conditions with the
proposed development. For each of these conditions, the following
analyses shall be completed:
(a) Mainline ADT volumes and turning movement volumes for all
key intersections within the study area will be determined for
the a.m. peak hours, p.m. peak hour and the proposed
development peak hours, if other than either the a.m. or p.m.
peak hours of the network.
(b) The effectiveness of the traffic signal control at all key
intersections will be evaluated by approach in terms of vehicle
stops and delays.
(c) Gap studies will be conducted at the proposed site access
points to evaluate the need for signal control, turn prohibitions
§ 173-70 PLUMBING § 173-70

§ 173-71. Final report.
A final report must be prepared to document the results of the traffic
impact study and the recommended improvements to accommodate the
projected traffic due to the proposed development. An executive summary
which provides a concise description of the study area, results of the
traffic analyses and any recommended improvements will be provided.
The presentation of data and analyses results should be accomplished on
or additional site access points to reduce the left-turn volume
from the site driveway(s).
(d) Queue length studies will be completed to evaluate the
potential for a backup of traffic from controlled intersections
which could impact other intersections including access points
to the proposed development.
(e) An analysis of the volume and capacity of the network and all
key intersections will be conducted utilizing the most current
Highway Capacity Manual procedures. Levels of service will be
determined and documented.
(2) The analysis of the future conditions without the proposed
development will document the adequacy of the study area network
to accommodate the traffic in the design year(s) without the
proposed development. This analysis must include a full
consideration of all committed roadway improvements to the study
area network when determining the expected levels of service.
(3) The analysis of the future conditions with the proposed
development will document the impacts created as a result of the
development.
F. Conclusions and recommended improvements. Levels of service for all
roadway segments and key intersections shall be presented in tabular
and graphic form. All roadway segments and/or key intersections
showing a level of service below D for roadway segments, signalized
intersections and unsignalized intersections shall be considered
deficient, and specific recommendations for the elimination of these
deficiencies shall be listed. This listing of recommended improvements
shall include but not be limited to the following elements: internal
circulation design, site access location and design, external roadway
and intersection design and improvements, traffic signal installation
and operation and transit design improvements. All physical roadway
improvements shall be shown on the preliminary plan. Existing and/or
future improvement transportation service shall also be addressed. For
each recommended improvement, a schematic drawing of existing and
proposed conditions, as well as a narrative description of the
improvement, including the cost and funding method of the
improvement and the implementation schedule for the improvement,
will be provided.

the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice. If
the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable
rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall
constitute a separate violation, unless the District Justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that
there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership or
corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was
no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have
been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of
the determination of a violation by the District Justice and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.
(3) The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of
stay, upon cause shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a

an employee who files an exemption certificate in the following
circumstances:
(a) If instructed to do so by the Township;
(b) If notified by the employee that he is no longer eligible for the
exemption;
(c) If the employer pays the employee equal to or in excess of
$12,000 for the calendar year.
(2) If any of the circumstances listed above are met, the employer will
collect the local services tax from the previously exempted
employee for the remainder of that calendar year. The employer
shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after the
individual's earned income level causes him/her to be subject to the
tax, a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not
withheld from the individual due to the exemption plus the prorated
per payroll amount due for that first pay period. The amount
of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods
in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld in the
same manner as other nonexempt employees.
I. Tax obligation when exempt employee's employment is severed. In the
event the employment of an individual who was exempt and becomes
subject to the local services tax is subsequently severed in that calendar
year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of the tax
due and the Township may pursue collection of the tax.

from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December
31.
§ 178-6. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation.
A. Each individual who shall have more than one occupation within the
Township of West Hanover shall be subject to the payment of this tax on
his principal occupation, and his principal employer shall deduct this
tax and deliver to him evidence of deduction on a form to be furnished
to the employer by the Township of West Hanover, which form shall be
evidence of deduction having been made and, when presented to any
other employer, shall be authority for such employer not to deduct this
tax from the employee's wages, but shall, nevertheless, require the
employer to include such employee on his return of taxes and shall
require the employer to set forth his name and address, and the name
and account number of the employer who deducted this tax.
B. In the event that a person is engaged in more than one occupation, or
an occupation which requires his working in more than one political
subdivision during the calendar year, and thereby subjects the
employee to the possibility of payment of multiple local services taxes,
the priority of claim to collect such local services tax shall be in the
following order; first, the political subdivision in which a person
maintains his principal office or is principally employed; second, the
political subdivision in which the person resides and works, if such a tax
is levied by that political subdivision; and third, the political subdivision
in which a person is employed and which imposes the tax nearest in
miles to the person's home. The place of employment shall be
determined as of the day the taxpayer first becomes subject to the tax
during the calendar year. It is the intent of this provision that no person
shall pay more than $52 in local services taxes in any calendar year,
irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which such
person may be employed within any given calendar year. In case of
dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for a disputed calendar
year, declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment, shall
constitute prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.
C. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the local services tax if the employee provides a recent pay
statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the
employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the local
services tax withheld, and a statement from the employee that the pay
statement is from the employee's principal employer and the employee
will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment
within two weeks of its occurrence on uniform forms developed by the
Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development.

of any type or kind, or engage in any occupation or profession, within West
Hanover Township do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject

shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or the
employee for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 178-9. Administration of tax.

tax of the Township of West Hanover to accept and receive payments of
this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by
him from each employer or self-employed person, together with the
date the tax was received.
B. The agent for the collection of the local services tax is hereby charged
with the administration and enforcement of this article, and is hereby
charged and empowered to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and
regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and

payroll records of any employer subject to this article, the examination
and correction of any return made in compliance with this article, and
any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which
overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the agent for the collection of the local
services tax shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas
of Dauphin County, as in other cases provided.
C. The agent for the collection of the local services tax, or his duly
authorized representative or agent, is hereby authorized to examine the

accuracy of any return of taxes made by an employer or, if no return
was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed
and required to give the agent for the collection of the local services

payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the local
services tax or for the payment of the withheld tax money to a political

employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. The employer shall also not be liable for payment of the local
services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the

144:443
§ 178-16. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax

tax.
§ 178-17. Excluded transactions.
A. Every person who makes, executes, delivers, accepts or presents for
recording any document or in whose behalf any document is made,
executed, delivered, accepted or presented for recording shall be

P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq., so that if any other political subdivision
shall impose or hereafter shall impose such tax on the same person or
transfer then the tax levied by West Hanover Township under the
authority of that Act shall, during the time such duplication of the tax
exists, except as hereinafter otherwise provided, be 1/2 of the rate and
such 1/2 rate shall become effective without any action on the part of
West Hanover Township; provided, however, that West Hanover
Township and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on
the same person or transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their
respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided, they will impose
respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the Local Tax Enabling Act.
D. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate in
effect at the time the tax is due shall be added and collected.
A. The tax imposed by § 178-15 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth, or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions, by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings, or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
§ 178-15 WEST HANOVER CODE § 178-17

year from the date of condemnation.

taxing under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife; between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce; between parent
and child or the spouse of such child; between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister; and between a grandparent and

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.

ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of

granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.
(9) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from a trustee to a
beneficiary of an ordinary trust.
(10) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration from trustee to

(11) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration between principal
and agent or straw party; or from or to an agent or straw party
where, if the agent or straw party were his principal, no tax would
be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from, or for the benefit
of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.

record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the

grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary purpose
of manufacturing, fabricating compounding, processing,

conversion, energy production, pollution control, warehousing or
agriculture; and the agency or authority has the full ownership
interest in the real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.

persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax-exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, [68A Stat. 3, 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3)] and which has as its

gas or minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation
of the reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

ownership interest in the company, however effected, if the changed
does not affect the continuity of the company; and of itself or together
with prior changes has the effect of transferring, directly or indirectly,
90% or more of the total ownership interest in the company within a
period of three years.
B. With respect to real estate acquired after February 16, 1986, a family
farm corporation is an acquired company when, because of voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, it ceases to be a family farm corporation or
when, because of issuance or transfer of stock or because of acquisition
or transfer of assets that are devoted to the business of agriculture, it
fails to meet the minimum requirements of a family farm corporation
under this article.

claim, lien, judgment, estate or costs of the sale and of the writ upon which
the sale is made except the state realty transfer tax, and the sheriff or other
officer conducting said sale shall pay the tax herein imposed out of the first

residential development that do not impact agricultural lands or create
further sprawling patterns of development. The district is located adjacent

ARTICLE IXA
R-3 Cluster Overlay (R-3CO)
[Added 4-3-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-03]
§ 195-44.1. Purpose.
The Comprehensive Plan recognizes that maintaining open spaces and
providing public parks and recreation land is important and desirable in
enhancing the Township's rural character and quality of life. The intent
of this article is to provide for modifications to certain use, design and
dimensional requirements of the R-3 District and open space residential and
nonresidential development standards and other standards of this chapter
and the movement (i.e., clustering) of residential development rights (i.e.,
dwelling units) from an adjacent district in the development area of the
subject property, to be located on the R-3 District portion of the
development area of the subject property, so as to facilitate the creation of
larger areas of open space in exchange for land to be offered for dedication
to the Township for public parks and recreation land, which will improve
living, working and natural environments; promote more efficient
subdivision and land development design; encourage a variety of residential
dwelling types; promote ingenuity and originality in total subdivision and
site design; preserve open space; and promote public parks and recreation
land.
§ 195-44.2. Relationship to other requirements.
The provisions, regulations, limitations and restrictions of this article shall
supersede all provisions, regulations, limitations and restrictions of this
chapter and Chapter 173, Subdivision and Land Development, that are in
conflict with the provisions, regulations, limitations and restrictions set
forth in this article. To the extent that a provision, regulation, limitation
or restriction is not specifically referenced in or regulated by this article,
then the applicable provisions, regulations, limitations and restrictions of
this chapter and of Chapter 173, as applicable, shall govern.
§ 195-44.3. Optional overlay.
While the R-3CO confers additional development options to be used at the
discretion of the applicant, any subject property located within the R-3CO
may be developed in accordance with either the regulations of the R-3CO or
the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Although the R-3CO does
not in any manner remove or alter the rights permitted by the underlying
zoning district, the use of one or more of the R-3CO development provisions
requires compliance with all applicable R-3CO requirements.
§ 195-44.4. Applicability.
A. Except as modified by this article, the open space standards of Article
XVII shall apply to subdivisions or land developments. Pursuant to
submission of a unified development plan submitted as part of the
§ 195-44.1 PLUMBING § 195-44.4
144:603
§ 195-44.5. General requirements.
preliminary plan, an R-3 cluster development is permitted by right in
the R-3CO, provided that the R-3 cluster development must be:
(1) Located on a subject property containing at least 100 contiguous
acres of undeveloped land (NOTE: For purposes of the R-3CO,
"undeveloped land" shall specifically include land with not more
than three single-family detached buildings and accessory
buildings.) on the effective date of this article;
(2) Located on a subject property, within at least two zoning districts,
within West Hanover Township, and one of which must be the R-3
District, on the effective date of this article;
(3) Located on a subject property with the R-3 District portion located
within a designated growth area or expansion area as depicted on a
Comprehensive Plan on the effective date of this article;
(4) Located on a subject property with frontage along and having at
least one point of access onto a state road on the effective date of
this article; and
(5) Connected or to be connected to public water and public sewer.
B. The requirements of this article do not apply to the areas of the subject
property that are not located in the development area. Therefore, the
applicable zoning district use and development requirements shall
govern these areas.
A. Required public park and recreation land.
(1) The minimum amount of land required to be offered for dedication
to the Township as public park and recreational land as part of the
R-3 cluster development shall:
(a) Be 40% of the gross acreage of the development area;
(b) Be open to the public; and
(c) Satisfy the total amount of any parkland, recreation or open
space land required by Chapter 173, Subdivision and Land
Development, or this chapter, notwithstanding any other
Township provision.
(2) Public park and recreation land shall be permitted to be located on
any portion of the development area. While a minimum of 65% of
the dedicated parkland must be located in the Township, the
remaining portion of the dedicated parkland may include land in a
contiguous municipality, provided such land is contiguous with land
being dedicated to West Hanover Township and is deed-restricted,
appropriately recorded at the County Recorder of Deeds Office, to
§ 195-44.4 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-44.5
144:604
permanently maintain such land as parkland, recreation space or
open space land, and is open to the public.
(3) The required public park and recreation land must be offered for
dedication to the Township. By affirmatively selecting the optional
R-3CO option, the applicant waives its right to pay a fee in lieu of
dedication. The required public park and recreation land shall be
included in the initial phase of any phased project and offered for
dedication contemporaneously with the recording of the Phase 1
final plan.
B. Residential dwelling units and related residential density.
(1) Prohibition of dwelling units from being developed on the portions

portions of the development area not located in the R-3 District, no
residential dwelling units shall be permitted to be located,
developed or constructed on the portions of the development area
not located in the R-3 District. All of the residential dwelling units
shall be restricted from being located, developed or constructed on
the portions of the development area not located in the R-3 District
via a deed restriction appropriately recorded at the County

District. All of the residential dwelling units permitted to be
calculated on the portions of the development area not located in
the R-3 District, and that are restricted from being located,
developed or constructed on the portions of the development area
not located in the R-3 District, shall be permitted to be located,
developed and constructed on the R-3 District portions of the
development area. This article specifically authorizes the
clustering (i.e., movement) of residential development rights from
an adjacent district in the development area to be located on the
R-3 District portion of the development area. The residential
development rights (i.e., dwelling units) shall not be permitted to
be located on any of the portions of the development area not
located in the R-3 District. In other words, the residential density
(i.e., development rights) of the development area can only be
clustered, located, developed and constructed on the R-3 District
portions of the development area.
(3) Notwithstanding any other Township provision, if residential
development rights (i.e., dwelling units) are moved from, and
prohibited on, the portions of the development area not located in
§ 195-44.5 PLUMBING § 195-44.5
144:605
§ 195-44.6. Specific district requirements.
the R-3 District as set forth in this article, nonresidential uses,
buildings and structures shall be permitted to be located on these
non-R-3 District portions of the development area in accordance
with this article.
(4) Density or development rights cannot be transferred into the
Township from any land part of the development area that is
located outside of the Township.
C. Slopes greater than 25%. Notwithstanding any other Township
provision, up to 40% of the land within the development area with
slopes greater than 25% shall be permitted by right to be removed or
altered. The slopes greater than 25% that are removed or altered shall
not be included in the calculation of the area of the Environmental
Overlay Districts as set forth in § 195-86C(2). To demonstrate
compliance with this section, as part of the unified development plan
submitted as part of the preliminary plan, the applicant shall prepare
an exhibit depicting the areas of the development area with slopes
greater than 25% that are to be removed or altered.
D. Stream and wetland crossings.
(1) Notwithstanding any other Township provision, streams and
drainageways shall be permitted by right to be crossed by utilities
and infrastructure, including transmission lines, pipelines, bridges,
culverts, roadways, roadway rights-of-way and roadway
approaches, and subject to the unified development plan. Such
crossings should be as perpendicular as practicable to the natural
stream alignment.
(2) Notwithstanding any other Township provision, all stream or
wetland crossings require federal or state encroachment permits
or waivers of such permits by the responsible federal or state

Floodplain Overlay District
§ 195-70. General provisions. [Amended 7-17-2000 by Ord. No.
2000-7; 9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act of 1978,228 delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of West Hanover Township does
hereby order as follows.
B. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to prevent the loss of life and
property, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of
commerce and governmental services, the extraordinary and
unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief
and the impairment of the tax base by:
(1) Regulating uses, activities and development which, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future use, activities and
development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights,
velocities and frequencies.
(2) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
(3) Minimizing danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(4) Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur
in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against
flooding and flood damage.
(5) Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(6) Complying with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
C. Applicability. Those provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of West Hanover Township and shown as being located
within the boundaries of any identified floodplain district which are
considered as part of the Official Zoning Map.
D. Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged or structurally altered except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this chapter and any other applicable
228. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 195-70 PLUMBING § 195-70
144:637
§ 195-71. Establishment of floodplain districts. [Amended 9-4-2012
by Ord. No. 2012-18]
ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the jurisdiction
of this chapter.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provision of this article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted
by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside any identified
floodplain area or that land uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages.
F. This article shall not create liability on the part of West Hanover
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
G. This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be
in effect in identified floodplain areas, unless conflicting provisions are
more restrictive, in which case the more restrictive shall prevail.
H. Identification.
(1) The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of West Hanover
Township classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated August 2, 2012, and issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most
recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part
of the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted by West Hanover
Township and declared to be part of the chapter.
I. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this section shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the ordinance, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this section are hereby declared to be
severable.
A. Floodway Area: the area identified as floodway in the FIS and FIRM
(Flood Insurance Rate Map dated August 2, 2012) which represents the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any
point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
§ 195-70 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-71
144:638
special floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the
FIS. Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood heights
shall be prohibited. No new construction or development shall be
allowed, unless a permit is first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office, prior to any Township
approvals or permits.
B. Special Floodplain Area: the area identified as Zones AE and A1-30 in
the FIS which is subject to inundation by the one-percent-annualchance
flood event determined by detailed methods and has base flood
elevations (BFEs) shown. No new construction or development shall be
located within a minimum distance measured 50 feet landward from the
top-of-bank of any watercourse. In Special Floodplain Areas without a
designated floodway, no new development shall be permitted unless it
can be demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and projected
development will not increase the BFE by more than one foot.
C. Approximate Floodplain Area: the areas identified as Zone A in the FIS
which are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood
event determined using approximate methodologies. Because detailed
hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs or flood depths
are shown.
(1) No new construction or development shall be located within a
minimum distance measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank
of any watercourse. When available, information from other
federal, state, and other acceptable sources shall be used to
determine the BFE, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no
other information is available, the BFE shall be determined by
using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area
which is nearest the construction site in question.
(2) In lieu of floodplain areas as identified on the current FIS maps, the
municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation
with hydrology and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualification, who shall certify
that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by West Hanover Township.
D. Shallow Flooding Area: the areas identified as Zones AO and AH in the
FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by one-percent-annualchance
shallow flooding where average depths are between one foot
and three feet. Drainage paths shall be established to guide floodwaters
around and away from structures on slopes.
E. Overlay concept.
(1) The floodplain areas described above shall be overlay districts to
the existing underlying districts as shown on the Zoning Map, and
§ 195-71 PLUMBING § 195-71
144:639
§ 195-72. District provisions.
as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as a
supplement to the underlying district provisions.
(2) Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any of the floodplain districts and those of any
underlying district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
F. Zoning Map. The boundaries of the floodplain districts are established
as incorporated into the West Hanover Township Zoning Map. Refer to
Article III, Designation of Districts, §§ 195-11 and 195-12B.
G. District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
districts may be revised by the Board of Supervisors where natural or
man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, a river basin commission or other qualified agency or
individual documents the need or possibility for such changes.
However, prior to any such changes, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, the
applicant providing such data shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data (LOMR submission).
H. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Floodplain Administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.
A. General provisions.
(1) All uses, activities and development occurring within any floodplain
district shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the
provisions of this article, Chapter 108, Floodplain Management,
and with all other applicable codes and ordinances, such as
Chapter 14, Section 1403.6, Flood resistance, Chapter 16, Section
1612, Flood Loads, Appendix G, Flood-Resistant Construction,
International Building Code 2003, or such successor code which
may be duly adopted by the Township, and Chapter 173,
Subdivision and Land Development. [Amended 9-5-2006 by Ord.
No. 2005-8; 9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18]
(2) Under no circumstances shall any uses, activity and/or
development adversely affect the capacity of the channels or
floodway of any watercourse, drainage ditch or any other drainage
facility or system.
(3) Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream,
watercourse, etc., within the municipality, permits shall first be
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
§ 195-71 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-72
144:640
Regional Office, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers,
if necessary. Further, notification of the proposal shall be given
to all affected adjacent municipalities. Copies of such notification
shall be forwarded to both FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department
of Community and Economic Development prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse. No encroachment, alteration,
or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede
the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse in any way and a
conditional use hearing is held before the Board of Supervisors.
[Amended 9-4-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-18]
(4) The applicant shall be required to submit technical or scientific
data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR) within six months
of the completion of any new construction, development, or other
activity resulting in changes in the BFE. [Added 9-4-2012 by Ord.

§ 195-78. Purpose. [Amended 9-5-2006 by Ord. No. 2005-8]
The Comprehensive Plan has provided an inventory of important natural
and cultural features that include wetlands, floodplains, watersheds,
streams, soils, historic sites and buildings. The Township recognizes the
interrelationship between its natural resources and the health, safety and
general welfare of the community. The Township also recognizes that these
resources have a major role in the quality of life in the community and must
be protected, maintained and preserved for future generations. Recognizing
that the Comprehensive Plan promotes the preservation and protection of
these important features, this article provides appropriate standards and
regulations for the following purposes:

The Comprehensive Plan identifies and recognizes streams and the natural
areas around them as important hydrological and environmental assets. It
is the intent of this section to provide appropriate standards for delineating
and preserving natural and man-made waterways. These regulations are
provided to protect wildlife; reduce exposure to high water and flood
hazards; preserve existing vegetation along waterways; minimize the
negative effects on waterways from agriculture and development related
erosion; minimize scenic degradation; and protect water quality by
reducing and cleaning stormwater runoff. An SPOD is hereby established as
a district which overlays other zoning districts of this chapter.
A. To protect drainageways and streams from development impacts.
B. To minimize negative impacts from development on hillside and slope
areas.
C. To protect water features from development impacts.
D. To preserve prime agriculture soils.
E. To protect existing wooded areas.
F. To minimize wetland impacts.
G. To preserve water quality.
H. To enhance water infiltration.
A. Establishment of district boundaries. The SPOD shall consist of a land
strip on each side of a watercourse. (See Illustration 16.233) The SPOD
boundary shall be based on an investigation of critical environmental
features that are related to the watercourse. The total extent of the
233. Editor's Note: Illustration 16 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 195-78 PLUMBING § 195-79
144:651
critical areas adjacent to the watercourse shall be considered in
determining boundaries of the SPOD. Where critical areas do not exist,
a minimum buffer of at least 50 feet on each side of the watercourse
shall be established.
B. Determining the critical areas. The total extent of the critical areas
adjacent to the watercourse shall be considered in determining the
boundaries of the SPOD. Critical areas include the following:

purpose of this chapter, these areas are considered hydrologically
related to the watercourse.
(2) Hydric soils. All hydric soils immediately adjacent to or bordering
within 50 feet of the watercourse. For the purpose of this chapter,
these areas are considered hydrologically related to the
watercourse.
(3) Steep slopes. Where the base of a steep slope is 50 feet or less from
the watercourse, the critical area shall extend to the top of the
steep slope(s) or ravine plus an additional 20 feet of moderate or
lesser slope.
(4) Wooded areas. Where forested land having a predominance of trees
of four-inch caliper or greater exists within 50 feet of the
watercourse, the SPOD boundary will include wooded areas within
100 feet from the watercourse.
C. Permitted uses. The following shall be permitted uses in the SPOD,
provided that they are in compliance with the provisions of the
underlying district and are not prohibited by another ordinance, and
provided that they do not require building(s), fill or storage of materials
and equipment:

§ 195-80. Hillside and Slope Protection Overlay District (HSPOD).
The Comprehensive Plan recognizes steep slopes and hillsides as unique
areas. Slope areas are fragile and susceptible to erosion, landslides,
mudslides, degradation of their natural vegetation and increased flooding
using conventional development practices. It is the intent of this section
to provide reasonable standards for hillside development that guide
development away from steep areas; minimize grading and other site
preparation in steep areas; provide safe means for ingress and egress
while minimizing scarring from hillside construction; preserve the natural
conditions in steep areas; and prevent flooding and the deteriorating effects
of erosion to streams and drainage areas. An HSPOD is hereby established
as a district which overlays other zoning districts of this chapter.

§ 195-82. Wetland Protection Overlay District (WPOD). [Amended
7-6-1999 by Ord. No. 1999-10]
The Comprehensive Plan recognizes wetland areas as indispensable and
fragile hydrological natural resources that provide habitat for fish, wildlife
and vegetation; water-quality maintenance and pollution control; flood
control; erosion control; open space; scientific study opportunities; and
recreational opportunities. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens
public safety and the general welfare. Because of their importance,
wetlands are to be protected from negative impacts by development and
other activities. It is the intent of this section to require planning to avoid
and minimize damage of wetlands whenever prudent or feasible; require
that activities not dependent upon wetlands be located to other upland
sites; and allow wetland losses through proper mitigation only where all
practical or legal measures have been applied to reduce these losses that
are unavoidable and in the public interest. A WPOD is hereby established as
a district which overlays other zoning districts of this chapter.
(2) At least 70% of the shoreline buffer area shall remain in its natural
state as open space.
(3) The LPPOD shall be established at the time of subdivision or land
development or the application for a zoning permit if there is no
subdivision or land development proposed.
(4) In all subdivision and land development applications, the LPPOD
shall be described by metes and bounds. A conservation easement
covering the LPPOD shall be provided in accordance with Chapter
173, Subdivision and Land Development.

drawing indicating the location and measurements of the district in
accordance with the above standards.
A. Establishment of WPOD. The WPOD shall apply to all lands in or within
50 feet of a nontidal wetland or mitigated wetlands located within the
Township. (See Illustration 16.237) The WPOD shall be based on a
wetland investigation by the applicant. The environmental limitations
map of the Comprehensive Plan may be used as a guide for determining
the general location of wetlands. Wetland delineations shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures of the PADEP as specified
in the Federal Manual of Identifying and Delineating Jurisdictional
Wetlands and any subsequent amendments thereto. Wetland mitigation
shall be permitted. Wetland mitigation shall be approved by PADEP.

Density Calculation
Example
Site:
A one-hundred-acre farm with small wooded stream
running through property is located in the Low-Density
Residential District (R-1). The property owner plans to
subdivide the farm for residential housing. The
following steps are used to determine the maximum
number of permitted lots for this property in the R-1
District.
STEP 1 Take total tract area, subtract any area applicable under
the Environmental Protection Overlay District (EPOD).
In this case, areas applicable under EPOD total 10 acres.

D. Minimum lot size calculation. The minimum lot size in an open space
subdivision or land development shall be determined using the
following calculation. (See Illustration 18). [Amended 9-5-2006 by
Ord. No. 2005-8]
(1) Determine the total area of the tract.
(2) Subtract the total area of the floodplain district (Article XV) and
Environmental Overlay Districts (Article XVI) to determine
remaining tract area.
(3) Subtract the required conservation features percentage in
accordance with § 195-86B from the total tract area to determine
remaining tract area.
(4) Divide the remaining tract area by the total number of lots
determined by the density calculation in § 195-86B.
Illustration 18
Minimum Lot Size Calculation
Site: One-hundred-acre farm with small wooded stream
running through property located in the Low-Density
Residential District (R-1). Property owner wishes to
subdivide farm for residential housing. Owner has
completed a density calculation (§ 195-86B) which
determined the maximum number of permitted lots
(162). Since the proposed subdivision involves four or
more lots [(§ 195-84A(1)], an area of permanent open
space is required [(§ 195-86A(3)]. When open space is
required, to achieve the potential for the same number
of lots as determined by the density calculation, in this
case 162 lots, a reduced lot size is permitted. This is
done by calculating the minimum lot size.
STEP 1 Take total tract area, subtract any area applicable under
Environmental Protection Overlay District (EPOD), and
subtract the amount of land required for open space
in accordance with the zoning district in which the
property is located. In this case, the required open space
for the R-1 District is 35% of the total tract area. The
number of acres after subtracting becomes the
remaining tract area.

§ 195-121. Purpose.
The Township recognizes that the process of development alters natural
topography and vegetation. Development creates impervious cover and
artificial light that can have a negative effect on the ecological balance
and visual character of an area by causing increases in air temperatures,
acceleration of runoff, erosion and sedimentation process, glare and noise
and incompatibilities of land uses. The Township intends to protect its
economic base and quality of life through the preservation and
enhancement of the unique natural beauty, environment and native plant
communities located within its boundaries. Recognizing that the
Comprehensive Plan promotes the protection of health, safety and welfare
of the public and encourages quality development, the Township declares
that this article is adopted for the following specific purposes, to:
§ 195-122. Buffering.250
Buffer yards required by this section are intended to separate different
land uses from each other and are intended to eliminate and/or minimize
nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare, signs, unsightly buildings or
parking areas, and to provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise,
A. Aid in stabilizing the environment's ecological balance within the
Township.
B. Provide buffering and visual screening between uses of different
character.
C. Enhance the Township's appearance.
D. Safeguard and enhance land values and protect public and private
investments.
E. Conserve energy.
F. Protect native plant communities, thereby supporting the ecosystem
and providing habitats for a variety of wildlife.
G. Allow for creativity in providing for buffering, landscaping and
screening.
H. Complement the existing Tree and Vegetation Preservation Ordinance
contained in Chapter 173, Subdivision and Land Development.

ARTICLE XX
Performance Standards
§ 195-127. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to provide appropriate standards relating
to the operation of commercial, industrial and residential uses throughout
the Township. Such operations and uses may create such excessive air
pollution, electromagnetic interference, fire and explosive hazards, glare,
heat, light, noise, odor, outdoor storage and waste disposal, vibration and
water pollution, as a deterrent to public health, comfort, convenience,
safety and welfare. This article is intended to require potential nuisances to
be measured factually and objectively; to ensure that all uses will provide
methods to protect the community from hazards and nuisances which can
be prevented by process of control and nuisance elimination; and to protect
activities from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based solely on the
nuisance production. These standards are, therefore, provided to protect
the public interest and promote public heath and welfare.
§ 195-128. Air pollution.
To protect and enhance the air quality in the Township, all sources of
air pollution shall comply with any and all regulations set forth by the
Federal Environmental Protection Agency and Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection. In addition, the following shall apply:
A. Odor. In any district, no odor shall be permitted at any lot line
exceeding the lowest amount set forth in Table III, Odor Thresholds, of
Chapter 5, Physiological Effects, of the Air Pollution Abatement Manual
of the Manufacturing Chemists Association, according to the latest
edition of such table for the compounds therein described. For
compounds not described in Table III, odor thresholds may be
established by methods indicated in Chapter 5 of the manual, and no
odor shall be permitted at any lot line exceeding the amount
determined by the application of such methods.
B. Smoke. For the purposes of grading the density or equivalent opacity of
smoke, the Ringlemann No. 1 from any chimney, stack, vent, opening or
combustion process is prohibited; however, smoke of a shade not to
exceed Ringlemann No. 3 is permitted for up to three minutes total in
any one eight-hour period.
C. Particulate matter.
(1) The rate of particulate matter emission from all sources within the
boundaries of any lot shall not exceed a net figure of one pound per
acre of lot area during any one-hour period, after deducting from
the gross hourly emission per acre the correction factors set forth
in the following table:
§ 195-127 PLUMBING § 195-128

NOTE:
*Interpolation for intermediate values not shown in table.
(2) Determination of the total net rate of emission of particulate matter
within the boundaries of any lot shall be made as follows:
(a) Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from
each source of emission and divide this figure by the number of
acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of
emission in pounds per acre.
(b) From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in Subsection
C(1) above, deduct the correction factor (interpolating as
required) for height of emission set forth in the table, thereby
obtaining the net rate of emission in pounds per acre per hour
from each source of emission.
(c) Add together the individual net rates of emission derived in
Subsection C(2) above to obtain the total net rate of emission
from all sources of emission within the boundaries of the lot;
such total shall not exceed one pound per acre of lot area

§ 195-131. Glare and heat.
Any operation producing intense glare or heat shall be conducted within an
enclosed building or with other effective screening in such a manner as to
make such glare or heat completely imperceptible from any point along the
property line. No heat from any use shall be sensed at any property line
to the extent of raising the ambient temperature of air or materials more
than 5º Fahrenheit. Any operation or activity that produces glare shall be
conducted so that direct or indirect light from the source shall not cause
illumination in excess of five-tenths footcandles measured at the property
line.
§ 195-132. Lighting.
Exterior lighting, except for overhead streetlighting and warning,
emergency, or traffic signals, shall be installed in accordance with Article
XIX, § 195-125, in such a manner that the light source will be sufficiently
obscured to prevent glare on public streets and walkways or into any
residential area. The installation or erection of any lighting which may be
confused with warning signals, emergency signals or traffic signals shall be
unlawful. Any lighting that produces glare shall not cause illumination in
excess of five-tenths footcandles measured at the property line.
§ 195-133. Noise.
In all zones, the sound-pressure level for all uses and activities shall not
exceed the decibel limits in the octave bands designated in the following
table and shall comply with the following standards:
A. Measurement. Lighting levels shall be measured in footcandles.
Measurement shall be taken with a direct reading portable light meter
or light-reading equipment recommended by the Township Engineer.
B. Method. Readings shall be taken by qualified personnel so that the
light-reading meter has been exposed long enough to provide a
constant reading. Measurements shall be made after dark with the light
sources in question on, then with the same sources off. The difference
between the two readings shall be compared to the maximum permitted
illumination at the property line at ground level. This procedure
eliminates the effects of moonlight and other ambient light.
A. Permitted decibel levels. At no point at or beyond the property line shall
the measured sound level exceed the maximum permitted sound levels
designated in the table below:
§ 195-131 PLUMBING § 195-133

1,200 to 2,400 45 51
2,400 to 4,800 41 47
Over 4,800 37 43
B. Measurement. Sound levels shall be measured with a sound-level meter
and associated octave band filter manufactured in accordance with the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Noises capable of being
measured shall be those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the
sound-level meter with a variation of no more than plus or minus two
decibels. Noises incapable of being measured, such as those of
irregular and/or intermittent nature, shall be controlled so as not to
become a nuisance to adjacent uses.
C. Exemptions. The following activities or sources are exempt from these
noise standards:
(1) Activities covered by the following: stationary signaling devices,
domestic power tools, air-conditioning and air-handling equipment
for residential purpose, operating motor vehicles, and refuse
collection vehicles.
(2) The unamplified human voice.
(3) The lowing of cattle, the clucking of fowl, the neighing of horses or
other normal sounds of reasonably cared for agricultural animals,
as well as the sounds of necessary farming equipment for a bona
fide agricultural operation. Noises related to domestic animals are
regulated by Chapter 67 of the Code.
(4) Fixed-wing aircraft operations. [Amended 11-6-2006 by Ord.
No. 2006-7]
(5) Construction or routine maintenance of public service utilities.
(6) Temporary activities relating to the construction and maintenance
of buildings and facilities including site preparation between 6:00
a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

Storage of toxic and hazardous substance shall meet the requirements of
the BOCA National Fire Prevention Code.
§ 195-136. Ground vibration.
Every use shall be so operated that the ground vibration inherently and
recurrently generated is not perceptible, without instruments, at any point
of any boundary line of the lot on which the use is located. Vibrations from
temporary construction and vehicles which leave the lot (such as trucks,
trains, airplanes and helicopters) are excluded.
(8) The emission of sound for the purpose of alerting persons of an
emergency, or the emission of sound in the performance of
emergency work.
(9) Occasionally used safety signals, warning devices and emergency
pressure relief values.
A. No materials or wastes shall be deposited upon a lot in such form or
manner that they may be transferred off the lot by natural causes or
forces.

A. Existing parking. Buildings and uses existing on the effective date of
this chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this article in
accordance with the following:
(1) The type or extent of use is not changed; and
(2) Provided that any parking facility now serving such structures or
uses shall not in the future be reduced.
B. Changes in requirements. Whenever there is an alteration of a building
or a change or extension of a use which increases the parking
requirements, the total additional parking required for the alteration,
change or extension shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of this article.
C. Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any use that
interferes with its availability for the parking need it is required to
serve.
D. Continuing obligation. All required parking facilities shall be provided
and maintained so long as the use exists which the facilities were
designed to serve. Reasonable precautions are to be taken by the
property owner or business owner to assure the availability of required
facilities for the employees or other persons for whom the parking
areas are designed to serve. The property owner or business owner
shall ensure that the parking area at no time constitutes a nuisance,
hazard or unreasonable impediment to traffic.
E. Drainage, surfacing and maintenance.
(1) The area of parking lots, including driveways, shall be graded,
surfaced with 1.5 inches ID-2 wearing course, two inches ID-2
binder course and six inches subbase, at a minimum, where there is

ARTICLE XXIII
Signs
§ 195-145. Purpose.
The Comprehensive Plan recognizes that attractive, appropriately
coordinated, well-designed signs can have a positive impact on local
business and the community in general. Recognizing that the
Comprehensive Plan promotes quality development and a pleasing
community character that will stimulate business and attract people, this
article provides appropriate sign standards and regulations for the
following purposes:
§ 195-146. Administration procedures.
A. To promote safety, comfort and well-being of the users of streets, roads
and highways in the Township.
B. To reduce distractions and obstructions from signs which would
adversely affect traffic safety, and to alleviate hazards caused by signs
projecting over or encroaching upon public ways.
C. To discourage excessive visual competition in signage and ensure that
signs aid orientation and adequately identify uses and activities to the
public.
D. To preserve or enhance Township character by requiring new and
replacement signage which is:
(1) Creative and distinctive.
(2) Compatible with the surroundings.
(3) Appropriate to the type of activity to which it pertains.
(4) Expressive of the identity of individual proprietors or of the
community as a whole.
(5) Appropriately sized in its context so as to be easily readable. (See
Illustration 24.261)
A. Permit; application procedure.
(1) No sign, with the exception of those outlined in § 195-147A and
signs installed by the direction of municipal, state, federal or other
governmental agency, shall be erected, placed, installed, altered,
relocated or replaced until a permit has been applied for and
issued. Applications shall be on forms provided by the Township
and shall be made to the Zoning Administrator. An application for
an off-premises sign shall be accompanied by written consent of the
261. Editor's Note: Illustration 24 is included as an attachment to this chapter.

owner or lessee of the property upon which the sign is to be erected
or placed. Permit requirements apply to temporary signs.
(2) Fall site plan, construction plans and specifications shall be
submitted with the application showing the location, dimensions,
message, materials, illumination, letter sizes, colors, location of
sign in relationship to the building and details of construction,
including load stresses and anchorage. Plans shall be drawn to
scale and be sufficiently clear, comprehensive, detailed and legible
so that, together with any accompanying specifications and
information, determination can be made as to whether or not the
proposed sign will comply with the requirements of these
regulations and with the installation requirements of the Building
Code of the Township.262 [Amended 3-3-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-02]
(3) Any sign permit issued shall be valid only while such sign and
support structure is maintained in a safe, sound and nonhazardous
condition.
(4) If necessary, a conforming sign may be removed and reinstalled for
normal maintenance activities without requiring the submission of
an application.
B. Measurement of sign area. The area of a sign shall be computed in the
following manner:
(1) The measurement of sign area shall mean the entire area within a
single perimeter enclosed by one continuous line, connecting the
extreme edges or points of a sign, together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate
such sign from the background against which it is placed.
(2) When two sides of a double-faced sign are located not more than 28
inches apart at the widest point and not more than 18 inches apart
at the narrowest point, and display identical writing or
representation, only one of the sides shall be used to determine the
surface area. Any additional sides of a multifaceted sign shall be
considered as a separate sign for purposes of computing the total
surface area of the sign.
(3) Sign area shall not include the main supporting sign structure in
determining sign area.
C. Measurement of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction, or the
newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling,
berming, mounding or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the

sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be
determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the
elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the
elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the
grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on
the lot, whichever is lower.
D. Measurement of setback requirements. The setback requirement shall
be measured from the outermost edge of the sign to the existing rightof-
way line.
E. Signs within intersection sight triangles. [Amended 9-16-1996 by
Ord. No. 1996-9]
(1) No signs may obstruct the line of sight in accordance with Chapter
173, Subdivision and Land Development, Exhibits VI and VII.
(2) To ensure clear line of sight, signs that may be located in the
intersection sight triangle shall be at a height under three feet or
over 12 feet, provided that all other ordinance requirements have
been met.263 [Amended 3-3-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-02]
A. Exempt signs from sign permit and fee. A sign permit and fee shall not
be required for any of the following signs. The exemption shall apply
only to the requirement for obtaining a sign permit and paying the fee
and shall not be construed as relieving the owner or applicant of such
sign from the responsibility for applying and obtaining a building and
electrical permit for erection, for maintaining it in a safe condition and
from being in conformance with the applicable requirements stated in
this article. See the definitions found in § 195-10, "Signs." [Amended

ARTICLE XXIV
Nonconforming Buildings and Uses
§ 195-151. Intent.
§ 195-152. Continuation of nonconformity.
The Zoning Officer shall be responsible for the proper registration of
premises occupied by a lawful nonconforming use, lot, building or structure
existing after the effective date of this chapter and issuance of a certificate
of nonconformance, which shall be for the purpose of ensuring to the
owner the right to continue such nonconformity in accordance with the
provisions of Article XXIV. It is the property owner's responsibility to assist
the Zoning Officer in the identification and registration of nonconforming
uses, lots, buildings and structures they are accountable for. A certificate of
nonconformance shall be required when a nonconforming use, structure or
A. Within the districts established by the Zoning Ordinance passed June 3,
1968, or amendments that may be later adopted, there exist lots,
buildings, structures and uses which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or later amendment.
[Amended 1-20-1997 by Ord. No. 1997-2]
B. The legitimate interests of those who lawfully established these
nonconformities are recognized in Article XXIV by permitting such uses
to continue subject to regulations for and limitations upon their
restoration, reconstruction or extensions. It is recognized, however,
that nonconformities substantially and adversely affect the
development, maintenance, use and taxable value of other properties in
the district that are subject to the regulations of this chapter. In order
to secure eventual compliance with the standards of this chapter, it is
therefore necessary to regulate nonconformities and to prevent their
reestablishment once they have been discontinued. It is further the
intent of this chapter that nonconformities not be used as grounds for
adding other buildings or structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the
same district.
C. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall affect the plans,
construction or designated use of any building or structure on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date or
amendment to this chapter. Actual building construction means the
placing and fastening of construction materials in a permanent manner.
In the case where a demolition or removal of an existing building or
structure has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such
demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction if a
building permit has been obtained, provided that work shall be
diligently carried on until completion of the building or structure is
accomplished and a certificate of occupancy is issued.
§ 195-151 PLUMBING § 195-152
144:771
building is proposed or changed to another nonconforming use, expanded
or repaired prior to the issuance of building or zoning permits.
§ 195-153. Nonconforming lots of record. [Amended 1-20-1997 by
Ord. No. 1997-2]
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a
single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected

shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission prior to the conduct of
the public hearing before the Board of Supervisors.
E. Conditions. The Board of Supervisors may attach additional conditions
to the approval of a conditional use. Such conditions shall be necessary
to protect the public welfare and preserve the integrity of the
Comprehensive Plan. Additionally, these conditions can impose
additional restrictions imposed within the zoning district and/or
specified for the use. Such conditions shall be enforceable by the
§ 195-187 PLUMBING § 195-188
144:815
Zoning Officer, and failure to comply with the conditions shall
constitute a violation of this chapter.
F. General standards. A conditional use may be granted when the
applicant demonstrates compliance with the following standards. The
applicant for conditional use shall have the burden of proof, which shall
include the burden of going forward with the evidence, and the burden
of persuasion on all questions of fact which are to be determined by the
Board of Supervisors.
(1) The proposed use, including its nature, intensity and location, is in
harmony with the orderly and appropriate development of the
zoning district.
(2) That adequate water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage and
fire and police protection are or can be provided for the use.
(3) That the use of adjacent land and buildings will not be discouraged
and the value of adjacent land and buildings will not be impaired by
the location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences.
(4) That the use will have proper location with respect to existing or
future streets, and will not create traffic congestion or cause
nonresidential traffic on local residential streets.
(5) That the specific standards set forth for each particular use for
which a conditional use may be granted have been met.
G. Specific standards. In addition to the general standards for all
conditional uses as contained in Subsection F, the specific standards for
particular uses as listed in Article XXIV must be met prior to the
granting of a conditional use.
H. Site plan approval.
(1) Any site plan presented in support of the conditional use pursuant
to Subsection A(3), shall become an official part of the record for
said conditional use. Approval of any conditional use shall also bind
the use in accordance with the site plan; therefore, should a change
in the site plan be required as part of the approval of the use, the
applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the issuance of a
building permit or use certificate.
(2) Any subsequent change to the use on the subject property shall not
reflect on the originally approved site plan, and shall require the
obtainment of another conditional use approval.
I. Hearing procedures.
(1) Before voting on the enactment of a conditional use, the Board of
Supervisors shall hold a public hearing thereon, pursuant to public
notice. The Board of Supervisors shall submit each such application
to the Planning Commission at least 30 days prior to the hearing on

such application to provide the Planning Commission an
opportunity to submit recommendations. If, after any public
hearing held upon an application, the proposed conditional use is
revised, the Board of Supervisors shall hold another public hearing,
pursuant to public notice, before proceeding to vote on the
amendment.
(2) All public hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the
requirements outlined in § 195-196 of this article, except that any
reference to the "Zoning Hearing Board" shall be replaced with the
"Board of Supervisors" and any reference to "special exception"
shall be replaced with "conditional use."
J. Applicability of ordinance amendments. When an application for a
conditional use has been filed with either the Zoning Hearing Board or
governing body, as relevant, and the subject matter of such application
would ultimately constitute either a land development as defined in
§195-10 or a subdivision as defined in §195-10, no change or
amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or
plans shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood
at the time the application was duly filed; provided, further, should such
an application be approved by either the Zoning Hearing Board or
governing body, as relevant, the applicant shall be entitled to proceed
with the submission of either land development or subdivision plans
within a period of six months or longer as may be approved by either
the Zoning Hearing Board or the governing body following the date of
such approval in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
filed before either the Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as

Section 508(1) through (4) (MPC, Act 247),279 and specifically to the
time limitations of Section 508(4) (MPC, Act 247),280 which shall

deemed sufficient by the Township along the perimeter of the
tract facing a public right-of-way to notify potentially
interested citizens. The affected tract or tax parcels shall be

request, including any plans, explanatory material or proposed
amendments, may be examined by the public.

(5) Dauphin County Planning Commission referrals. All proposed
amendments shall be submitted to the Dauphin County Planning
Commission at least 30 days prior to the public hearing on such

may proceed without its recommendation.
(6) Adjournment of public hearing. If during the public hearing process
the Board of Supervisors needs additional time to understand the

a decision, it may adjourn the public hearing to another certain
time and place.
(7) Within 30 days after enactment, a copy of the amendment to this
chapter shall be forwarded to the Dauphin County Planning

Supervisors, which shall then proceed in the same manner as with a
petition to the Board of Supervisors which has already been reviewed
by the Planning Commission.

which he has an interest may submit a curative amendment to the
Board of Supervisors with a written request that his challenge and
proposed amendment be heard and decided as provided in MPC

in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplain, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features.
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplain, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the

other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
C. The Board of Supervisors shall render its decision within 45 days after
the conclusion of the last hearing.

within the time limit referred to in Subsection C, a denial of the request
is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
E. Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of the
ordinance or Official Zoning Map is in question and shall give the place
and times when a copy of the request, including any plans, explanatory

§ 195-191. Curative amendments by Board of Supervisors.

G. Where, after the effective date of the MPC,284 a curative amendment
proposal is approved by the grant of a curative amendment application
by the Board of Supervisors pursuant to this section or a validity
challenge is sustained by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to
§ 195-188A, or the court acts finally on appeal from denial of a curative
amendment proposal or a validity challenge, and the proposal or
challenge so approved requires a further application for subdivision or
land development, the developer shall have two years from the date of
such approval to file an application for preliminary or tentative
approval for a subdivision or land development. Within the two-year
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision
or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the
curative amendment or the sustained validity challenge. Upon the filing
of the preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of MPC § 508.4285
shall apply.
A. The Board of Supervisors shall declare by formal action this chapter or
portions thereof substantively invalid and propose to prepare a curative
amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30 days following such
declaration and proposal, the Board of Supervisors shall:

§ 195-190 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-191
144:822
(2) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Board of Supervisors shall enact a curative amendment to validate or
reaffirm the validity of this chapter pursuant to the provisions required
by this section in order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures, as set forth in Subsection A, the
Board of Supervisors shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 195-190 nor shall the
Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested under
MPC § 909.1 or 916.1286 subsequent to the declaration and proposal
based upon the grounds identical to or substantially similar to those
specified in the resolution required by Subsection A(1). Upon
completion of the procedures as set forth in Subsection A and B, no
rights to a cure pursuant to the provisions of § 195-190 and MPC 916.1
shall, from the date of declaration and proposal, accrue to any
landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of the unamended
zoning ordinance for which there has been a curative amendment
pursuant to this section.
D. The Board of Supervisors, having utilized the procedures set forth in
Subsections A and B, may not again utilize said procedure for a thirtysix-
month period following the date of the enactment of a curative
amendment or reaffirmation of the validity of this chapter, pursuant to
Subsection B; provided, however, that if after the date of declaration
and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed
upon the Township by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a
Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Township may utilize the
provisions of this section to prepare a curative amendment to this
chapter to fulfill said duty or obligation.
E. Authentication of Official Zoning Map. Whenever there has been a
change in the boundary of a zoning district or a reclassification of the
zoning district adopted in accordance with the above, the change on the
Official Zoning Map shall be amended, and shall be duly certified by the
Township Secretary and shall thereafter be refiled as part of the
permanent records of the Township.

and a statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may
be examined.
A. Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance, except
those brought before the Zoning Hearing Board Board of Supervisors as
a curative amendment in accordance with Article XXVI, § 195-191.
(1) If a challenge heard by a Zoning Hearing Board is found to have
merit, the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board shall include
recommended amendments to the challenged ordinance which will
cure the challenged defects. In reaching its decision, the Board
shall consider the amendments, plans and explanatory material
submitted by the landowner, and shall consider the following:
§ 195-196 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-197
144:828
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of
the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise
unlawfully excluded by the challenged provisions of the
ordinance or map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by
the site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplain,
aquifers, natural resources and other natural features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplain, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed,
the tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts.
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(2) The Board shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing. If the Board fails to act on the
landowner's request within the time limit referred to in Article
XXVI, § 195-190A, a denial of the request is deemed to have
occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last hearing.
(3) The Board shall commence its hearing within 60 days after the
request is filed unless the landowner requests or consents to an
extension of time.
(4) Public notice of hearing shall be provided as specified in § 195-190.
B. Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after
the effective date of said ordinance.
C. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but not
limited to the granting or denial of any permit, or failure to act on the
application therefor, the issuance of any cease-and-desist order or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.
D. Appeals from a determination by a Township Engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance.
§ 195-197 PLUMBING § 195-197
144:829
§ 195-198. Applicability of judicial remedies.
Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to deny the appellant
the right to proceed directly to court, where appropriate, pursuant to
the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure No. 1091 (relating to action in
mandamus).
§ 195-199. Variances.
E. Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter and the flood
hazard ordinance287 or such provisions within a land use ordinance,
pursuant to Article XXVI, § 195-190.
F. Appeals from the determination of any officer or agency charged with
the administration of performance density provisions of this chapter.
G. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's determination under Article XXVII,
§ 195-204. [Amended 7-17-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-7]
H. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Township
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same relate to development not
involving subdivision or land development applications.
A. Filing of variance. An application may be made to the Zoning Hearing
Board for a variance where it is alleged that the provisions of this
chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The
application must be on a form provided for that purpose by the Zoning
Officer. Unless the form and information requested is complete at the
time of submission, the application will be returned to the applicant.
The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
287. Editor's Note: See Ch. 108, Floodplain Management.
§ 195-197 WEST HANOVER CODE § 195-199
144:830
§ 195-200. Special exceptions.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible for the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter. These conditions shall be enforceable by the
Zoning Officer and failure to comply with such conditions shall
constitute a violation of this chapter and be subject to the penalties
described in Article XXV, § 195-187B.
A. Filing of special exception. For any use permitted by special exception,
a special exception must be obtained from the Zoning Hearing Board.
In addition to the information required on the zoning permit
application, the special exception application must show the following:
(1) Ground floor plans and elevations of proposed structures.
(2) Names and addresses of adjoining property owners, including
properties directly across a public right-of-way.
(3) A site plan, drawn to scale, of the site with sufficient detail and
accuracy to demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions
of this chapter.
(4) A written description of the proposed use in sufficient detail to
demonstrate compliance with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
B. Conditions. The Zoning Hearing Board, in approving special exception
applications, may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the
public welfare and the Comprehensive Plan, including conditions which
are more restrictive than those established for other uses in the same
zone. These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Officer, and
failure to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this
chapter and be subject to the penalties described in Article XXV,
§ 195-187B.
C. General standards. A special exception may be granted when the
Zoning Hearing Board finds from a preponderance of the evidence
produced at the hearing that:
§ 195-199 PLUMBING § 195-200
144:831
(1) The proposed use, including its nature, intensity and location, is in
harmony with the orderly and appropriate development of the
zoning district.
(2) Adequate water supply, sewage disposal, storm drainage and fire
and police protection are or can be provided for the use.
(3) The use of adjacent land and buildings will not be discouraged and
the value of adjacent land and buildings will not be impaired by the
location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences.
(4) The use will have proper location with respect to existing or future
streets, and will not create traffic congestion or cause
nonresidential traffic on local residential streets.
D. Specific standards. In addition to the general standards for all special
exceptions as contained in Subsection C, the specific standards for
particular uses must be met prior to the granting of a special exception.
E. Site plan approval.
(1) Any site plan presented in support of the special exception
pursuant to Subsection A(3) shall become an official part of the
record for said special exception. Approval of any special exception
shall also bind the use in accordance with the site plan; therefore,
should a change in the site plan be required as part of the approval
of the use, the applicant shall revise the site plan prior to the
issuance of a building permit or use certificate.
(2) Any subsequent change to the use on the subject property shall not
reflect on the originally approved site plan, and shall require the
obtainment of another special exception approval.
F. Applicability of ordinance amendments. When an application for a
special exception has been filed with either the Zoning Hearing Board
or governing body, as relevant, and the subject matter of such
application would ultimately constitute either a land development as
defined in § 195-10 or a subdivision as defined in § 195-10, no change or
amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or
plans shall affect the decision on such application adversely to the
applicant and the applicant shall be entitled to a decision in accordance
with the provisions of the governing ordinances or plans as they stood
at the time the application was duly filed; provided, further, should such
an application be approved by either the Zoning Hearing Board or
governing body, as relevant, the applicant shall be entitled to proceed
with the submission of either land development or subdivision plans
within a period of six months or longer as may be approved by either
the Zoning Hearing Board or the governing body following the date of
such approval in accordance with the provisions of the governing
ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the application was duly
filed before either the Zoning Hearing Board or governing body, as
relevant. If either a land development or subdivision plan is so filed

§ 195-201. Parties appellant before Board. [Amended 7-17-2000 by
Ord. No. 2000-7]
Appeals under Article XXVII, § 195-197A, B, C, D, F, G and H, may be filed
with the Zoning Hearing Board, in writing, by the landowner affected, any
officer or agency of the Township or any person aggrieved. Requests for a
variance under § 195-199 may be filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by
any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such landowner. Any
appeal shall state the following:
§ 195-202. Time limitations.
within said period, such plan shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 508(1) through (4) (MPC, Act 247),288 and specifically to the
time limitations of Section 508(4) (MPC, Act 247),289 which shall
commence as of the date of filing such land development or subdivision
plan in accordance with Section 917 of the MPC, Act 247.290 [Added
11-4-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-8A]
A. The name and address of the appellant and applicant.
B. The name and address of the landowner of the real estate to be
affected.
C. A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by such
proposed change, together with a plot plan drawn to scale with
sufficient clarity to show the nature and character of the request.
D. A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question, the improvements thereon and the present use thereof.
E. A statement of the section of this chapter under which the request may
be allowed, and reasons why it should or should not be granted.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after an application for development,
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate Zoning
Officer or Board of Supervisors if such proceeding is designed to secure
reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person
alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge or reason to
believe that such approval had been given. If such person has
succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest.
B. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision or from an adverse decision by a Zoning Officer on a
challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map pursuant to Article
XXVII, § 195-197, shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except
288. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. 10508.
289. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. 10508.

§ 195-203. Stay of proceedings.
in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from
the approved tentative approval. [Amended 7-17-2000 by Ord. No.
2000-7]
C. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the determination
is issued.
A. Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in Article XXVII, § 195-197,
and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land
development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval
of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action
thereunder, shall be stayed unless the Zoning Officer or any other
appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts indicating that
such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case
the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by
a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the court
having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the
Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an
application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly
approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are
filed with the Zoning Hearing Board by persons other than the
applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction of
zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to
continuing the proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board.
[Amended 7-17-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-7]
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to
determine if the filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing,
evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After
condition of all evidence presented, if the court determines that the
appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for a bond. The right to
petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is
taken from a final decision of the court.
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the
amount of the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An
order denying a petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order
directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an
order of the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond
and the appellate court sustains the order of the court below to post a
bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning
appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and attorney
fees incurred by the petitioner.

144:834
§ 195-204. Procedure to obtain preliminary opinion. [Amended
7-17-2000 by Ord. No. 2000-7]
In order not to unreasonably delay the time when a landowner may secure
assurance that the ordinance or map under which he proposed to build
is free from challenge, and recognizing the procedure for preliminary
approval of his development may be too cumbersome or may be unavailable,
the landowner may advance the date from which time for any challenge
to the ordinance or map will run under Article XXVII, § 195-202, by the
following procedure:
§ 195-205. Application for appeal; fee.
A. The landowner may submit plans and other materials describing his
proposed use or development to the Zoning Officer for a preliminary
opinion as to their compliance with the applicable ordinances and
maps. Such plans and other materials shall not be required to meet the
standards prescribed for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for
the issuance of a building permit so long as they provide reasonable
notice of the proposed use or development and a sufficient basis for a
preliminary opinion as to its compliance.
B. If the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion is that the use or
development complies with the ordinance or map, notice thereof shall
be published once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the Township. Such notice shall include a
general description of the proposed use or development and its
location, by some readily identifiable directive, and the place and times
where the plans and other materials may be examined by the public.
The favorable preliminary approval under Article XXVII, § 195-202, and
the time therein specified for commencing a proceeding with the
Zoning Hearing Board shall run from the time when the second notice
thereof has been published.
A. An appeal from the terms of this chapter shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer on forms provided by the Township and shall contain the
following information:
(1) The name and address of the applicant filing the appeal.
(2) The name and address of the owner of the real estate to be affected
by such appeal.
(3) A brief description and location of the real estate to be affected by
such appeal.
(4) A statement of the present zoning classification of the real estate in
question and the present use thereof.
(5) A statement of the section of this chapter under which the appeal is
filed.
§ 195-204 PLUMBING § 195-205
144:835
§ 195-206. Appeals to Court of Common Pleas.
Any person, taxpayer or the Township aggrieved by any decision of the
Zoning Hearing Board may within 30 days after such decision of the Zoning
Hearing Board seek review by the Court of Common Pleas of such decision
in the manner provided by the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
and Article X-A of the Act, as amended.
(6) A narrative shall be submitted as an attachment to the application
stating the reasons why the appeal should be granted; or a
narrative describing the situation in which the alleged erroneous
decision is being appealed.
(7) An accurate description of the present improvements and the
additions intended to be made under the application, indicating the
size and use of such proposed improvements and general
construction thereof. In addition, a site plan shall be submitted as
an attachment to the application of the real estate to be affected, as
required to accompany applications for permits, indicating the
location and size of the lot and locations of improvements now
erected and proposed to be erected thereon.
(8) The signature of the applicant and the owner; and the date the
application was signed by the applicant and the owner.
B. A filing fee, established by the Board of Supervisors by resolution, shall
accompany the application. The application shall not be processed until
the filing fee has been paid in full.
