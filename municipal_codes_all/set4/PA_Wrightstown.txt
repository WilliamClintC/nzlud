Where there are delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties or user charges against the property

receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim, the Treasurer of the Township of Wrightstown

a certificate and bill pursuant to this subsection, the insurer shall transfer to the Secretary of
the Township of Wrightstown an amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to pay said
sums prior to making payment to the named insured, subject to the provisions of Subsection

this section or when the Treasurer of Wrightstown Township has issued a certificate described in

property, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured.
If the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the
aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure, the procedures set
forth in this subsection shall apply in place of the procedure specified in Subsection 2 hereof:
The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Treasurer of the Township of
Wrightstown, Bucks County, in the aggregate, $2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or
fraction thereof.

Secretary of the Township of Wrightstown from the insurance proceeds the amount specified
in the estimate. If there is more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds shall be on a prorata
basis by all insurers insuring the building or other structure.

Township of Wrightstown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, shall do the following:

incurred by the Township of Wrightstown in connection with such removal, repair or

contractor's signed estimate of the cost of removing, repairing or securing the building or
other structure, in which event the Secretary of the Township of Wrightstown shall, if such
estimate is deemed by the Secretary of the Township of Wrightstown to be reasonable,
return to the insured the amount of the funds transferred to the Township of Wrightstown

the Township of Wrightstown has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the
building or other structure in which case the Township of Wrightstown will complete the

of a certificate issued by the Secretary of the Township of Wrightstown that the repair,
removal or securing of the building or other structure has been completed in accordance

§ 1-404. Procedure Upon Arrest.
[Ord. No. 321, 5/20/2019]
Any officer making an arrest under these guidelines shall follow those procedures set forth in the
Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, in particular Rule 441, said rule currently providing as
follows:
When a defendant has been arrested without a warrant, the defendant shall be either
released from custody pursuant to Subsection 1B or taken before the proper issuing authority
under Subsection 1C.
Release of defendant.
When a defendant has been arrested without a warrant, the arresting officer shall
promptly release the defendant from custody when the following conditions have been
met:
The defendant poses no threat of immediate physical harm to any other person or to
himself or herself; and
The arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will
appear as required.
A citation shall be issued to the defendant at the time of release and thereafter the case
shall proceed in accordance with Rules of Criminal Procedure 405-409 as if the
proceedings had been instituted by issuing a citation to the defendant.
When the defendant has not been released from custody under Subsection 1B:
The defendant shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the issuing authority,
when available, pursuant to Rule of Criminal Procedure 117, where a citation shall be
filed against the defendant, and:
The defendant shall enter a plea.
If the defendant pleads guilty, the issuing authority shall impose sentence. If the
defendant pleads not guilty, the defendant shall be given an immediate trial unless:
The commonwealth is not ready to proceed, or the defendant requests a
postponement or is not capable of proceeding, and in any of these
circumstances, the issuing authority shall release the defendant on
recognizance unless the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe
that the defendant will not appear, in which case the issuing authority may fix
the amount of collateral to be deposited to ensure the defendant's appearance
on the new date and hour fixed for trial; or
The defendant's criminal record must be ascertained before trial as specifically
required by statute for purposes of grading the offense charged, in which event
the issuing authority shall release the defendant on recognizance unless the
issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the defendant will not
appear, in which case the issuing authority may fix the amount of collateral to be
deposited to ensure the defendant's appearance on the new date and hour fixed
for trial, which shall be after the issuing authority's receipt of the required
information.
In determining whether it is necessary to set collateral and what amount of collateral
should be set, the issuing authority shall consider the factors listed in Rule of
8/17/2020 Township of Wrightstown, PA Ecode360

Criminal Procedure 523. The amount of collateral shall not exceed the full amount of
the fine and costs.
If collateral has been set, the issuing authority shall state, in writing, the reason(s)
why any collateral other than release on recognizance has been set and the facts
that support a determination that the defendant has the ability to pay monetary
collateral.
If collateral is set and the defendant does not post collateral, the defendant shall not
be detained without a trial longer than 72 hours or the close of the next business day
if the 72 hours expire on a nonbusiness day.
If the defendant is under 18 years of age and cannot be given an immediate trial, the
issuing authority promptly shall notify the defendant and defendant's parents, guardian,
or other custodian of the date set for the summary trial, and shall release the defendant
on his or her own recognizance.

The Wrightstown Township Board of Supervisors ("Board") has, by Ord. 187, enacted on
December 3, 2001, and effective on December 8, 2001, as amended, adopted by reference the
2000 IBC International Building Code as the building code of Wrightstown Township pursuant to its

et seq.
Also effective on December 8, 2001, the Board has, by Ord. 190, adopted by reference the 1999

By Act 45 of 1999 ("Act 45"), the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted the Pennsylvania
Construction Code Act to provide uniform statewide construction standards; and to require that all
municipalities in Pennsylvania timely adopt the uniform construction standards once the standards
were promulgated by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry ("L&I").

L&I promulgated the uniform construction standards (the "Code") on January 10, 2004, and Act 45
requires municipalities to adopt the Code by ordinance as the municipality's building code no later
than July 8, 2004; and to elect whether the municipality will enforce and/or administer the Code
within the municipality.
Act 45 and the Code preempts and rescinds the Local Building Code, unless provisions of the
Local Building Code exceeding the minimum requirements of the Code were in effect on or before
July 1, 1999. Wrightstown Township has five such "grandfathered" ordinances enacting provisions
of the Local Building Code that were not repealed from the Local Building Code but were
preserved and continued. The grandfathered and preserved provisions of the Local Building Code
are as follows:
Wrightstown Township Ord. 81, adopted April 4, 1988, prohibiting foam plastic wallframe
building materials and similar composite construction.

water per flush; prohibiting showerhead and sink faucet discharge rates from exceeding 2.75
gallons of water per minute; and proscribing hot water circulating devices with a single loop
return.
The purpose of this Part is to promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of

§ 8-402. Description and Special Requirements of Identified
Floodplain Areas.
[Ord. 310, 3/2/2015]
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas in the FIS and the FIRM which represent the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without any increase in the water surface elevation at any point. This
term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other available studies or
sources of information for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development, shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in
the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on
the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE zone on the FIRM
included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided but no floodway has been determined.
No permit shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within
any AE Area/District without floodway unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development would not, together with all other existing and
anticipated development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
No new construction or development shall be located within the area measured 50
feet landward from the top-of-bank of any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit
is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection's regional office.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one-percent annual chance flood elevations have
been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal, state,
or other acceptable sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined by hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by Wrightstown Township.

information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change within the A Area/District or AE Area/District, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 8-501, Subsection 2, for situations where FEMA notification is required.
§ 8-404. Boundary Disputes.
[Ord. 310, 3/2/2015]
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the floodplain administrator; and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may
appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 8-405. Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
[Ord. 310, 3/2/2015]
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44CFR 60.3.

variance from the provisions of this chapter provided that all of the findings set forth in § 8-802,
Subsection 1E, are made where relevant in a given case.
§ 8-802. Variance Procedures and Conditions.
[Ord. 310, 3/2/2015]
The Zoning Hearing Board shall consider requests for variances from the provisions of this
chapter in accordance with the requirements contained in the National Flood Insurance Program
Requirements for Floodplain Management Regulations, 44 CFR 60.6, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10910.2, and the express requirements set forth below:.
No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any
Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the BFE.
No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use, or activity within any AE
Area/District without floodway that would, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE at any point.
No variance shall be granted for any of the other requirements pertaining specifically to
development which may endanger human life (§ 8-504).
No variance shall be granted for recreational vehicles (§ 8-507) or prohibited uses/activities

Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a variance from the provisions of this chapter upon a
showing of unnecessary hardship by the applicant and provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary hardship
is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by
the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that
the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use
of the property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least modification of the regulation in issue.
That the variance, if authorized, will not result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase
in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense.
That the variance, if authorized, will not create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize
the public or conflict with any other applicable state or local ordinances and regulations.
A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by
Wrightstown Township. In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall be
included in the annual report to FEMA.
Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures shall be designed and constructed so as

It is shown on the FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
START OF CONSTRUCTION
Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days after the date of the permit and

lease of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more than 10 acres, not involving any new
street or easement of access or any residential dwelling, shall be exempted.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE
Damage from any cause sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its
before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 25% or more of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, of which the cost
equals or exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless
of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for
improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety
code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which
are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.

the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare.
§ 9-101. Short Title.
[Ord. 261, 9/17/2007]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Soil Erosion, Sedimentation and Grading Control
Ordinance," implementing Title 25, Pa. Code, Rules and Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources, Subpart C, Protection of Natural Resources,
Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," as well as provisions of Act 167,
Stormwater Management Act, 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., Article V of the Municipalities Planning Code
(MPC), 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., and the Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. § 65101 et seq.
§ 9-102. Findings and Purposes.
[Ord. 261, 9/17/2007]
Findings. In Wrightstown Township excessive quantities of soil are eroding from areas undergoing
development for nonagricultural uses, such as housing developments, industrial sites, roads, and
recreation areas. The washing, blowing and deposition of eroded soil across and upon roadways
decrease visibility and reduce the traction of automobiles. This soil erosion necessitates the costly
repair of gullies, washed out fills, roads, and embankments and causes the undermining of trees.
The resulting sediment clogs storm sewers and muddies, pollutes, and silts streams, rivers,
ponds, and lakes. The sediment is expensive to remove and limits the use of water for most
beneficial purposes; promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds; and destroys fish and
other desirable aquatic life. The sediment reduces the channel capacity of drainage ditches,
streams, and rivers, and thus, increases the likelihood of flooding and associated damages. All of
these effects of soil erosion threaten the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of
Wrightstown Township, as well as the general ecology of the Township.
Purposes. The purposes of this Part are to regulate the modification of the natural terrain, the
alteration of drainage, and to provide for certain erosion and sediment control measures within
Wrightstown Township to assure and safeguard health, safety, ecology and the general welfare in
the Township.
§ 9-103. Scope.
[Ord. 261, 9/17/2007]
From and after the effective date of this Part, any subdivision and/or land development approved under
the Township's Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22] and/or Zoning Ordinance,
or any activity requiring a permit under § 9-105, Subsection 1, herein shall be in conformity with this
Part. In the event of a conflict between this Part and any other statute, ordinance, or regulation, the
strictest statute, ordinance, or regulation shall take precedence.

Cut and fill operations shall be kept to a minimum. In the design of cut and fill slopes,
consideration must be given to the length and steepness of the slope, the soil type, upslope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and other applicable factors. Areas of steep slopes
where high cuts and fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible. Where
unavoidable, cuts and fills on steep slopes must be immediately seeded, and natural contours
must be followed as closely as possible.
The disturbed earthen area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum.
All disturbed soils and topsoil stockpile areas shall be stabilized as quickly as possible and, if
necessary, seeded and mulched immediately. Any stockpile areas located on sloping ground
or near waters of the Commonwealth shall be enclosed with silt fencing.
Procedures for protecting soils or geologic structures with water supply potential from
contamination by surface water or other disruption by earthmoving activity must be
established to the satisfaction of the Township.
Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, silt traps or filters shall be installed and
maintained to remove sediment form runoff waters from land undergoing development. All
runoff from the site shall be collected and diverted to these facilities for the removal of
sediment. Sedimentation in the runoff water shall be trapped and filtered by these facilities
until the disturbed area is stabilized to the satisfaction of the Township.
All plans, wherein a sump pump or basement drain is proposed to be installed, shall provide
for discharge of the sump pump/drain to a natural watercourse, drainage swale, stormwater
easement, storm sewer system, open space area or BMP stormwater management facility.
No sump pump or basement drain discharge shall be permitted to a grassed lawn area of
residential or nonresidential buildings, unless such area is part of a stormwater easement or
drainage swale.
Provisions shall be made to minimize any runoff caused by changed soil and surface
conditions during and after development. All drainage facilities shall be designed to carry
surface water in such a manner as to prevent erosion or overflow. Drainage facilities shall be
designed and constructed to withstand the expected velocity of flow from a ten-year
frequency storm without erosion. Stabilization adequate to prevent erosion must also be
provided at the outlets of all pipes and paved channels.
Natural vegetation shall be retained, protected, and supplemented wherever possible.
Permanent vegetation shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently
stabilized. Permanent vegetation and related structures shall be installed as soon as practical.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until a ground cover is achieved
that is mature enough to control the soil erosion satisfactorily and to survive severe weather
conditions to the Township's satisfaction.
Permanent or temporary soil stabilization must be applied to denuded areas within one day
after final grade is reached on any portion of the site. Soil stabilization must also be applied
immediately to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain dormant
(undisturbed) for longer than one day.
Properties adjacent to the site of a land-disturbing activity shall be protected from sediment
disposition by preserving a well-vegetated buffer strip around the lower perimeter of the landdisturbing
activity; by installing perimeter controls such as sediment barriers; filters, dikes,
interceptor drains or sediment basins; or by a combination of such measures.
Vegetated buffer strips may not be used alone except where only runoff in sheet flow is
expected.
Buffer strips shall be at least 20 feet in width and shall contain preexisting, permanent
vegetation, excluding trees and shrubs that cover 95% of the ground within the buffer

If, at any time, the Township Engineer finds that a vegetated buffer strip alone is
ineffective in preventing sediment movement onto adjacent property, additional perimeter
controls must be provided by the permittee or then owner of the property within a time
period specified by the Township.
In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of
continuing maintenance shall be considered.
The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be based on assessment of the
probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, on an evaluation of
the risks, costs and benefits involved and in accordance with best management practices.

construction shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter the conveyance
system without first being filtered or otherwise treated to remove sediment.
Construction vehicles are to be kept out of watercourses, wetlands, and other bodies of water.
Where in channel work is necessary, permits from regulatory agencies must be secured and
provided to the Township and precautions must be taken to stabilize the work area during
construction to minimize erosion. The channel, including bed and banks, must be restabilized
immediately after in channel work is completed.
Where a watercourse must be crossed by construction vehicles during construction, a
temporary stream crossing approved by the Township Engineer must be provided.
Sediment barriers shall be properly installed with silt fencing trenched and hay bales staked.
During all earthmoving and/or stripping operations, necessary measures for dust control must
be exercised to prevent dust from leaving the property on which earthmoving activities are
being conducted.
Wherever construction vehicle access routes intersect paved public streets, provisions must
be made to minimize the transport of sediment (mud) and dust onto the paved surfaces by
runoff or vehicle tracking including, but not limited to, the installation of tire cleaning areas at
each point of access to the site. These tire cleaning areas shall be constructed of AASHTO
#1 stone, and each shall be at least 50 feet in length. Where sediment and dust is transported
onto a public street, the permittee shall clean the street immediately. Sediment and dust shall
be removed from roads by shoveling or sweeping and then transported to a sediment control
area.
No grading equipment shall be permitted to be loaded, unloaded, or stored on a public street.

No more than 500 feet of trench is to be opened at one time.
Where consistent with safety and space considerations, excavated material is to be
placed on the uphill side of trenches.
Trench dewatering devices shall discharge in a manner that will not adversely affect
flowing streams, drainage systems or off-site property.
Individual service connections, telephone and electric lines and underground public
utility lines under existing hard-surfaced roads, streets or sidewalks are exempt from the
above requirements, provided that such land-disturbing activity is confined to the area
which is hard-surfaced.
All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be disposed of within 30 days
after final site stabilization is achieved, unless otherwise authorized by the Township
Engineer. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the disposition of
temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion and
sedimentation.
Before granting occupancy permits for buildings, building lots shall be finish graded so that
drainage will not be concentrated onto adjacent lots. Building lots must also be seeded or
mulched. If it is not possible to establish lawns due to the season of the year, or if exposed
areas will result in excess runoff onto adjoining properties because of the lack of ground
cover, the Township may require extra mulching, the installation of silt barriers, and/or the
construction of temporary sedimentation basins to control excess runoff, in addition to a
vegetation escrow to secure establishment of ground cover.
First Floor Certifications. Construction of any structure requiring a grading plan under this Part
shall not continue past the foundation stage until the owner/builder has submitted certification
that the first floor and garage floor elevations of the proposed structure conform to the plans
submitted with the grading permit application. The certification shall be submitted to the
Township Code Official on a form approved by the Township and shall be signed and sealed
by the responsible registered professional land surveyor or engineer, licensed in the

conform with the approved grading plan or file an amended application in accordance with the
procedures set forth herein for the grading area which is in fact proposed. The permittee shall
not strip, clear or grade any area larger than the area shown on the grading plan approved by
the Township.
If stripping, clearing, grading and/or landscaping are to be done in phases or areas, the
permittee shall give notice and request inspection at the completion of each of the above work
stages in each phase or area.
Notification of the results of the inspection shall be given in writing.
The permittee shall make regular inspections of all erosion and sedimentation control measures in
accordance with the inspection schedule outlined on the approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan. The purpose of such inspection will be to determine the condition and need for
replacement or repair of in place control measures; the overall effectiveness of the plan; and the
need for additional control measures.
All inspections shall be documented in written form and submitted to the Township Engineer
at the time interval specified in the erosion and sedimentation control plan.
A set of recorded "as built" plans shall be on file at the site and authenticated by a registered
professional engineer or surveyor, licensed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These
recorded "as built" plans shall be available on the site at all times and be subject to inspection and
inquiry. Engineering check notes shall accompany all recorded "as built" plans which involve
structural or mechanical measures and shall serve as supporting evidence that structures meet
design standards and specifications specified herein.
A final inspection shall be conducted by the Township Engineer to certify compliance with this
Part. Satisfactory compliance with this Part shall be necessary before issuance of a use and
occupancy permit.
The permittee shall bear all costs of inspections required or permitted hereunder and shall deposit

he shall, within 30 days prior to expiration of the permit, present in writing to the Township, a request
for an extension of time, setting forth therein the reasons for the requested extension. If, in the
discretion of the Township Engineer, such an extension is warranted, the Engineer may grant
additional time for the completion of the work. Where the Township Engineer determines that the
extension of time will require a substantial modification of the erosion and sedimentation control plan
and/or grading plan, any extension of a permit shall be subject to approval of such revised plans in
accordance with the applicable procedure of this Part.
§ 9-114. Amendment of Plans and Additional Conditions.
[Ord. 261, 9/17/2007]
Amendments of the erosion and sedimentation control plan or grading plan shall be submitted to
the Township and shall be processed and approved or disapproved in the same manner as the

by summary proceeding or in the manner provided for the collection of municipal claims, or by
an action of assumpsit without filing of a claim.

jurisdiction to compel the abatement of a nuisance and to secure whatever other relief the
said court may deem appropriate.

Notes:
1. Illumination levels are maintained
horizontal footcandles on the task,
e.g., pavement or area surface
2. Uniformity ratios dictate that
average illuminance values shall
not exceed minimum values by
more than the product of the
minimum value and the specified
ratio, e.g., for commercial parking
high activity, the average
footcandles shall not be in excess
of 3.6 (0.9 x 4).
Lighting Fixture Design.
Fixtures shall be of a type and design appropriate to the lighting application and aesthetically
acceptable to the Board of Supervisors.
For lighting horizontal tasks such as roadways, pathways and parking areas, fixtures shall
meet IESNA cutoff criteria (not have more than 2.5% of their light output emitted above 90° at
any lateral angle around the fixture).
The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures, decorative globes and other
fixtures not meeting IESNA cutoff criteria shall be permitted only with the approval of the
Board of Supervisors, based upon acceptable glare control.
Fixtures shall be equipped with or be capable of being back-fitted with light directing devices
such as shields, visors or hoods when necessary to redirect offending light distribution.
Control of Nuisance and Disabling Glare.
All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this Part, on private, residential, commercial,
industrial, municipal, recreational or institutional property, shall be aimed, located, designed,
fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their
ability to safely traverse, i.e., disabling glare, and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting
or reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or property, i.e., nuisance glare.

Directional fixtures such as floodlights, spotlights and sign lights shall be so installed or aimed
so that they do not project their output into the windows of neighboring residences, adjacent
uses, directly skyward or onto a roadway.
Unless otherwise permitted by the Board of Supervisors, e.g., for safety or security, lighting
shall be controlled by automatic switching devices such as time clocks or combination motion
detectors and photocells, to permit extinguishing offending sources between 11:00 p.m. and
dawn, to mitigate nuisance glare and sky lighting consequences.
Where all-night safety or security lighting is to be provided, the lighting intensity levels shall
not exceed 25% of the levels normally permitted by this Part for the use, but in no case shall
they be less than the minimum levels for safety or security as invoked by IESNA.
Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the primary means for controlling glare.
Rather, glare control shall be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff
fixtures, shields and baffles, and appropriate application of fixture mounting height, wattage,
aiming angle and fixture placement.
The intensity of illumination projected onto a residential use from another property shall not
exceed 0.1 vertical footcandle, measured at 30 inches above the ground at the property line.
Externally illuminated signs and billboards shall be lighted by fixtures mounted at the top of
the sign and aimed downward. Such fixtures shall be automatically extinguished between the
hours of 11:00 p.m. and dawn.
Fixtures meeting IESNA cutoff criteria shall not be mounted in excess of 20 feet above
finished grade. Fixtures not meeting IESNA cutoff criteria shall not be mounted in excess of
16 feet above grade except as specifically approved by the Board of Supervisors.
Fixtures used for general area lighting shall be aimed so as to project their output straight
down, unless approved otherwise.
Fixtures used for architectural lighting, e.g., facade, fountain, feature and landscape lighting,
shall be aimed so as not to project their output beyond the objects intended to be illuminated
and shall be extinguished between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and dawn.
With the exception of temporary holiday lighting no lighting fixture shall have any blinking,
flashing or fluttering lights or other illuminating device which has a changing light intensity,
brightness or color nor is any beacon permitted, except those required for fire alarm and/or
emergency systems.
Under-canopy lighting for such applications as gas/service stations, hotel/theater marquees,
fast-food/bank/drugstore drive-ups, shall be accomplished using flat-lens full-cutoff fixtures
aimed straight down and shielded in such a manner that the lowest opaque edge of the fixture
shall be below the light source at all lateral angles. The average illumination in the area
directly below the canopy shall not exceed 20 initial footcandles and the maximum shall not
exceed 30 initial footcandles.
Installation.
Electrical feeds for lighting standards shall be run underground, not overhead.
Lighting standards in parking areas shall be placed a minimum of five feet outside paved
area, or on concrete pedestals at least 30 inches high above the pavement, or suitably
protected by other approved means.
Maintenance. Lighting fixtures and ancillary equipment shall be maintained so as to always meet
the requirements of this Part and all Township ordinances and building codes.

§ 16-104. Residential Development Fixture Placement.
[Ord. 263, 9/17/2007]
Street lighting fixtures in residential developments shall, at the discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, be placed at the following locations:
At the intersection of public roads with entrance roads to the proposed development.
Intersections involving proposed public or nonpublic major thoroughfare roads within the
proposed development.
In multi-family unit parking areas one fixture for every 10 contiguous parking spaces provided
or sufficient to meet the requirements as specified in § 16-103, Subsection 1A.
§ 16-105. Recreational Uses.
[Ord. 263, 9/17/2007]
The nighttime illumination of outdoor recreational facilities for such aerial sports as outdoor riding
arenas, baseball, basketball, soccer, tennis, track and field, and football typically necessitate
higher than normally allowed fixture mounting heights and aiming angles, utilize very high-wattage
lamps and potentially produce unacceptable levels of light trespass and glare when located near
residential properties. Permission to illuminate such facilities shall be granted only when the
Township is satisfied that the health, safety and welfare rights of nearby property owners and the
Township as a whole have been properly protected. When recreational uses are specifically
permitted by the Township for operation during hours of darkness, the following requirements shall
apply:
Lighting shall be accomplished through the use of fixtures conforming to IESNA full-cutoff
criteria. The Township may consider the use of other than full-cutoff fixtures only when it can
be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Township that acceptable control of glare and light
trespass can be achieved, taking into account the proximity of the facility to adjacent
properties that could be adversely impacted.
Race tracks and such recreational venues as golf driving ranges, trapshooting facilities and
outdoor riding arenas that necessitate the horizontal, or near horizontal projection of
illumination, shall not be permitted to be artificially illuminated.
Recreational facilities for basketball, baseball, football, soccer, miniature golf, tennis or track
shall not be illuminated if located within a residential district or sited on a nonresidential
property located within 1,000 feet of a property containing a residential use.
Sporting events shall be timed to end at such time that all lighting in the sports facility, other
than lighting for safe exit of patrons, shall be extinguished by 10:00 p.m., regardless of such
occurrences as extra innings or overtimes.
Maximum mounting heights for recreational lighting shall be in accordance with the following:
Basketball: 20 feet.
Football: 70 feet.
Soccer: 70 feet.
Little League Baseball.

Any owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located within a subdivision, who sells, transfers or

sanctions and penalties hereafter set forth. The Board of Supervisors may also enjoin such
transfer or sale or agreement by injunction in addition to the penalties herein provided.
In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain appropriate actions by law

damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The description by
metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other documents used in the process of selling
or transferring shall not exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the remedies
herein provided.
The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve
or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision
of real property in violation of this chapter. This authority to deny such a permit or approval shall
apply to any of the following applicants:
The owner of record at the time of such violation.
The vendee (buyer) or lessee (renter) of the owner of record at the time of such violation
without regard as to whether such vendee (buyer) or lessee (renter) had actual or
constructive knowledge of the violation.
The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation
without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation.
The vendee (buyer) or lessee (renter) of the current owner of record who acquired the
property subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee (buyer)
or lessee (renter) had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an approval to any such
owner, current owner, vendee (buyer) or lessee (renter) for the development of any such real
property, the Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have been
applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
Magisterial district judges or the Court of Common Pleas exercising jurisdiction of magisterial
district judges, shall have initial jurisdiction in proceedings brought under § 22-202, Subsection 9,
hereof.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of this chapter
shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the

attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be
imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the magisterial
district judge or other appropriate tribunal. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the
judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil
procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the
magisterial district judge determining that there has been a violation further determines that there
was a good faith basis for the person, partnership, or corporation violating this chapter to have
believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only
one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the
magisterial district judge and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.
The Court of Common Pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause shown, tolling
the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and judgment.

§ 22-402. Procedures for Plans.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The following procedures are to be followed for plans submitted to Wrightstown Township. The
content of the plan submissions will vary depending on the type of plan submitted (sketch,
preliminary, or final) and are specified by the terms of this chapter.
Pre-Application Meeting. It is recommended that a pre-application meeting be held with the
applicant and the Township to introduce the applicant to the Township's zoning and
subdivision regulations and procedures, to discuss the applicant's objectives, and to schedule
site visits, meetings and plan submissions as described below. Applicants are also
encouraged to present the existing resources and site analysis plan at this meeting.
Applicants Shall Submit an Existing Resources and Site Analysis Plan (ERSAP). Applicants
shall submit an ERSAP, prepared in accordance with the requirements contained in this
section. The purpose of this submission is to familiarize officials with existing conditions on
the applicant's property and within its immediate vicinity and to provide a complete and factual
reference for making a site visit. This analysis shall be provided prior to the site visit. Contents
of the ERSAP shall be as follows:
Applicability. All applicants for preliminary or final subdivisions or land developments shall
submit the ERSAP. It is recommended that this information be provided with presubmission
sketch plans. No preliminary or final plan will be accepted by the Township
which does not include the ERSAP.
Review by the Township. The first item to be discussed when the plan reaches reviewing
boards and commissions shall be the ERSAPs. No discussion of a preliminary plan shall
occur until the applicants have provided a satisfactory ERSAP meeting all requirements.
The purpose of the ERSAP is to ensure that all development in Wrightstown Township
occurs in a manner that respects the natural environment and that the applicant and the
Township have a solid understanding of the natural conditions of any proposed
development site, as well as conditions around the site which provide the context for the
proposed development. It is recommended that this plan be prepared prior to the preapplication
meeting and site visit.
Required Contents of ERSAP.
Site boundaries.
Existing Resources Inventory. A comprehensive analysis of existing conditions on
the proposed development site and areas within 500 feet, showing:
Soils. Soils types within the site, based on maps contained in the Soil Survey of
Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States Department of Agriculture, as last
revised. The soil classifications and boundary lines of all soils located on the
tract shall be shown with reference to any alluvial soils, hydric soils, soils on
floodplains boundary and agricultural soils (Class I, II, and III and "Prime
Farmland" and "Statewide Important Farmland"). Soil descriptions for all soil
types shall be provided. Any building or septic system restrictions due to wet
soils, seasonably high water table or other restrictions shall be noted on the

of § 22-525, Subsection 1A, for landscape conservation and improvement plans,
including areas under active cultivation, forest and woodland areas and large
trees standing alone (i.e., outside of forest or woodland areas measuring six
inches diameter at four feet above natural ground cover).
Streams, watercourses, waters of the commonwealth, waters of the United
States, lakes, ponds, and all natural drainage areas with an explanation of how
site drainage works.
Wetlands - areas of wetlands on the proposed development parcel shall also be
indicated, as evident from testing, visual inspection, or from the presence of
wetland vegetation.
The Township may undertake its own wetland delineation at the applicant's
expense if any of the following site-specific criteria are applicable:
It is recommended by the Township Engineer due to uncertainties
raised by the applicant's delineation or conflicts exist between the
applicant's delineation and wetlands information obtained from other
sources including surrounding subdivision.
Greater than one acre of wetlands is on-site.
Wetlands on-site are associated with a wetland system of 10 or more
contiguous acres.
On-site wetlands are adjacent to a park, wildlife refuge or sanctuary, or
other open space area managed for resource preservation purposes.
The wetlands are within a watershed determined to be of exceptional
value or high quality as defined in 25 Pa. Code, Chapter 105.
If any of the three wetlands parameters (hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation
or evidence of hydrology) are present on a site proposed for development,
a separate wetlands delineation of sufficient detail to allow for thorough
review by Township officials must be submitted to the Township. As part of

and verification shall be performed by a qualified wetlands professional.
The person or organization performing the delineation shall certify that the
delineation has been performed in accordance with the criteria for wetlands
delineation established in the 1989 "Federal Manual for Identifying and
Delineating Jurisdictional Wetlands," or any more restrictive amendments
thereto. Wetlands shall be defined by metes and bounds.
In the event the applicant's and the Township's delineations are conflicting,
the delineation that causes the preservation of the larger area of wetlands
shall govern.
Existing land uses.
Historic buildings and resources.
All recorded easements.
Existing buildings, structures, and roads.
Photographs of the site including views of the proposed development site from
all abutting public roads.

Site Visit. After preparing the ERSAP, applicants shall arrange for a site visit of the property by
Township representatives and shall distribute copies of site analysis plan prior to the on-site
meeting. Applicants are encouraged to accompany the Township representatives. The
purpose of the visit is to familiarize officials with the property's existing conditions and special
features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to
discuss site design concepts, including the general layout of designated required open space
(if applicable), potential locations for proposed buildings and street alignments, stormwater
management concepts, and protection of resources (natural and historic). Comments made
by the Township or their staff and consultants shall be as only advisory and are not binding on
either the Township or the applicant. It shall be understood by all parties that no formal
recommendations can be offered, and no official decisions can be made, at the site visit or
during the sketch plan process.

Pre-Plan Conference. Following the site visit and prior to the first plan submission, the
applicant may meet with Township officials at a publicly advertised meeting to discuss the
findings of the site visit and to develop a mutual understanding on the general approach for
subdividing and/or developing the property. At the discretion of the Township, this conference
may be combined with or occur during the site visit.
Four-Step Design Process. The applicant shall use the four-step design process to determine
the most suitable development for the site. The layout of lots or development shall occur so
that the areas identified as being important in the site analysis are preserved and the areas of
secondary importance are used for development. The steps in the four-step design process
are as follows:
Step 1: Delineation of Areas to Be Left Undisturbed. Proposed open areas to be left
undisturbed shall be designated using the maps and materials in the ERSAP. The
Township's maps of conservation lands in the Comprehensive Plan, Open Space Plan, and
Park and Recreation Plan shall also be referenced and considered. The pre-application
conference and the site visit shall be used to determine those areas that should have
minimal or no disturbance.
The open areas identified at this stage of the design process shall include consideration for
stormwater management, taking into account areas suitable for groundwater recharge and
infiltration.
Step 2: Preparation of Resource Conservation Plan. Analysis of how resources will be
protected. Narrative shall be provided indicating the ways in which the applicant will respect
the existing features of the land described in the site analysis.
(1) Limits of Disturbance on Site. The limits of the grading and soil disturbance shall
be shown, with areas designated as important areas delineated and protected.
(2) Areas that are to be preserved should be described, including prime agricultural
soils, woodlands, vegetation, slopes, views, or any other areas identified in Step
1.
(3) Description of the manner in which stormwater will be captured on site for
maximum infiltration. This should indicate that the areas best suited for
stormwater infiltration have been selected for that purpose, based on hydrologic
soil groups and the stormwater management requirements of this chapter.
(4) Description and plan showing that existing natural contours and vegetation will
be respected.
(5) Limits on site disturbance and resources applicable to the site due to Zoning
Ordinance requirements shall be shown.
(6) Description of any historic buildings or resources on the site and proposed
efforts to preserve them.
Step 3: Location of Structures and Alignment of Infrastructure. Buildings, streets, trails,
utilities, and stormwater management.
(1) Building area shall be identified based on the areas set aside for development.
(2) Upon designating the building sites, a street plan shall be designed to provide
vehicular access to the development which reflects a logical relationship to
topographic conditions. Impacts of the street plan on open areas to be protected
shall be minimized, particularly with respect to crossing environmentally
sensitive areas such as wetlands and traversing slopes exceeding 15%.
(3) Applicant shall also indicate the locations and method for providing water
supply, wastewater treatment, and stormwater management facilities and fire
suppression facilities.
Step 4: Drawing Lot Lines. For developments where lots are proposed, lot lines are drawn
as required to delineate the boundaries of individual lots.

§ 22-403. Sketch Plans.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Purpose. The purpose of the sketch plan, which is an optional but strongly encouraged
submission, is to afford the applicant the opportunity to consult early and informally with the
Planning Commission and the Township before preparation of the preliminary plan and formal
application.
To encourage sketch plan submissions, the Township agrees to not apply a change of the Zoning
Ordinance that would adversely affect the density allowed on a subdivision for which a sketch plan
has been submitted. This protection shall apply for a period of 120 days from the date of
acceptance of the sketch plan for review and shall not be available for a period of one year for the
same property from the end of the one-hundred-twenty-day protection period.
Procedure for Sketch Plans. It is recommended that applicants for sketch plan review follow the
steps outlined in § 22-402, "Review Procedures for Plans."
Sketch Plan Submission and Review.
Applicant prepares sketch plan reflecting the information and input derived from following the
procedures in § 22-402.
Applicant submits copies of the sketch plan and application to the Township. The number of
copies to be submitted will be as stated by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
Copies of the sketch plan and application shall be distributed by the Township to the Township
Planning Commission, the Bucks County Planning Commission, the Township Engineer, and
any other agencies or individuals designated to review the plans.
This is an informal review. The applicant will describe the proposal and relate any concerns or
questions to the Township. The Township will offer a nonbinding opinion or suggest other
sources that may be able to provide guidance regarding the proposal.
The Planning Commission shall review the sketch plan in accordance with the criteria
contained in this chapter and with other applicable ordinances of the Township. Its review
shall informally advise the applicant of the extent to which the proposed subdivision or land
development conforms to the relevant standards of this chapter and environmentally
responsible design, and may suggest possible plan modifications that would increase its
degree of conformance. Its review shall include, but is not limited to:
The compatibility of the proposal with respect to the objectives and policy
recommendations of the Comprehensive Plan, Sewage Facilities Plan (Act 537), Open
Space Plan, Park and Recreation Plan, and other municipal and regional plans as
applicable.
Compatibility of the plan with the input from the pre-application conference, site visit,
ERSAP, and the four-step design process.
Consistency with the Zoning Ordinance.
The location of all areas proposed for land disturbance (streets, foundations, yards,
wastewater disposal systems, fire suppression systems, stormwater management areas,
etc.) with respect to notable features of natural or cultural significance as identified on the
applicant's ERSAP.

§ 22-404. Preliminary Plan - Major Subdivision or Land
Development.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The preliminary plan is a set of documents demonstrating compliance with zoning provisions,
showing existing features, proposed street and lot layout, storm water management facilities and
engineering detail sufficient to ensure proper functioning of proposed improvements and sufficient
to meet the plan requirements of this chapter.
Applicants who choose to submit preliminary plans without taking advantage of the sketch plan
review option may incur added engineering expense. Evaluation of planning and design issues,
ordinance issues, wastewater options, and open space issues that occur during sketch plan
review with the Township can facilitate the preliminary plan review process by addressing these
issues at an earlier stage in plan preparation.
General. A preliminary plan shall be submitted conforming to the recommendations made
during the sketch plan procedure, if sketch plan has been submitted. The preliminary plan and
all information and procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in compliance with the
provisions of these regulations.
The preliminary plan shall include all information and steps required in § 22-402 of this
chapter, specifically including the pre-application meeting, ERSAP, site visit, pre-submission
conference, and four-step design process. If these have been satisfactorily completed during
the sketch plan stage, they need not be done again.
Procedure for Submission and Acceptance.
Applicant prepares preliminary plan and complete application. The plans shall be marked
"Preliminary Plans."
Applicant submits copies of the preliminary plan and supporting information along with
the application to the Township. The number of copies to be submitted will be as stated
by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.
No preliminary plan shall be accepted unless the applicant includes required escrow and
review fees in accordance with the municipal fee schedule, and fees for the Bucks
County Planning Commission and Bucks County Conservation District reviews.
The Township shall have five business days from the date the application and plans are
received to determine whether the submission is complete. For a submission to be
considered complete, all of the documentation required by this chapter shall be included
in the plan submission. If the submission is accepted for review, the ninety-day review
period shall be calculated from the date of the regular meeting of the planning
commission following the date the application is received, provided that should the next
regular meeting be more than 30 days following the receipt of the application the review
period shall be calculated from the thirtieth day following the day the application is
received. If the plan submission is incomplete, a written statement shall be prepared and
provided to the applicant detailing the deficiencies within five business days of the date
the plans were received by the Township (the "deficiency report"). The applicant shall
resubmit plans addressing the deficiencies noted in the deficiency report within 30 days
of the date the plans were initially received. Failure to do so shall be evidence of the lack
of due diligence in processing the application and may be grounds for denial of the plan.

Distribution of Plans. The Township shall forward the plans to other reviewing agencies. Plans
are not to be delivered to any reviewing agency by the owner, applicant, developer or agent
unless specified by this chapter. After receipt of the required plan sets, application materials,
and fees, copies of the plans and application materials will be delivered by the Township to
the Township staff, Township boards and commissions assigned to review the plans, the
Bucks County Conservation District, the Bucks County Planning Commission, the
Wrightstown Township Fire Marshal, and when applicable, the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the local fire
company, and other agencies as required.
The Township Planning Commission shall review the plans and carry out its responsibilities as
set forth in the Municipalities Planning Code. The plans shall also be reviewed by the
Township staff and any other departments designated by the Township.
Following receipt of the Township Planning Commission's report and, within the time limits set
forth in the Municipalities Planning Code, the Board of Supervisors shall:
Receive, review and evaluate the applicant's submission.
Receive and review the reports by the Township Planning Commission, the Township
professional staff, the Bucks County Planning Commission, and other agencies or
officials who have submitted a report.
Determine whether the preliminary plan meets the objectives and requirements of this
chapter and the Township Zoning Ordinance.
Render a Decision. The decision shall be in writing and communicated to the applicant
personally or mailed to him at his last known address not later than 15 days following the
decision. When the application is not approved as filed, the decision shall specify the
defects found in the application, describe requirements which have not been met and
shall cite the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon. When the application is
approved with conditions, failure to appeal the conditions imposed by the Board of
Supervisors within 30 days of the date of approval shall constitute acceptance of the
conditions. Nonacceptance of and/or noncompliance with the conditions set forth in the
approval communication shall void the plan approval. The plan shall be considered
denied for noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter which were conditionally
waived in the approval; noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter which were
conditionally waived in the approval; noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter
noted by the Township Engineer in its most recent review; and for noncompliance with
the most recent review comments of the Wrightstown Township Planning Commission,
the Bucks County Planning Commission, or other entity or person charged with review of

Purpose. The purpose of the final plan is to require the applicant to demonstrate compliance with
the conditions of preliminary plan approval before plans for all subdivisions and land
developments are recorded.
General. A final plan shall be submitted conforming to the conditions of preliminary plan approval
granted during the preliminary plan procedure. The final plan and all information and procedures
relating thereto shall in all respects be in compliance with the provisions of these regulations.
Procedure.
Applicant prepares the final plan and application. The plan shall be labeled as "Final Plan."
Applicant submits copies of the final plan and application to the Township and any required
fees and escrow. The number of copies submitted shall be as stated by resolution of the
Board of Supervisors. No final plan shall be accepted unless the applicant includes all
required review and escrow fees.
The Township shall have five business days from the date the application and plans are
received to determine whether the submission is complete. For a plan to be considered
complete, all of the documentation required by this chapter shall be included in the plan
submission. If the submission is accepted, the ninety-day review period shall be calculated
from the date of the regular meeting of the Planning Commission following the date the
application is received, provided that should the next regular meeting be more than 30 days
following the receipt of the application the review period shall be calculated from the thirtieth
day following the day the application is received. If the plan submission is incomplete, a
written statement shall be prepared and provided to the applicant detailing the deficiencies
within five business days of the date the plans were received by the Township (the "deficiency
report"). The applicant shall resubmit plans addressing the deficiencies noted in the
deficiency report within 30 days of the date the plans were initially received. Failure to do so
shall be evidence of the lack of due diligence in processing the application and may be
grounds for denial of the plan.
Distribution of Plans. After receipt of the required plan sets, application materials, and fees, copies
of the plans and application materials will be delivered by the Township to the Township staff,
Township boards and commissions assigned to review the plans, the Bucks County Conservation
District, the Bucks County Planning Commission, and when applicable, the Wrightstown Township
Fire Marshal, the local fire company and other agencies as required.
The Township Planning Commission shall review the plans and carry out its responsibilities as set
forth in the Municipalities Planning Code. The plans shall also be reviewed by the Township staff
and departments designated by the Township.
Following receipt of the Township Planning Commission's report and, within the time limits set
forth in the Municipalities Planning Code, the Board of Supervisors shall:
Receive, review and evaluate the applicant's submission.
Receive and review the reports by the Township Planning Commission, the Township
professional staff, the Bucks County Planning Commission, and other agencies or officials
who have submitted a report.
Determine whether the final plan meets the conditions of preliminary plan approval and any
applicable requirements of this chapter.
Recommend plan revision if the plan does not meet any of the conditions of preliminary plan
approval and/or the requirements of this chapter, Comprehensive Plan, Act 537 Plan and
other municipal plans and ordinances.

communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him at his last known address not later
than 15 days following the decision. When the application is not approved in terms as filed,
the decision shall specify the defects found in the application, describe requirements which
have not been met and shall cite the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon. When
the application is approved with conditions, failure to appeal the conditions imposed by the
Board of Supervisors within 30 days of the date of approval shall constitute acceptance of the
conditions. Nonacceptance of and/or noncompliance with the conditions set forth in the
approval communication shall void the plan approval. The plan shall be considered denied for
noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter which were conditionally waived in the
approval; noncompliance with the provisions of this chapter noted by the Township Engineer
in its most recent review; and for noncompliance with the most recent review comments of the
Wrightstown Township Planning Commission or other entity or person charged with review of
the Plan.

warrant.
Whenever municipal or other applicable regulations impose more restrictive standards and
requirements than those outlined herein, such other regulations shall control.
Where literal compliance with the standards specified herein is clearly impractical, the Board of
Supervisors may modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while
securing substantial conformance with the objectives of this chapter.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 22-543, substantive changes may be made with regard to selected
standards in keeping with § 503(5) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC).
§ 22-502. General Standards.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
All portions of a tract being subdivided or developed shall be taken up in lots, streets, open
spaces, or other proposed uses so that remnants and landlocked areas shall not be created.
Reserve strips controlling access to lots, public rights-of-way, public lands or adjacent private
lands are prohibited.
In general, lot lines shall follow Township boundary lines rather than cross them.
The developer shall conform to all applicable performance standards, including, but not limited to,
those contained in the Zoning Ordinance.
Where the sketch or preliminary plan includes a portion of a tract, which could be further
subdivided or developed under the standards of the Zoning Ordinance, the applicant shall
demonstrate how the proposed development will affect the remainder of the site, in terms of
potential for future use, resource protection, and community circulation.
The name of a subdivision and the streets located within the subdivision shall be subject to the
approval of the Township and, once approved, shall not be changed except with the approval of
the Township as a revision to the plans.
No subdivision or street name within the municipality or zip code areas shall be repeated or be so
similar to an existing subdivision or street name so as to cause confusion between the names.
Such potential confusion shall be valid cause for the Township to deny approval of a proposed
name.
Streets that are an extension of or obviously in alignment with existing streets shall bear the
names of the existing streets.
No subdivision or street shall be given a name which contains the word "Wrightstown."
All houses shall receive address numbers. All address numbers shall be assigned by the
Township.

established by Wrightstown Township and pursuant to §§ 22-504 and 507. In wooded areas, this
may be modified to preserve trees.
Proposed streets shall conform in all respects to the municipal plan, or to other street plans or
parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township.
Proposed streets shall conform to county and state street and highway plans as have been
prepared, adopted and/or filed as prescribed by law, and to the requirements of the Newtown Area
Joint Comprehensive Plan and the Newtown Area Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance.
Streets shall be related to topography so as to produce reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage,
and suitable building sites.
Internal residential streets should be designed to discourage excessive traffic speeds; however,
the arrangement of streets should provide for continuation of existing or platted streets and for
proper access to adjoining undeveloped tracts suitable for future subdivision or development.
Through streets are preferred over loop roads and culs-de-sac.
If lots resulting from a subdivision are large enough to permit further subdivision, or if a portion of
the tract is not subdivided, adequate street rights-of-way to permit further subdivision shall be
provided as necessary, unless the remaining property is restricted from further subdivision in a
manner acceptable to the Township.
Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs to permit future street extension into
adjoining tracts, or when designed as culs-de-sac.
Stub streets greater in length than one lot depth shall be provided with a turnaround designed to
meet the standards required for culs-de-sac and shall be provided with sufficient rights-of-way to
permit further extension of the street onto adjacent property.
The construction of streets, roads, lanes and driveways, as shown upon final plans and as
contained in contract agreements, shall in every respect conform to such requirements as
Wrightstown Township may by resolution require for the construction of streets.
All streets shall be offered for public dedication. Private streets shall not be permitted.
Specifications. The minimum requirements for improvements shall be those contained in the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation's Specifications (Form 408) as last revised, or those
of Wrightstown Township, as the Township may elect.
Any applicant who encroaches within the legal right-of-way of a state highway is required to obtain
a highway occupancy permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The Township
shall require the applicant to obtain Township approval, and PennDOT approval shall not override
the need for Township approval of all street layouts, driveways, and highway occupancy
applications.
§ 22-504. Classification of Streets.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Pursuant to the table below, new streets will be classified according to the average daily traffic

§ 22-505. Transportation Impact Study.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
A transportation impact study shall be undertaken for all major subdivisions and land
developments as defined in Subsection 2 below. This study will enable the Township to assess the
impact of a proposed development on the local transportation system. Its purpose is to ensure that
proposed developments do not adversely affect the transportation network and to identify any
traffic problems associated with access from the site to the existing transportation network. The
study's purpose is also to delineate solutions to potential problems and to present improvements
to be incorporated into the proposed development. The study shall assist in the protection of air
quality, the conservation of energy and the encouragement of public transportation use.
Subdivisions and land developments for which a study is required:
A transportation impact study shall be required for all subdivisions and land developments
that meet one or more of the following criteria:
Residential. 50 or more dwelling units.

The Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, shall have
the discretion to require the posting of additional monies in escrow, by the applicant, for the
preparation of a traffic impact study for any other subdivision or land development.
The Township shall select a qualified traffic engineer and/or transportation planner with previous
traffic study experience to prepare the transportation impact study. The Township may utilize
applicant's fees, placed in escrow, to fund such studies. Studies submitted by the applicant shall
not be considered as a transportation impact study under this chapter and shall not be accepted
by the Township as such. The procedures and standards for the traffic impact study, which shall
be adhered to by the consultant, are set forth in Subsection 4 below.
The transportation impact study shall contain, but not be limited to, the following information:
General Site Description. The site description shall include the size, location, proposed land
uses, construction staging and completion date of the proposed land development. If the
development is residential, types of dwelling units and number of bedrooms shall also be
included. A brief description of other major existing and proposed land developments within
the study area shall be provided. The general site description shall also include probable
socioeconomic characteristics of potential site users to the extent that they might affect the
transportation needs of the site (i.e., number of senior citizens).
Transportation Facilities Description.
The description shall contain a full documentation of the proposed internal and existing
external transportation system. This description shall include internal vehicular, bicycle,
and pedestrian circulation, all proposed ingress and egress locations, all internal roadway
widths and rights-of-way, parking conditions, traffic channelizations, and any traffic
signals or other intersection control devices within the site. The site design shall be
shown to maximize potential public transportation usage to and from the development,
such as providing adequate turning radii at all access points to allow a bus to enter the
development. Bus shelter and sign locations shall be designated where appropriate.
The report shall describe the entire external roadway system within the study area. Major
intersections in the study area shall be identified and sketched. All existing and proposed
public transportation services and facilities within a one mile radius of the site shall also
be documented. All future highway improvements, including proposed construction and
traffic signalization, shall be noted. This information shall be obtained from the 12-Year
Highway Capital Program for the Delaware Valley Region, the Comprehensive Plan and
from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Any proposed roadway
improvements resulting from proposed surrounding developments shall also be recorded.
Existing Traffic Conditions.
Existing traffic conditions shall be measured and documented on all streets and
intersections in the study area. Traffic volumes shall be recorded for existing average
daily traffic, existing peak hour traffic and for the land development's peak hour traffic.
Complete traffic counts at all major intersections in the study area shall be conducted,
encompassing the peak highway and development-generated hour(s), and

documentation shall be included in the report. A volume/capacity analysis based upon
existing volumes shall be performed during the peak hour(s) and the peak development
generated hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the study area. Levels of
service shall be determined for each location.
This analysis will determine the adequacy of the existing roadway system to serve the
current traffic demand. Roadways and/or intersections experiencing levels of service E or
F shall be noted as congestion locations.
Transportation Impact of the Development. Estimation of vehicular trips to result from the
proposal shall be completed for both the street system and the development-generated peak
hours. Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for this calculation shall be obtained from
Table 22-1.[1] These development-generated traffic volumes shall be provided for the inbound
and outbound traffic movements as estimated. The reference source(s) and methodology
followed shall be cited. These generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and
assigned to the existing streets and intersections throughout the study area. Documentation
of all assumptions used in the distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic
volumes shall be assigned to all access points.
Pedestrian volumes shall also be calculated, if applicable. If school crossings are to be used,
pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to each crossing. Any characteristics of the site that will
cause unusual trip generation rates and/or traffic flows shall be noted.
Editor's Note: Table 22-1 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Analysis of Transportation Impact.
The total future traffic demand based on full occupancy of the proposed subdivision or
land development shall be calculated. This demand shall consist of the combination of
the existing traffic expanded to the completion year, the development generated traffic,
and the traffic generated by other proposed developments in the study area. A
volume/capacity analysis shall also be conducted using the total future demand and the
future roadway capacity. If staging of the proposed development is anticipated,
calculations for each stage of completion shall be made. This analysis shall be performed
using the peak highway hour(s) and peak development-generated hour(s) for all streets
and major intersections in the study area. Volume/capacity calculations shall be
completed for all major intersections.
All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be examined as to the feasibility of
installing traffic signals. This evaluation shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian
volumes to the warrants for traffic signal installation. Levels of service for all streets and
intersections shall be listed.
Conclusions and Recommended Improvements.
All streets and/or intersections showing a level of service below (3) shall be considered
deficient, and specific recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall be
listed. This listing of recommended improvements shall include, but not be limited to the
following elements:
Internal circulation design; site access location and design; external street and
intersection design and improvements; traffic signal installation and operation, including
signal timing; and transit design improvements.
Existing and/or future public transportation service shall also be addressed. A listing of all
actions to be undertaken to increase present public transportation usage and improve
service, if applicable, shall be included.
The listing of recommended improvements for both streets and transit shall include, for
each improvement, the party responsible for the improvement, the cost and funding of

** Parking limitations may be required by the Board of Supervisors.
Additional rights-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the Township in order to lessen
traffic congestion, to secure safety from hazards, to facilitate the adequate provision for
transportation and other public requirements, to promote Township-wide circulation and mobility,
and to promote the general welfare.
Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an existing street of inadequate rightof-
way width, additional right-of-way width shall be dedicated to conform to the standards set by
the Township. Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate cartway width, the applicant shall be required to widen and/or reconstruct the roadway
to meet current Township standards.
Wherever a tract to be subdivided or developed borders an existing half or partial street, the other
part of the street shall be constructed. No new half-streets shall be permitted.
§ 22-508. Street Alignment.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of 5°, connection shall be made by horizontal
curves. Long radius curves shall be used rather than a series of curves and tangents.
To ensure adequate sight distance, minimum center-line radii for horizontal curves shall be as
follows:
Principal arterials, minor arterials and major collectors: 500 feet.
Feeder streets and minor collectors: 300 feet.
Local streets: 150 feet.
For arterial, collector and feeder streets, a minimum tangent of 100 feet shall be required between
curves.
The approaches to an intersection shall follow a straight course for at least 100 feet as measured
from the intersection of the right of way lines.
§ 22-509. Street Grades.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Center line grades shall not be less than 1%. A minimum slope of 1% shall be provided along the
gutter line.
The maximum street grades shall be as follows:
Local Streets: 10%.
Arterials, collectors and feeders: 6%.
Vertical curves shall be used at changes in grade exceeding 1%. The length of curve shall
approximate 25 feet on local roads and 50 feet on all other roads for each 1% of change in grade.
Vertical curves shall not produce excessive flatness in grade either over crests (summits) or under
crests (sags). There shall be no dips, cross gutter bumps or humps in the paving.

Four percent for a distance of 50 feet measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines for
local and feeder streets.
Three percent for a distance of 100 feet measured from the intersecting right-of-way lines for
all other streets.
§ 22-510. Street Intersections.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Streets shall be laid out to intersect at right angles.
Streets intersecting a street of higher classification, as defined herein, shall be designated as a
stop intersection street and shall be provided with proper signage.
Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two streets shall be prohibited.
Minimum sight distances shall be provided at all intersections pursuant to § 22-512.
Minor collectors, feeders and local streets shall not intersect on the same side of an arterial or
major collector at an interval of less than 600 feet between their center lines.
Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out either directly opposite one
another or with a minimum offset of 200 feet between their center lines.
The minimum curb radii at street intersections, which shall be concentric with the street line, shall
meet PennDOT standards. In no instance shall curb radii be less than 20 feet for local streets and
35 feet for higher order streets. Where streets of different categories intersect, the radius
requirements of the higher order street shall apply.
Streets shall be designed, to the extent reasonably possible, so that they do not access another
street directly opposite an existing residence. Where no reasonable alternative to access opposite
an existing residence is possible, the plans shall provide for buffering which, in the opinion of the
Board of Supervisors, adequately protects the existing residence from headlights intruding into the
residence.
Intersections shall be designed to allow for pedestrian crossings in a safe manner by keeping
crossing distance to a minimum, by providing crosswalks, which are painted or constructed with
contrasting paving materials, to identify crosswalk areas.
§ 22-511. Street Access.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
All subdivisions and land developments creating 21 or more dwelling units must have a minimum
of two access points to existing streets.
Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial or collector street, the
Township may require marginal-access streets, reverse-frontage lots, or such other treatment as
will provide protection for abutting properties, reduce the number of intersections with the major
street and separate local and through-traffic.

§ 22-515. Stormwater Management.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Findings. The Board of Supervisors of Wrightstown Township finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development
and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by
changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and
erosion of stream-beds and stream-banks thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying
aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Through project design, impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime, and sustain high water quality,
groundwater recharge, stream baseflow, and aquatic ecosystems. The most cost effective
and environmentally advantageous way to manage stormwater runoff is through nonstructural
project design, minimizing impervious surfaces and sprawl, avoiding sensitive areas (i.e.,
stream buffers, floodplains, steep slopes), and designing to topography and soils to maintain
the natural hydrologic regime.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of
stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater
discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems can contribute to
pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the Township.

The rainfall intensity "I" curves presented in Figure 5 shall be used in determining
stormwater runoff.[1]
Editor's Note: Figure 5 is included as an attachment to this chapter.
Storm Frequency.
A ten-year storm frequency shall be used for the design of all stormwater systems,
except conveyance systems to stormwater management facilities.
In all cases where storm drainage is picked up by means of a headwall or inlet
structure, and hydraulic inlet or outlet conditions control, the pipe shall be designed
as a culvert for a twenty-five-year storm.
Storm Duration.
A five-minute storm duration shall be used if this duration does not result in a
maximum expected discharge that exceeds the capacity of a thirty-inch pipe.
If a five-minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, the time of
concentration approach shall be used in determining storm duration.
If a five-minute storm duration results in a pipe size exceeding 30 inches, within any
run of pipe, the time of concentration approach may be used for sizing of pipes from
that point on by adjusting the time of concentration.
Pipes.
Pipes shall be sized by use of Manning's equation with the pipes flowing full. The design
shall be based on gravity (nonpressure) flow.
Except when pipe class and strength are required to be increased in accordance with
PennDOT specifications, all storm pipe shall either be Class III reinforced concrete pipe
or smoothed lined high density polyethylene pipe, which type shall be subject to prior
approval by the Township.

Tree Protection During Construction.
Tree protection areas shall be delineated to implement the standards contained in the
Township Zoning Ordinance and this chapter regarding preservation of trees, woodlands,
and forests during the development and construction process.
The tree protection area shall be 15 feet from the trunk of the tree to be preserved, or the
distance from the trunk to the dripline (the line marking the outer edge of the branches of
the tree), whichever is greater. Where there is a group of trees or woodlands, the tree
protection area shall be the aggregate of the protection areas for the individual trees.
Tree protection areas shall be shown on the landscape plan and the grading plan
submitted by the applicant. Tree trunk locations as well as tree canopy locations shall be
shown.
Prior to any site work, clearing, tree removal, grading, or construction, the tree protection
area shall be delineated by the following methods:
The tree protection area that is delineated on the site prior to construction shall
conform to the approved development plans.
Forty-eight inch high orange snow fence or other suitable fence, such as super silt
fence, mounted on steel posts located eight feet on center, shall be placed along the
boundary of the tree protection area.
Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed or pulled into a tree protection area
or into trees that are to be preserved.
Grade changes and excavations shall not encroach upon the tree protection area.
No toxic materials, including petroleum products shall be stored less than 100 feet
from a tree protection area or a watercourse. If field conditions warrant, a greater
distance may be required.
The area within the tree protection area shall not be built upon nor shall any
materials be stored there either temporarily or permanently. Vehicles and equipment
shall not be parked in the tree protection area.
When tree stumps are located within 10 feet of the tree protection area, the stumps
shall be removed by means of a stump grinder to minimize the effect on surrounding
root systems.
Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment
aligned radially to the tree. This method reduces the lateral movement of the roots
during excavation, which if done by other methods could damage the intertwined
roots of adjacent trees.
Within four hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have been exposed
and/or damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily with moist peat
moss, burlap, or other biodegradable material to keep them from drying out until
permanent cover can be installed.
Sediment, retention, and detention basins shall not discharge into the tree protection
area.

Sediment, retention, and detention basins shall not be located within the tree
protection area.
Trees shall not be used for roping, cables, signs, or fencing. Nails and spikes shall
not be driven into trees.
Protection from Grade Change.
When the original grade cannot be retained at the tree protection area line, a
retaining wall shall be constructed outside the tree protection area.
Appropriate details of the retaining wall design shall be provided.
To ensure the survival of trees, the following methods shall be used.
The top of the wall shall be four inches above the finished grade level.
The wall shall be constructed of large stones, bricks, building tiles, concrete
blocks, or treated wood beams not less than six inches by six inches. A means
for drainage through the wall shall be provided so water will not accumulate on
either side of the wall. Weep holes shall be required within any wall.
Any severed roots as a result of excavation shall be trimmed so that their edges
are smooth and are cut back to a lateral root if exposed.
Trees Damaged During Construction. Tree trunks and exposed roots damaged during
construction shall be protected from further damage. Damaged branches shall be pruned
according to National Arborist Association standards. All cuts shall be made sufficiently
close to the trunk or parent limb without cutting into the branch collar or leaving a
protruding stub. All necessary pruning cuts must be made to prevent bark from being torn
from the tree and to facilitate rapid healing.
Tree Replacement. In the event that trees that are to be protected are removed or
damaged by accident or by violation of the tree protection requirements, trees shall be
replaced on an inch for inch basis.
Preservation and Replacement of Existing Trees.
Prior to final approval a calculation and estimation of existing trees shall be performed in
the presence of the Township Landscape Architect and shall be based on the following
procedures:
Trees 24 inches in caliper or greater shall be documented individually and noted on
the landscape plan and/or existing features plan.
The quantity of all trees 10 inches up to 24 inches in caliper shall be counted
individually where possible. On sites where an efficient individual count is not
possible due to size of the site or quantity of trees, estimation shall be calculated by
the following method:
Three, 100 foot by 100 foot square areas will be staked out in locations
acceptable to the owner/developer's representative and the Township
Landscape Architect.
The quantity of trees in each area will be counted and the totals averaged to
determine the average number of trees per 10,000 square feet of wooded area.
This average quantity per area will be used to determine both the quantity of
trees being removed and the quantity of trees to remain.

In accordance with Newtown Area Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance § 903.B.5, within
the CM and CR-1 Zoning Districts, no more than 15% of woodlands may be developed,
disturbed, regraded or cleared of vegetation. No more than 50% of woodlands may be
developed, disturbed, regraded or cleared of vegetation in any other Zoning District.
Within the CM and CR-1 Zoning Districts, up to 15% of the existing trees of less than 48
inches in caliper may be removed. All trees of 48 inches in caliper or greater shall be
preserved.
Within all other Zoning Districts, up to 50% of the existing trees of less than 48 inches in
caliper may be removed. However, replacement trees are required at the following ratios:
Trees of six inches in caliper but less that 12 inches in caliper to be removed shall be
replaced at a rate of 40%. Replacement trees of 2 1/2 inches in caliper shall be
required to be planted on a tree for tree basis.
Trees of 12 inches in caliper but less than 24 inches in caliper to be removed shall
be replaced at a rate of 40%. Replacement trees of three inches in caliper shall be
required to be planted on a tree for tree basis.
Trees of 24 to 47 inches in caliper to be removed shall be replaced at a rate of 40%.
Replacement trees of three inches in caliper shall be required to be planted on a
caliper inch for caliper inch basis.
Trees of 48 inches in caliper or greater shall be preserved.

Notes:
(a) No tree replacement is required in the CR-1 and CM Zoning Districts.
(b) In all districts, all trees of 48-inch caliper or greater shall be preserved.
(c) A combination of evergreen and flowering trees and shrubs may be utilized to
meet replacement tree requirements. Two evergreen or flowering trees or 10
shrubs may be utilized to meet the replacement requirement of one shade
tree.
Replacement trees may be planted in appropriate locations within the site, but may not
be utilized to fulfill other planting requirements of this chapter. Where development takes
place on fully wooded lots, the Township may permit replacement trees to be planted in
an off-site location approved by the Township. Alternatively, the Township may accept a
contribution to a capital account established by the Township for the planting of trees at
approved locations within the Township. The Board of Supervisors shall, from time to
time, by resolution establish appropriate amounts for contributions in lieu of either on-site
or off-site tree replacement and shall, from time to time, establish appropriate locations
for planting replacement trees.
Recommended Plant List. The following is the recommended list of shade trees, flowering
trees, evergreen trees, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs for use in Wrightstown
Township. However, the Board of Supervisors may permit other planting types if they are
native to the area, noninvasive, not subject to blight or disease and of the same general
character and growth habit as those listed below. The sizes listed are the minimum
acceptable sizes for required plantings at the time of installation.

§ 22-529. Nonresidential Developments.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The platting of individual lots for nonresidential uses shall be avoided in favor of a comprehensive
design of the land to be used for such purposes.
Additional width of streets adjacent to areas proposed for nonresidential use may be required by
the Township to ensure the free flow of through traffic from vehicles entering or leaving parking
areas.
For nonresidential uses, the applicant may be required to provide loading and parking areas
intended for patron use. This may be accomplished by using an alley and separate access point
for service vehicles to move from the road to the loading area. The applicant may also be required
to screen the loading area when deemed necessary by the Township. When two adjacent lots
proposed for nonresidential uses front on an arterial or major collector street, the applicant may be
required to provide common ingress and egress as well as common parking facilities. When three
or more adjacent lots are proposed for nonresidential uses, the applicant may be required to
provide a service road for common ingress and egress.
Streets shall not be connected to local streets intended for predominantly residential traffic.
Parking areas shall be located or designed in such a manner that they are visibly secluded from
eye level in any surrounding residential area. Grading to depress the parking area, raised berms,
landscaping, and/or fencing are satisfactory methods to create such seclusion.
Outdoor collection stations shall be provided for garbage and trash and for recyclable materials
when indoor collection is not provided. Collection stations shall be located to avoid being offensive
and shall be screened from view and landscaped in accordance with § 22-525, Subsection 3C(4).
No driveway or private accessway shall end in a dead end.
§ 22-530. Two-Family and Multi-Family Residential
Developments.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Approval of the preliminary plan must be obtained for the entire proposed development. Final
approval may be obtained section by section, but such sections shall be specified on the
preliminary plan and must be numbered in the proposed order that they are to be developed. Such
order of development must be adhered to, and if changes are required, plans must be resubmitted
and processed pursuant to Part 4.

Design Standards.
The land development shall be designed to be harmonious and efficient in relation to
topography, the size and shape of the site, the character of adjoining properties and the type
and size of proposed buildings.
Buildings shall be well related to their natural topography, existing desirable vegetation,
bodies of water, views within and beyond the site, and exposure to the sun and other existing
and proposed buildings.
Attached dwelling types should incorporate varied designs, architectural modes and setbacks.
Access and Circulation.
Access to dwellings and circulation between buildings and other important project facilities for
vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be comfortable and convenient for the occupants.

trucks, garbage collection, deliveries and snow removal shall be planned for efficient
operation and convenience.
Walking distances from the main entrance of a building or single-family dwelling unit to a
parking area shall be less than 100 feet. Exceptions to this standard shall be reasonably
justified by compensating advantages, such as desirable views and site preservation through
adaptation of topography. In no case shall the distance exceed 200 feet.
Access easements having a minimum width of three feet shall be provided on each attached
dwelling lot along all rear lot lines. In instances where the side lot line does not pass through a
common wall, an easement having a minimum width of three feet shall also be provided on
each such side lot line. Said easements shall remain unobstructed for the use of residents
and emergency personnel.
Grading.
Grading shall be designed for buildings, lawns, paved areas and other facilities to assure
adequate surface drainage, safe and convenient access to and around buildings, screening of
parking and other service areas and conservation of desirable existing vegetation and natural
ground forms.
Grading around buildings shall be designed to be in harmony with the natural topography.
Streets and Driveways.
Streets and/or driveways shall be provided on the site where necessary for convenient access
to dwelling units, garage compounds, parking areas, service entrances of buildings, collection
of refuse and all other necessary services. Internal streets and driveways shall enter public
streets at safe locations.
Streets and/or driveways shall be planned for convenient circulation suitable for traffic needs
and safety.
All streets and/or driveways shall be laid out to conform to the design, service, and access
standards contained herein for public streets based upon projected average daily traffic.
Streets and/or driveways shall be paved and constructed in accordance with Township
standards.

and to screen out objectionable features.
§ 22-531. Park and Recreation Requirements.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Purpose. All subdivision or land development plans submitted after the effective date of this
chapter shall provide for suitable and adequate recreation as more particularly set forth in this
chapter in order to:
Insure acquisition, development and maintenance of adequate recreational areas and
facilities to serve the people that work and live in the Township.
Maintain compliance with recreation standards as recommended by the Wrightstown
Township Park and Recreation Board and as approved by the Wrightstown Township Board of
Supervisors.
Coordinate existing recreational areas with future recreational areas.
Enhance existing recreational areas and facilities to enable them to be supportive of future
development.
Provide for the orderly acquisition and development of additional park and recreational areas.
Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to any subdivision or land development plan submitted to the
Township for approval.
Dedication of Land Suitable for Park and Recreational Use to the Township.
The developer or applicant shall dedicate land suitable for park or recreational use to
Wrightstown Township, unless one of the alternatives set forth in Subsection 6 is agreed to by
the Township and the developer. The land shall not be dedicated until the completion of the
necessary and agreed upon improvements is made to the land, and the appropriate facilities
are constructed to make the land usable for park and recreation purposes.
The amount and location of land to be dedicated to the Township shall bear a reasonable
relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the present and future
residents of Wrightstown Township. At a minimum, the following criteria for dedication of park
and recreation areas to the Township shall apply:
Residential Subdivision or Land Development. The amount of land to be dedicated for
park and recreational areas in residential subdivision or land developments, whether they
are single family dwellings or contained within multi-family dwellings, shall be as follows:
Single-Family Detached. In the case of subdivisions of single-family detached
dwellings, the developer shall dedicate a minimum of 2,500 square feet per dwelling
unit for park and recreation use.

Single-Family Cluster and Multi-Family Developments. In single-family cluster and
multi-family residential developments, the open space and recreation requirements
as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance shall be adhered to.
Any residential subdivision or land development plan, whether single-family, singlefamily
cluster or multi-family, that contains less than 30 dwelling units may be
exempted, at the option of the Board of Supervisors, from the provision of land for
parks and recreation purposes but shall be required to pay the fee-in-lieu of the offer
of dedication.
Nonresidential Subdivision and Land Development. The amount of land to be dedicated
for park and recreational areas in a nonresidential subdivision or land development shall
be 2,000 square feet per 4,000 square feet of building area, or fraction thereof. The types
of park and recreational areas that shall be deemed suitable for nonresidential
subdivisions or land developments shall include, but not be limited to:
Playing fields (baseball field, soccer field or the like, designed for active recreation,
constructed pursuant to the minimum standards of the Township Park and
Recreation Board).
Tennis court.
Tot lots (small playground especially designed for young children).
Basketball courts.
Paddle tennis courts.
Jogging paths with exercise stations.
Construction of the segment of the Township's trail system, or reservation of the
right-of-way, if the trail crosses the subject tract.
Construction of a connecting link or reservation of the right-of-way to the Township's
trail system.
The land dedicated to the Township for park and recreation purposes need not be a part
of the land development or subdivision. It may be located on a separate parcel of land,
provided that in the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, it is convenient to the
subdivision or land development. In addition, the developer, with the approval of the
Township may construct park and recreation facilities in a Township park, or the facilities
of another developer to satisfy the requirements of this section. Park and recreation
facilities which are available to all Township residents as opposed to facilities which are
available only to the residents of a particular subdivision or land development are
encouraged. Land that is intended to be offered for dedication to the Township shall
comply with the criteria established for recreation land in § 22-531, Subsection 4,
"Criteria for Locating Recreation Areas."
In the event of a conflict between the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance and this chapter
as to the amount of recreational area which must be dedicated, this chapter shall control.
When land is being dedicated, notwithstanding the foregoing, the land which is dedicated
must meet the minimum lot size for the district within which it is being dedicated.
Any land dedicated to the Township shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and
recreational facilities.

When land is dedicated, acceptance by the Township shall be by means of a deed of
dedication to which a property description of the dedicated recreational areas shall be
attached. All changes and agreements should eventually be listed directly on the signed
drawing lines. In no event shall the Township be required to accept dedication of park and
recreational areas.
Where a developer dedicates land, the acquisition value of the land plus any improvements
being placed on the land for park and recreation purposes must equal or exceed the fee in
lieu of dedication as established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors from time to time. If
the value of the fee in lieu of dedication is not met or exceeded, the developer must supply
the balance of his obligation to supply park and recreation facilities by one or more of the
alternatives set forth is Subsection 6 herein.
Criteria for Locating Recreation Areas. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors, in
exercising their duties regarding the review of subdivisions and land development plans, shall
consider the recommendations of the Park and Recreation Board as well as the following criteria
in determining whether to approve the proposed plan (which approval shall include both the use
and location of the proposed park and recreation area) in the developer's subdivision or land
development plan:
The site or sites shall be easily and safely accessible and have good ingress and egress for
vehicular and pedestrian traffic. No public road shall traverse the site or sites. At least one
side of the recreation area shall abut a street within the subdivision or land development for a
minimum distance of 50 feet for access of emergency and maintenance vehicles, and for
access to a parking lot if one is provided.
When recreational activities or facilities are adjacent to a street or parking area measures
shall be taken to ensure the safety of the users. Measures include, but are not limited to,
fencing, raised earthen berm, a hedge of plant material, or physical separation.
The site or sites shall have suitable topography (maximum of 5% slope), and soil conditions
for use and development as a recreation area.
No more than 25% of an area designated for active recreation may consist of floodplain,
wetlands, or slopes in excess of 8% or other natural resources as defined by the Township
Zoning Ordinance. Areas of floodplain, wetlands, and steep slopes may not be used for active
recreation.
Active recreation areas may contain only stormwater management facilities that are
necessary for the recreation area.
A site designated for passive recreation may contain lands with natural resources provided
that the area can be developed with trails, picnic areas, nature study area, greenways or
other activities acceptable to the Township.
The size and shape of the site or sites shall be suitable for the development as a recreation
area. The area shall consist of at least three acres and shall generally have a length to width
ratio of three to one. The configuration of the recreation area must be able to accommodate
the activities that are proposed. The recreation area shall not include narrow or irregular
pieces of land, which are remnants created by the arrangement of the building lots and/or by
streets or parking areas. The shape of the recreational area shall be suitable to accommodate
those recreation and open space activities appropriate to the location and needs of future
residents.
The recreational activities and/or facilities for which the area is intended shall be specified on
the preliminary, final and record plans.

Recreation areas shall not be traversed by utility easements unless said utilities are placed
underground and no part of them or their supportive equipment protrudes above ground level.
The following shall not be located in recreation areas: sewage treatment or disposal facilities
of any type, water storage tanks, well pump houses, and any similar use or other use which is
not related to or associated with recreation.
Active recreation areas shall be located in such a location that the use of the facility will not be
a nuisance to the residents of nearby dwelling units. However, the recreation area must be
conveniently located and easily accessible to the residents. When active recreation activities
are proposed which entail the construction and installation of equipment or playing surfaces, a
Type 2 buffer, as described in § 22-525, shall be provided when such activities abut
residential uses.
The recreation area in the proposed development shall be located adjacent to a recreation
area in an adjacent development, if one exists. When the adjacent land is vacant,
consideration shall be given to locating the recreation land so that in the future it could be
combined with the recreation land in the development of that land.
Review by the Park and Recreation Board.
At the submission of a preliminary plan, a recreation plan may be submitted to the Township
Park and Recreation Board at the discretion of the Township, which may review the plan (both
as to use and location) and make recommendations thereon in writing to the Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors. Revised plans shall be resubmitted to the Township
Park and Recreation Board for recommendations.
In certain instances the Board of Supervisors may determine that it is impractical to provide
recreation land within the subdivision where the size, shape, location, access, topography,
drainage, or other physical conditions of the land, result in there being no area within the
proposed subdivision which is practical for dedication to the public or which can be set aside
for recreation uses. In that event, the developer shall proceed in accordance with Subsection
6 hereof.
Alternatives to Dedication of Land.
Fee in Lieu of Dedication.
Where the Board of Supervisors and the developer agree that because of size, shape,
location, access, topography or other physical features of the land or any other need of
the Township, that it is impractical to dedicate as required by this chapter, the
Supervisors shall require a payment of a fee in lieu of dedication of such land from the
developer. In the evaluation of a proposed development application, the Planning
Commission, Park and Recreation Board, and Board of Supervisors shall take into
consideration the importance of providing the opportunity for recreation within the
proposed subdivision or land development. The need for recreational areas in the form of
tot lots and general-purpose playfields within the development is particularly important for
communities with higher density and small lots.
To that end, the applicant is required to provide at least a portion of the required
recreation land (2,500 square feet per lot or dwelling unit) on-site as a mini-park for the
benefit of the residents. For subdivisions or land developments consisting of two-family,
multi-family and/or single-family detached houses on lots of 20,000 square feet or less, a
minimum of 750 square feet of the required 2,500 square feet per dwelling unit or lot shall
be provided on-site as a recreation area or mini-park.
The on-site recreation area or mini-park shall comply with the following standards:

A tot-lot shall be provided with play equipment for pre-school age children and an
open, grassed playfield.
The land shall be usable land for park purposes. A minimum of 75% of the park shall
be gently sloping land that is developed as a grassed, open playfield. A maximum of
25% of the mini-park may contain natural resources such as woodland, steep slopes
and streams.
The development plans shall provide details of the play equipment and play areas
that will be provided. The mini-park shall be designed and improved to
accommodate informal unstructured recreational use.
The area of the recreation land shall be considered to be a part of the park and
recreation land that is required by § 22-531, Subsection 3B(1)(a) and (b).
The recreation land shall be conveniently located for the residents of the
development and shall have frontage on an interior street.
The mini-park shall be a destination point of the internal pedestrian bicycle
circulation system within the proposed development.
In large developments (large in terms of land area and/or number of dwelling units)
the mini-park requirement may be provided in two or more locations, provided each
is usable and functional as a recreational area.
The calculation of the fee in lieu of dedication shall be set forth in detail in a
resolution and shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and
recreation facilities by future inhabitants of Wrightstown Township.
A fee authorized under this subsection shall, upon its receipt by the Township, be
deposited in an interest-bearing account, designated the Wrightstown Township Park and
Recreation Fund. Interest earned on such accounts shall be expended only on specific
recreation facilities approved by the Board of Supervisors.
Reservation by Developer for Homeowner's Association.
Where the developer and the Board agree, the required lands necessary to be dedicated
to the Township may be reserved by the developer for use by the development's
homeowner's association. If this is agreed to by the developer and the Township, the
lands must be used solely for park or recreation purposes.
If the homeowner's association desires to dissolve and offers the land and equipment to
the Township, the Park and Recreation Board will review the land condition and
maintenance costs and provide budgetary inputs to the Board of Supervisors. The Board
of Supervisors will then determine whether they wish the land to be dedicated to the
Township or whether the homeowner's association shall be required to continue to own
and maintain it.
Combination. Where the developer and the Township agree, the developer may utilize any
combination of the aforementioned techniques to satisfy his park and recreation obligation.
However, in no circumstance shall the total value of the acquisition of land, improvements
thereon, dedicated land, or reserved land fail to meet or exceed the value of the fee in lieu of
dedication established by resolution of the Board of Supervisors from time to time.

[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Where required by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall install or cause to be installed, at
the developer's expense, street lights in accordance with the final plan approval. Provision shall be
made for energizing said lighting prior to the issuance of the first occupancy permit. The developer
shall be responsible for all costs involved in lighting the streets until such time that the streets are
accepted as public streets by the Township. When the Township accepts the streets, the Township
may by resolution assess all costs of the lighting to the property owners along the street.
The Township may waive the requirement for street lights in order to prevent glare, preserve night
darkness, and to maintain rural character.
All street lights shall be metal or fiberglass pole lights serviced by underground conduit in
accordance with a plan to be prepared by the developer's engineer and approved by the Board of
Supervisors and by PECO (an Exelon Company).
§ 22-534. Monuments.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Monuments shall be placed at each change in direction of boundary, at each angle point and at
the beginning and end of curves along all roadways, and at every lot corner. Utility and
conservation easements shall be monumented at their beginning, their end, and at all directed
changes; and areas to be conveyed for public use shall be fully monumented at their external
boundaries.
Monuments shall be placed in the ground after final grading is completed, at a time specified by
the Township Engineer. The monument shall be concrete, the size and length as may be approved
by the Township Engineer.
All monuments shall be certified for accuracy by the developer's engineer, or their accuracy
checked by the Township Engineer. Accuracy of monument shall be within 3/100 of a foot.
In cases where it is impossible to set a monument or where the permanency of a monument may
be better ensured by off-setting the monument with a reference monument(s), the Township may
authorize such procedure, provided that proper instrument sights may be obtained and complete
offset data is designated on the record plan. A reference monument (preferably two) should be set
on the boundary line(s) that intersect the corner.
§ 22-535. Water Supply.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
All water supplies proposed for any new subdivision or land development must comply with the
requirements of the Wrightstown Township Water Ordinance which include the requirement that a
water resource impact study be performed demonstrating how the hydrologic balance will be
maintained and surrounding water supplies protected.

The Township will not approve a public or centralized water system unless the development
cannot be served by on-lot, individual water systems.
All centralized water systems shall have established agreements suitable to the Township
Solicitor and approved by the Township for the ownership and maintenance of the system.
In all subdivisions and land developments to be served by a central water supply, the
developer shall construct water mains in such a manner as to make adequate water service
available to each lot or dwelling unit within the subdivision or land development.
The water supply and pressure must comply with the regulations and the standards of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Bucks County Health
Department.
Said supply shall be located or constructed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of
flood damage.
The central water supply system shall be designed with adequate capacity and appropriately

States Department Association of Fire Underwriters, the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) and Insurance Service Office (ISO). Review and approval by the Township Engineer,
fire company having jurisdiction, and the Township Fire Marshal shall be required in order to
ensure that adequate fire protection is provided.
Private Water Supply.
Where no public water is accessible, water shall be furnished by the developer on an
individual lot basis.
Private wells must meet all DEP and Bucks County Health Department standards.
If wells are installed on each lot and the lot also contains its own sewage disposal facilities,
the well shall be of the drilled type, cased and grout-sealed into the bedrock.

meeting PennDOT standards.
§ 22-541. Inspection of Streets and Improvements.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Preliminary Inspection. Prior to commencing construction, the developer shall notify the Township
Engineer of the proposed construction schedule. Pursuant to notification by the developer, the
Township Engineer shall inspect required improvements during the initial construction phase, and
on a periodic basis thereafter, as may be required to ensure proper adherence to this chapter. The
Township Engineer shall submit reports to the Board of Supervisors and the developer specifying
those items of construction, material and workmanship which do not comply with Township
specifications or the approved final plan.
Final Inspection.

profile plan such elevations.
§ 22-542. Acceptance of Streets and Improvements.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer of acceptance of required improvements if
satisfied that the applicant has complied with all specifications and ordinances of the Township.
No streets or other improvements will be accepted by the Township if such improvements were
constructed during the period from October 15 to April 15 of each year, unless otherwise
recommended by the Township Engineer.
No streets or other improvements will be accepted by the Township should said streets contain
structures erected within the street rights-of-way. This prohibition shall not apply to curbside
mailboxes, appurtenant structures of public utilities and improvements required pursuant to this
chapter.
Adequate provisions for the satisfactory maintenance of all improvements shall be made by
dedication to and acceptance for maintenance by the Township, or by any other legal entity
acceptable to the Township.
§ 22-543. Varying of Design Standards.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The Board of Supervisors, recognizing that a situation may arise where additional flexibility is
warranted, is authorized to alter the design standards specified in this chapter. The applicant shall
present evidence and demonstrate that the variation requested will result in improving the
proposed subdivision or land development which may lead to varying the design of specific
streets.
Streets. Standards for streets expressed in this chapter are intended to provide for the safe
and intelligent layout of streets which can be easily maintained at minimum cost. There are
several aspects which may lead to varying the design of specific streets.
Cartway Width. The width of streets has been established to ensure adequate movement
of traffic in times of greatest parking loads.
Where a street is designed so that all units face on local streets and where on-street
parking is not anticipated and no safety hazard will be created, the cartway width
may be reduced. This reduction is limited to 28 feet on minor collectors or 20 feet on
local streets.
Curbs. Curbs are used to channel water to storm sewers, protect pavement edges and
keep vehicles off of grassed areas. In certain cases, however, natural drainage should be
encouraged. Where topography and soils permit, roadside swales, set back a minimum
of 10 feet from the edge of the cartway, may be substituted for curbs, provided that the
alternate design:
Ensures adequate means for the protection of pavement edges.

Handles stormwater in a manner to ensure against erosion or other conditions
detrimental to the public health, safety or welfare.
Has the approval of the Township Engineer.
Right-of-Way Widths. Right-of-way widths are intended to provide enough land for
streets, sidewalks, driveway aprons, street trees, cut or fill slopes, and utilities. They are
intended to provide an additional buffer between dwelling units and streets. Where
sidewalks are not run along streets, cartway widths are reduced (see paragraph .A.1
above), utilities are located outside of the right-of-way, or dwellings will not front on the
streets, a reduction in the widths of rights-of-way may be permitted. In no instance shall a
right-of-way width be reduced to less than 33 feet.
Sidewalks. Sidewalks are intended to provide as separate means of movement for
pedestrians. Modern design practice encourages the location of sidewalks away from streets.
In order for the Board of Supervisors to waive the requirement for sidewalks to be within a
street right-of-way, all of the following provisions for relocated sidewalks shall be met:
The walks shall be all-weather and easily cleared of snow.
They shall be convenient for the most frequent trips, such as children walking to school
bus stops.
The walks shall remain as private property, and the responsibility for their maintenance
shall be clearly established, such as by a homeowner's association.
Part 6. ADMINISTRATION AND IMPROVEMENT
GUARANTEES
§ 22-601. Purpose.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]

Inspection of actual construction under any subdivision or land development plan shall be the sole
responsibility of the Township, which shall undertake reasonable measures to provide an
adequate inspection of all projects.
Any action not in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to a cease-anddesist
order and other appropriate measures necessary to obtain or produce compliance with this
chapter.
No lot, unit or other section of a subdivision shall be sold, leased, or otherwise transferred, nor
shall a building permit be issued unless a final plan has been approved and recorded.
§ 22-603. Exemption of Agricultural Subdivisions.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
Any division of land by lease for agricultural purposes into parcels of more than 10 acres and not
involving any new street or easement of access or residential dwellings shall be exempt from this
chapter.
§ 22-604. Application and Guarantee Requirements.
[Ord. 260, 9/17/2007]
The improvements required by this chapter are minimum requirements. Wrightstown Township
reserves the right in any case to increase the same if conditions so warrant in order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of Township residents.
If the Board of Supervisors approves a final plan of subdivision or land development:
[Amended by Ord. No. 315, 4/3/2017]
The Board of Supervisors shall adopt a resolution approving the final plan or issue a letter of
contingent approval.
Approval shall not be final and the construction of improvements having a public impact shall
not be commenced until the applicant provides the Township financial security and enters into
a written agreement with the Township in the manner and form set forth by the Township
Solicitor, to guarantee the construction and installation of all improvements at the developer's
expense.
The final plan or record plan shall not be signed nor recorded and construction of
improvements shall not commence until the land development agreement is executed and
financial security is posted.
Five exact copies of the approved final plan with signatures of the required agencies shall be
submitted to the Board of Supervisors.
The developer shall furnish to Wrightstown Township financial security in the form of an
irrevocable letter of credit, escrow agreement or such other surety as the Board of Supervisors
shall approve, in an amount and form approved by the Township and sufficient to cover the costs
of any improvements that may be required. Such financial security shall provide for and secure to
the public the completion of any improvements that may be required on or before the date fixed in
the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for completion of improvements. The
amount of financial security to be posted for completion of the required improvements shall be
equal to 110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for

completion by the developer. Annually, Wrightstown Township may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements that have been completed and
the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the
90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of
completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, Wrightstown Township may require the developer to
post additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals said 110%. Any
additional security shall be posted by the developer in accordance with this section.
[Amended by Ord. No. 315, 4/3/2017]
The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements, submitted in writing by an applicant or developer and
prepared by a professional engineer licensed as such in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. Wrightstown
Township, upon recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate
for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and Wrightstown Township are unable to
agree upon an estimate, the procedures set forth in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code shall be followed. If the developer requires more than one year from the date of posting of
the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements as re-established on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year
period by using the above bidding procedure.
In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Board of Supervisors may
authorize submission of final plans by section or stages of development subject to such
requirements or guarantees as to improvements in future stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the development. As the work of
installing the required improvements proceeds, the developer may request the Township to
release, from time to time, such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor performing the work. Any such request shall be in writing addressed to Wrightstown
Township and Board of Supervisors shall have 45 days from receipt of such request within which
to allow the Township Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that the
improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved plan. If Wrightstown
Township fails to act within the forty-five-day period, Wrightstown Township shall be deemed to
have approved the release of funds as requested. Wrightstown Township may, prior to final
release at the time of completion and certification by the Township Engineer, require retention of
10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
Where Wrightstown Township accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements
following completion, Wrightstown Township may require the posting of financial security to secure
structural integrity of the improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plan for a term not to
exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. The amount of this financial security
shall not exceed 15% of the cost of installation of the improvements.
If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion of improvements required as a
condition for the final approval of a plan as set forth in this section, the Township shall not
condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the construction of the
improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or land as depicted on the final plan. Moreover, if
said financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or buildings to be
erected shall not be withheld following: the improvement of the streets providing access to and
from existing public roads to such building or buildings to a permanently passable condition, as
well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted upon the approved plan, either upon
the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots in question if such improvements are necessary for the
reasonable use of or occupancy of the building or buildings.

In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain appropriate actions of
law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to
recover damages and to prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The

The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further
improve or develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a
subdivision of real property in violation of this chapter. The authority to deny such a permit or
approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
The owner of record at the time of such violation.
The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard
as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the
violation.
The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of
violation without regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property
subsequent to the time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee
had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an approval to any
such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the development of any such real
property, the Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have
been applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such
real property.
Enforcement Remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of this
chapter shall, upon being found liable therefore in a civil enforcement proceeding
commenced by the Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs,
including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Township as a result thereof. No
judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be payable until the date of the
determination of a violation by a magisterial district judge. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the magisterial district judge determining that there has been a
violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for the person, partnership
or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no such violation, in
which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the fifth day
following the date of the determination of a violation by the magisterial district judge and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
The court of common pleas, upon petition, may grant an order of stay, upon cause
shown, tolling the per diem judgment pending a final adjudication of the violation and
judgment.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to grant to any person or
entity other than the Township the right to commence any action for enforcement
pursuant to this section.

provided, they will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed the
maximum rate permitted under the "Local Tax Enabling Act."

previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit existing record legal title or interest.

Part 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 25-101. Short Title.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Wrightstown Township Act 167 Stormwater
Management Ordinance.
§ 25-102. Statement of Findings.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development and
redevelopment throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to
erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers,
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-reduction efforts in upstream and downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting from land development
and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface water resources by
changing the natural hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and
erosion of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation), destroying
aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings such as
sediments, nutrients, heavy metals, and pathogens.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including reasonable
regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the
public health, safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the municipality and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater recharge for water
supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of
stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater
discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
§ 25-103. Purpose.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare within Wrightstown
Township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime and by minimizing the harms and
maximizing the benefits described in § 25-102 of this chapter, through provisions designed to:

(For Delaware River South requirements, see §§ 25-307, 25-308 and 25-309)
Volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect stream channel morphology,
maintain groundwater recharge, and contribute to water quality improvements. Stormwater runoff
volume control methods are based on the net change in runoff volume for the two-year storm
event.
Volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection 2A or the
Simplified Method in Subsection 2B below. For regulated activities equal to or less than one acre,
this chapter establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations of the
procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors. All regulated activities greater
than one acre must use the Design Storm Method.
Design-Storm Method (Any Regulated Activity): This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions. For modeling assumptions, refer to § 25-305, Subsection 1.
Post-development total runoff should not be increased from predevelopment total runoff
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration precipitation.
The following applies in order to estimate the increased volume of runoff for the two-year,
twenty-four-hour duration precipitation event:
To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site conditions (predevelopment)
and for the proposed developed site conditions (post-development), it is recommended to
use the Soil Cover Complex Method as shown following. Table B-3 in Appendix B is
available to guide a qualified professional and/or an applicant to calculate the stormwater
runoff volume.[1] The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired, or
infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Soil Cover Complex Method:
Step 1: Runoff (inches) = Q = (P - 0.2S) /(P + 0.8S)
Where:
P = Two-year rainfall (inches).
S = (1,000/CN) - 10, the potential maximum retention (including initial
abstraction, Ia).
Step 2: Runoff Volume (cubic feet) = Q x Area x 1/12
Where:
Q = Runoff (inches).
Area = SWM area (square feet).
Editor's Note: The appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
Simplified Method (Regulated Activities Less Than or Equal to One Acre):
Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
Volume (cubic feet) = (2 inches runoff/12 inches) * impervious surface (square feet)
At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface
waters of the commonwealth. The calculated volume shall be either reused,
evapotranspired or infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.

Volume (cubic feet) = (1 inch runoff/12 inches) * impervious surface (square feet)
Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the first half inch of the
permanently removed runoff.
No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious surfaces shall be released from
the site. The release time must be over 24 to 72 hours.
Stormwater Control Measures. The applicant must demonstrate how the required volume is
controlled through stormwater best management practices (BMPs), which shall provide the
means necessary to capture, reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the total runoff volume.
If natural resources exist on the site, the applicant is required to submit an SWM site plan
and shall determine the total acreage of protected area where no disturbance is
proposed. The acreage of the protected area should be subtracted from the total site
area and not included in the stormwater management site area acreage used in
determining the volume controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area =
{Total Site Area (for both pre- and post-development conditions) - Protected Area}
Natural resource areas should be calculated based upon the municipalitys own natural
resource protection ordinance. If no ordinance exists, see Table B-2 in Appendix B for
guidance to assess the total protected area.[2] For additional reference see Chapter 5,

Editor's Note: The appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based
on the suitability of soils and site conditions (see Table B-6 in Appendix B for a list of
infiltration BMPs). Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the infiltration BMPs and
the top of bedrock or seasonally high water table.
An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load and dewater
completely as determined by field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inch per hour (in/hr)
should be utilized, and for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50% should be applied
for design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4 inch per hour, the BMP design
should use 0.2 inch per hour to ensure safe infiltration rates after construction).

All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to completely infiltrate runoff
volume within three days (72 hours) from the start of the design storm.
Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the suitability of
infiltration facilities. All regulated activities are required to perform a detailed soils
evaluation by a qualified design professional which at a minimum addresses soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general process for designing
the infiltration BMP shall be:
Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within the
site to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct geotechnical
investigations of subgrade stability; infiltration may not be ruled out without
conducting these tests.
Provide field tests, such as double-ring infiltrometer or hydraulic conductivity tests (at
the level of the proposed infiltration surface), to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for design purposes.
Design the infiltration structure based on field-determined capacity at the level of the
proposed infiltration surface and based on the safety factor of two.
If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be demonstrated to the
municipality that the soils are conducive to infiltrate on the lots identified.
An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins where the possibility of
groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the municipality.
§ 25-304. Stormwater Peak Rate Control and Management
Districts.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
Peak rate controls for large storms, up to the one-hundred-year event, are essential in order to
protect against immediate downstream erosion and flooding. The following peak rate controls
have been determined through hydrologic modeling of the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River
South watersheds.
Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware
River South watersheds for the two- , five- , ten- , twenty-five- , fifty- , and one-hundred-year
design storms are shown in Tables 304.1 and 304.2. Development sites located in each of the
management districts must control proposed development conditions' runoff rates to existing
conditions' runoff rates for the design storms in accordance with Tables 304.1 and 304.2

General. Proposed conditions' rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the
peak release rates of runoff from existing conditions for the design storms specified on the
Stormwater Management District Watershed Map (Appendix D)[1] and in this section of the
chapter.
Editor's Note: The appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
District Boundaries. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on
official maps and are available for inspection at the municipal office and county planning
offices. A copy of the Wrightstown Township Area Map with zoomed-in extents is included in

Appendix D. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they
apply to a given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the
two-foot topographic contours (or most-accurate data required) provided as part of the SWM
site plan.
Sites Located in More than One District. For a proposed development site located within two
or more stormwater management district category subareas, the peak discharge rate from
any subarea shall meet the management district criteria for the district in which the discharge
is located.
Off-Site Areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates, developers do not have to
account for runoff draining into the subject development site from an off-site area. On-site
drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development
site.
Site Areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area subject to the
management district criteria. Nonimpacted areas or nonregulated activities bypassing the
stormwater management facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
Alternate Criteria for Redevelopment Sites. For redevelopment sites, one of the following
minimum design parameters shall be accomplished, whichever is most appropriate for the
given site conditions as determined by Wrightstown Township:
Meet the full requirements specified by Tables 304.1 and 304.2, and §§ 25-304,
Subsection 1A through F; or
Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20% based upon a
comparison of existing impervious surface to proposed impervious surface.
§ 25-305. Calculation Methodology.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground cover used to determine
the existing conditions' runoff volume and flow rate shall be as follows:
Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of woods in good condition. A site is classified
as wooded if a continuous canopy of trees exists over 1/4 acre.
The undeveloped portion of the site, including agriculture, bare earth, and fallow ground,
shall be considered as meadow in good condition, unless the natural ground cover
generates a lower curve number (CN) or Rational c value (i.e., woods) as listed in Table
B-4 or B-7 in Appendix B of this chapter.[1]
Editor's Note: The appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
For sites considered redevelopment, the ground cover used to determine the existing
conditions' runoff volume and flow rate for the developed portion of the site shall be based
upon actual land cover conditions. If the developed site contains impervious surfaces, 20% of
the impervious surface area shall be considered meadow in the model for existing conditions.
Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a drainage area equal to or
greater than 200 acres shall be calculated using a generally accepted calculation technique that is
based on the NRCS Soil Cover Complex Method. Table 305.1 summarizes acceptable
computation methods. The method selected by the design professional shall be based on the
individual limitations and suitability of each method for a particular site. The municipality may allow

Q = Peak flow rate, cubic feet per second (cfs).
C = Runoff coefficient, dependent on land use/cover.
I = Design rainfall intensity, inches per hour.
A = Drainage area, acres.
All calculations consistent with this chapter using the Soil Cover Complex Method shall use the
appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return-period storms according to the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14 rain data corresponding to the
Doylestown rain gage, seen in Table B-1 in Appendix B.[2] The SCS Type II rainfall curve from
NOAA is found on Figure B-1 in Appendix B. This data may also be directly retrieved from the
NOAA Atlas 14 website: hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/pa_pfds.html. If a hydrologic computer
model such as PSRM or HEC-1/HEC-HMS is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the
duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours.

The Manning Equation is preferred for one-dimensional, gradually varied, open channel flow. In
other cases, appropriate, applicable methods should be applied; however, early coordination with
the municipality is necessary.
Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance
standards of this chapter using the generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method of
the municipality.
The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance standards of
this chapter shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using
the Storage-Indication Method. For drainage areas greater than 200 acres in size, the design
storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.
The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation

§ 25-307. Water Quality  Delaware River South Watershed.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
In addition to the performance standards and design criteria requirements of this Part, the
applicant shall comply with the following water quality requirements of this Part:
Adequate storage and treatment facilities will be provided to capture and treat stormwater
runoff from developed or disturbed areas. The recharge volume computed under § 25-308
may be a component of the water quality volume if the applicant chooses to manage both
components in a single facility. If the recharge volume is less than the water quality volume,
the remaining water quality volume may be captured and treated by methods other than
recharge/infiltration BMPs. The required water quality volume (WQv) is the storage capacity

needed to capture and to treat a portion of stormwater runoff from the developed areas of the
site produced from 90% of the average annual rainfall (P).
To achieve this goal, the following criterion is established:
The following calculation formula is to be used to determine the water quality storage
volume (WQv) in acre-feet of storage for the Delaware River South watershed:
Equation: 307.1
WQv = [(P)(Rv)(A)]/12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume (acre-feet).
P = Rainfall amount equal to 90% of events producing this rainfall (inches).
A = Area of the project contributing to the water quality BMP (acres).
Rv = 0.05 + 0.009(I), where I is the percent of the area that is impervious surface
(impervious area/A*100).
The P value for the five PennDOT rainfall regions is shown in Figure B-2 in Appendix B of
the Model Ordinance within the Plan. Since the Delaware River South is in PennDOT
Region 5, the P value to be utilized to meet this requirement is 2.04 inches.
Design of BMPs used for water quality control shall be in accordance with design
specifications outlined in the Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual or other
applicable manuals. The following factors shall be considered when evaluating the suitability
of BMPs used to control water quality at a given development site:
Total contributing drainage area.
Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
Slope and depth to bedrock.
Seasonal high-water table.
Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
Erodibility of soils.
Land availability and configuration of the topography.
Peak discharge and required volume control.
Stream bank erosion.
Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water quality problems.
The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
The nature of the pollutant being removed.
Maintenance requirements.
Creation/protection of aquatic and wildlife habitat.
Recreational value.
Enhancement of aesthetic and property value.

To accomplish the above, the applicant shall submit original and innovative designs to the
municipality for review and approval. Such designs may achieve the water quality objectives
through a combination of BMPs (best management practices).
No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall commence until
approval by the municipality of a plan which demonstrates that compliance with state water
quality requirements post-construction is complete.
The BMPs shall be designed, implemented and maintained to meet state water quality
requirements and any other more-stringent requirements as determined by the municipality.
To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated earth disturbance activities,
state water quality requirements can be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions, so that postconstruction
stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical, chemical or biological
characteristics of the receiving waters. As described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater
Management Policy (No. 392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration conditions;
Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering out of the chemical
and physical pollutants from the stormwater runoff; and
Stream Bank and Streambed Protection: management of volume and rate of postconstruction
stormwater discharges to prevent physical degradation of receiving waters
(e.g., from scouring).
Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance activities from the
appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to the municipality. The issuance of an
NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)]
satisfies the requirements of § 25-303, Subsection 2C.
§ 25-308. Groundwater Recharge (Infiltration)  Delaware River
South Watershed.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
Infiltration BMPs shall meet the following minimum requirements:
Regulated activities will be required to recharge (infiltrate) a portion of the runoff created by
the development as part of an overall stormwater management plan designed for the site. The
volume of runoff to be recharged shall be determined from § 25-308, Subsection 1A(2)(a) or
(b), depending upon demonstrated site conditions.
Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas shall be selected based
on suitability of soils and site conditions (see Table B-6 in Appendix B for a list of
Infiltration BMPs)[1] and shall be constructed on soils that have the following
characteristics:
A minimum depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the BMP and the limiting zone.
An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional stormwater load and drain
completely as determined by field tests conducted by the applicants design
professional. A minimum of 0.2 inch/hour (in/hr) should be utilized, and for
acceptable rates a safety factor of 50% should be applied for design purposes (e.g.,
8/17/2020 Township of Wrightstown, PA Ecode360

(c)
(d)
(e)
[1]
(a)
(b)
(2)
for soil which measured 0.4 in/hr, the BMP design should use 0.2 in/hr to ensure
safe infiltration rates after construction).
The recharge facility shall be capable of completely infiltrating the recharge volume
within four days (96 hours).
Pretreatment shall be provided prior to infiltration.
The requirements for recharge are applied to all disturbed areas, even if they are
ultimately to be an undeveloped land use such as grass, since studies have found
that compaction of the soils during disturbance reduces their infiltrative capacity.
Editor's Note: The appendixes are included as attachments to this chapter.
The recharge volume (Re ) shall be computed by first obtaining the infiltration
requirement using methods in either § 25-308, Subsection 1A(2)(a) or (b), then
multiplying by the total proposed impervious area. The overall required recharge volume
for a site is computed by multiplying total impervious area by the infiltration requirement.
NRCS Curve Number Equation.
The following criteria shall apply.
The NRCS runoff shall be utilized to calculate infiltration requirements (P) in inches.
For zero runoff:
Where:
Equation: 308.1
P = I (Infiltration) = (200/CN) - 2
P = I = infiltration requirement (inches)
CN = SCS (NRCS) curve number of the existing conditions
contributing to the recharge facility
This equation can be displayed graphically in, and the infiltration requirement can
also be determined from, Figure 308-1.
The recharge volume (Re ) required would therefore be computed as:
Equation: 308.2
Re = I * impervious area (SF) /12 = cubic feet (CF)
Annual Recharge Water Budget Approach
It has been determined that infiltrating 0.5 inch of runoff from the impervious areas
will aid in maintaining the hydrologic regime of the watershed. If the goals of § 25-
308, Subsection 1A(2)(a) cannot be achieved, then 0.5 inch of rainfall shall be
infiltrated from all impervious areas, up to an existing site conditions' curve number
of 81. Above a curve number of 81, Equation 308.1 or the curve in Figure 308.1
should be used to determine the infiltration requirement.
Where:
I = 0.5 inch
The recharge volume (Re ) required would therefore be computed as:
Re = I * percent impervious area (SF)/12 = cubic feet (CF)

The recharge values derived from these methods are the minimum volumes the applicant
must control through an infiltration/recharge BMP facility. However, if a site has areas of soils
where additional volume of infiltration can be achieved, the applicant is encouraged to
recharge as much of the stormwater runoff from the site as possible.
Figure 308-1. Infiltration Requirement Based Upon NRCS Curve Number
The general process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
A detailed soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to determine the suitability of
recharge facilities. The evaluation shall be performed by a qualified professional and, at a
minimum, address soil permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability.
Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and man-made features within the
watershed to determine general areas of suitability for infiltration practices.
Provide field tests, such as double-ring infiltration tests, at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface to determine the appropriate hydraulic conductivity rate.
Design the infiltration structure for the required storm volume based on field-determined
capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface.
Where the recharge volume requirement cannot be physically accomplished due to the
results of the field soils testing, supporting documentation and justification shall be
supplied to the municipality with the drainage plan.
If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed by the applicants design professional, it must
be demonstrated to the municipality that the soils are conducive to infiltration on the lots
identified.
Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in geologically susceptible areas,
such as strip mine or limestone areas. Extreme caution shall also be exercised where salt or
chloride would be a pollutant, since soils do little to filter this pollutant and it may contaminate the
groundwater. Extreme caution shall be exercised where infiltration is proposed in source water
protection areas. The qualified design professional shall evaluate the possibility of groundwater
contamination from the proposed infiltration/recharge facility and perform a hydrogeologic
justification study if necessary. The infiltration requirement in high-quality/exceptional-value waters
shall be subject to the DEPs Title 25, Chapter 93, Antidegradation Regulations. The municipality
may require the installation of an impermeable liner in BMP and/or detention basins where the
possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be
required by the municipality.

The municipality shall require the applicant to provide safeguards against groundwater

§ 25-309. Stream Bank Erosion Requirements  Delaware River
South Watershed.
[Ord. 303, 3/3/2014]
In addition to the water quality volume, to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
downstream stream bank erosion, the requirement is to design the BMP to detain the postdevelopment
two-year, twenty-four-hour design storm to the predevelopment one-year flow using
the SCS Type II distribution. Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding a small orifice
at the bottom of the outlet structure) so that the post-development one-year storm takes a
minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a point where the maximum volume of water
from the one-year storm is captured (i.e., the maximum water surface elevation is achieved in the
facility).
Release of water can begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water quality orifice is at
the invert of the facility). The design of the facility shall consider and minimize the chances of
clogging and sedimentation. Orifices smaller than three inches in diameter are not recommended.
However, if the design engineer can provide proof that the smaller orifices are protected from
clogging by use of trash racks, etc., smaller orifices may be permitted.

safe and adequate water supplies to support the intended land uses within the capacity of
available water resources and to coordinate land use policies with policies for providing water
supply in an environmentally sound manner that protects the quality and quantity of groundwater.
Any proposed water system or on-lot water supply for any zoning permit, subdivision and any land
development which does not provide an adequate water supply for use, or which adversely affects
nearby wells or streams shall be cause for denial of the well utilization permit, subdivision or land
development application, unless an alternate water supply is available.
Supply Requirements. The adequacy of the water supply shall be determined based on the
following assumptions:
Residential. An average of 3.5 persons per dwelling unit, with each person assumed to use
150 gallons of water per day.
Nonresidential. A professional engineer shall prepare an estimate of the quantity of water
needed for the proposed use. The estimates shall include peak hourly, peak daily and
average daily water demand. The estimate shall also include water needs for fire flow.
Report Requirements. The water resources impact study shall be prepared by a licensed
professional geologist qualified in hydrogeology and a professional engineer registered in the

should contain information on the depth and thickness of all water bearing zones
encountered and the yield from each zone. Yield from the well must be measured using a
quantitative method.
A pumping test of not less than 72 hours duration shall be conducted at a rate of not less
than 150% of the intended long-term withdrawal from the well. This rate must be
determined by a step test and approved by the Township before the start of the pumping

should not deviate greater than +/-5% during the test. Notice of all pumping tests shall be
given to the Township at least 72 hours before commencing the pumping test.
In order to determine the impact of the project well on existing wells, a representative sample
of existing wells, evenly spaced around the pumping well, shall be monitored for changes in
water level. The number and location of monitoring wells shall be subject to approval by the
Township before conducting a step test. Sufficient well monitoring shall be performed to allow
for the construction of hydrographs showing a continuous record of well levels before, during
and after the pumping test.
A means of accurately measuring the well discharge shall be provided subject to approval by
the Township.
Well discharge shall be directed away from the site by a method suitable to the Township and
to a point suitable to the Township.

proposed wells and wells serving adjacent land parcels within a half mile distance from the
site boundary.
The study shall contain a current water table contour map (feet above mean sea level) based
on available groundwater and surface water monitoring points. All proposed developments
are required to utilize for this purpose a minimum of three existing or new groundwater
monitoring points, optimally positioned to allow the determination of groundwater flow
direction. For sites greater than 100 acres, there shall be at least one monitoring well for each
33 acres, or a fraction thereof, of the site.
The study shall contain existing geologic and soil maps, updated with site specific
refinements.
The study shall contain the result of a pumping test 72 hours following equilibrium, but not
more than 120 hours, with the following features:
The test shall be conducted during a period of no significant recharge event, unless the
influence of recharge can be factored out.
The test shall include one pumping well (roughly centered on-site) and at least two
observation wells, all completed in the same hydrogeologic unit with their positions
established by survey and distributed at appropriate distances along and across geologic
strike from the pumping well.
Analyses shall include all pumping and recovery calculations of hydraulic conductivities
(directional), specific yield, and specific capacity, and long-term sustainable well yield
(tabulated).
The test shall be conducted as set forth in the above referenced subsections with a
pumping rate equal to or greater than the proposed peak rate of groundwater use.

§ 304. Interpretation of District Boundaries. [Readopted effective 6/
23/2007 by JMZO Ord. 2007, adopted 6/18/2007.]
Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of a district as
indicated on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
§ 305. Statements of Purpose and Intent for the Districts.
[Amended effective 10/2/2006 by JMZO Ord. 2006-09, § 1; adopted
9/27/2006, Amended effective 10/30/2006 by JMZO Ord. 2006-18,

27/2010 by JMZO Ord. 2010-02, § 01; adopted 9/22/2010.]
A. Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately coinciding
with the center lines of streets, highways, railroad lines, or streams,
such center lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
B. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said
boundaries; or where district boundaries are extensions of lot lines or
connect the intersections of lot lines, such lines shall be said district
boundaries.
C. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are approximately
parallel to center lines of streets or highways, such district boundaries
shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such distance
therefrom as indicated on the Zoning Map.
D. Section 304.A takes precedence over § 304.B, which takes precedence
over § 304.C.
A. Jericho Mountain District (JM). The Jericho Mountain District consists
of an area within the Region with limited development potential due to
steep slopes, poor suitability for on-lot sewer systems, high soil erosion
potential, and extremely limited ground-water availability. For these
reasons development is limited to single-family detached development
on large lots for scattered-type development and cluster-type
development, provided that individual on-lot waste disposal systems are
utilized in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of the Participating
Municipality where building or development is proposed.
B. Conservation Management (CM). The Conservation Management
District consists of valuable natural resources such as woodlands,
agricultural soils, floodplains, wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, and
areas of steep slopes. The Conservation Management District is
dependent on groundwater as the primary water source. Agriculture is
a significant and an important use of land in the Conservation
§ 303 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:29
Management District. For these reasons, uses are permitted in both
type and intensity which provide the maximum opportunities for open
space in order to protect the natural resources and encourage the
continuation of farming activities. Single-family detached, single-family
detached cluster, and performance subdivisions are permitted,
provided sewage disposal methods shall replenish the water table in
accordance with the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal
Comprehensive Plan and the Sewage Facilities Plan (Act 537) of the
participating municipality where building or development is proposed.
The use and ownership of open space within residential developments
shall be designed to achieve the purposes noted above and to be
compatible with other uses in the Conservation Management District.
C. Country Residential/Low Density (CR-1). The Country Residential/Low
Density District is intended to promote the maintenance of existing low
density neighborhoods in the rural areas adjacent to the Region's
villages while providing the opportunity for future infill development at
similar intensities. In addition to the existing single-family detached
dwelling units, single-family detached cluster and performance
subdivisions are permitted in order to insure the protection of the
environmental resources within the district. All wastewater disposal
shall utilize methods that shall replenish the water table in accordance
with the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan
and the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building or
development is proposed.
D. Country Residential/Medium Density (CR-2). The Country Residential/
Medium Density District is intended to accommodate medium density
development within the villages located in the more rural areas of the
Region. Single-family detached, single-family cluster, and performance
subdivisions are permitted to insure the protection of the
environmental resources of the district and to provide open space for
recreation. All wastewater disposals shall utilize methods that shall
replenish the water table in accordance with the wastewater policies of
the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan and the Act 537 Plan of the
Participating Municipality where building or development is proposed.
E. Residential/Medium Density (R-1). The Residential/Medium Density
District is intended to promote the maintenance of existing mediumdensity
neighborhoods that are already served by public sewer and
water, while providing the opportunity for single-family detached,
single-family cluster, and mixed dwelling development at higher
densities in a Performance Subdivision. This district is adjacent to the
high-density districts that are adjacent to the Borough of Newtown and
the regional shopping center where municipal services are mostly
available. Areas within this district are suitable for single-family
detached with or without on-lot sewer and water and Performance
Subdivision mixed dwelling developments. Except for single-family
detached uses, all such uses shall be served by a franchised water
company and sewer facility in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of the

intended to provide higher-density development in those areas near
major highways, commercial areas, and/or centers of employment.
Single-family detached, single-family detached cluster and Performance
Subdivision mixed dwelling development at high densities are
permitted. Restrictions are provided to maintain suitable areas of open
space. Except for single-family detached uses, all such uses shall be
served by a franchised water company and sewer facility in accordance
with the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building
or development is proposed. [Amended effective 9/23/2018 by JMZO
Ord. No. 2017-04, adopted 9/18/2018.]
G. Village Residential/Low Density (VR-1). The Village Residential/Low
Density District is intended to provide design standards and use
regulations for the older villages or neighborhoods that were built prior
to the advent of municipal planning and zoning. Single-family detached
dwelling units are permitted on larger lots.
H. Village Residential/Mixed Development (VR-4). The Village Residential/
Mixed Development is intended to provide design standards and use
regulations for the older villages and hamlets that were built prior to
the advent of municipal planning and zoning. Single-family detached
dwelling units and limited commercial and office uses are permitted on
large lots. All wastewater disposal shall be provided in accordance with
the wastewater policies of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan and
the Act 537 Plan of the Participating Municipality where building or
development is proposed.
I. Professional Service (PS). The intent of the Professional Service
Districts is to provide reasonable standards for the harmonious
development of professional and governmental offices, which are
compatible with adjacent residential uses within the villages.
J. Office Research (OR). The intent of the Office Research District is to
provide for special office and research, industrially related uses on
large tracts of land, which will provide a major employment center for
the Region while enhancing its open space characteristics and natural
features. Design standards avoid adverse impacts and encourage high
quality development which will relate compatibly to adjacent
residential areas. However, due to the increased level of traffic and
consideration of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
Interim low density uses such as various agricultural activities shall
also be permitted.
K. Professional Service (PS-2). The intent of the Professional Service-2
District is to provide reasonable standards for the harmonious
development of professional and business offices which are compatible
§ 305 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:31
with existing residential uses within the District and with surrounding
residential and non-residential uses which have been developed around
the District.
L. Village Commercial-1 (VC-1). In the Village Commercial-1 Districts, the
intent is to provide for small neighborhood commercial areas within the
major villages. There are three types of new development that can
occur within these centers: (1) development of a tract for a single use,
(2) development of a tract for a variety of uses, and (3) conversion of a
single structure into a new single use. When the land area of this
district has been fully developed, the future expansion of this district
shall be directly adjacent thereto and limited to an increase of 20% of
this District.
M. Village Commercial-2 (VC-2). The purposes of the Village Commercial-2
Districts are to achieve the type and scale of village development as
identified for the Village Commercial-1 Districts while providing for
certain automotive service uses and appropriate use criteria. VC-2
Districts are established to recognize the rural character and
commercial nature at certain designated intersections of principal
arterial roadways.
N. Convenience Commercial (CC). The purpose of Convenience
Commercial Districts is to provide reasonable standards for the orderly
development of highway-oriented businesses and commercial uses. Due
to the nature of their activities, these uses must be appropriately
located with adequate street frontage along major roads in order to be
coordinated into an overall plan which avoids undue congestion of the
streets. For this reason, most uses are conditional.
O. Planned Commercial (PC). The intent of the Planned Commercial
District is to provide for a cohesive unit of commercial stores with
transportation facilities that are arranged and constructed according to
a master plan that will provide the major commercial needs of the
Region. Because of the concentration of substantial retail activity,
increased levels of traffic, consideration of access and safety control,
large areas of parking, and the flow of pedestrian traffic, most uses are
conditional in order to insure adequate design, access, and traffic
controls and in order to insure that this area will blend with adjoining
uses and function as an asset to the region.
P. Town Commercial (TC). The intent of the Town Commercial District is to
provide a commercial area with pedestrian access and visual impact.
The uses and the regulations are intended to encourage vitality in the
commercial area through allowance of a mix of activities and uses.
Requirements for design and inclusion of public spaces will make the
area attractive to pedestrians and a destination for people outside the
area. The district requirements are designed to discourage those uses
or standards which generate large amounts of traffic and which are not
in keeping with the architectural and historic commercial area or that
would threaten the human-scale pedestrian friendliness of the area.
§ 305 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 305
I:32
Public space is an important component of the TC District. [Amended
effective 10/15/2012 by JMZO Ord. 2012-01, adopted 10/10/
2012.]
Q. Town Commercial (TC-2). The intent of the TC-2 Town Commercial-2
District is to provide a mixed use area at the entrance to the Township
that allows for residential and nonresidential uses, conversion of
residences to low-impact nonresidential uses, and a visual style
Community.
R. Rural Industrial (RI). The intent of the Rural Industrial District is to
provide for low-intensive industrial uses in those portions of the Region
where sewer facilities and water are not provided. In order to insure
that the uses are free from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odors,
glare, hazards of fire, or other objectionable effects such as extensive
use of water, and because of the increased levels of traffic and
consideration of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
S. Light Industrial (LI). The purpose of the Light Industrial District is to
provide a wide range of industrially-related uses which will provide a
major employment center for the Region while enhancing its open
space characteristics and natural features. Design standards avoid
adverse impacts and encourage high quality development which will
relate compatibly to adjacent residential areas. Wastewater
management shall be provided in accordance with the Act 537 Plan of
the Participating Municipality where building or development is
proposed. In order to insure that the uses are free from offensive noise,
vibration, smoke, odors, glare, hazards of fire, or other objectionable
effects and because of the increased levels of traffic and consideration
of access and safety control, most uses are conditional.
T. Quarry/Agricultural (QA). The intent of the Quarry/Agricultural District
is to provide for safe and efficient quarrying operations. Upon
completion of such operation, including all reclamation, the
municipality shall determine the feasibility of rezoning this district to a
residential district.
U. Rural Industrial (RI-A). The intent of the Rural Industrial (RI-A) District
is to serve the same purposes as those stated for the Rural Industrial
(RI) District and to provide appropriate locations for recycling and
refuse facility uses.
U.1. Office-Light Industrial (O-LI). The purpose of the Office-Light Industrial
District is to provide for a variety of office and industrial uses that will
complement the Light Industrial District. Design and intensity
standards are intended to avoid adverse impacts and encourage high
quality development which will relate compatibly to adjacent
residential and nonresidential areas. In order to insure that the uses are
free from offensive noise, vibration, smoke, odors, glare, hazards of fire,
or other objectionable effects and because of the increased levels of
§ 305 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 305
I:33
traffic and consideration of access and safety control, most uses are
permitted as conditional uses.
V. Municipal Services (MS). The Municipal Services District is intended to
provide for adequate areas and appropriate standards for municipal
services facilities needed to accommodate the local government
activities of the participating municipalities.
W. Educational, Institutional and Recreational District (EIR). The
Educational, Institutional and Recreational District is intended to
provide for adequate areas and appropriate standards for major
governmental and nongovernmental uses and activities that serve the
Newtown Area and the greater region. Such uses require larger land
areas, but provide for substantial open areas in a recreational or
campus setting.
X. Park and Open Space District (POS). The Park and Open Space District
is intended to recognize major land parkland by governmental bodies
and other entities who have reserved the land from developed uses.
Y. Federal Cemetery Overlay District (FCO). The Federal Cemetery
Overlay District is an overlay zone upon the Conservation Management
District and a portion of the R-2 District, recognizing the designation of
the National Veterans Cemetery in Upper Makefield Township, the
existing Historic Village of Dolington, the transfer of residential density
from the cemetery site to an area adjacent to a school use area, and the
coordination of water and sewer facilities throughout the district. In
lieu of the Conservation Management District agricultural soils
requirements, upon acquisition of the land for a Federal Cemetery, the
FCO permits two Residential Development Areas, an Age-Qualified
Housing Area, a School Use Area, an Open Space Area, and the creation
of the National Veterans Cemetery as a buffer to the Historic Village of
Dolington.
Z. Quarry/Agricultural - A (QA-A). The intent of the Quarry/Agricultural - A
is to, in addition to the previously established purposed of the Quarry/
Agricultural District, provide for a safe location for the sale of consumer
fireworks.
AA. Municipal Services Agriculture District (MSA). The Municipal Services
Agriculture District is intended to provide adequate areas and
appropriate standards for municipal service facilities needed to
accommodate the local government activities within Wrightstown
Township; to promote agriculture within the municipality by providing
opportunities for goods to be produced and sold on an approximately 12
acre portion of a 62.6 acre tract on the eastern side of Second Street
Pike, between Penns Park Road and Swamp Road, known as Chippewa
Farm and identified as Tax Map Parcel No. 53-12-18 (as of September
22, 2010, the date of adoption of this Ordinance); and to provide for the
protection, renovation, restoration, and/or adaptive reuse of buildings
and structures on Municipal Open Space within the MSA District.

Outdoor eating areas
Public spaces must be visible from and accessible from Sycamore
Street, except for any public spaces located along Newtown Creek,

not necessarily visible from the street. Properties on the east side
of Sycamore Street that abut Newtown Creek are encouraged to
use the creek as all or part of any required public space. Access to
Newtown Creek may be designed as a natural area, walking path,
building entrance, or outdoor eating area. Access to Newtown
Creek is an option that is encouraged but that is not required.
3. Sidewalks shall be a minimum of four feet wide as opposed to the
Township ordinance requirements (as required by this Ordinance
or by the Subdivision/Land Development Ordinance).
§ 603 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 603
I:89
4. Parking.
a. Parking for the following uses in the TC District may be

c. Where two or more adjacent property owners agree to share
parking and access improvements, in a manner approved by
the Board of Supervisors, to ensure adequate improvements
are provided and the requirements of this Ordinance and those
of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance will be
met, the requirement for two off-street parking spaces shall be
eliminated or a new curb cut (access point) is avoided. In
addition, the requirements for two off-street parking spaces

impede the flow of vehicular traffic on the site. Seasonal farmers'
markets shall be permitted.
8. Required Design Review.
a. In accordance with Section 605 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code,15 the TC District is declared a
special area as a major thoroughfare and an area of unique
historical and architectural interest and is hereby designated
as an area requiring design review by the Township.
b. No structure or improvement on any land within the TC
District shall be made until the plans for the exterior
architectural features, signs, parking and vehicular and
pedestrian access, and landscaping have been reviewed and
approved by the Board of Supervisors. The review shall not be
required for regular maintenance of a structure, painting, or
exterior color changes. Properties within the TC District and
also within the designated Historic District shall be subject to
review by the Historic Architectural Review Board. The Board
of Supervisors may consult with the HARB for properties
within the TC District that are outside the Historic District, but
the Historic District procedures shall not be applied in that
case.
c. No specific architectural style shall be imposed on applicants.
Factors to be considered by the Board of Supervisors are:
(1) If a lot is being redeveloped, can the existing structures be
used? Preference is given to the reuse of existing
structures rather than removal and building new
structures.
(2) Franchise architecture, used by national or chain
companies, is discouraged in favor of reusing existing
building or designs that reflect the architecture of
Sycamore Street. Use of design, materials, color, lighting,
texture, mass or roofline designed to serve as an
advertisement or commercial display do not meet the
standards of the Township and shall not be approved.
Franchise logos may be included in signage that meets
ordinance requirements.

1. The natural resource restrictions, herein, shall apply to all uses.
2. Site alterations, regrading, filling, or clearing of vegetation prior to
approval of final plan by the governing body shall be a violation of
this Ordinance. However, this Section shall not prohibit any land
management practices that may be necessary for the ecological
improvement of any stream, pond, lake, or wetland or for forest
production, provided that all applicable permits have been
obtained from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection.
B. Requirements for All Uses.
1. Floodplain and Floodplain Soils. All such lands shall remain as open
space. No structures, filling, piping, diverting, or stormwater
detention basins shall be permitted within the floodplain unless
permitted pursuant to the Floodplain Ordinance of the respective
municipality where the property is located. [Amended effective
12/9/2017 by JMZO Ord. No. 2015-02, adopted 12/4/2017.]
2. Lakes, Ponds, Wetlands, and Waters of the Commonwealth.
a. These areas shall remain as open space. No development,
filling, piping, or diverting shall be permitted.
b. Wetland Transition Area.
(1) In order to minimize the adverse impacts of human
activity; to prevent groundwater contamination; to reduce
surface run-off and sedimentation; to protect the
hydrology of the wetland; and to protect wildlife habitats,
a Wetland Transition Area shall be established in the
Jericho Mountain (JM), Conservation Management (CM),
Country Residential/Low Density (CR-1), Country
Residential/Medium Density (CR-2) and Village
Commercial-1 (VC-1). This transition area shall be
§ 902 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:251
established as a buffer extending from the outer limit
of the wetlands as defined in this Ordinance a minimum
distance of 50 feet,. Where sensitive site features warrant
additional protection, the Wetland Transition Area shall be
extended in accordance with the most restrictive of the
following conditions:
(a) Where the 300 feet of land adjacent to the outer limit
of the wetlands has an average upland slope in excess
of 10%, the Wetland Transition Area shall be increased
by four feet for each degree of slope above 10%,
however, in no case shall the Wetland Transition Area
exceed 100 feet.
(b) Where wetlands support wildlife on the PNDI list and
plant life species as identified therein, the Wetland
Transition Area shall be increased to 100 feet, and
there shall not be any disturbance within 50 feet of the
wetland transition area. It shall be presumed that the
wetlands support wildlife and plant life species
identified on the PNDI list, unless the applicant or
property owner provides a habitat suitability
assessment showing: 1) that the species do not reside
within the transition area, and 2) that the transition
area is not suitable as habitat of the species.
(2) Where in the opinion of the Township, disturbance to the
shape, but not the square footage, of a Wetland Transition
Area on a tract or parcel of land will mitigate the
environmental impact or result in minimal environmental
impact, and the modified transition area continues to serve
the transition function, the width of the Wetland Transition
Area may be reduced to 50% of its required width, so long
as it is compensated by increasing the transition area
width in another portion of the same wetland area on the
same site, and the total required Wetland Transition Area
square footage is not reduced. In no event shall more than
20% of the Wetland Transition Area be disturbed or
stripped of its vegetation. There shall be no disturbance
within 50 feet of a delineated wetlands which supports
plant and wildlife identified on the PNDI list of a wetland
be disturbed and 25 feet of all other delineated wetlands.
(3) The following activities are permitted in Wetland
Transition Areas:
(a) The Wetland Transition Areas shall remain in a natural
state, but pruning of existing vegetation, planting of
native vegetation, and removal of invasive species
subject to compliance with the restrictions listed in
this Ordinance shall be permitted.
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:252
(b) Streets and driveway crossings, that do not disturb
more than .1 acre (one-tenth of an acre) of the
transition area within the tract or parcel, and for
which compensation is provided in terms of equivalent
increased transition area in the same wetland area on
the same site.
(4) Wetland Transition Areas are restricted from the following
activities:
(a) Removal, dumping, filling, excavation, or disturbance
of the soil, other than in association with any activities
identified in § 903.B.2.b.3 hereof.
(b) Erection of structures or paving, other than in
association with any activities identified in
§ 903.B.2.b.3 hereof.
(c) Destruction of plant life which would alter vegetation
patterns.
(d) Underground utilities, unless the property owner or
applicant can demonstrate that no feasible alternative
locations are available, and further provided that
hydrology stops exist to prevent a change in the
natural conveyance of natural ground water. Any
disturbed area shall be restored to its original state
following disturbance activity.
(5) Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to relieve a
property owner or applicant of the requirement to obtain a
Floodplain Permit under the provisions of the Floodplain
Ordinance of the respective municipality where the
property is located or a Conditional Use under § 903.B.13,
"Riparian Buffer Overlay Zone." [Amended effective 12/

[5] The effect of any increased water runoff on all
adjacent properties and any other property which
will be materially affected by increased water runoff.
b. Exemptions. Areas of steep slope that are less than 3,000
square feet shall be exempted from these standards.
5. Woodland Associations. All wooded areas greater than 1/4 acre
shall be subject to the following restrictions:
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:254
a. Zoning districts of JM, CM, and CR-1: no more than 15% of
such areas shall be developed and/or regraded or cleared of

designated. No land within the tree protection zone shall be
altered, regraded, compacted, or built upon, or used for
storage or parking of vehicles.
b. The site layout plan shall indicate all existing trees which are
to be saved, the tree protection zone boundary, and the method
by which protection will occur. In addition, tree protection
techniques, in accordance with the local municipal Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance, shall be indicated on the
plan and its provisions shall be adhered to during construction.
c. No live tree of girth greater than 10 inches measured at a point
four feet above grade shall be removed in connection with a
land development or building permit unless a zoning permit for
a specific number of trees in a specific location is first obtained
from the municipal zoning officer upon recommendation by the
local planning commission. Permits will be granted only where
tree removal will not adversely affect the intent of this Section
or the utility and character of the overall foliage of the parcel
or lot in question. In no case will removal of trees exceed the
standards for steep slopes or woodland protection within
subsections 903.B.4 and 5. The permit provisions of this
Section shall not apply to a landowner who wishes to remove
an individual tree not in conjunction with a land development
or building permit.
d. For all healthy trees of a girth greater than 10 inches as
measured at a point four feet above grade, the following
standards shall apply. No greater than 1/3 of the roots may be
disturbed by the removal of topsoil or paving provided that a
similar amount of the canopy has been removed by a trained
arborist. Any filling within 35 feet of the trunk shall require a
tree well and/or aeration channels in accordance with the
standards of the American Association of Nurserymen, Inc.
7. Agricultural Soils. In the CM District, in areas of Agricultural Soils
as defined at § 205 of this Ordinance, the following standards shall
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:255

except as provided in Footnote 1 of § 902.B.2.b.
8. Aquifer Recharge Areas. (To be added by amendment)
9. Stormwater. All developments shall limit the rate of stormwater
runoff so that no greater rate of runoff is permitted than that of the
site in its pre-development condition. Where farm field or disturbed
earth is the pre-development condition, meadow shall be used as
the starting base for such calculations instead of the actual predevelopment
condition. All runoff calculations shall be based on
one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms. The method for such
calculations shall be that contained in the United States
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation "Engineering Field
Manual Notice  TR-55," as amended.
10. Soil Erosion and Sedimentation. All developments shall protect
streams, lakes, and ponds from sedimentation damage and shall
control erosion in accordance with the "Clean Streams Law" P.L.
1987, Chapter 102, except that in addition all developments shall
submit a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan as required by
the municipal subdivision and land development ordinance as part
of the preliminary land development plan even 25 acres in extent.
11. Grading and Erosion Control. During the preparation for
installation of and use of areas coming under this control, the
developer shall meet the requirements specified in § 903.B.10 of
this Ordinance.
a. No increased erosion will occur as a result of the planned
development of the lot;
b. No increased water run-off will occur which will materially and
adversely affect any property other than the lot to be
developed.
12. A Delaware Canal Overlay District is hereby created and adopted
which shall, except as noted herein, comprise all land areas within
60 feet of the property line of the Delaware Canal structure. The
property line of the Delaware Canal shall be determined from a
survey to be provided by an applicant or owner in accordance with
the regulations and guidelines of the DCNR and the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A typical cross-section as
promulgated by the DCNR is attached hereto and adopted as a
representative sample of the methodology of establishing the lot
line.
a. Purpose. A Delaware Canal Overlay Zoning District is created
for the following purposes:30
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:256
(1) To preserve natural, scenic and historic values in the
environment, especially along the Federally-recognized
Delaware and Lehigh Navigation Canal National Heritage
Corridor and the Delaware Canal State Park; and
(2) To preserve woodlands, riparian buffers and to conserve
other areas of significant environmental sensitivity that
should not be intensely developed; and
(3) To protect the public health and safety of existing
residents against the harm from flooding; and
(4) To regulate uses and structures at, along or near natural
or artificial bodies of water, especially to avoid increased
erosion; and
(5) To regulate uses and structures at, places having unique
historical, architectural patriotic interest or value; and
(6) To regulate uses and structures at, along or near places of
relatively steep slope or grade, or other areas of hazardous
geological or topographic features, especially to avoid
increased erosion and sedimentation; and
(7) To encourage compatible land uses along the Delaware
Canal; and
(8) To encourage landowners, where the dimensions of the
property and proposed new structure(s) or
improvement(s) permit, to locate structures or
improvements as close to the front yard setback line (or, if
the property fronts on the canal, the rear yard setback
line) in order to maximize the special setback area and
minimize encroachments into the canal viewshed, all in
furtherance of the purposes of this overlay district.
b. Relationship to Other Zoning Districts. The Canal Overlay
District is an overlay to the existing zoning districts. The
provisions of the underlying district shall remain in full force,
except where the provisions of the overlay district differ from
the provisions of the underlying district, in which case the
provision which is more restrictive and less permissive to a
landowner or applicant shall apply.
c. Special Minimum Setbacks for New Structures. Sixty feet from
the lot line for the Delaware Canal State Park as established by
a survey to be performed by the owner or applicant in
conformance with the regulations and guidelines of the DCNR
and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A typical cross-section as
promulgated by the DCNR is attached hereto and adopted as a
30.Editor's Note: See Attachment 3 to this article.
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:257
representative sample of the methodology of establishing the
lot line.
(1) The overlay district setback requirement shall terminate at
the edge of River Road or Taylorsville Road, i.e., the
setback requirement shall not extend to land on the
opposite side of River Road or Taylorsville Road from the
canal.
(2) If a principal structure as proposed meets all other
requirements, including impervious surface, but cannot fit
within the building envelope created by the applicable
front, side and/or rear yard setback requirements and the
special setback created by this Section, then the setback of
the yard which is opposite the canal lot line reduced by no
more than 25% of the setback requirement of that yard.
(3) Structures subject to the special set-back created by this
Section shall include the principal structure on a lot and
those improvements which are considered structures
under Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance § 1000.E.3.b.(1),
namely, patios, porches, decks and similar structures, but
as applied to all lots regardless of size. Projections into
yards which are permitted under JMZO § 1000.E.3.a. shall
be permitted in the special setback created by this
Section. Accessory buildings which are permitted under
JMZO § 1000.E.4 shall be permitted in the special set-back
created by this Section so long as there are no more
stringent provisions prohibiting or placing other
limitations on said structures contained elsewhere in the
JMZO. In that event, the most stringent provisions shall
apply.
d. Buffer Yards.
(1) The first 30 feet of the special set-back created by this
Section, i.e., the 30 feet closest to the edge of the
Delaware Canal shall be a buffer yard composed of
planting of indigenous species of deciduous and/or
evergreen trees and shrubs whenever there is present or
proposed to be on any lot a new or expanded:
(a) Commercial or industrial use;
(b) Outdoor commercial or industrial storage area;
(c) Area routinely used for the parking, loading or
unloading of motor vehicles; or,
(d) Stormwater detention basin of more than 20,000
square feet in maximum detention area, unless the
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:258
basin is planted in grass and is suitable for being
mowed or will clearly resemble a natural pond.
The buffer yard provided for in this subsection d., shall
be part of and not in addition to, the special minimum
setback provided for in subsection c., of this Section.
(2) The requirement of § 1003 of the Joint Municipal Zoning
Ordinance regarding screening, landscaping and plant
materials shall apply to the buffer yards. The buffer yard
shall be free of above-ground structures (temporary and
permanent), dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage
or display, manufacturing or processing activity, material,
loading or unloading areas, or vehicular parking. No new
driveways or roadways shall be permitted in the buffer
yards except at points of ingress and egress. Septic
systems shall be permitted in the buffer yard provided the
entire system is an underground system (i.e., the entire
system is underground) and any portions of the system
which are, of necessity, located above ground are fully
screened from view from the canal with the appropriate
plantings. In no case shall sand mounds or spray irrigation
systems be permitted within the buffer yard.
(3) If a substantial natural berm or slope or dense vegetation
will be maintained and will be substantial enough to meet
the buffer provisions of this Section, or if topographic
conditions or the creations of berming by the developer
would clearly relieve the need and cause for screening the
Applicant may request appropriate relief from the Zoning
Hearing Board.
(4) Any fence that may be constructed shall be on the inside of
any required screening.
(5) Required plant materials shall have a minimum height
when planted of three feet. Plant materials used in the
planting screen shall be of such species, spacing and size
as can reasonably be expected to produce, within five
years, a solid year-round visual screen at least six feet in
height.
(6) When the use of the land in this district is subject to the
buffering requirements of the canal zoning overlay, the
following light encroachment controls shall be imposed to
control the spillage of light into the buffer and canal.
(a) Any primary structure, accessory structure, or other
device used to support any luminary that provides
illumination shall not allow the illumination to be
directed in the direction of the canal. Stray light shall
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:259
not be directed or focused onto the canal and the
buffer zone.
To accomplish these goals, the following restrictions
are imposed to control the spillage or focusing of light:
[1] No light fixtures shall be mounted on the wall of
any structure facing in the direction of the canal
that would allow the light emitted from that
fixture to illuminate the buffer zone of the canal.
[2] Light fixtures mounted on the wall of any
structure facing the canal shall be of the "full
shielded cut-off type" as defined by the IESNA.
There shall be no projecting refractors to allow
surface brightness.
[3] Light fixtures mounted on walls perpendicular to
the buffer zone shall have fully opaque sides and
not allow the transmission of any lateral light in
the direction of the buffer and the canal. There
shall be no projecting refractors to allow surface
brightness.
[4] Lighting fixtures mounted on poles located within
the setback shall not exceed 20 feet in height and
any fixture mounted on such pole shall be of the
"fully shielded cut-off type" as defined by the
IESNA and shall not exceed one-tenth foot
candles at the thirty-foot buffer yard portion of
the setback. There shall be no projecting
refractors to allow surface brightness.
e. Special Exceptions. Any structure, roadway, driveway or other
improvement which is proposed to be constructed in the
setback area or buffer yard provided for in this Section shall be
permitted only as special exception granted by the Zoning
Hearing Board.
f. Non-conforming Lots. Existing uses and structures shall be
considered non-conforming and nothing herein shall prevent
their continued existence or natural expansion, as permitted by
law, provided, however, that no such expansion shall encroach
further toward the canal than does any existing structure or
use.
13. Riparian Buffer Overlay Zone.
a. Creation and Purposes of Riparian Buffers. A Riparian Buffer
Overlay Zone (RBOZ) shall be and hereby is created in order to
protect and preserve the numerous benefits that are provided
by riparian buffers, including the following:
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:260
(1) Reduction of the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic
matter, pesticides, and other harmful substances that
reach watercourses through subsurface and surface flow
pathways through natural processes including filtration,
deposition, absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, and
denitrification, and by improving infiltration, sheet flow,
and stabilizing concentrated flows. The consumption of
nitrogen and denitrification in surface and groundwater
and the trapping of phosphorus-laden sediment and other
pollutants resulting from adjacent land uses, thereby
protecting water quality are critical;
(2) Provision of shade which moderates stream temperature
and protects fish habitats by retaining more dissolved
oxygen and encouraging the growth of diatoms, beneficial
algae and aquatic insects;
(3) Provision for stream bank stability that protects fish
habitats and controls sediment and erosion. Tree roots
consolidate the soils of floodplains and stream banks,
reducing the potential for severe bank erosion;
(4) Provision of organic matter through leaves which fall into
the stream and are trapped on woody debris (fallen trees
and limbs) and rocks where they provide food and habitats
for small bottom dwelling creatures (such as insects,
amphibians, crustaceans and small fish), which are critical
to the aquatic food chain; and
(5) Conservation of natural features important to land or
water resources (e.g. headwater areas, groundwater
recharge zones, floodways, floodplains, springs, streams,
woodlands, and prime wildlife habitats) that exist on
developed and undeveloped land.
b. Definitions. When used in this subsection 903.B.13 the
following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
(1) The term "stream channel" shall mean the bed and banks
of a watercourse or Waters of the Commonwealth,
excluding roadside ditches, man-made drainage swales,
and drainage improvements constructed pursuant to
normal farming practices that confine and conduct
continuously or intermittently flowing water in or through
a participating Municipality.
(2) The term "land disturbance" shall mean any activity that
exposes soil, alters topography, alters the existing
structure of a woodland or hedgerow and/or removes
vegetation. Alteration includes the cutting or removal of
trees, understory shrubs and vines, woody and herbaceous
woodland floor species as well as the removal of humus or
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:261
duff from the ground. The term "land disturbance" shall
not include the mowing and routine maintenance of
existing lawn or any lawn area that may be permitted
within the RBOZ after the effective date of this Ordinance.
(3) The term "solar access window" shall mean the minimum
opening in the tree canopy needed to provide to the south
side of a structure that level of solar access which is
required for the effective operation of its solar energy
system. Any such solar access window shall be identified
and quantified on a solar energy plan prepared by a
professional, including an architect, with experience in the
design, construction or installation of active and/or passive
solar energy. Ground cover and the shrub or understory
layer may not be disturbed to create a solar access
window.
c. Relationship to Other Zoning Regulations. The RBOZ is an
overlay to the existing zoning districts within the participating
municipalities. The provisions of the underlying district shall
remain in full force, except where the provisions of the RBOZ
differ from the provisions of the underlying district, in which
case the provision which is more restrictive, and less
permissive, to a landowner or applicant shall apply.
d. Establishment. Measurement of the RBOZ shall be and is
hereby established as follows:
(1) Zone One. This zone will begin at each edge of a stream
channel and occupy a minimum width of 25 feet measured
horizontally on a line perpendicular to the top of the bank.
Where the land within 25 feet of the defined edge of a
stream channel has an upland slope greater than 10%,
Zone One shall include the land from the stream channel
edge and the upland slope and shall further extend
outward 25 feet from the edge or top of such upland slope;
(2) Zone Two. This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone
One and occupy a minimum width of 25 feet in addition to
Zone One, unless modified herein. Where the onehundred-
year floodplain extends greater than 50 feet from
the waterway, Zone One shall remain a minimum of 25
feet, and Zone Two shall extend from the outer edge of
Zone One to the outer edge of the one-hundred-year
floodplain.
e. Activities and Uses Permitted in the RBOZ.
(1) No structure, land disturbance or use shall be permitted
within the RBOZ unless permitted herein as of right, or by
zoning permit, or specifically authorized by conditional use
or special exception as provided herein. Notwithstanding
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:262
the foregoing, in no event shall any of the following
activities or uses be permitted: (a) any solid or hazardous
waste facilities, including but not limited to sanitary
landfills, transfer stations or wastewater lagoons; (b)
junkyards, commercial or industrial storage facilities or
open storage of vehicles and materials; and
(2) The allowance of any activity, structure or other use under
this Section, whether by right, permit, special exception or
otherwise, shall not constitute a waiver of the
requirements of any other applicable federal, state or local
laws or regulations.
(3) In Zone One, the following uses shall be permitted:
(a) Pruning and removal of trees and other vegetation
which are dead, diseased or in such a condition or
physical position as to constitute (a) a danger to the
structures or occupants of property or a public rightof-
way, or (b) a threat to the well-being of other viable
trees and shrubs or the stream channel, provided that
any such activities are performed by hand or with the
aid only of tools or power equipment which are handheld;
(b) Unpaved hiking, biking or bridle trails;
(c) Fishing areas, provided, however, that the area
provided for any such use on a lot shall not exceed
20% of the area of the riparian buffer on that lot;
(d) Wildlife sanctuaries, arboretums, woodland, and other
natural resource preserves, but excluding buildings;
(e) Selective cutting of trees and/or the clearing of other
vegetation when necessary to prepare land for a use
permitted by the underlying zoning district. Removal
of trees and/or vegetation is subject to revegetation by
native plants that are most suited to the riparian
corridor;
(f) Customary agricultural practices in accordance with a
soil conservation plan approved by Bucks County
Conservation District, provided, however, that no such
agricultural practices shall be conducted within 25
feet of the edge of any stream channel;
(g) Routine maintenance and cleaning of streams and
stream channels pursuant to all applicable federal,
state, and county laws and regulations;
§ 903 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 903
I:263
(h) Creation of a solar access window to the extent it
involves only the topping of trees. For purposes of this
subsection only, the term "topping" shall mean the
removal of the minimum portion of the top of a tree
which is required to provide solar access without
adversely affecting the viability of the tree. Whenever
a tree is removed under and pursuant to this
subsection, or is rendered nonviable as a result of
being topped, a shrub or understory tree shall be
planted in place of each tree removed;
(i) Dredging or grading when incidental to permitted
uses.
(j) The following uses shall be permitted in Zone One by
conditional use only: corridor crossings of
recreational trails, roads, railroads, centralized sewer
and/or water lines, and public utility transmission
lines.
(4) Uses Permitted in Zone Two.
(a) All uses permitted in Zone One.
(b) Reconstruction of a nonconforming building or
structure may occur in compliance with § 1209 of the
JMZO and any other applicable provisions of the JMZO
regarding nonconforming buildings and/or structures.
(c) Any of the following uses shall be permitted in Zone
Two as a special exception when authorized by the
local Zoning Hearing Board subject to Article XV and
the "Use Regulations," Article VIII, of the JMZO:
[1] Residential accessory structures and uses
including: H-3 Residential Accessory Structure,
H-5 Accessory Building, H-6 Outdoor Storage, H-7
Temporary Structure, H-8 Swimming Pool. The
foregoing uses shall be permitted within the
Riparian Buffer Zone but not within 25 feet of the
edge of any stream channel;
[2] Recreational Uses including Uses C-5
Recreational Facility, C-6 Athletic Facility, C-7 Golf

(d) Any of the following uses shall be permitted in Zone
Two as a conditional use when authorized by the
governing body of the municipality in which the use
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 903
I:264
will be located, subject to requirements for conditional
uses as set forth in this JMZO, as well as the "Use
Regulations," Article VIII, of the JMZO:
[1] Dams, culverts, bridges roads, and the facilities of
all utilities, including sanitary and storm sewers

federal, state, county and local laws or
regulations, and any disturbances offset by
riparian corridor improvements approved by the
Township; and
[2] Detention or retention basins and related outfall
facilities.
(5) The above conditional uses and special exception uses are
permitted on the condition that the landowner shows that
there is insufficient room outside the riparian buffer to
accommodate the particular use or accessory use, and
provided that there is no other reasonable alternative to
establishment of the use in the riparian buffer.
f. Exemptions. The areas along the Newtown Creek and Core
Creek in Newtown Township and the area along the Delaware
Canal are exempt from the requirements of this Section.
g. Restoration and Revegetation of Riparian Buffers. The
requirements of this Section shall apply to those all uses in the
RBOZ whether permitted by right, by conditional use, or by
special exception, and in cases where a subdivision or land
development is proposed. Native vegetation approved by the
Municipality must be used in replanting efforts. Three layers of
vegetation are required when replanting the riparian corridor.
Three layers include herbaceous plants that serve as ground
cover, understory shrubs, and trees that form an overhead
canopy. The revegetation plan shall be prepared by a qualified
professional such as a landscape architect or engineer, shall
comply with the following minimum requirements, and shall be
subject to the approval of the Municipal Engineer:
(1) Ground Cover. Ground cover consisting of a native seed
mix extending a minimum of 25 feet in width from the edge
of the stream bank must be provided along the portion(s)
of the stream corridor where little or no riparian
vegetation exists. Appropriate ground cover includes
native herbs and forbs exclusive of noxious weeds as
defined by the Pennsylvania State Department of
Agriculture. This twenty-five-foot wide planted area shall
be designated on the plan as a "no mow zone" and shall be

(2) Trees and Shrubs. These planting layers include trees that
form an overhead canopy and understory shrubs.
Overstory trees are deciduous or evergreen trees that
include oak, hickory, maple gum, beech, sycamore,
hemlock, pine and fir. Evergreen and deciduous shrubs
should consist of elderberry, viburnum, azalea,
rhododendron, holly, laurel and alders. These plants shall
be planted in an informal manner clustered within the
riparian buffer. These plants shall be provided at a rate of
at least one overstory tree and three shrubs for every 20
linear feet of waterway.
A. Requirements for All Uses.
1. No use shall be permitted which is noxious or offensive in the
immediate surrounding areas by reason of odor, dust, smoke, gas,
vibration, illumination, or noise, or which constitutes a public
hazard whether by fire, explosion, or otherwise. In determining
whether a proposed use is noxious, hazardous, or offensive, the
following standards shall apply. The proposed operation shall not:
a. Constitute any nuisance whatsoever beyond the boundary of a
site on which the use is located by reason of dissemination of
noxious, toxic, or corrosive fumes, smoke, odor, or dust. (All
fixed equipment shall be operated by electric power, gas, or
other smokeless fuel);
b. Result in noise or vibration exceeding the average intensity of
noise or vibration occurring from other causes at the boundary
line;
c. Endanger surrounding areas by reason of fire or explosion;
d. Produce objectionable heat, glare, or radiation beyond the
property line;
e. Result in major electrical disturbance in nearby residences, or
adversely affect the operation of equipment other than on the
property on which the disturbance is located, when such
equipment can be shown to be of good design and in proper
functional condition;
§ 903 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 904
I:266
f. Discharge any untreated sewage or industrial waste into any
stream, or otherwise contribute to the pollution of surface or
underground waters in accordance with Act 537;
g. Create any other objectionable condition in an adjoining area
which will endanger public health or safety or be detrimental
to the proper use of the surrounding area.
2. When required by the municipality, an applicant for a proposed use
shall demonstrate as a condition of approval that adequate
provisions will be made to reduce and minimize any objectionable
elements to the degree necessary to insure that the proposed use
will not be noxious, hazardous, or offensive as defined above. If
required, the applicant shall submit supplemental information,
plans, and impartial expert judgments, and the municipality may
require the expert advice of official agencies or private consultants
and such reasonable tests as are deemed necessary, the costs of
which shall be borne by the applicant.
B. Requirements for Commercial and Industrial Uses.
1. General. All activities shall be operated in such a manner as to
comply with applicable performance standards as hereinafter set
forth governing noise, smoke, particulate matter, toxic or noxious
matter, odors, fire and explosive hazards, vibration, glare, or heat
for the district in which such use shall be located; and no use,
already established on the effective date of this Part, shall be so
altered or modified as to conflict with or further conflict with such
applicable performance standards for the district in which such use
is located.
2. Noise. Each of the participating Municipalities shall adopt its own
Noise Ordinance. All proposed activities shall demonstrate
compliance with the noise ordinance of the Township in which the
use is located.
3. Vibration.
a. Vibration shall be measured at or beyond any adjacent lot line
or residential district line as indicated in Table II below and
such measurements shall not exceed the particle velocities so
designated. The instrument used for these measurements shall
be a three-component measuring system capable of
simultaneous measurement of vibration in three mutually
perpendicular directions.
b. The maximum vibration is given as particle velocity, which may
be measured directly with suitable instrumentation or
computed on the basis of displacement and frequency. When
computed, the following formula shall be used.
§ 904 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 904
I:267
P.V. = 6.28 F x D
P.V. = Particle velocity, inches per second
F = Vibration frequency, cycles per second
D = Single amplitude displacement of the vibration,
inches
c. The maximum particle velocity shall be the vector sum of the
three individual components recorded. Such particle velocity
shall not exceed the values given in Table II.

C. Establishment of the Floodplain Zoning District.
1. Description of District.
§ 905 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 905
I:279
a. Basis of District. The Floodplain District shall include areas
subject to inundation by water of the one-hundred-year flood.
The basis for the delineation of this district shall be the most
recent formally adopted Flood Insurance Study prepared by
the Federal Insurance Administration under FIA contract.
The maps showing all areas considered to be subject to the
one-hundred-year flood are available for inspection at the
municipal offices. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the
following nomenclature is used in referring to the various
kinds of floodplain areas:
(1) The FW (Floodway Area) is delineated for purposes of this
Ordinance using the criteria that a certain area within the
floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the
one-hundred-year flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any
point. The areas included in this area are specifically
defined in the Floodway Data Table contained in the abovereferenced
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and identified as
"Floodway" in the AE Zone as shown on the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Map. The term shall also include
floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in
the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) The FF (Flood-fringe Area) shall be that area of the onehundred-
year floodplain identified as Zone AE not included
in the Floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of
this District shall be the one-hundred-year flood elevations
contained in the flood profiles of the above-referenced
Flood Insurance Studies and as shown on the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map.
(3) The FA (Approximated Floodplain) shall be that area of the
one-hundred-year floodplain for which no detailed flood
profiles or elevations are provided in the above-referenced
Flood Insurance Maps accompanying the study. When
available, information from other Federal, State and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the onehundred-
year elevation, as well as a floodway area, if
possible. In determining the one-hundred-year flood
elevations, the applicant for the proposed development
shall utilize approximate hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques as discussed in Subsection C.3
below.
b. Approximated Floodplain. In areas of any municipality where
no detailed flood profiles or elevations have been provided by
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), the Floodplain District shall
§ 905 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 905
I:280
include the approximate one-hundred-year flood boundary as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for each municipality
(hereinafter FA) and land areas which contain soil
characteristics indicative of flooding conditions, hereinafter
referred to as "floodplain soils." In these undesignated areas,
the floodplain soils shall be subject to the Floodplain District
Regulations contained herein. The floodplain soils shall include
any one or combination of the following soil classifications as
defined and classified in the 1975 Soil Survey of Bucks and
Philadelphia Counties, Pennsylvania (or as revised), prepared
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation
Service:
Symbol Name
Ae Alluvial Land
AlA Alton Series
Bo Bowmansville Series
Ha Hatboro Series
Mh Marsh
PoA, PpA, PpB Pope Series
Ro Rowland Series
2. Floodplain District Boundary Changes Initiated By Participating
Municipalities. The Participating Municipalities in the Newtown
Area Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance may revise the Floodplain
District Boundary Map and these regulations where the
Participating Municipalities deem that such revisions are
appropriate. However, prior to adoption, any proposed revision
shall be submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration for its
review and approval.
3. Establishment and Interpretation of Floodplain District
Boundaries. Any property owner who is aggrieved by the
determination of the floodplain based upon the approximated
floodplain and floodplain soils, may submit to the Participating
Municipality in which the property is located, a Floodplain Study
for a one-hundred-year flood conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Type
15 Flood Insurance Study, for the Participating Municipality's
review. The Participating Municipality may, within its sole
discretion, adopt the property owner's Floodplain Study or reject it;
the Participating Municipality's decision in this regard being
considered final. The floodplain study shall conform to the
requirements of the "Procedure for Applicant Wishing to Challenge
Floodplain District Boundaries" which is attached to this Article as
Exhibit "A" and is incorporated herein by reference. Prior to acting
upon the challenge to the Floodplain District boundary, the
§ 905 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 905
I:281
Participating Municipality will submit the floodplain study to the
Federal Insurance Administration for its review.
The boundaries of the Floodplain District shall not be revised by a
reclassification of the soils on the site by a soil scientist, whether
or not the reclassification is approved by the Soil Conservation
Service.
A floodplain shall be established for every watercourse which
affects the property under study by the "Procedure for Applicant
wishing to Challenge Floodplain District Boundaries" whether or
not floodplain soils are present, as all watercourses have a
definable one-hundred-year floodplain.

5. Special Exceptions and Variances.
a. An applicant for a special exception or variance shall comply
with the "Procedure for Applicant Requesting Special
Exception or Variance from the Requirements of § 905,
Floodplain District, of the Newtown Area Joint Municipal
Zoning Ordinance" which is attached to this § 905 as Exhibit
"B" and is incorporated herein by reference.
In passing upon applications for special exceptions and
variances, the Local Zoning Hearing Board shall consider all
relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of
the Zoning Ordinance and the following:
(1) The danger to life and property due to increased flood
heights or velocities caused by encroachments. No special
exception or variance shall be granted for any proposed
use, activity, or development that will cause any increase
in the one-hundred-year flood levels in the Floodplain
District as delineated in the Flood Insurance Study
referenced in § 905.C.1.a, except that a special exception
or variance may be granted for any proposed use, activity
or development permitted by § 905.D.1 of this Ordinance
that will cause an increase of no greater than one foot in
the one-hundred-year flood levels in the Floodplain District
as delineated in the Flood Insurance Study referenced in
§ 905.C.1.a, provided that no use, activity or development
occurs in the floodway.
(2) The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands
or downstream to the injury of others.
§ 905 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 905
I:286
(3) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination,
and unsanitary conditions.
(4) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owners.
(5) The importance of services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
(6) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
(7) The availability of alternative locations not subject to
flooding for the proposed use.
(8) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the
foreseeable future.
(9) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and the floodplain management program for the area.
(10) The safety of access to the property by ordinary and
emergency vehicles in times of flood.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood water at the site.
(12) The Local Zoning Hearing Board may request that
additional studies be performed by or under the direction
of the Township Engineer of the Participating Municipality
in which the property is located for further technical
assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to
flood heights and velocities, and the adequacy of the plans
for protection and other related matters. All costs,
charges, and expenses shall be paid by the applicant.
(13) Special exceptions and variances shall only be issued after
the Local Zoning Hearing Board has determined that the
granting of such will not result in:
(a) An increase in flood heights of greater than one foot in
the one-hundred-year flood level.
(b) Any use, activity or development in the floodway.
(c) Additional threats to public safety;
(d) Extraordinary public expense;
(e) Creation of nuisances;

municipality shall notify the applicant in writing that:
(a) The granting of the special exception or variance may
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance;
(b) Such special exception or variance may increase the
risks to life and property.
(15) A record of the action taken with respect to all variance or
special exception applications under § IV.E. hereof
together with a copy of the Local Zoning Hearing Board's
decision shall be maintained by the municipality in which
the property affected by the action is located. A report of
all such actions shall be included in each municipality's
annual or biennial report to the Federal Insurance
Administration.
(16) In passing upon an application for a variance, the Local
Zoning Hearing Board shall also consider whether the
failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(17) In passing upon an application for a variance or special
exception, any adverse impact on any surrounding
property owner may be the basis for denial by the local
Zoning Hearing Board.
b. Elevation and Flood-Proofing Requirements. No special
exception or variance shall be granted permitting construction
within the one-hundred-year floodplain pursuant to the
provisions of § 905 hereof, unless the following conditions shall
be met:
(1) Residential Structures. The lowest floor, including the
basement of any or substantially improved residential
structure, is at least 1 1/2 feet above the one-hundred-year
flood elevation. The structure shall be anchored to prevent
collapse, flotation, and lateral movement.
(2) Nonresidential Structures. The lowest floor, including any

and land development ordinance and as provided in the following:
1. Parking areas shall be permitted within required yards in OR Office
Research, LI Light Industrial, O-LI Office-Light Industrial Districts.
2. Front Yard Exceptions for Existing Alignment. If the alignment of
existing buildings on either side of a lot within a distance of 100
feet of the proposed building and fronting on the same side of the
same street in the same block is nearer to the street than the
required front yard depth, the governing body may accept the
average of such existing alignment within that distance as the
required front yard.
3. Projection into Yards.
a. An arbor, open trellis, flagpole, unroofed steps or sidewalks,
recreational structures, such as jungle gyms, swings and
sandboxes, and clothes drying apparatus shall be permitted as

long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that any
parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced below such requirements.
2. Whenever there is an alteration of a use which increases the
parking requirements according to this Article, the total additional
parking required for the alteration, change, or extension shall be
provided in accordance with the requirements of this Article.
3. No parking area shall be used for any use that interferes with its
availability for the parking need it is required to serve.
4. All required facilities shall be provided and maintained as long as
the use exists which the facilities were designed to serve. The total
extent of off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced after their
provision, except upon the approval of the Local Zoning Hearing
Board and then only after proof that, by reason of diminution in
§ 1000 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1001
I:293
floor area, seating area, or the number of employees, or change in
other factors controlling the regulation of the number of parking
spaces, such reduction is in conformity with the requirements of
this Article. Reasonable precautions shall be taken by the owner
or sponsor of particular uses to assure the availability of required
facilities to the employees or other persons whom the facilities are
designed to serve. Such facilities shall be designed and used in
such a manner that at no time constitutes a nuisance, hazard, or
unreasonable impediment to traffic.
5. For parking areas of three or more vehicles, the area not
landscaped and so maintained, including driveways, shall be
graded, surfaced with asphalt or other suitable material, and
drained to the satisfaction of the municipal engineer to the extent
necessary to prevent dust, erosion, or excessive water flow across
streets or adjoining property. All off-street parking spaces shall be
marked so as to indicate their location. Failure to keep parking
areas in satisfactory condition (i.e., free from holes, clearly
delineated, or properly graded) shall be considered a violation of
this Ordinance.
6. All off-street parking lots and areas for the display, storage, sale, or
movement of three or more motor vehicles shall be adequately
buffered from adjacent streets and properties and landscaped in
accordance with an overall plan as required in subsection 1001.F.6.

structurally sound wall or fence, or other abutment to insure safety
shall be installed around each side of the parking lot wherever said
lot adjoins a public street, sidewalk, or alley; and an adequate
retaining wall, wherever necessary, to prevent the washing of soil
to and from adjoining property, shall also be provided.
8. Within the VC-1, VC-2, TC, and TC-2 Districts, any use existing as of
the effective day of this Ordinance which can be lawfully expanded,
or any new use that cannot meet the parking requirements of this
Ordinance within the lot lines of the principal use may meet the
parking requirements of this zoning ordinance by either:
a. On an annual basis the landowner shall show proof of a lease of
the required parking spaces within 300 feet of the premises
and in the same district; or
b. The landowner shall pay the Participating Municipality in
which the use takes place a fee-in-lieu for each required
parking space, to be determined by a formula set forth by
resolution by the Participating Municipality for the acquisition,
construction, and maintenance of public parking.

Commercial District, and within 10 feet of the side and/or rear
property lines in all other districts, except as provided in
§ 1000.E.1. However, driveways, parking aisles, and parking spaces
may be permitted in side or rear yards in the TC Town Commercial
District when these parking improvements are shared between two
or more abutting uses.
5. Computation.
a. When determination of off-street parking spaces required by
this Ordinance results in a requirement of a fractional space,
any fraction of 1/2 or less may be disregarded while a fraction
in excess of 1/2 shall be counted as one parking space.
b. Off-street parking space shall be required as provided for each
use in Article VIII. All uses which do not have a parking
requirement in Article VIII and which have a lot coverage in

entrances or exits, from streets and from residential or other
uses with less intensive parking requirements. The buffer shall
consist of an ornamental fence or wall consistent with the
architectural character of the surrounding uses, or by a
compact evergreen hedge, not less than four feet in height.
Where a planted screen is proposed, it shall incorporate the
planting of staggered and overlapping evergreen and
deciduous shrubs of such species and size as will produce
within two growing seasons (May through September) after
planting a screen at least four feet higher than the elevation of
the adjacent parking area and of such density as will obscure
75% of the light emitted from automobile headlights on the
premises throughout the full course of the year. Where the
adjacent land elevation is higher than the parking area
elevation, trees and shrubs shall be at least two feet in height,
satisfaction of the four foot requirement notwithstanding.
These provisions shall not, however, interfere with the
maintenance of clear sight lines at intersections. Where such
screening is required, it shall be assured by a performance
guarantee posted with the governing body in an amount equal
to 20% of the estimated cost of the plantings. Such guarantee
shall be released only after passage of the second growing
season following planting.
b.1. Any area for the display and sale of motor vehicles shall be
provided with a fence, wall or planted screen, as described in
subsection b. above, along property lines with adjacent land
uses other than Uses E-10 Service Station, E-11 Automotive
Sales or E-12 Automotive Repair and Car Wash. Along any
street frontage, planted screening shall be provided along 25%

20-vehicle width shall be separated from one another by
planting strips not less than 10 feet in width.
d. Except in the TC Town Commercial District, no less than 10%
of a proposed parking area must consist of buffer areas and
islands and must be landscaped and continually maintained.
Planting along the perimeter of a parking area, whether for
required screening or general beautification, will be
considered as part of the required parking area landscaping.
G. Reduction of Nonresidential Parking Requirements. In order to prevent
the establishment of a greater number of parking spaces than is
actually required to serve the needs of nonresidential uses, the
governing body, after consulting with the planning commission and the
municipal engineer, may permit a conditional reduction of parking
space if the following conditions are satisfied:
1. The conditional reduction of parking spaces may apply to the
following:
a. The minimum number of parking spaces required for a land
use is in excess of actual parking needs.
b. The operating schedules of two or more land uses are such that
a parking lot may be shared between them and that the
minimum number of parking spaces required for each land use
is in excess of actual parking needs.
2. The design of the parking lot, as indicated on the land development
plan, must designate sufficient space to meet the parking
requirement. The plan shall also illustrate the layout for the total
number of parking spaces, which must be in compliance with the
impervious surface and yard requirements of this Ordinance.
3. The balance of the parking area conditionally reserved shall not
include areas for required buffer yards, setbacks, or areas which
would otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the
physical characteristics of the land or other requirements of this
Ordinance. This parking area which is reserved shall be located
and have characteristics so as to provide amenable open space
should it be determined the additional parking spaces are not
required. The developer shall provide with the land development
plan a landscaping plan for the reserved area.
4. If required by the governing body, the developer or owner shall
post a performance bond or other securities to cover the expense of
a traffic study to be undertaken by a registered traffic engineer of
the governing body's choosing who shall determine the advisability

A. General Provisions.
1. It is mandatory that the recorded plan and the deeds indicate that
there shall be no additional development of the open space. The
open space shall be restricted against any future building,
development, or use except as is consistent with that of providing
for open space for recreation, conservation, agricultural uses, and
§ 1003 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1005
I:305
access ways and parking facilities accessory thereto. Buildings
or uses for noncommercial recreation, cultural, or agricultural
purposes compatible with the open space objective may be
permitted only with the express approval of the governing body,
following approval of the building, site and operational plans by
the governing body. The governing body may, at its sole discretion,
make post-development changes within development open space
to improve stormwater management, increase stormwater
infiltration, implement stormwater best management practices, or
make other changes to reduce flooding, reduce water pollution,
or comply with local, county, state and federal stormwater
management requirements.
2. All documents pertaining to the conveyance and maintenance of
the open space shall meet the approval of the municipal solicitor as
to legal form and effect with recommendations from the local
planning commission and the local park and recreation boards as to
suitability for the proposed use of the open space and be approved
by the governing body as part of the final plan approval.
3. Layout of open space within the Conservation Management
District. A primary purpose of the open space within this district is
to preserve agriculture lands for agricultural use. Therefore, the
plan for open space areas shall clearly demonstrate that every
effort has been made to provide a maximum amount of farmland
preserved for agriculture. Pursuant to a participating
municipality's Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, a
participating governing body, upon the recommendation of the
local planning commission, may permit greater encroachment into
areas of forests, slopes, or shorelines in order to maximize the
protection of Class I, II or III agricultural soils. A plan which does
not provide for the agricultural use of the majority of Class I, II or
III soils shall not be deemed to meet the provisions of this
Ordinance. A planted buffer may be required between the
residential areas and the open space retained for agricultural
purposes where appropriate. Where, on any adjacent property,
permanently protected open space or land in active agricultural
use is located within 50 feet of a property proposed for
development with open space requirements, the open space within
the proposed development shall be located at one or more
locations, as approved by the governing body, near the common
property line with the adjacent agricultural land or open space in
order to establish a contiguous area of open space. See § 902.B.2,
Calculation for Land with Resource Restrictions and Resource
Protection, for the calculation of protected agricultural soils.
The governing body may require a planted buffer between existing
and/or proposed residential uses or other existing uses and the
open space retained for agricultural purposes. The proposed
agricultural uses of the open space, the location of existing and
§ 1005 NEWTOWN AREA JMZO § 1005
I:306
proposed ownership of the agricultural open space, and the
methods to restrict the use of open space to agricultural uses
are permitted only with the expressed approval of the governing
body. The governing body may attach conditions and safeguards
in addition to those expressed in this Ordinance, or may deny
agricultural use of open space where agricultural use of open space
may result in impacts on or be incompatible with other uses of
land in the Conservation Management District or other adjoining
districts.
4. Where open space is designated on a subdivision plan or is
restricted from further subdivision and/or development by a
restriction in a deed and/or by a note on a subdivision plan, the
open space shall not be further subdivided, regardless of an
intervening zoning change.
5. In all zoning districts, the open space designated within a
development area shall not be merely leftover or unusable land. It
shall be laid out to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors
according to sound site design principles. Except in the
Conservation Management District, open space shall be accessible
to a maximum number of the residents of a developed area, and
shall be provided in accordance with the participating
municipality's subdivision and land development ordinance. In the
Conservation Management District, the requirements of § 1005.A.3
shall be met. Further, the open space designated within a
development area shall be arranged so as to encompass a single
land area or minimum number of areas, linked by a common means
of circulation and access; and, it shall be contiguous to the
developed area and not separated from it by existing roads unless
safe pedestrian access can be provided. Open space areas may only
be bisected by roads when approved by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Open Space Design Standards. [Amended effective 9/23/2018 by
JMZO Ord. No. 2017-04, adopted 9/18/2018.]
1. Areas set aside for open space shall be suitable for the designated
purpose and in any event shall be consistent with the plan policy for
future land use in the municipality. Any such area shall contain no
structure other than a structure related to the purposes of open
spaces. Where structures relating to open space or recreational
activity are located in the Developed Open Space, no more than 5%
of that area, or 10,000 square feet, whichever is greater, may be
converted to building areas. Structures relating to agricultural
uses shall conform with the provisions of Use A-1.1, 2, 3, and 4, in
§ 803.
2. Any land set aside as open space of such a size as may be capable of
future subdivision under the regulations of this Ordinance must be
made subject to a deed restriction or agreement in a form

open space.
c. The dedication of open space, streets, or other lands in
common ownership of the corporation, association, individual,
or other legal entity or the municipality shall be absolute and
not subject to reversion for possible future use for further
development.
3. At the option of the municipality, by conveyance of the restrictive

SIGNS
§ 1100. Objectives. [Readopted effective 6/23/2007 by JMZO Ord.
2007, adopted 6/18/2007.]
The objectives of this Article are to establish requirements for placing,
installing and maintaining signs, in order to preserve and protect the health,
safety, welfare and general well-being of the community's citizens. Just as
regulations for the placement, construction and maintenance of buildings
and structures through zoning is a valid use of the law so are regulations
for the placement, installation and maintenance of signs a valid use of the
law, because signs, in the literal sense, must be considered structures, and,
in a practical sense, are capable of producing many of the same nuisances
as buildings produce.
Sign regulations are further justified by the primary purpose of a sign: to
draw attention to its content. However, since signs can distract drivers or
obstruct views, the very nature of a sign can be a potential hazard to the
safety of the motoring public. Therefore, it is the intent of this Ordinance to
regulate the location of signs in such a way that they can fulfill their purpose
without causing unsafe conditions for motorists.
Finally, it is the objective of this Article to protect and preserve the visual
character of the community by regulating the placement, installation and
maintenance of signs. Because signs are intended to command visual
contact this gives them an important role in the overall visual character
of a community. This visual impact is an economic fact that affects the
value of property, as well as its enjoyment. Therefore, the regulation of
signs can work to conserve the value of property and encourage the most
appropriate use of land throughout a municipality. Good planning requires a
Such plan shall be in accordance with all other applicable sections
of this Ordinance.
3. No alteration of any stream, pond, or lake shall be permitted unless
in accordance with a plan approved by a majority vote of the
association of property owners, if applicable, pursuant to review
and approval by the municipal governing body. Such plan shall be
in accordance with other applicable sections of this Ordinance and
all applicable regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
4. No structures shall be erected unless in accordance with a plan
approved by a majority vote of the association of property owners,
if applicable, pursuant to review and approval by the municipal
governing body. Such plan should be in accordance with all other
applicable sections of this Ordinance.

to the extent of 50% of the appraised replacement value of such
building or structure, such nonconforming building or structure shall
not be restored, or rebuilt, except in such manner as to conform to the
regulations of this Ordinance, and amendments thereto. When a
nonconforming building or structure is partially destroyed by fire,

replacement value, it may be restored to its original use in accordance
with provisions of this Ordinance but must be restored within one year
of such happening.
B. Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the strengthening or
restoration to a safe condition of any walls, floor, foundation, or roof
which has been declared unsafe by the municipal building inspector.
A. In granting a conditional use, the governing body or its authorized
representatives shall make findings of fact consistent with the
provisions of this Ordinance. The governing body or its authorized
representatives shall not approve a conditional use except in
conformance with the conditions and standards outlined in this
Ordinance.
B. The governing body or its authorized representatives shall grant a
conditional use only if it finds adequate evidence that any proposed
development submitted will meet all of the following general
requirements as well as any specific requirements and standards listed
herein for the proposed use. The governing body or its authorized
representatives shall require that any proposed use and location among
other things be:
1. In accordance with the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan for
Newtown Township, Upper Makefield Township, and Wrightstown

file those applications simultaneously or to file the application for
conditional use first and process it to conclusion without the necessity
to file more intricate land development plans. Should the applicant file
the applications simultaneously, and request simultaneous review, the
applicant assumes the risk of cost of preparation of plans for both
applications and the cost of modifications the municipality may require
in the review process. Approval of both conditional use and subdivision
and land development shall be required before the issuance of any
zoning permit.
A. The landowner shall make a written request to the governing body or its
authorized representatives of the municipality in which the parcel of
land is located. The request shall contain a statement reasonably
informing the governing body or its authorized representatives of the

the governing body or its authorized representatives shall at the time of
making application pay to the zoning officer, for the use of the

§ 1601. Municipal Curative Amendments. [Readopted effective 6/23/
2007 by JMZO Ord. 2007, adopted 6/18/2007.]
A. Procedure upon Municipal Curative Amendment.
1. A participating municipality, by formal action, may declare the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof substantially
invalid and propose that the participating municipalities prepare a
curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. The formal action
shall make specific findings setting forth the declared invalidity of
the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance which may include:
a. References to specific uses which are either not permitted, or
not permitted in sufficient quantity,
b. References to a class of use or uses which require revision, or
c. Reference to the entire Ordinance which requires revisions.
2. The governing bodies of the remaining municipalities shall vote,
within 30 days following such declaration by the initiating
governing body, by formal action whether or not to declare the Joint
Municipal Zoning Ordinance or portions thereof substantially
invalid. In the event of the failure of a majority of the participating
municipalities to declare the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance or
portions thereof substantially invalid within the 30 days following
such declaration, the declaration by the first participating
municipality shall be deemed null and void.
3. The declaration by a majority of the participating municipalities of
the substantive invalidity of the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance
shall be binding upon all the participating municipalities from the
moment the initiating governing body declares the Joint Municipal
Zoning Ordinance invalid, provided that the majority of all
§ 1512 TITLE, PURPOSE AND JURISDICTION § 1601
I:383
participating municipalities approves of the formal action within 30
days. In the event that a majority of the participating municipalities
vote, by formal action, not to declare the Joint Municipal Zoning
Ordinance invalid in accordance with this Section, subsection
1601.D shall not apply.
4. Upon the declaration that the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance is
invalid by the majority of the participating municipalities, the
participating municipalities shall begin to prepare and consider a
curative amendment to the Joint municipal zoning ordinance to
correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration by the first
participating municipality, pursuant to subsection 1601.A.1 above, the
municipalities shall enact a curative amendment to or reaffirm the
validity of this Ordinance pursuant to the provisions required by § 1602,
to cure the declared invalidity of this Ordinance.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures by the first governing body as set
forth in Section 1601.A, any participating governing body shall not be
required to entertain or consider any landowner's curative amendment
as provided for within the PA Municipalities Planning Code, nor shall
the Local Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report requested
under §§ 1507.A and B subsequent to the declaration and proposal
based upon the grounds identical to or substantially similar to those
specified in the resolution required by subsection 1601.A.1. Upon
completion of the procedures as set forth in §§ 1601.A and B, no rights
to a cure pursuant to the provisions of the PA Municipalities Planning
Code, shall, from the date of the declaration and proposal, accrue to any
landowner on the basis of the substantive invalidity of this Ordinance
for which there has been a curative amendment pursuant to this
Section.
D. The municipalities having jointly utilized the procedures as set forth in
subsections 1601.A and B may not again utilize said procedures for a 36
month period following the date of the enactment of a curative
amendment or reaffirmation of the validity of this Ordinance pursuant
to subsection 1601.B; provided, however, if after the date of declaration
and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation imposed
upon the municipality by virtue of a change in statute or by virtue of a
Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the municipalities may utilize
the provisions of this Section to prepare a curative amendment to the
Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance to fulfill said duty or obligation;
provided, however, that the participating municipalities shall not be
deemed to have utilized the procedures set forth in subsections 1601.A
and B either if the participating municipalities take formal action to not
declare the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance invalid in accordance
with subsection 1601.A.3 or if they fail to act in accordance with
subsection 1601.A.2 above.

municipality, the governing body of each municipality shall
separately advertise public hearings by the governing body of each
municipality to take place within the municipality in a newspaper of

Planning Code, the County, Joint, and municipal planning
commissions shall submit to the governing body of each
participating municipality a report containing each planning
commission's recommendations, including any additions or
modifications to the original proposal. The failure of one of the
above planning commissions to forward such a report within the
above allotted time period shall be interpreted as a
recommendation for adoption by the governing bodies of the
participating municipalities.
3. Amendments to the Joint Zoning Ordinance must be approved by all
participating municipalities. The effective date of any amendment
shall be the date on which all of the participating municipalities
have approved the amendment.
4. Each municipality shall vote on enactment of the amendment
within 30 days after the conclusion of the last hearing. Upon such a
vote to enact the amendment, the other municipalities shall be
notified in writing.
5. Failure of a majority of the participating municipalities, including
the municipalities physically affected, to vote within the allotted
time periods shall, for the purpose of this Ordinance, render the
proposed amendment null and void.
