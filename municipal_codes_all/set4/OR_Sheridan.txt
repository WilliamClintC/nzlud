SHERIDAN MUNICIPAL CODE 2000 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
the City of Sheridan, Oregon 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 6,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Sheridan Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Mike Sauerwein, City Manager, and walt Gowell, City Attorney. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 6, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2019-01, passed April 15, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 6, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 6, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 6, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Sellers must hold in trust all taxes collected pursuant to Section 3.05.010 for the city's account until the seller makes payment to the city.

C.  If the director determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under Section 3.05.010 is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax will be added thereto, in addition to the penalties stated in subsection A. and B. 
D.

A.  If any seller fails to make any report of the tax required by Section 3.05.010 within the time provided in Section 3.05.020, the director will proceed to obtain facts and information on which to base the estimate of tax due. As soon as the director procures such facts and information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by Section 3.05.010 and payable by any seller, the director will determine and assess against such seller the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by Section 3.05.025. 
B.  If the director makes a determination as outlined in subsection A., the director must give notice to the Seller of the amount assessed. The notice must be personally served on the seller or deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the seller at the last known place of address.

3.05.045 - Actions to collect. 
    Any tax required to be paid by any seller under the provisions of Section 3.05.010 is a debt owed by the seller to the city. Any tax collected by a seller that has not been paid to the city is a debt owed by the seller to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of Section 3.05.010 is liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of the amount owing. In lieu of filing an action for recovery, the city, when taxes due are more than thirty (30) days delinquent, may submit any outstanding tax due to a collection agency. So long as the city has complied with the provisions set forth in ORS 697.105, if the city turns over a delinquent tax account to a collection agency, it may add to the amount owing an amount equal to the collection agency fees, not to exceed the greater of fifty dollars ($50.00) or fifty (50) percent of the outstanding tax, penalties, and interest owing.

A.  All violations of Sections 3.05.010 and 3.05.020 are punishable as set forth in Chapter 1.28. It is a violation of Sections 3.05.010 and 3.05.020 for any seller or other person to: 
1.  Fail or refuse to comply as required herein; 
2.  Fail or refuse to furnish any return required to be made; 
3.  Fail or refuse to permit inspection of records; 
4.  Fail or refuse to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the director; 
5.  Render a false or fraudulent return or claim; or 
6.  Fail, refuse, or neglect to remit the tax to the city by the due date. 
B.  The remedies provided by Sections 3.05.025, 3.05.045, and subsection A. are not exclusive and do not prevent the city from exercising any other remedy available under the law. 
C.  The remedies provided by this chapter do not prohibit or restrict the city or other appropriate prosecutor from pursuing criminal charges under state law or city ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 10-20-2014) 
3.05.055 - Confidentiality. 
    Except as otherwise required by law, it is unlawful for the city, any officer, employee, or agent to divulge, release, or make known in any manner any financial information submitted or disclosed to the city under the terms of Section 3.05.020. Nothing in this section prohibits any of the following: 
A.  The disclosure of the names and addresses of any person who is operating a licensed establishment from which marijuana is sold or provided; 
B.  The disclosure of general statistics in a form which would not reveal an individual seller's financial information; 
C.  Presentation of evidence to the court, or other tribunal having jurisdiction, in the prosecution of any criminal or civil claim by the city or an appeal from the city for amounts due the city under Section 3.05.010;

E.  The disclosure of records related to a business' failure to report and remit the tax when the report or tax is in arrears for over six months or when the tax exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).

(Ord. No. 2014-05, § 1, 10-20-2014) 
Chapter 3.08 - CONTRACTS AND PURCHASING 

3.08.010 - Contract review board established. 
    There is established a contract review board for the city. The city council is designated as the contract review board of the city as to all contracts entered into by the city subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter; and said board shall have all of the powers granted to the State Public Contract Review Board. 
(Ord. 76-5 § 1, 1976) 
3.08.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter, the following words and phrases shall mean: 
    "Board" means the local contract review board as established in Section 3.08.010. 
    "Public contract" means any purchase, lease or sale by the city of Sheridan of personal property, public improvements or services other than agreements which are exclusively for personal service. 
    "Public improvement" means any construction of improvements on real property by or for the city of Sheridan. 
(Ord. 76-5 § 2, 1976) 
3.08.030 - Bids required. 
    All public contracts shall be based upon competitive bids except as specified in this chapter. 
(Ord. 76-5 § 3, 1976) 
3.08.040 - Government contracts. 
    Contracts made with or the cost of which is provided by other public agencies or the federal government are exempt from the requirement of Section 3.08.030. 
(Ord. 76-5 § 4, 1976) 
3.08.050 - Competitive bids-Exemptions. 
    The council finds that the following classes of contracts as set forth in this section, subsections A through F, are declared to be exempt from the requirements of Section 3.08.030 because they will not: encourage favoritism; substantially diminish competition (for the reason that the amounts involved do not warrant competitive bidding and the cost of the competitive bidding process would be disproportionate to costs and amounts involved); increase costs to the public without corresponding benefits thereto; diminish competition by the dispensing with bids. 
A.  It shall not be necessary for either formal or informal bids to be called in connection with any purchase the amount of which shall be less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00); 
B.  Informal bids only shall be necessary for any purchase which exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) but is less than twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00). An informal bid shall be considered to be the procedure whereby the purchasing agent of the city ascertains, by correspondence, telephone calls or direct contact, the various prices for the items involved, quoted by a number of reliable firms that shall have such items for sale. The purchasing agent or manager shall cause to be kept all records and evidence of such informal bids; and after obtaining the same, the purchase may be made by the city manager or his or her designated agent; 
C.  It shall not be necessary for either formal or informal bids to be called in any case where the item to be purchased is manufactured or available only through one company, firm or individual. Products shall not be specified nor be purchased by brand name or mark unless exempt under subsection A or B of this section; or unless there is evidence regarding one source; or substantial savings to the public would result; or efficient utilization of existing supplies requires the acquisition of compatible equipment or supplies; 
D.  Public sales or auctions of surplus city property or unclaimed property administered pursuant to the applicable procedures set forth in Chapter 10.24 of this code; 
E.  In any bid situation, except a contract in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), for public improvement to be made by a private contractor, and where the contract review board specifically determines that the public interest will be served; that favoritism will not be encouraged; that competition will not be diminished; and that specific reasons for such determination is made of record; then the calling of competitive bids may be waived by the contract review board; 
F.  If emergency conditions require prompt execution of the contract, except a contract in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), for public improvement to be made by a private contractor, competitive bidding may be dispensed with; in which case, the same may be declared by a unanimous vote of the board, together with the reasons for such declaration of an emergency.

    After the city engineer's report has been filed with the city recorder, the council shall consider the report. The council may approve the report as submitted or may amend and approve the report as amended. The council may direct the city engineer to furnish the council with a further report or information or, on the basis of the engineer's report, the council may by motion record its intention to abandon the improvement. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 3, 1956) 
3.12.040 - Notice of hearing-Opening of bids. 
    After the council has approved the engineer's report as submitted or as amended by the council: 
A.  It shall direct the city recorder to cause to be published forthwith once each week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in Sheridan, a notice stating: 
1.  That the report or amended report of the city engineer, as approved by the council, is on file in the city recorder's office, subject to examination, giving the date, no earlier than ten (10) days immediately following the first publication of notice, when any objections thereto will be considered by the council at a public hearing; 
2.  That written remonstrances may be filed against the proposed improvement at the office of the city recorder not later than the scheduled time for the council hearing of objections to the proposed improvements; 
3.  That the improvement will be abandoned for at least six months if there is presented a valid remonstrance of the owners of the property affected by such improvement which will bear sixty (60) percent of the total cost of the improvement according to the method of assessment set forth in the council-approved engineer's report and which method or basis shall be specified in said notice; 
4.  A description of the boundaries of the district to be specially benefitted by the improvement, giving the names of the record owners thereof and, when readily available, the names of the other owners thereof as defined herein; 
5.  The estimated total cost of the improvement which is to be paid for by special assessment of benefitted property; 
6.  The city engineer's estimated unit cost of the improvement to the specially benefitted property clearly indicating that this is an estimate and not an assessment. 
B.  It shall also direct the city recorder to send forthwith by registered mail the same notice, at his or her last known address, to each record owner and, when readily known to each owner, as defined herein, of property to be specially benefitted by the proposed improvement. 
C.  It may, in its discretion, direct the city recorder, upon the basis of the council-approved engineer's report, to advertise for bids and designate the time at which such bids shall be opened, which time may be the time of the aforesaid hearing; provided, that no such contract shall be let until after any objections to the council-approved engineer's report are heard by the council, and provided that in the letting of any such contract the provisions of Section 3.12.060 shall be followed by the council. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 4, 1956) 
3.12.050 - Hearing. 
    At the aforesaid hearing the council shall hear oral objections to the proposed improvement and shall consider any written remonstrances thereto. Written remonstrances of the owners of the property specially affected by such improvement which will bear sixty (60) percent of the total cost of the improvement according to the method of assessment, which shall have been specified by the council for the improvement, shall defeat the proposed improvement, in which event no further action to effect the improvement shall be taken for six months. "Owners" shall have the meaning for this purpose that is given in this chapter. If the council, after hearing objections and considering any remonstrances, finds that there is not a sufficient remonstrance, it may proceed with the improvement. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 5, 1956) 
3.12.060 - Manner of doing work-Contracts, bids and bonds. 
    The council shall provide by resolution the time and manner of doing the work of such improvement, and may provide for the city to do the work or it may award the work on contract. In the event that the work is done under contract, bids shall be received after advertisement, for such time as the council may determine, on all such work the estimated cost of which is more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). The contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder, provided that the council shall have the right to reject all bids when they are deemed unreasonable or unsatisfactory. The council shall provide for taking security by bond for the faithful performance of any contract let under its authority, and the provisions thereof, in case of default, shall be enforced by action in the name of the city. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 6, 1956) 
3.12.070 - Special hearing when low bid substantially exceeds engineer's estimate. 
    If the council finds, upon opening bids for the work of such improvement, that the lowest responsible bid substantially exceeds the engineer's estimate, it may, in its discretion, hold a special hearing of objections to proceeding with the improvement on the basis of such bid and may direct the city recorder to publish reasonable notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in Sheridan. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 7, 1956) 
3.12.080 - Assessment ordinance. 
    When the council, after the aforesaid hearing or hearings, shall determine to proceed with the improvement, it shall pass an ordinance assessing the various lots, parcels, and tracts of property specially benefitted thereby with their apportioned share of the cost of the improvement; but the passage of such an assessment ordinance may be delayed until the contract for the work is let or the improvement completed and the total cost thereof determined if the council shall desire to avoid deficit assessments or rebates or for any other reason deemed sufficient by the council. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 8, 1956) 
3.12.090 - Method of assessment and alternative methods of financing. 
A.  The council, in adopting a method of assessment of the costs of the improvement, may: 
1.  Use any just and reasonable method of determining the extent of any improvement district consistent with the benefits derived; 
2.  Use any method of apportioning the sum to be assessed as is just and reasonable between the properties determined to be specially benefitted; 
3.  Authorize payment by the city of all or any part of the cost of any such improvement when in the opinion of the council, on account of topographical or physical conditions, unusual or excessive public travel, or other character of the work involved, or when the council otherwise believes the situation warrants it, provided the method selected creates a reasonable relation between the benefits derived by the property specially assessed and the benefits derived by the city as a whole. 
B.  Nothing herein contained shall preclude the council from using other available means of financing improvements, including federal or state grants-in-aid, sewer service or other types of service charges, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds, or other legal means of finance. In the event any of such other means of finance are used, the council may, in its discretion, levy special assessments hereunder according to benefits to cover any part of the costs of the improvement not covered by such means. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 9, 1956) 
3.12.100 - Appeal. 
    Any person feeling aggrieved by assessments made as herein provided may, within sixty (60) days from the passage of the ordinance levying the assessment by the council, appeal therefrom to the circuit court of the state of Oregon for Yamhill County. Such appeal and the requirements and formalities thereof shall be heard, governed and determined and the judgment thereon rendered and enforced so far as is practical in the manner provided for appeals from reassessments contained in ORS 223.005 to 223.105, and 223.205 to 223.930 as now or hereafter amended.

Upon such entry in the lien docket, the amount so entered shall be a lien and charged upon the respective lots, tracts, and parcels of land against which the same are placed. Such liens shall be first and prior to all other liens or encumbrances thereon whatsoever insofar as the laws of the state of Oregon allow. Interest shall be charged at the rate of six percent per annum until paid on all amounts not paid within thirty (30) days from the date of such entry, or entry corrected pursuant to Section 3.12.130. The city may proceed to foreclose or enforce any lien to which it shall be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this chapter at any time after thirty (30) days from the date on which the assessment, or assessment corrected pursuant to Section 3.12.130, was entered in the lien docket, in the manner provided for the foreclosure or enforcement of liens by the general laws of the state. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 11, 1956) 
3.12.120 - Notice of assessment-Bonding. 
    Within ten (10) days after the ordinance levying assessments has been passed, the city recorder shall send by registered mail, to his or her last known address, a notice of assessment to the record owner and, so far as readily known, to the owner as herein defined, of each lot, tract, or parcel of land assessed. This notice shall state the time within which such assessments must be paid or bonded and that assessments which are not paid or bonded within the time stated in the notice shall bear interest at six percent per annum and that the property so assessed is subject to foreclosure if such assessments are not paid or bonded within the time stated in the notice. Such record owner or other owner as herein defined may make application to bond such assessment pursuant to the provisions of ORS 223.205 and 223.210 to 223.295, which is known as the "Bancroft Bonding Act," together with amendments or future amendments thereof.

3.12.130 - Errors in assessment calculations. 
    Claimed errors in the calculation of assessments shall be called to the attention of the city recorder prior to any payment on account thereof. Said city recorder shall determine whether there is an error in fact. If the city recorder shall find that there is an error in fact, he or she shall recommend to the council an amendment to the assessment ordinance to correct the error. Upon the enactment of such an amendment by the council, the city recorder shall make the necessary correction in the docket of city liens and send by registered mail to the last known address of the owner a corrected notice of the assessment. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 13, 1956) 
3.12.140 - Deficit assessment. 
    If assessment is made before the total costs of the improvements are known, and it be found that the amount assessed is insufficient to defray the expenses of the improvement, the council may by motion declare such deficit and prepare a proposed deficit assessment. The council shall set a time for a hearing of objections to such deficit assessment and shall direct the city recorder to publish reasonable notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation, printed and published in Sheridan. The council, upon such hearing, shall make a just and equitable deficit assessment by ordinance. Such deficit assessment shall be consolidated with the assessment in the lien docket in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.12.110. Thereafter, the provisions of Sections 3.12.120 and 3.12.130 shall be applicable with regard to such deficit assessment. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 14, 1956) 
3.12.150 - Rebate. 
    If, upon the completion of the project, it is found that any sum theretofore assessed therefor upon any property is more than sufficient to pay the cost thereof, the council must ascertain and declare the same by ordinance, and when so declared, it must be entered in the docket of city liens as a credit upon the appropriate assessment. If any such assessment has been paid, the person who paid the same, or his or her legal representative, shall be entitled to the payment of any portion of the rebate credit which exceeds the assessment, by a warrant on the city treasury. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 15, 1956) 
3.12.160 - Abandonment of proceedings. 
    The council shall have full power and authority to abandon and rescind proceedings for improvements hereunder at any time prior to the final consummation of such proceedings, and if liens have been assessed upon any property under this procedure, they shall be canceled, and any payments made thereon shall be refunded to the payor, his or her assigns, or legal representatives. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 16, 1956) 
3.12.170 - Curative provisions. 
    No improvement assessment shall be invalid by reason of a failure to give, in any report, in the proposed assessment, in the assessment ordinance or ordinances, in the lien docket or elsewhere in the proceedings, the name of the owner of any lot, tract, or parcel of land or part thereof or the name of any person having a lien upon or interest in such property, or by reason of any error, mistake, delay, omission, irregularity, or other act, jurisdictional or otherwise, in any of the proceedings or steps hereinabove specified, unless it appears that the assessment as made, insofar as it affects the person complaining, is unfair and unjust, and the council shall have power and authority to remedy and correct all such matters by suitable action and proceedings. 
(Ord. 1211-C § 17, 1956) 
3.12.180 - Reassessment.

Such reassessments shall be made in the manner provided by ORS 223.405 to 223.485 as now or hereafter amended.

Chapter 5.32 - SOLICITORS 

5.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council finds it necessary and desirable to regulate solicitation in order to provide an effective opportunity for the occupants of residential property to protect themselves from the unwanted disruption of the peaceful and quiet enjoyment of their property and right to privacy caused by solicitors, to protect the rights to free speech guaranteed by the Oregon and federal constitutions for lawful solicitors, and to provide a means by which those solicitors who choose to intrude upon and disrupt an occupant's quiet enjoyment of property can be held accountable for such violations. The city council has also been advised that based upon actual experiences in Sheridan and in the opinion of crime prevention specialists nationwide, there is a direct connection between residential burglaries and unscrupulous solicitors. The creation of a registration requirement will enable city officials and citizens of the city to become informed concerning the individuals and organizations who choose to solicit in the city. This chapter also provides a mechanism for discouraging, through the civil infraction process, those solicitors who avoid registration and provides a mechanism to identify and discourage those who would use solicitation as a front for criminal activity.

5.32.020 - Definition. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, the terms "solicit" and "solicitation" mean the entry onto real property used for residential purposes by a person for the purpose of communicating with an occupant of the property, whether the communication is verbal, visual or in writing.

B.  Warrants. The city manager may request any municipal or circuit court judge to issue a nuisance abatement warrant whenever entry onto private property is necessary to remove and abate any nuisance, or whenever the city manager has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any property any nuisance which makes such property substandard as defined in any building regulations. 
C.  Grounds for Issuance of Nuisance Abatement Warrants; Affidavit. 
1.  Affidavit. A nuisance abatement warrant shall be issued only upon cause, supported by affidavit, particularly describing the applicant's status in applying for the warrant, the statute, ordinance or regulation requiring or authorizing the removal and abatement of the nuisance, the building or property to be entered, the basis upon which cause exists to remove or abate the nuisance, and a statement of the general types and estimated quantity of the items to be removed or conditions abated. 
2.  Cause. Cause shall be deemed to exist if reasonable legislative, judicial or administrative standards for removing and abating nuisances are satisfied with respect to any building or upon any property, or if there is cause to believe that a nuisance violation exists, as defined in this Title 8, with respect to the designated property. 
D.  Procedure for Issuance of a Nuisance Abatement Warrant. 
1.  Examination. Before issuing a nuisance abatement warrant, the judge may examine the applicant and any other witness under oath and shall be satisfied of the existence of grounds for granting such application. 
2.  Issuance. If the judge is satisfied that cause for the removal and abatement of any nuisance exists and that the other requirements for granting the application are satisfied, the judge shall issue the warrant, particularly describing the person or persons authorized to execute the warrant, the property to be entered, and a statement of the general types and estimated quantity of the items to be removed or conditions abated. The warrant shall contain a direction that it be executed on any day of the week between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., or where the judge has specially determined upon a showing that it cannot be effectively executed between those hours, that it be executed at any additional or other time of the day or night. 
3.  Police Assistance. In issuing a nuisance abatement warrant, the judge may authorize any peace officer, as defined in Oregon Revised Statutes, to enter the described property to remove any person or obstacle and to assist the representative of the city in any way necessary to enter the property and, remove and abate the nuisance. 
E.  Execution of Nuisance Abatement Warrants. 
1.  Occupied Property. Except as provided in subsection 2 of this section, in executing a nuisance abatement warrant, the person authorized to execute the warrant shall, before entry into the occupied premises, make a reasonable effort to present the person's credentials, authority and purpose to an occupant or person in possession of the property designated in the warrant and show the occupant or person in possession of the property the warrant or a copy thereof upon request. 
2.  Unoccupied Property. In executing a nuisance abatement warrant on unoccupied property, the person authorized to execute the warrant need not inform anyone of the person's authority and purpose, as prescribed in subsection 1 of this section, but may promptly enter the designated property if it is at the time unoccupied or not in the possession of any person or at the time reasonably believed to be in such condition. In such case a copy of the nuisance abatement warrant shall be conspicuously posted on the property. 
3.  Return. A nuisance abatement warrant must be executed within ten (10) working days of its issue and returned to the judge by whom it was issued within ten (10) working days from its date of execution. After the expiration of the time prescribed by this subsection, the warrant unless executed is void. 
F.  Disposal of Nuisance Items Removed. The city manager may cause the nuisance items removed pursuant to the nuisance abatement warrant to be disposed of in an approved manner whenever the city manager, in the city manager's sole discretion, finds that the fair and reasonable value of the items at resale would be less than the cost of storing and selling the items. In making the above determination, the city manager may include in the costs of sale the reasonable cost of removing the items to a place of storage, of storing the items for resale, of holding the resale auction, including reasonable staff allowances, and all other reasonable and necessary expenses of holding the sale.

Article III. - Property Maintenance, Vacant Buildings and Derelict Buildings 

8.12.250 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish an enforcement program to address the problem of derelict, abandoned, and vacant buildings and property within the city in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the community through the required maintenance of unkempt, unsightly, unsafe, unsanitary, and otherwise improperly maintained premises and structures. 
    The program is intended to protect the city from blight, deterioration, and decay as a result of properties in a condition or state that potentially would have an adverse effect on the value, utility, and habitability of property within the city. In addition to the obvious hazards which these conditions pose to the public health, safety, and welfare, they specifically cause damage to adjoining and nearby properties. A property which is merely unkempt or vacant for long periods may reduce the value of adjoining and nearby property, and the habitability and economic well-being of the city may be materially and adversely affected. 
(Ord. No. 2013-02, § 3, 3-18-2013) 
8.12.260 - Goals. 
    The goal of this article is as follows: 
A.  To supplement this chapter and further define as public nuisances those conditions which constitute visual blight and which could result in conditions which are harmful or deleterious to the public health, safety and welfare; and 
B.  To develop regulations that will promote the sound maintenance of property, enhance the livability, community appearance, and the social, economic, and environmental conditions of the community; and 
C.  To establish guidelines for the correction of property maintenance violations and nuisances that afford due process and procedural guarantees to affected property owners; and 
D.  To support responsible environmental practices with the repair and reuse of existing structures in lieu of demolition of buildings that are able to be repaired. 
(Ord. No. 2013-02, § 3, 3-18-2013)

(Ord. No. 2013-02, § 3, 3-18-2013) 
8.12.320 - Vacant buildings. 
A.  Purpose. Vacant buildings are a cause and source of blight in both residential and non-residential neighborhoods, especially when the person in charge of the building fails to actively maintain and manage the building to ensure that it does not become a liability to the neighborhood. Vacant buildings discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values. Vacant buildings are potential fire hazards and can jeopardize the ability of owners of neighboring property from securing or maintaining affordable fire insurance. Vacant buildings cause increased need for police protection due to misuse of the property by persons not having permission or right to use the property. It is the responsibility of property ownership to prevent owned property from becoming a burden to the neighborhood and community and a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare. One vacant building which is not actively and well maintained and managed can be the core and cause of spreading blight. 
B.  Maintenance and Security Requirements. In addition to the maintenance standards in Sections 8.12.310, the person in charge of a vacant property and/or building shall comply with the following maintenance and security requirements: 
1.  The building and/or property shall be kept free of any accumulation of newspapers, circulars or flyers, graffiti, discarded items including but not limited to furniture, clothing, appliances, or any other items that give the appearance that the property or building is vacant. 
2.  The building and/or property shall be secure so that it is not to accessible to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to the closure and locking of windows and doors (walk through, sliding, and garage) and any other opening of such size that may allow a child to access the interior of a structure; chaining or padlocking gates, and repairing fencing. 
3.  Broken windows and/or doors shall be secured by means of reglazing with undamaged glass or other approved permanent material, and not by cardboard, plywood, or other temporary means except as necessary temporarily for not more than three months while awaiting reglazing. 
4.  The property shall be posted with name and twenty-four (24) hour contact phone number of the owner, person in charge, or a local property management representative. The posting shall be no larger than eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four(24) inches and shall contain the words "THIS PROPERTY MANAGED BY..." The posting shall be secured to the exterior of the building or placed in a location on the property so it is visible from the street. 
5.  Vegetation around the building shall be pruned back from the walls to allow good airflow and security visibility. Overhanging dead tree limbs and branches shall be removed. 
6.  Buildings located in commercial areas shall have some street presence by the display of goods in the storefront windows, interpretive displays, or some other activity that give the appearance of the building being occupied. Displays in vacant buildings shall be reviewed and approved by the city planner prior to installation. 
C.  Long Term Vacant Buildings. If a property is determined to be vacant for more than five years, the property may be subjected to a fee as established by resolution approved in accordance with the city Charter. 
1.  A building is deemed to be a long term vacant building if the following has occurred for a period of five years or more, including the years prior to adoption of this section as verified by city records or other documentation: 
a.  Utilities have been turned off or not in use; or 
b.  Building has been boarded up or secured against any regular use entry; or 
c.  Building is in disrepair to a state that is obviously not habitable; or 
d.  Building is not in compliance with the maintenance and security requirements of this section; or 
e.  Building has not been legally occupied, regardless of the condition of the building. 
2.  Exception. 
a.  The person in charge has obtained a building permit and is progressing diligently to repair the building for occupancy; or 
b.  The building meets all applicable codes, including the property maintenance standards, and is actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent; or 
c.  The city manager may approve an exception based on a written finding that there is a benefit to the community in the building remaining vacant such as, but not limited to, historical significance of the building interior that prevents current use of the building, use of the building that serves a current or future need of the business and/or property owner, etc. and provided that the building is maintained to the standards as identified in the Section 8.12.310. 
D.  Enforcement and Fees. After a determination that a building is deemed a long term vacant building, the city shall notify the person in charge of the property of the following requirements: 
1.  Repair and/or Use of Property. The building shall be repaired to a useable condition and shall be offered for sale, lease, or rent, or shall be legally occupied; and 
2.  Fee Payment. 
E.  Vacant Building Fee. There is imposed upon the person in charge of a vacant building pursuant to this Code, an annual vacant building fee in an amount as established by resolution. The fee shall be payable for any building vacant for more than five consecutive years. Regardless of an imposition of a fee, the building shall be repaired to a useable condition.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    ""A" band level" means the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using A-weighting network. The unit is the dB(A). 
    "Ambient noise" means the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. For the purpose of this chapter, ambient noise level is the level obtained when the noise level is averaged over a period of fifteen (15) minutes without inclusion of noise from isolated identifiable sources, at the location and time of day near that at which a comparison is to be made. Averaging may be done by instrumental analysis in accordance with American National Standard Section 13-1971, or may be done manually as follows: 
1.  Observe a sound level meter for five seconds and record the best estimate of central tendency of the indicator needle, and the highest and lowest indications. 
2.  Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to ensure that observations are made at the beginning and the end of the fifteen (15) minute averaging period and that there are at least as many additional observations as there are decibels between the highest high indication and the lowest low indication. 
3.  Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency indications. 
    "Decibel" means a sound pressure that is twenty (20) times the logarithm to the base ten (10) of the ratio of the pressure of sound to the reference pressure, 2 × 10(-5) Newton/meter(2). 
    "Emergency work" means work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect the health, safety or welfare of persons or property or work by private or public utilities when restoring utility service. 
    "Frequency" of a function periodic in time means the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the hertz and shall be specified. 
    "Impulse noise" means a noise of short duration, usually less than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. 
    "Microbar" means a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is equal to one dyne per square centimeter. 
    "Motor vehicles" mean any self-propelled vehicle operated within the city, including but not limited to licensed or unlicensed vehicles, automobiles, mini-bikes, go-carts and motorcycles. 
    "Period" of a periodic quantity means the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself. 
    "Periodic quantity" means oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time. 
    "Pure tone noise" means any noise which is distinctly audible as a single pitch (frequency) or set of pitches as determined by the enforcement officer. 
    "Residential premise" means any premise where single or multiple-dwelling units exist and shall include schools, churches, hospitals, nursing homes and similar institutional facilities. 
    "Sound level" (noise level), in decibels (dB) means the sound measured with the A-weighting and slow response by a sound level meter. 
    "Sound level meter" means an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of sound levels which satisfies the pertinent requirements in American Standard Specifications for Sound Level Meters Section 1.4-1971 or the most recent revision thereof.

Chapter 8.16 - CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES 

8.16.010 - Declaration of purpose. 
    It is found and declared that: 
A.  Repeated nuisance activities occurring on, or resulting from the use of, certain properties within the city create unreasonable disruptions and may create unsafe conditions in the neighborhoods where the properties are located; 
B.  Chronic nuisance properties degrade neighborhoods; 
C.  Existing state criminal statutes and city ordinances are inadequate to address, control or remedy the adverse impacts of chronic unlawful activity occurring at the properties; and 
D.  Civil regulation of these properties will provide a remedy to the problems caused by these chronic behaviors and will promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
E.  An additional purpose of this section is to establish an expedited enforcement program to address the problem of properties and/or property owners (person in charge) with multiple, continuing violations concerning derelict, abandoned, or vacant commercial and residential buildings and property within the city. Violations of other offenses as defined in Chapter 8.12 may also be declared to be a chronic nuisance. 
F.  Chronic nuisance properties present health, safety and welfare concerns, where the persons responsible for such properties have failed to take corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance properties have a negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. This section is enacted to remedy nuisance activities that are particularly disruptive to quality of life and repeatedly occur or exist at properties, by providing a process for abatement. This remedy is not an exclusive remedy and may be used in conjunction with such other remedy authorized by law.

8.16.040 - Police chief's determination. 
A.  If the police chief or the city manager determines that property may become a chronic nuisance property, the police chief shall notify the owner and the owner's registered agent, if known, in writing.

C.  The order may include conditions under which abatement or closure is to occur. 
D.  Existing City Permits. In addition to any other remedy that is authorized by this chapter or other laws, upon the finding by the municipal court that a property is a chronic nuisance property, the person in charge is subject to the suspension or revocation of a business license, other city license, or city permit for the subject property issued pursuant to this Code, the Sheridan Development Code, or other city codes. Permits and/or licenses issued to a tenant who has not caused or participated in the nuisance activity shall not be suspended or revoked as a result of the actions of the person in charge of the subject property. 
    If a permit or license is suspended, it may be reinstated by the city manager or designee once the nuisance has been abated and all liens, fines, fees, or costs have been satisfied. A new permit or license for the subject property shall not be issued to the person in charge or business associated with the nuisance until the nuisance has been abated and all city liens, fines, fees, or costs have been satisfied.

B.  A chronic nuisance determination and remedy may be applied to multiple units, up to and including the entire property, if the municipal judge determines that: 
1.  The incidents occurred in the common areas of the property or otherwise are not reasonably attributable to a particular unit; 
2.  The nature or scope of the incidents is such that they cannot reasonably be attributed to a particular unit; 
3.  Incidents continue to occur despite previous imposition of remedies on specific units and the owner has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to mitigate or correct the nuisance; or 
4.  The owner has taken no reasonable action to regain possession from those convicted of the offences listed in Section 8.16.040(B)(3). 
(Ord. 03-8 § 6, 2003; Ord. No. 2013-03, §§ 1, 2, 5-20-2013) 
8.16.070 - Request for hearing. 
A.

The request must set forth the issues sought to be determined and a general statement of the relevant facts.

C.  The request for a hearing must be received by the municipal court by four-thirty p.m. on the seventeenth (17th) day after the order was issued and mailed to the owner. Failure to file the request with the court within the time limit shall be a jurisdictional defect and a failure to exhaust remedies and the civil penalty or closure order shall become final. Failure to mail or deliver to the city a copy of the request within five days of filing with the court shall constitute grounds for dismissal upon motion of the city unless the court finds good faith excusable neglect. 
(Ord. 03-8 § 7, 2003; Ord. No. 2013-03, §§ 1, 2, 5-20-2013)

Any service animal that is allowed to annoy, molest, bark continuously, attack or injure any person or animal on park property or is tied up and left unattended will no longer be deemed a service animal and will not be permitted to remain on the premises. Service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animals' work or the individual's disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the animal through voice, signal, or other effective controls. 
Under the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, a service animal is defined as a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. The work or task the animal has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person's disability. A service animal whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animal under the ADA. 
A miniature horse that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people [with] disabilities will be considered a service animal. Miniature horses generally range in height from twenty-four (24) to thirty-four (34) inches measured to the shoulders and generally weigh between seventy (70) to one hundred (100) pounds. Entry into a park will be permitted where reasonable. There are four assessment factors which are: 
(1)  Whether the miniature horse is housebroken; 
(2)  Whether the miniature horse is under the owner's control; 
(3)  Whether the facility can accommodate the miniature horse's type, size, and weight; and 
(4)  Whether the miniature horse's presence will not compromise legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility. 
B.  As used in subsection (A), the term "parks privileges" means the ability to enter a city park or make any use of any city park facilities. 
C.  A person may be immediately ejected form [from] a city park or all city parks based on conduct from subsection (A), at the discretion of the public works director or other authorized designee.

In situations where circumstances make the cost of an alternative water source prohibitive, additional service may be granted to existing dwellings along the mainline extension. 
10.  The applicant made and documented reasonable efforts to obtain an alternative source of potable domestic water, and failed to secure such water supplies despite such best efforts. 
R.  Notwithstanding the foregoing criteria, the city reserves the right to grant access to city water service to properties located outside the city municipal boundaries in exchange for easement or other property rights beneficial to the city.

A.  There is granted to West County Sanitary Service, Inc., hereinafter called the "franchisee," the exclusive right, privilege and franchise to provide all solid waste management service in the city and to use the public rights-of-way of the city for the purposes of this franchise. 
B.  Exceptions to the exclusive right, privilege and franchise are: 
1.  A person may engage in the collection of source-separated materials for recycling or resource recovery, but only for the purpose of raising funds for a charitable, civic or benevolent activity. Such person or their representative must notify the city and franchisee in writing of their intent to engage in such activity and specify the time when such activity is to take place. 
2.  A person may transport solid waste which such person produces directly to an authorized disposal site or recycling or resource recovery facility. However, the household solid waste produced and placed in a receptacle by a tenant, licensee, occupant or person other than the owner of the leased, occupied or licensed premises shall be considered produced by the tenant, licensee, occupant or person and not produced by the landlord or property owner. 
3.  A person may engage in the practice of pumping, transporting and disposing of septic tank and cesspool pumpings or other sludge, provided such activity is conducted in compliance with applicable state and local laws.

Upon giving such notice of termination, the franchisee shall have a franchise which will terminate seven years from the date of the notice of termination. The city may later extend the term or reinstate a continuing renewal upon mutual agreement with the franchisee. If the city notifies the franchisee of its intent to terminate the franchise, the franchisee shall have the right for a hearing before the city council before any termination is made, provided such hearing is requested by the franchisee within thirty (30) days of the notice, in writing.

Chapter 13.24 - SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT CHARGES 

13.24.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the systems development charges (SDC) is to impose an equitable share of the public costs of capital improvements upon those developments that create the need for or increase the demands on capital improvements. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.015, 1991) 
13.24.020 - Scope. 
    The systems development charge imposed by Section 13.24.040 is separate from and in addition to any applicable tax, assessment, charge, fee in lieu of assessment, or fee otherwise provided by law or imposed as a condition of development. A systems development charge is to be considered in the nature of a charge for service rendered or facilities made available, or a charge for future services to be rendered on facilities to be made available in the future. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.017, 1991) 
13.24.030 - Definitions. 
    The following words and phrases, as used in this chapter, have the following definitions and meanings: 
    "Capital improvements" means public facilities or assets used for any of the following: 
1.  Water supply, treatment and distribution; 
2.  Sanitary sewers, including collection, transmission and treatment; 
3.  Storm sewers, including drainage and flood control; 
4.  Transportation, including but not limited to streets, sidewalks, bike lanes and paths, street lights, traffic signs and signals, street trees, public transportation, vehicle parking, and bridges; or 
5.  Parks and recreation, including but not limited to neighborhood parks, mini neighborhood parks, community parks, public open space and trail systems, buildings, courts, fields and other like facilities. 
    "Development" means conducting a building or mining operation, or making a physical change in the use or appearance of a structure or land, which increases the usage of any capital improvements or which will contribute to the need for additional or enlarged capital improvements. 
    "Public improvement charge" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements to be constructed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. This term shall have the same meaning as the term "improvement fee" as used in ORS 223.297 through 223.314. 
    "Qualified public improvements" means a capital improvement that is: 
1.  Required as a condition of development approval; 
2.  Identified in the plan adopted pursuant to Section 13.24.060(B); and 
3.  Not located on or contiguous to a parcel of land that is the subject of the development approval. 
    "Reimbursement fee" means a fee for costs associated with capital improvements constructed or under construction on the date the fee is adopted pursuant to Section 13.24.040. 
    "Systems development charge" means a reimbursement fee, a public improvement charge or a combination thereof, assessed or collected at any of the times specified in Section 13.24.070. It shall not include connection or hookup fees for sanitary sewers, storm drains or water lines. Such fees are designed by the city only to reimburse the city for actual or average costs for such connections. Nor shall the SDC include costs for capital improvements which by city policy and state statute are paid for by assessments (or fees in lieu of assessments) for projects of special benefit to a property. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.010, 1991) 
13.24.040 - Systems development charge established. 
A.  Unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of this chapter or other local or state law, a systems development charge is imposed upon all new development within the city, and all new development outside the boundary of the city that connects to or otherwise uses the sanitary sewer system, storm drainage system or water system of the city. The city manager is authorized to make interpretations of this section, subject to appeal to the city council. 
B.  Systems development charges for each type of capital improvement may be created through application of the methodologies described in Section 13.24.050. The amounts of each system development charge shall be adopted initially by council resolution. Changes in the amounts shall also be adopted by resolution, except changes resulting solely from inflationary cost impacts. Inflationary cost impacts shall be measured and calculated each January by the city manager and charged accordingly. Such calculations will be based upon changes in the Engineering News Record Construction Index (ENR Index) for Seattle, Washington, or any suitable replacement index identified by the council by resolution. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.020, 1991) 
13.24.050 - Methodology. 
A.  The methodology used to establish a reimbursement fee shall consider the cost of then-existing facilities, prior contributions by then-existing users, the value of unused capacity, rate-making principles employed to finance publicly owned capital improvements, and other relevant factors. The methodology shall promote the objective that future systems users shall contribute an equitable share of the cost of then-existing facilities. 
B.  The methodology used to establish the public improvement charge shall consider the cost of projected capital improvements needed to increase the capacity of the systems to which the fee is related and shall provide for a credit against the public improvement charge for the construction of any qualified public improvement. 
C.  The methodology may also provide for a credit as authorized in Section 13.24.090. 
D.  Except when authorized in the methodology adopted under subsection A of this section, the fees required by this chapter which are assessed or collected as part of a local improvement district or a charge in lieu of a local improvement district assessment, or the cost of complying with requirements or conditions imposed by a land use decision, are separate from and in addition to the systems development charge and shall not be used as a credit against such charge. 
E.  The methodologies used to establish the systems development charge shall be adopted by resolution of council. The specific systems development charge may be adopted and amended concurrent with the establishment or revision of the systems development charge methodology. The city manager shall review the methodologies established under this section periodically and shall recommend amendments, if and as needed, to the council for its action. 
F.  The formulas and calculations used to compute specific SDC's are based upon averages and typical conditions, Whenever the impact of individual developments present special or unique situations such that the calculated fee is grossly disproportionate to the actual impact of the development, alternate fee calculations may be approved or required by the city manager under prescribed administrative procedures. All data submitted to support alternate calculations under this provision shall be specific to the site and development under consideration. Major or unique developments may require special analyses to determine alternatives to the standard methodology. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.030, 1991) 
13.24.060 - Compliance with state law. 
A.  The revenues received from the systems development charges shall be budgeted and expended as provided by state law. Such revenues and expenditures shall be accounted for as required by state law. Their reporting shall be included in the city's comprehensive annual financial report required by ORS Chapter 294. B. The capital plan for capital improvements required by state law as the basis for expending the public improvement charge component of systems development charge revenues shall be the Sheridan capital improvement plan (CIP); adopted facilities plans; the capital improvement plan of any other governmental entity with which the city has cooperative agreement for the financing of commonly-used public improvements by the collection of system charges; provided such plans conform with state law and are consistent with the city's CIP and the city's comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.040, 1991) 
13.24.070 - Collection of charge. 
A.  The systems development charge is payable upon, and as a condition of, issuance of: 
1.  A building permit; 
2.  A development permit for development not requiring the issuance of a building permit; or 
3.  A permit to connect to the water, sanitary sewer or storm drainage systems. 
B.  If development is commenced or connection is made to the water system, sanitary sewer system or storm sewer system without an appropriate permit, the systems development charge is immediately payable upon the earliest date that a permit was required, and it will be unlawful for anyone to continue with the construction or use constituting a development until the charge has been paid or payment secured to the satisfaction of the city manager. 
C.  Any and all persons causing, constructing, conducting, occupying or using the development or making application for the needed permit, or otherwise responsible for the development, are jointly and severally obligated to pay the charge, and the city manager may collect the said charge from any of them. The city manager or his/her designee shall not issue any permit or allow connections described in subsection A of this section until the charge has been paid in full or until an adequate secured arrangement for its payment has been made, within the limits prescribed by resolution of the city council. 
D.  A systems development charge shall be paid in cash when due, or in lieu thereof, the city manager may accept the delivery of a written agreement to pay if the written agreement is secured by collateral satisfactory to the city manager or his/her designee. The collateral may consist of a municipal lien or the property being developed, mortgage or trust deeds on other real property, or an agreement secured by surety bond issued by a corporation licensed by a state law to give such undertakings, or by cash deposit, letter of credit, or other like security acceptable to the city manager. 
E.  The person paying the systems development charge in installments may apply for deferral of the payments as provided by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.050, 1991) 
13.24.080 - Exemptions. 
    The following are exempt from the systems development charge imposed in Section 13.24.040: 
A.  Except for the systems development charge attributable to the sanitary sewer system, water system and the storm sewer system, development which existed on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter or for which a building permit was issued before that date; 
B.  An alteration, addition, replacement or change in use that does not increase the use capital improvements; 
C.  Housing for low-income or elderly persons which is exempt from real property taxes under state law. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.060, 1991) 
13.24.090 - Credits. 
A.  As used in this section and in the definition of "qualified public improvements" in Section 13.24.030, the word "contiguous" means that part of a public way which abuts the development parcel. 
B.  When development occurs that must pay a systems development charge under Section 13.24.040, the systems development charge for the existing use shall be calculated and if it is less than the systems development charge for the proposed use, the difference between the systems development charge for the existing use and the systems development charge for the proposed use shall be the systems development charge required under Section 13.24.040. If the change in use results in the systems development charge for the proposed use being less than the system development charge for the existing use, no systems development charge shall be required; however, no refund or credit shall be given. 
C.  The limitations on the use of credits contained in this subsection shall not apply when credits are otherwise given under this section. A credit shall be given for the cost of a qualified public improvement associated with a development. If a qualified public improvement is located partially on and partially off the parcel of land that is the subject of the approval, the credits shall be given only for the cost of the portion of the improvement not located on or wholly contiguous to the parcel of land. The credit provided for by this subsection shall be only for the public improvement charge charged for the type of improvement being constructed and shall not exceed the public improvement charge even if the cost of the capital improvement exceeds the applicable public improvement charge. 
D.  Applying the adopted methodology, the city manager may grant a credit against the public improvement charge, the reimbursement fee, or both, for a capital improvement provided as part of the development that reduces the development's demand upon existing capital improvements or the need for future capital improvements or that would otherwise have to be constructed at city's expense under then-existing council policies. 
E.  In situations where the amount of credit exceeds the amount of the systems development charge, the excess credit is not transferable to another development. It may be transferred to another phase of the original development. 
F.  Credit shall not be transferable from one type of capital improvements to another. 
(Ord. 91-14 § 4.20.070, 1991) 
13.24.100 - Appeal procedures. 
A.  As used in this section, "working day" means a day when the general offices of the city are open to transact business with the public. 
B.

A notice of special assessment, including the right to a hearing, as set out in subsections D.5. and D.6., shall be sent first class mail, from the city's finance director to the property owner/lessee at the address listed for the property owner in the county record and the property address. If any notice is returned, the property shall be posted with such notice. 
b.  The property owner/lessee has thirty (30) days from the date the notice of special assessment is mailed or if notice is returned, from the date the property is posted to pay the assessment. Failure to pay within the time allotted will cause the special assessment to be recorded against the property. The special assessment will constitute a continuing lien against such property. 
c.  The amount of the assessment will include, in addition to all contractors' charges, inspection costs, attorneys' fees, court costs, and all other associated costs. Payments must be made directly to the city's finance director. 
d.  Unpaid assessments will be filed with the proper office of the county clerk. 
e.  An owner/lessee may object to such assessment within thirty (30) days from the date the notice of assessment was mailed or if the notice is returned, from the date the property is posted. The objection must be in writing and mailed to and received by the building official within the thirty (30) day period. The objection must include a phone number and address of the objecting party, and must state the basis for the objection and must be on forms made available for this purpose by the building inspection division. Upon receipt of such objection and payment of the appropriate fee, the building official will notify the city recorder who will then set a hearing date, which hearing shall be at a regularly or specially scheduled meeting of the city council following receipt of the objection. Notice of this date will be mailed to the person making the objection. Failure to include an address in the objection will constitute a waiver of the right to file an objection. 
f.  The city council shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The building official shall carry the burden of establishing that costs for abatement represented in the special assessment were reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The standard of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. A written decision will be prepared at the end of the hearing. This decision will be reached after both the landowner and the building official have presented their cases. The decision will be deemed effective three days from the date the decision is mailed to the owner/lessee and will be a final decision. 
2.  Revolving Fund. The city council may establish a special revolving fund to be designated as the repair, rehabilitation, remediation, and demolition fund. Payments shall be made out of said fund upon the demand of the building official to defray the costs and expenses which may be incurred by this jurisdiction in doing or causing to be done the necessary work of repair or demolition of dangerous buildings. 
(Ord. No. 2008-06, § 1, 11-3-2008)

H.  Utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system. 
2.  All new and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed and located to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
3.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding consistent with the state department of environmental quality regulations. 
I.  Residential Developments Generally. Residential developments involving more than one detached single-family dwelling or more than one duplex, including but not limited to partitions, subdivisions, manufactured home parks, multiple-family dwellings and planned unit developments, including development regulated under Sections 16.280.070 A., B., and C., shall: 
1.  Be designed and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
2.  Provide public and private utilities and facilities, including but not limited to sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, which are designed, located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; 
3.  Provide adequate drainage to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and 
4.  Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated by the applicant. 
J.  Storage of Materials and Equipment. Materials that are buoyant, flammable, toxic or otherwise injurious to persons or property, and can be transported by floodwaters, are prohibited. Storage of materials and equipment not having these characteristics is permissible only if the materials and equipment have low damage potential and are anchored or are readily removable from the area within the time available after forecasting and warning. 
K.  Review of Building Permits. Where elevation data is not available either through the flood insurance study, flood insurance rate map, or from another authoritative source in accordance with Section 16.280.030 G.5., Use of Other Base Flood Data (in A zone), flood plain development permit applications related to a building permit shall be reviewed through the type I-B process to ensure the proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness shall be based on available data, including but not limited to historical data, high water marks, and photographs of past flooding. The lowest floor shall be at least two feet above grade in these zones. 
L.  Floodways. The floodway is designated within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 16.280.030 B., Basis for Special Flood Hazard Areas. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential projectiles, and causes erosion. The following provisions shall apply to development in the floodway: 
1.  Encroachments, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development are prohibited, except as set forth in subsection L.2. 
2.  Encroachments, including but not limited to fill, new construction, substantial improvements, water facilities, sewer facilities, storm drainage facilities, and transportation facilities, public parks and other development by the city, the county and state and federal agencies for public infrastructure, are allowed through a flood plain development permit processed as a type I-B action, when certification by a registered professional civil engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with FEMA standards and standard engineering practices that the encroachments shall not result in an increase in flood levels of more than one-foot during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. This evaluation may be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for technical review. 
3.  For structures, the area below the lowest floor shall remain open and unenclosed to allow the unrestricted flow of floodwaters beneath the structure. 
4.  A manufactured home on an individual lot or parcel or in a manufactured home park is prohibited in the floodway. 
5.  Projects for stream habitat restoration may be permitted in the floodway provided: 
a.  The project qualifies for a Department of the Army, Portland District "Regional General Permit for Stream Habitat Restoration" (NWP-2007-1023); 
b.  A qualified professional (a registered professional engineer; or staff of the natural resources conservation service; the county; or fisheries, natural resources, or water resources agencies) has provided a feasibility analysis and certification that the project was designed to keep any rise in 100-year flood levels as close to zero as practically possible given the goals of the project; 
c.  No structures would be impacted by a potential rise in flood elevation; and 
d.  An agreement to monitor the project, correct problems, and ensure the flood carrying capacity remains unchanged is included as part of the local approval. 
6.  In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development, including fill, shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, unless through a flood plain development permit processed as a type I-B action, it is demonstrated in a written report that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
7.  Temporary structures placed in the floodway. Relief from the no-rise evaluation, elevation or dry floodproofing standards may be granted for a non-residential structure during the dry season, June - October. A plan for the removal of the temporary structure after the dry season or when a flood event threatens during the dry season shall be provided. The plan shall include disconnecting and protecting from water infiltration and damage all utilities servicing the temporary structure. 
8.  Temporary storage of goods and materials, not including hazardous materials, is allowed in the floodway during the dry season, June - October. 
M.  Recreational Vehicles. 
1.  A recreational vehicle in a recreational vehicle park shall comply with subsections M.1.a., or M.1.b., or M.1.c of this section: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
b.  Be: 
i.  Fully licensed and ready for highway use; 
ii.  On its wheels or jacking system; 
iii.  Have no permanently attached additions; and 
iv.  Be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type devices for utilities and security systems; 
c.  Meet the requirements of Section 16.280.070B., Manufactured Homes. 
2.  A recreational vehicle not in a recreational vehicle park shall: 
a.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; 
b.  Be on its wheels or jacking system; 
c.  Have no permanently attached additions; and 
d.  Be attached to the site only by quick disconnect type devices for electricity. 
N.  Below Grade Crawl Space. 
1.  A below-grade crawlspace is allowed subject to the following standards as found in FEMA technical bulletin 11-01, "Crawlspace Construction for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas." For structures with a below grade crawlspace the national flood insurance program requires increased insurance premium costs due to a charge that is added to the basic policy premium for the below-grade crawlspace. Contact an insurance agent for more information. 
a.  The building shall be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Hydrostatic loads and the effects of buoyancy can usually be addressed through the required openings stated in subsection B. Because of hydrodynamic loads, crawlspace construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered professional engineer. Other types of foundations are recommended for these areas. 
b.  The crawl space is an enclosed area below the base flood elevation (BFE) and, as such, shall have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. The bottom of each flood vent opening shall be no more than one foot above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. 
c.  Portions of the building below the level that is one-foot above the BFE shall be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, including but not limited to the foundation walls of the crawlspace used to elevate the building, posts, joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the level that is one-foot above the BFE. The recommended construction practice is to elevate the bottom of joists and all insulation above BFE. 
d.  Any building utility systems within the crawlspace shall be at least one-foot above the base flood elevation. 
e.  The interior grade of a crawlspace below the base flood elevation shall not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade. 
f.  The height of the below-grade crawlspace, measured from the interior grade of the crawlspace to the top of the crawlspace foundation wall shall not exceed four feet at any point. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood hazard areas. 
g.  There shall be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawlspace. The enclosed area shall be drained within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system may vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through proven porous, well-drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles or gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means. 
h.  The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawlspace. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used. 
2.  For more detailed information refer to FEMA technical bulletin 11-01, including the diagrams that illustrate the two-foot and four-foot rules, and note the state building code requirements require the lowest floor to be at least one-foot above the base flood elevation for residential structures. 
O.  Critical Facilities. 
1.  Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the area of special flood hazard (100-year floodplain). 
2.  Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the area of special flood hazard if no feasible alternative site is available. 
3.  Critical facilities constructed within the area of special flood hazard shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet above the base flood elevation or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. 
4.  Access routes to and from critical facilities shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation to the extent possible and should be elevated three feet above the base flood elevation or to the height of the 500-year flood, whichever is higher. 
5.  Floodproofing and sealing measures shall be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. 
P.  AH Zone Drainage. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011; Ord. No. 2016-03, § 3, 4-18-2016) 
16.280.080 - Generalized floodplain areas. 
    Where elevation data is generalized, such as the unnumbered A zones on the flood insurance rate map, a flood plain development permit processed as a type I-B action shall include a review and determination that the proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding and meet the flood protection standards. In determining whether the proposed floodplain development is reasonably safe, historical data, high water marks, photographs of past flooding, or data (e.g. an engineering study or soil and landscape analysis) may be submitted by qualified professionals that demonstrate the site is not in a floodplain. In such cases, a letter of map amendment may be required by the city manager, or designee. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011; Ord. No. 2016-03, § 3, 4-18-2016) 
16.280.090 - Flood plain variances-Issuance, notification and records. 
A.  The city manager shall decide requests for variances from the requirements of the flood plain overlay district consistent with the type I process. Generally, the only situation under which a variance from the elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, in conformance with the criteria in Section 16.280.100. For lots greater than one-half acre the technical justification required for approving the variance increases. 
B.  Prior to, or after, the application has been submitted the city manager, or designee, shall notify the applicant in writing that: (1) the granting of a variance to construct a structure with the elevation of the lowest floor less than one foot above the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance commensurate with the increased rick resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation; and (2) such construction less than one foot above the base flood elevation increases risk to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions as required in subsection C. 
C.  The city manager, or designee, shall: 
1.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance; and 
2.  Report variances granted to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
D.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the statewide inventory of historic properties, without regard to the procedures set forth in Sections 16.280.090, Variances, and 16.280.100, Variance Criteria. 
E.  Upon consideration of the factors in Section 16.280.100, the application may be approved, approved with conditions or denied as deemed necessary to implement the flood plain overlay district. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011; Ord. No. 2016-03, § 3, 4-18-2016; Ord. No. 2017-03, § 2, 3-20-2017) 
16.280.100 - Variance criteria. 
    In deciding variance applications, the decision authority shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other relevant sections of the zoning and development ordinance, and the following factors: 
A.  There is a good and sufficient cause; 
B.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
C.  Granting the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws; 
D.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
E.  The variance will be consistent with the intent and purpose of the provision being varied; 
F.  There has not been a previous land use action approved on the basis that variances would not be allowed; 
G.  The new construction or substantial improvement is not within any designated regulatory floodway, or if located in a floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result; 
H.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
I.  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
J.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
K.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
L.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
M.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
N.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
O.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan, the underlying zone for the subject property, and the flood plain overlay district for that area; 
P.  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
Q.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; 
R.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges; 
S.  Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical piece of property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances. They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential neighborhoods. As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare; and 
T.  Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight or dry-floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria except Section 16.280.090.A., and otherwise complies with Sections 16.280.070.F., Anchoring, G., Construction Materials and Methods, and H., Utilities. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011; Ord. No. 2016-03, § 3, 4-18-2016; Ord. No. 2017-03, § 2, 3-20-2017) 
16.280.110 - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by the Flood Plain Overlay District is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on occasion. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. The Flood Plain Overlay District does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. The Flood Plain Overlay District will not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or employee thereof or the federal insurance administration for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
SECTION 16.285 - LIMITED USE OVERLAY DISTRICT (LUO) 

16.285.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the LUO District is to reduce the list of permitted uses in a district to those that are suitable for a particular location. Zoning districts permit a number of uses which may be considered compatible in terms of the type and intensity of activity with uses on adjacent properties. However, on a particular property certain permitted uses may conflict with uses on adjacent properties. Rather than deny appropriate permitted uses because the proposed district would permit an objectionable use, the LUO District can be used to identify the appropriate uses and require a conditional use permit for other uses normally permitted in the district. It is the intent that the maximum number of acceptable uses be permitted so the use of the property is not unnecessarily limited. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.020 - Application of the LUO District. 
A.  Requirements. When the LUO District is applied, the uses permitted in the underlying district shall be limited to those permitted uses specifically referenced in the ordinance or resolution adopting the LUO District. Until the LUO District has been removed or amended, the only permitted uses in the district shall be those specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance or resolution. Uses that would otherwise be permitted may only be allowed if a conditional use permit is approved. 
B.  Procedures. The LUO District shall be applied at the time the underlying district is changed. The hearing notice of a rezoning application that may apply the LUO District shall state the LUO District may be applied. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.030 - Criteria. 
    The ordinance or resolution adopting the LUO District shall include findings showing that: 
A.  No district has a list of permitted uses where all the applicant's desired uses would be appropriate; 
B.  The proposed district is the best suited to accommodate the desired uses; 
C.  It is necessary to limit the uses permitted in the proposed district to ensure abutting properties, and properties n the neighborhood, will not be negatively affected; and; 
D.  The maximum number of acceptable uses in the district has been identified and will be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.040 - Adopting ordinance or resolution identification of uses. 
    The ordinance or resolution adopting the LUO District shall by section reference, or by name identify, those permitted uses in the district that will remain permitted uses. A permitted use description may be segmented to require a conditional use for distinct uses that may not be compatible. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.050 - Official zoning map amendment. 
    The official zoning district map shall be amended to show an "LUO" suffix on any parcel where the LUO District has been applied. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.060 - Development provisions. 
    Development of property located within the LUO District shall comply with all applicable procedures or development requirements contained in the city's development code. Compliance with the city's development code provisions is not waived, altered or otherwise modified by the LUO District. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.285.070 - Recording of LUO District. 
    Any ordinance or resolution adopting a LUO District shall be recorded in the deed and mortgage records of Yamhill County at the applicant's expense. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
SECTION 16.290 - HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (HDO) 

16.290.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the HDO District is: 
A.

(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.290.060 - Development standards generally. 
A.  Planned Unit Development Concept. All residential subdivisions proposed for sites larger than one acre shall be developed as a planned unit development, subject to the requirements of Sections 16.290, HDO, and 16.562, Planned Unit Development Applications, if more than ten (10) percent of the site area is comprised of slopes in excess of ten (10) percent. 
B.  Conservation of Natural Features. 
1.  Hillside development shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained to require the minimum feasible amount of land coverage, as well as the minimum disturbance of soil and site by grading, excavation, and other land alterations. 
2.  Hillside development shall be planned, designed, constructed and maintained to avoid: 
a.  Accelerated erosion; 
b.  Pollution, contamination, or siltation of streams and rivers; 
c.  Damage to vegetation; 
d.  Injury to wildlife and fish habitats; 
e.  The alteration of natural drainage channels resulting in a reduction of water-carrying capacity. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.290.070 - Utility lines and facilities. 
A.  All electrical power distribution and service lines, telephone lines, gas distribution and service lines, cable television lines, and appurtenant facilities shall be installed underground unless the applicant demonstrates that installation of any of the foregoing line and facilities above ground will better protect scenic and environmental values. 
B.  The following types of lines and facilities may be excepted from the requirements of subsection A. of this section: 
1.  Poles without overhead lines and used exclusively for lighting purposes or traffic control; 
2.  Overhead wires attached to the exterior surface of a building by means of a bracket or other fixtures and extending from one location on the building to another location on the same building; 
3.  Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, such as at grade transformers, pedestal-mounted terminal boxes, and meter cabinets and concealed ducts, provided that such facilities shall be located and designed to harmonize with the area, and shall be appropriately screened and landscaped. In appropriate instances, all or part of the transformers and service terminals shall be flush with or below the surface of the ground at the point of installation.

(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.290.080 - Water supply and distribution. 
A.  Each lot, parcel and multiple-dwelling unit shall be supplied with an adequate amount of water for its intended use, and the development shall be supplied with water adequate to fight fires on the site. 
B.  A hillside development shall have a water distribution system that will be adequate in volume and pressure to furnish each lot, parcel and multiple-dwelling unit. In addition, a hillside development shall provide adequate means for delivering water at adequate pressures and quantities by fire hydrants, or otherwise, to any location within the development for fire protection. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.290.090 - Circulation and streets. 
A.  Streets within the HDO District shall be private streets. The location, alignment, design, grade, width, and capacity of streets within the development shall conform to city engineering standards. However, the use of reduced width private streets shall be encouraged in hill areas to reduce the disturbance of the natural landscape. The width of these streets shall be allowed to be as narrow as public safety, pedestrian facilities, parking and traffic generation will permit. 
B.  Loop and split, one-way street sections, and occasional steep street grades shall be allowed to fit terrain and minimize grading and exposed slopes. 
C.  Streets in hill areas shall be laid out to encourage slow speed traffic and respect the natural topography of the area. 
D.  Street grades may be permitted up to fifteen (15) percent provided they do not exceed two hundred (200) feet in length, whereby they must be reduced to ten (10) percent or less for a minimum length of two hundred (200) feet. The overall grade shall not exceed ten (10) percent. 
E.  Culverts, bridges and other drainage structures shall be placed to encourage drainage in established drainageways. 
F.  Additional road construction improvements may be required in areas exhibiting poor soil stability.

The circulation system shall, when feasible, be developed throughout the hill areas, to provide connections between park areas and scenic easements to help maximize the leisure opportunities of the hills. Trails may be accepted by the city in fee simple ownership or easement. 
H.  Accessways shall be required when determined by the decision authority to be needed for public safety and convenience. When required, accessways shall be at least eight feet wide unless a greater need is shown. Accessways shall be constructed of a material suitable for use in the particular area, and shall be located to provide maximum pedestrian safety and preservation of the character of the area. 
I.  Parking shall be provided on at least one side of all public streets , except where the topography renders development adjacent to the street impractical, or where the street serves solely as an access road, or where an adequate number of off-street parking spaces are provided on lots adjacent to the street. 
J.  Driveways shall be designed to a grade and alignment that will provide the maximum safety and convenience for vehicular and pedestrian use. Common private driveways shall be encouraged where their utilization will result in better building sites and reduced land coverage than would result if a private road were required. 
K.  Minimum standards for private street and private access easement construction within the hillside area shall be as follows: 
1.  Minimum travel service width: twelve (12) feet; 
2.  Minimum vertical clearance: fourteen (14) feet; 
3.  Minimum horizontal clearance: twenty (20) feet;

3.  The construction of Portland cement concrete sidewalks along all new public streets, and private streets in the Hillside Development Overlay District. 
4.  All improvements required under this subsection shall be completed prior to the approval by the city and recording of the final partition plat. 
B.  Subdivisions. 
1.  The following improvements shall be required for all subdivisions: 
a.  Frontage Improvements. One-half street improvements to full city standards shall be required for all public streets on which a proposed subdivision fronts. Such improvements shall be blended to match with existing improved surfaces across the center line and for a reasonable distance beyond the frontage of the property. Additional frontage improvements shall include: Portland cement concrete sidewalks, curbing, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, water lines, other public utilities as necessary, and such other improvements as the city shall determine to be necessary to serve the development or the immediate neighborhood. 
b.  Project Streets. All public or private streets within the subdivision shall be constructed as required by the provisions of this title. 
c.  Monuments. Upon completion of street improvements, previously existing monuments shall be re-established and protected in monument boxes at every street intersection and all points of curvature and points of tangency of street center lines. Elevation bench marks shall be established at each street intersection monument with elevations to U.S. Geological Survey datum. 
d.  Surface Drainage and Storm Sewer System. Drainage facilities shall be provided within the subdivision and to connect the subdivision drainage to drainageways or to storm sewers outside the subdivision. Design of drainage within the subdivision shall take into account the capacity and grade necessary to maintain unrestricted flow from areas draining through the subdivision and to allow extension of the system to serve such areas. 
e.  Sanitary Sewers. Sanitary sewer shall be installed to serve the subdivision and to connect the subdivision to existing mains both on and off the property being subdivided. 
If the required sewer facilities will, without further sewer construction, directly serve property outside the subdivision, the planning commission may recommend to the city council construction as an assessment project with such arrangement with the subdivider as is equitable to assure financing the subdivider's share of the construction. 
The city may require that the subdivider construct sewage lines of a size in excess of that necessary to adequately service the development in question, where such facilities are or will be necessary to serve the entire area within which the development is located when the area is ultimately developed. The city may also require that the construction take place as an assessment project with such arrangement with the subdivider as is desirable to assure the subdivider's share of the construction. 
f.  Water System. Water lines with valves and fire hydrants serving the subdivision and connecting the subdivision to the city mains shall be installed. The design shall take into account provisions for extension beyond the subdivision to adequately grid the city system and to serve the area within which the development is located when the area is ultimately developed. However, the city will not require the subdivider to pay for the extra cost of mains exceeding eight inches in size. 
g.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be installed along both sides of each public street and in any accessways within the subdivision. 
h.  Other. 
i.  Curb cuts and driveway installations are not required of the subdivider, but, if installed, shall be according to the city standards. 
ii.  Street tree planting is not required of the subdivider, but, if planted, shall be according to city requirements and of a species compatible with the width of the planting strip. 
i.  Street Lights. The installation of street lights is required at locations and of a type required by city standards. 
j.  Street Signs and Striping. The installation of street name signs, traffic control signs and striping is required at locations determined to be appropriate by the city and shall be of a type required by city standards. 
2.  All improvements required under this subsection shall be completed to city standards, or assured through a performance bond or other instrument at the discretion of the city manager and acceptable to the city attorney, prior to recording of the final plat. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011)

A.  Improvement work shall not commence until construction plans have been checked for adequacy and approved by the city. Plans shall be prepared in accordance with requirements of the city. 
B.  Improvement work shall not commence until the city has been notified in advance; and, if work has been discontinued for any reason, it shall not be resumed until the city has been notified. 
C.  Improvements shall be constructed under the inspection and to the satisfaction of the city manager or designee. The city may require changes in typical sections and details in the public interest, if unusual conditions arise during construction to warrant the change. 
D.  All underground utilities, water lines, sanitary sewers, and storm drains installed in streets by the subdivider shall be constructed prior to the surfacing of the streets. Stubs for service connections for underground utilities, water lines, and sanitary sewers shall be placed to a length eliminating the necessity for disturbing the street improvements when service connections are made. 
E.  As-built plans showing all public improvements as built shall be filed with the city manager or designee upon completion of the improvements.

SECTION 16.554 - INTERPRETATION APPLICATION 

16.554.010 - Purpose. 
A.  It is recognized that all possible uses are not listed in each zoning district, and it is anticipated that new uses will be created, and that some terms or phrases in this title may be ambiguous and subject to two or more reasonable meanings, and that the boundaries of zoning districts and the comprehensive plan map may not be clear. Because it is not possible to identify all existing and future uses, or remove all language ambiguities, or because a boundary may be unclear, a process is established to resolve the language and boundary ambiguities through a stand-alone application or concurrent with another application. An interpretation application provides a process for recognizing uses that are not listed, new uses and resolving language and boundary ambiguities. 
B.  The purposes of this section are to: 
1.  Provide a process to interpret the language of this title; 
2.  Provide a process to interpret the location of zoning district and comprehensive plan map boundaries; and 
3.  Allow an interpretation to be requested and decided as a stand-alone application or as part of a primary application using the process for the primary application. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011) 
16.554.020 - Process. 
    Interpretation applications may be reviewed in accordance with the: 
A.  Type I-B procedures in Section 16.506 when the interpretation is not part of another application; or 
B.  Type I-C, I-D, II-A, II-B, II-C, III, or IV procedures in Sections 16.508-16.520, respectively, when the interpretation is part of another application. 
C.  Notwithstanding subsections A. and B. the decision authority may decline to issue an interpretation decision. The decision authority's decision to not issue an interpretation decision is not subject to a local appeal. 
D.  Notwithstanding the type I-B procedures in Section 16.506 for an application that is not part of another application, the decision authority may decline to issue an interpretation decision and instead forward the application to the planning commission for a decision using the type II-A procedure. The decision to forward the application to the planning commission is final and is not subject to any local appeal. 
E.  Notwithstanding the type I, II, III or IV procedures, the interpretation decision shall not expire unless superseded by a subsequent interpretation by the same or higher authority, or by an amendment to the language in this title, or to the zoning map, or to the comprehensive plan map. The city council's authority is superior to the planning commission's authority, and the planning commission's authority is superior to the city manager's authority. 
F.  For an interpretation by the city manager or planning commission, the interpretation decision applies only to the specific facts of the application under review, does not set a precedent, and shall not be applied citywide. 
G.  For an interpretation by the city council, the interpretation decision applies citywide and an amendment to the interpreted document should be initiated as soon as is practicable by city staff. 
(Ord. No. 2011-06, § 2, 12-19-2011)
