contained herein:
(1) Cable communications services should be available to all Borough
residents.

to the Borough of compensation at rates different from those set forth for
franchise fees. The franchisee shall pay to the Borough an amount equal
to the reasonable costs for the use of the Borough's streets to provide
noncable services in the franchise area. Payment of such costs and expenses
shall not be deemed to be franchise fees within the meaning of the Cable
Act, and such payments shall not be deemed to be:

or hereafter held by the Borough which shall entitle the Borough and the
grantee to the use thereof for the purpose of installing and maintaining the
grantee cable television system. No reference herein, or in any franchise, to
the public way shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the
Borough that its title to any property is sufficient to permit its use for such

only such rights to use property in the Borough as the Borough may have
the undisputed right and power to give.

ARTICLE III
Grant of Franchise
§ 259-5. Grant and continuing obligations.
A. In the event that the Borough shall grant to a grantee a nonexclusive
revocable franchise to construct, operate, and maintain a cable
communications system within the Borough, said franchise shall
constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a
cable communications system as regulated by the provisions of this
chapter and a franchise agreement.
B. The franchise shall be granted under the terms and conditions
contained herein, consistent with the Municipal Borough Code and/or
other applicable statutory requirements.
C. Any franchise granted by the Borough is hereby made subject to the
general ordinances provisions now in effect and hereafter made
effective. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the
requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the Borough
regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
D. State of the art continuing obligation.
(1) General requirement. Throughout the term of any franchise
agreement, the franchisee shall construct, operate, maintain and
upgrade the cable communications system in order to ensure that it
continuously conforms to the state of the art in accordance with the
requirements set forth herein below. In addition, the franchisee,
either on its own initiative or at the reasonable request of the
Borough, shall participate in or undertake experiments, test, and
other activities to enhance and advance the state of the art of cable
communications systems technology.
(2) State-of-the-art report. A franchisee shall provide to the Borough,
in a form satisfactory to the Borough, at the Borough's request, but
no more often than once every year, a report setting forth the
franchisee's review and assessment of the current state of the art
of cable communications systems and its plans, if any, for
upgrading the system to conform to the state of the art. The report
shall address, at a minimum: technological advances making
possible enhanced signal quality, publicly available equipment for
the receipt of services or greater channel capacity and interactive
systems; a list of each jurisdiction in which new technologies have
been or are being used and a description of the experience those
jurisdictions have had with such new technologies; and assessment
of the costs associated with implementing such new technologies
into the system; the franchisee's activities to enhance or advance
such technology in connection with the system and any other cable
communications system or systems operated by the franchisee or
any affiliated person in the Borough or elsewhere and the
§ 259-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 259-5
1:81
franchisee's compliance with and any modifications with respect
thereto; and assessment of the need to scramble Signals
distributed over the system in order to prevent theft of service
(such assessment to investigate alternatives to scrambling of
signals and include a cost/benefit analysis of both scrambling and
such alternatives that takes into account significant costs and
benefits both to the franchisee and subscribers); a discussion of
additional technological advances anticipated during the
remainder of the term of the franchise, along with a projection of
the costs and timetable for the franchisee offering such advances
as part of or over the system; a discussion of what improvements
the franchisee anticipates making in its customer service facilities,
equipment, systems and operations during the remainder of the
term of the franchise, along with a projection of the costs and
timetable for the implementation of such improvements; a
description of any technical experimentation which the franchisee
or any affiliated person anticipates undertaking during the
remainder of the term of the franchise; an assessment of the
compatibility of the system with subscribers' televisions and video
cassette recorders, the franchisee's compliance with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the FCC pursuant to Section 624A
of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 544a) and any experimentation the
franchisee is making to enhance such compatibility; and, generally,
the steps the franchisee or any affiliated person is undertaking to
continuously construct, operate, maintain and upgrade the system
in accordance with the state of the art. The state-of-the-art report
submitted by a franchisee may be only one resource that the
Borough will consider in evaluating the franchisee's obligation
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this chapter to
continuously construct, operate, maintain and upgrade the system
in accordance with the state of the art, and the Borough may
commission third parties, as necessary, to ascertain the current
state of the art in cable communications systems generally.
(3) Procedures for maintaining state of the art. Upon receiving the
report from a franchisee required pursuant to this section of this
chapter, the Borough will evaluate such report and assemble any
additional data necessary to ascertain whether the franchisee's
system or any aspect thereof needs to be upgraded so that it meets
the state-of-the-art requirement set forth herein.
(4) Directive. Upon completing the evaluation contemplated by this
section of this chapter, and after providing notice to a franchisee
and an opportunity for the franchisee to comment, the Borough
may issue a reasonable directive to the franchisee to upgrade the
system so as to incorporate state-of-the-art features. Within 45 days
after receipt of such directive, such franchisee shall submit plans,
as specified by the Borough, describing how it intends to complete
such Upgrade. Upon approval of such plans by the Borough, the
§ 259-5 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 259-5
1:82
§ 259-6. Use of public rights-of-way.
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications
system in the Borough, a grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,
reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along the public
streets and ways within the Borough such wires, cable, conductors, ducts,
conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances, pedestals, attachments
and other property and equipment as are necessary to the operation of the
cable communications systems; provided, however, that grantee complies
with all design, construction, safety, and performance provisions contained
in this chapter, the franchise agreement, and other applicable laws,
including but not limited to the Federal Technical Performance Standards,
National Electrical Safety Code (current edition) and the power company
and telephone company pole contract standards.
§ 259-7. Use of grantee facilities.
No poles shall be erected by a grantee without prior approval of the
Borough with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent
aspect. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested
right and such poles shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its
own expense whenever the Borough determines that the public convenience
would be enhanced thereby. Grantee shall utilize existing poles and
conduits, where possible. The Borough shall have the right, during the
life of the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles
franchisee shall commence and diligently pursue implementation
of the required upgrade.
(5) "State-of-the-art" or "state of the art," as applicable, means that
level of technical or service performance, capacity and capability
(including, but not limited to, plant or other equipment, access
channel and other production equipment or facilities, construction
techniques, customer service, facilities, equipment systems and
operations, and performance standards) which has been developed
and demonstrated in the cable industry, or any other comparable
industry that provides services to the public under similar
conditions, to be workable and economically and technically
feasible and viable from time to time throughout the term of the
franchise.
(6) "Economically and technically feasible and viable" means capable
of being provided:
(a) Through technology which has been demonstrated in actual
applications (not simply through tests or experiments) to
operate in a workable manner; and
(b) In a manner which has a reasonable likelihood of generating
additional revenues or other financial benefits for a system,
when measured over the term of the franchise.
§ 259-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 259-7
1:83
owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably
interfere with the operations of the grantee.
§ 259-8. Franchise required.
No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the
streets of the Borough or be allowed to operate without a franchise.
§ 259-9. Term of franchise.
The term of any franchise as granted pursuant to this chapter shall be
specified in the franchise agreement in the discretion of the Borough.
§ 259-10. Franchise nonexclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The
Borough specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional
franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate, and/
or build, operate and own such cable communications system or systems as
it deems appropriate.
§ 259-11. Transfer of ownership or control.
A. Transfer of franchise. No franchise granted hereunder shall be
transferred and no control or controlling interest in any system,
franchise, or franchisee shall be transferred without the prior written
consent of the Borough, and then only under such reasonable
conditions as the Borough may establish, and only if in compliance with
Section 617 of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 537) and regulations
promulgated by the FCC to implement Section 617.
B. The franchisee shall promptly notify the Borough by written petition of
any proposed transfer. The petition shall fully describe the proposed
action and shall be accompanied by a justification for the action and, if
applicable, an argument as to why such action would not involve a
change in control or controlling interest. The Borough shall notify the
franchisee as soon as all of the information required by the FCC, the
franchise agreement, this chapter and all applicable state and local law
has been received by the Borough and that therefore the petition is
complete, after which the Borough shall take action within 120 days
following the date such notice is provided by the Borough, pursuant to
Section 617(e) of the Cable Act.
C. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer,
the Borough may inquire, with the assistance of the grantee, into the
legal, financial, character, technical, customer service, and operations
qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the effect that
the proposed transfer and sale price may have on rates being paid by
subscribers. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by
the Borough as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the
proposed transfer. If the Borough finds the results of this inquiry are
§ 259-7 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 259-11
1:84
satisfactory, its consent to such transfer shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
D. Assumption of control. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to
notify the Borough that it or its designees satisfactory to the Borough
will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
insure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations
during the term the financial institution exercises control over the
system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the
system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the Borough
at its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the Borough
finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character,
technical, customer service, and operations qualifications of the
applicant are satisfactory and that the proposed transfer and sale price
will not result in a rate increase to subscribers, the Borough will
transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the
public interest. The consent of the Borough to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
E. The consent or approval of the Borough to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Borough in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
F. The Borough reserves the right to review the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of the cable television system. Any negotiated
sale value which the Borough deems unreasonable will not be
considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate
increases, if permitted by applicable law and § 259-16 of this chapter.
G. Any approval by the Borough of transfer of ownership or control shall
be contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a
signatory to the franchise agreement.
H. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection D above, the Borough
reserves the right of first purchase in any transfer of the system. Should
the Borough exercise this option, it shall do so within 30 days of
notification and thereafter shall make payment therefor under the same
terms and conditions as the proposed Transferee, or as the parties
might otherwise agree.
I. The transfer of any franchise or the transfer of control or controlling
interest in any system, franchise or franchisee without the prior written
consent of the Borough shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
system by the franchisee under § 259-33 of this chapter and shall entitle
the Borough to all of the rights set forth under § 259-33C.
§ 259-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 259-12
1:85
§ 259-12. Franchise fees.
§ 259-13. Revocation and acceleration of expiration date.
A. Because the Borough finds that: the streets of the county, state, and
Borough to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within
the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the county, state, and Borough at great
expense to its taxpayers; and the grant to the grantee to the said streets
is a valuable property right without which the grantee would be
required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and
acquisitions; and the administration of this chapter and the franchise
imposes upon the Borough additional regulatory responsibility and
expense; and the presence of the grantee and its facilities places
additional burdens upon the Borough police and road departments and
the volunteer fire company serving the area which is supported by the
Borough; A grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the Borough
a franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise agreement
up to the maximum amount permitted under applicable federal, state,
or local law. The present maximum franchise fee allowable is 5% of
gross annual revenues.
B. In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is
not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement,
grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the
commercial prime interest rate of the Borough primary depository bank
during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
C. The franchise fee shall be payable as specified in the franchise
agreement and shall be furnished at the time of each payment with a
statement certified by the grantee's Chief Financial Officer reflecting
the total amounts of gross revenues for the period conveyed by the
payment.
D. The Borough shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts
determined to be payable under this chapter for a period of five years
from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of the Borough
unless the audit discloses an underpayment in any one year of 5% or
more, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the grantee.
Any additional amount due the Borough as a result of the audit shall be
paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the
Borough, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report, unless
written notice of disagreement is filed by the grantee with the Borough
within such time.
A. Grounds for revocation or acceleration of expiration date. The Borough
reserves the right to accelerate the expiration of the franchise term
and/or revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights
and privileges associated with the franchise in the following
§ 259-12 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 259-13
1:86
circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach
under this chapter and the franchise agreement:

material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and
between the Borough and the grantee.
(2) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or any
performance bond or security fund as required.

schedule contained in the franchise agreement or beyond any
extended date set by the Borough.
(7) If there is an occurrence of any event which may reasonably lead to
the foreclosure or other similar judicial or nonjudicial sale of all or
any material part of the system, including, but not limited to, any of
the following events:
(a) Default under any loan or any financing arrangement material
to the system or the obligations of the grantee under the
franchise agreement;
(b) Default under any contract material to the system or the
obligations of the grantee under the franchise agreement; or
(c) Termination of any lease or mortgage covering all or any
material part of the system.
(8) If in regards to any grantee:
(a) A grantee shall suspend or discontinue its business, shall make
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall fail to pay its
debts generally as they become due, shall become insolvent
(however such an insolvency may be evidenced), shall be
adjudicated insolvent, shall petition or apply to any tribunal
for, or consent to, the appointment of, or taking possession by,
a receiver, custodian, liquidator or trustee or similar official
pursuant to state or local laws, ordinances or regulations of or
for it or any substantial part of its property, or assets, including
all or any part of this system; or
§ 259-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 259-13
1:87
(b) A writ or warrant of attachment, execution, distraint, levy,
possession or any similar process shall be issued by any
tribunal against all or any material part of a grantee's property
or assets; or
(c) Any creditor of a grantee petitions or applies to any tribunal for
the appointment of, or taking possession by, a trustee, receiver,
custodian, liquidator, or similar official for the grantee or of
any substantial parts of the assets of the grantee under the law
of any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect, and an
order, judgment or decree is entered appointing any such
trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator, or similar official, or
approving the petition in any such proceedings; or
(d) Any order, judgment or decree is entered in any proceedings
against a grantee decreeing the voluntary or involuntary
dissolution of the grantee.
(9) If there is a failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
total system outage in 40% or more of the system, except when
approval of such interruption is obtained from the Borough or is
excused pursuant to Subsection B.
(10) If the grantee transfers the franchise or transfers control or a
controlling interest in any system, franchise or in the grantee itself
without the prior written consent of the Borough pursuant to the
provisions set forth in § 259-11.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, a grantee
shall not be liable for delay in performance of, or failure to perform in
whole or in part its obligations pursuant to the franchise agreement or
this chapter, due to strike, war or act of war, (whether an actual
declaration of war is made or not), insurrection, riot, act of public
enemy, accident, fire, flood or other act of God, sabotage or other
events, where a grantee has exercised all due care in the prevention
thereof and to the extent that such causes or other events are beyond
the control of the grantee and such causes or other events are without
the fault or negligence of the grantee. In the event that any such delay
in performance or failure to perform affects only part of a company's
capacity to perform, the company shall perform to the maximum extent
that it is able to do so and shall take all steps within its power to correct
such cause or causes. In correcting such cause or causes, a grantee
shall take all reasonable steps to do so in as expeditious a manner as
possible. A grantee shall notify the Borough in writing of the occurrence
of an event covered by this subsection within five business days of the
date upon which the grantee learns of its occurrence. Shortage or
unavailability of equipment from suppliers shall not be deemed to be
beyond the control of the grantee in regards to any construction delays.
§ 259-13 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 259-13
1:88
C. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the
performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise
agreement. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because
of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation
pursuant to the provisions of this section. The Borough shall comply
with any related court orders.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The Borough shall make written demand that the grantee do so
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule
or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.
After written demand is made, the Borough may place its request
for revocation of the franchise upon a regular Council meeting
agenda. The Borough shall cause to be served upon such grantee at
least seven days prior to the date of such Council meeting, a
written notice of this intent to request such revocation, and the
time and place of the meeting, notice of which shall be published by
the Borough once, at least seven days before such meeting, in a
newspaper of general circulation within the Borough.
(2) The Council shall hear any persons interested therein, and shall
determine in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal or
neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as determined by the Council, the Council shall direct the
grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such
terms and conditions as are reasonable.
(4) If the Council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the
grantee was without just cause, then the Council may, by
resolution, declare that the franchise of the grantee shall be
revoked and the performance bond forfeited.
E. Disposition of facilities. In the event a franchise expires, is revoked or
otherwise terminated, the Borough may in its sole discretion, do any of
the following:
(1) Order the removal of the system facilities from the Borough within
a reasonable period of time as determined by the Borough.
(2) Require the grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period
of up to 18 months or such further time as may be mutually agreed
upon. During any time the grantee continues to operate the system
it shall do so pursuant to the terms of this chapter and its franchise
agreement and shall be entitled to the revenues from the system.
(3) Order that the system be transferred to another cable operator.
§ 259-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 259-13
1:89
§ 259-14. Receivership and foreclosure.
F. Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as
good a condition or better as that prevailing prior to the grantee's
removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical
or telephone cable wires or attachments. The Borough shall inspect and
approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables,
wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity,
insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall continue in
full force and effect during the period of removal and until full
compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
subsection, this chapter and the franchise agreement.
G. Restoration by Borough; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by Subsection E
or F of this section, or any other work required by Borough law or
ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction
of the Borough, the Borough may cause such work to be done and the
grantee shall reimburse the Borough the cost thereof within 30 days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the Borough may
recover such costs through the performance bond or letter of credit
provided by grantee. The Borough shall be permitted to seek legal and
equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
A. Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the Borough, cease and terminate 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee to take over and
conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or similar action or proceeding unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days, or unless:
(1) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, full complied with all the terms and

health, life and property by reason thereof; relating to water supply and
distribution, sewage and sewage disposal and drains (including storm
drains and similar and related items); providing for administrative,
procedural, organizational, and enforcement matters; and providing for
the issuance of permits and collection of fees therefor, the Borough
adopts the 1997 Edition of the International Plumbing Code, published
by the International Code Council, Inc., the Building Officials and Code
Administrators International, Inc., the International Conference of
Building Officials, and the Southern Building Code Congress
International, Inc. Copies of that code have been placed on file with the
Borough Secretary, and will remain on file with her. That entire
plumbing code, as affected by the deletion, amendment or modification
of certain portions of that code in the following sections of this article,
is adopted, and is incorporated herein as fully as if set out verbatim in
this article and, from the date on which this article takes effect, the

modifications are kept on file in the office of the Borough Secretary,
preferably with notations of those changes made by the Plumbing
Official of the Borough in the proper and pertinent places in the file
copies of the published plumbing code referred to in Subsection A of
this section. When any complete new edition of the published code
becomes available to the Borough in place of the 1997 or later edition,
that newer edition may be adopted by the Borough in place of the
edition then current, either by a new ordinance or by an amendment of
this article, serving to adopt the new edition and to make necessary or
desired changes in material contained in § 472-10.

A. The code is amended and modified in the following respects:
(1) Wherever the words "name of jurisdiction" appear in brackets in
the code, the words "Borough of Collegeville" shall be inserted in

to the person designated elsewhere in this article as the Plumbing
Official, or an authorized representative of the Plumbing Official
acting for him/her under this Plumbing Code. Provided, at the

or word of this code, or of the ordinance adopting this code, is
declared to be unconstitutional, illegal or invalid, that decision
shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of
the code or of the ordinance adopting the code. It is declared as a
legislative intent that the said code and ordinance would have been
adopted had such unconstitutional, illegal or invalid provision not
been included therein."

of other laws, State regulations and ordinances of this Borough
which prescribe more restrictive or stricter requirements or
limitations on any subject covered in this code. When any provision
specified in the code pertaining to health, safety and/or welfare
is more restrictive than any such other provisions, this code shall

inspections, every person to whom a permit is issued under this
code, or his agents, shall notify the Plumbing Official that work

code, or in violation of a detailed statement or the approved
construction documents thereunder, or in violation of a permit or
certificate issued under this code. The notice of a violation or order
shall direct the discontinuance of the illegal action or condition and

for the initiation and correction or the remedial action required,
except where emergency conditions exist which require immediate
corrective action."

appropriate proceeding by law or in equity to restrain, correct or
abate the violation, or to require the removal or termination of the
unlawful occupancy of the structure in violation of this code or of
the order or direction made pursuant thereto."

a permit or certificate issued under the provisions of this code,
shall be guilty of an offense; and, for every such offense, shall,
upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less than $50
or more than $1,000 and costs of prosecution; and, in default of
payment of fine and costs, to undergo imprisonment for not more
than 30 days. Provided: The imposition of one penalty for any such
violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue;
and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy every
such violation or defect within a reasonable time; and, when not
otherwise specified, each 10 days that such prohibited conditions
are maintained shall constitute a separate offense."

"108.5 Stop-work orders: Upon notice from the Plumbing
Official, work on any plumbing system that is being done contrary
to the provisions of this code, or is being done in a dangerous
or unsafe manner, shall immediately cease. That notice shall be
§ 472-10 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 472-10
1:192
in writing and shall be given to the owner of the property, or to
the owner's agent, or to the person doing the work. The notice

resumed. Where an emergency exists, the Plumbing Official shall
not be required to give a written notice prior to stopping the work.
Any person who continues any work in or about a structure after
having been served with a stop-work order, except such work as
that person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe
condition, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200 or more
than $1,000, and costs, and, in default of payment of fine and costs,
to undergo imprisonment for not more than 30 days."

Sections 109.1 through 109.7, are deleted, and the following new
Section 109 is substituted for that deleted material.
"SECTION 109
MEANS OF APPEAL
109.1 Right of appeal: Any person shall have the right to
appeal a decision of the Plumbing Official to the Board of
Plumbing Appeals. An application for appeal shall be based on a
claim that the true intent of this code or of any rule legally
adopted thereunder has been incorrectly interpreted, the
provisions of the code do not apply, or an equally good or better
form of construction is proposed.
109.2 Board of Appeals:
1. There is hereby created a Board of Plumbing Appeals
consisting of three members of Council. One member shall be
appointed for one year; one member shall be appointed for
two years; and one member shall be appointed for three years.
Annually thereafter in the month of January, a member of the
Board of Plumbing Appeals shall be appointed for a term of
three years, which term shall commence on the first day of
January and terminate on the 31st day of December, three
years thereafter. An appointment to fill a vacancy shall be for
the unexpired portion of the term only. Provided: Since the
purpose of the above-stated appointments shall be to establish
overlapping rather than coinciding terms of office, if the said
board has already been established when this ordinance takes
effect, the individuals now in office shall be entitled to
complete their present terms just as if the ordinance had not
been enacted, with appointments to fill vacancies to be made
for the unexpired portion of the term for which their
appointment had been made.

Code of Ordinances)]
§ 495-1. Adoption of property maintenance code.
§ 495-2. Modifications made in BOCA National Property
Maintenance Code.
A. BOCA National Property Maintenance Code. For the purpose of
establishing minimum regulations governing the conditions and
maintenance of property, buildings and structures in the Borough of
Collegeville, by providing standards for supplied utilities and facilities
and other physical things and conditions essential to insure that
structures are safe, sanitary and fit for occupation and use; and for the
condemnation of buildings and structures unfit for human occupancy
and the demolition of such structures, the Borough adopts as its
property maintenance code, the BOCA National Property Maintenance
Code/1996, Fifth Edition, as published by the Building Officials and
Code Administrators International, Inc. That entire property
maintenance code, as affected by the deletion, amendment or
modification of certain portions in the following sections of this article,
is adopted, and is incorporated in the Borough's Code of Ordinances as
fully as if set out verbatim in this article. From the date on which this
article takes effect, the provisions of that property maintenance code,
as affected by this article, shall be in effect within the limits of the
Borough of Collegeville. In this article, the BOCA National Property
Maintenance Code may be referred to as "the code" or "this code."
B. Amendments and changes in the published property maintenance code.
All amendments, changes, additions and deletions in the published
1996 Fifth Edition of the property maintenance code referred to in
Subsection A of this section, as made by the publisher of the code and
transmitted to the Borough, prior to publication of a new code that is to
supplant this code, shall be considered as part of this article and

the code, the words "Borough of Collegeville" shall be in place of
those bracketed words. Likewise, the words "Borough of
Collegeville" shall be substituted for the word "jurisdiction"
§ 495-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 495-2
1:199
whenever that word appears singly in the code without being
preceded by the words "under the."
(2) The term "Code Official," as used in the code, shall mean not only
the individual known and referred to as the "Code Official," but the
same individual when referred to as "Building Official," "Building
Inspector," or "Building Permit Officer," or an authorized
representative of an individual known and referred to by any of
those titles.
(3) The terms "appointing authority," "chief appointing authority,"
"governing body," "Chief Administrative Officer," or "legislative
authority of the jurisdiction," as used in the code, shall mean
Borough Council.
(4) The terms, "legal counsel of the jurisdiction," "the jurisdiction's
legal representative," and "the legal representative of the
jurisdiction" shall mean the Borough Solicitor.
(5) Section PM-101.1 of the code is amended to read as follows:
"PM-101.1 Title: These regulations shall be known as the
"Property Maintenance Code of the Borough of Collegeville,"
hereinafter referred to as "the code" or "this code."

"PM-102.2 Saving clause: Nothing in this code or in the
ordinance adopting it by reference shall be construed to affect any
suit or proceeding pending in any court at the time of enacting that
ordinance, or any rights acquired, liability incurred, or any cause or
causes of action accrued or existing, under any ordinance repealed
by that ordinance. No right or remedy of any character shall be
lost, impaired or affected by that Code or ordinance."
(7) The following new section is inserted directly after Section 102.2 of
the code:
"PM-102.3 Validity of other laws, regulations and
ordinances: Nothing in this code shall be construed to prevent the
enforcement of other laws, state regulations and ordinances of this
Borough which prescribe more restrictive or stricter requirements
or limitations. When the provisions specified in this code for health,
safety and welfare are more restrictive than other provisions, this
code shall control, but in any case, the most rigid requirements of
either this code or other laws, regulations or ordinances shall apply
whenever they may be in conflict."

code which violation, if corrected, would not substantially serve to
further the purpose of this code in protecting the public health,
safety and welfare, and where the elimination of that violation
would constitute a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship, the
code official shall recommend to the appeal board that a variance
be granted. In considering such recommendations, the appeal
board shall give consideration to the special physical
characteristics of existing older dwellings in the Borough which
would require extensive structural alterations to conform to the
strict provisions or applications of this code."

premises, and the issuance and enforcement of notices and orders

department or officer of Borough government, the code official
shall make reasonable effort to arrange for the coordination of such
inspections so as to minimize the number of visits by inspectors,

department or officer shall not, however, delay the issuance of any
emergency orders which it determines must be issued."

approved thereunder, or any certificate or permit issued
thereunder, and from which no appeal has been taken, or who
fails to comply with such an order as affirmed or modified by the
appeal board or by a court of competent jurisdiction, within the
time fixed herein, shall severally, for each and every such violation
and noncompliance, respectively, be sentenced to pay a fine of not
less than $200 or more than $1,000, and costs of prosecution, and,
in default of payment of fine and costs, to undergo imprisonment
for not more than 30 days. The imposition of one penalty for any
violation shall not excuse the violation or permit it to continue,
and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such
violations or defects within a reasonable time; and when not
otherwise specified, each 10 days that prohibited conditions are
maintained shall constitute a separate offense."
(14) Section PM-108.1 of the code is amended to read as follows:

a remedy of the situation, as provided in Section PM-101.5 of this
code, that structure or part thereof may be condemned pursuant

affecting the POTW's operation or for violating any pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority may at any time, on its own initiative or in
response to a petition received from a user, and in accordance with
procedures in 40 CFR 403.8(f)(6), determine that such user should
not be considered a significant industrial user.
(4)
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for
the same parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by
any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits as defined in § 550-10;
(1)
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds
the product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,

A. General discharge prohibitions and standards. No user shall contribute,
introduce or cause to be contributed or introduced, directly or
indirectly, into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes
pass-through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all
users of the POTW whether or not the user is subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. Specific prohibitions.
(1) No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW
the following pollutants, substances or wastewater:
(a) Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup
flash point of less than 140° F. (60° C.) using the test methods
specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
(b) Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 10.0 or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or
equipment.
(c) Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference
(but in no case solids greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension).
The following substances are also prohibited: ashes, cinders,
sand, mud, straw, metal, glass, bones, rags, feather, tar, plastic,
wood, paunch manure, whole blood or blood products, lye,
building materials, rubber, hair, shavings, leather, china,
ceramic wastes, asphalt, paint, waxes, butcher offal, porcelain,
and bentonite.
(d) Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW.
(e) Wastewater having a temperature greater than 104° F. (40°
C.), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment
plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater
which causes the temperature at the introduction into the
treatment plant to exceed 104° F. (40° C.).
(f) Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or
pass-through.
(g) Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors,
or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute
worker health and safety problems.
(h) Trucked or hauled pollutants or wastewater.
§ 550-10 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-10
1:238
(i) Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other
wastes, are sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to
life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or
repair.
(j) Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by
the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts
color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating the
Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority's NPDES
permit.
(k) Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes.
(l) Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water,
roof runoff, subsurface drainage, swimming pool drainage,
condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and
unpolluted wastewater.
(m) Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment
of industrial wastes.
(n) Medical wastes.
(o) Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, the treatment plant's effluent to fail toxicity test.
(p) Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which
may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.
(q) Wastewater causing an explosive hazard at the point of
discharge or at any point in the sewer interceptor system or
the POTW.
(r) Any substance or condition which will cause the POTW to
violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit, the
receiving water quality standards, or any statute, rule, or
regulation of any public agency.
(s) In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain
concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed any time
period longer than 15 minutes or contain more than five times
the average twenty-four-hour concentration of flow during
normal operation, or otherwise constitutes a slug discharge.
(t) The discharge of toxic or hazardous wastes, as defined in the
Act or RCRA.
(u) Total solids of such character or quantity as to require unusual
attention or expense in treatment.
(v) Discharges prohibited by state or federal regulations.
§ 550-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-10
1:239
(w) Fats, oils, or greases of an animal or vegetable origin in
concentrations greater than 100 mg/l.
(2) When the control authority determines that a user(s) is
contributing to the POTW any of the above enumerated substances
in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the POTW, the
control authority shall:
(a) Advise the user(s) of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW;
(b) Develop effluent limitation(s) for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW; and
(c) Proceed with enforcement pursuant to the provisions of this
article.
(3) Pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this section
shall not be processed or stored in a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW.
C. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The categorical
pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N,
Parts 405 through 471 are hereby incorporated in this article by
reference as though set forth in full.
(1) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the control authority may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
(2) When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
control authority shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
(3) A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment
standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered
by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
(4) A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard
in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15.
D. Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. Where the
Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority's wastewater
treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by
national pretreatment standards, the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority as control authority may apply to the approval
authority for modification of specific limits in the national pretreatment
standards. "Consistent Removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of
a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
§ 550-10 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-10
1:240
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which
is achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured
according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(b)(2) of 40 CFR
403, General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources
of Pollution, promulgated pursuant to the Act. The Lower Perkiomen
Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control authority may then modify
pollutant discharge limits in the national pretreatment standards if the
requirements contained in 40 CFR 403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and
prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
E. State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those in this article.
F. Right of revision. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority as control authority reserves the right to establish by
resolution more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to
the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the
objectives presented in § 550-9A of this article.
G. Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any
way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation
unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The control authority may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
H. Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or
user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to
the control authority for review, and shall be approved by the control
authority before construction of the facility. All existing users shall
complete such a plan by January 1, 1994. No user shall be permitted to
introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the control authority. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an
accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
notify the control authority of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.
(1) Written notice. Within five days followings an accidental discharge;
the user shall submit to the control authority a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to
§ 550-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-10
1:241
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage,
or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor
shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other
applicable law.
(2) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers
shall insure that all employees who may cause or suffer such an
accidental discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedures.
I. Local limits.
(1) The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control
authority is authorized to establish local limits pursuant to 40 CFR
403.5(c).
(2) The following pollutant limits are established to protect against
pass-through, interference, and sludge contamination. No person
shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following
limits:
Parameter
Daily Maximum
(mg/l)
Arsenic 0.425
Cadmium 0.05
Chromium 3.5
Copper 1.0
Cyanide 1.0
Lead 1.0
Mercury 0.002
Nickel 1.1
Oil and grease and fats of animal
or vegetable origin
100
Oil and grease of petroleum
origin, nonbiodegradable cutting
oil, mineral oil

Silver 0.35
Zinc 3.0
§ 550-10 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-10
1:242
§ 550-11. Pretreatment of wastewater.
(3) The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the sewer. All concentrations from metallic
substances are for total metal unless otherwise indicated. The
above local limits are based on maximum allowable headworks
loadings (MAHL) as approved by EPA. The Lower Perkiomen Valley
Regional Sewer Authority as control authority, through the
issuance of an industrial waste discharge permit, may establish
other effluent limits consistent with the approved MAHL. No such
permits, however, shall waive or abrogate federal or state
categorical pretreatment standards or regulations. Categorical
concentrations apply at the end of the process waste stream. No
person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of
allowable discharge limits as established by the Lower Perkiomen
Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control authority. The Lower
Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control authority,
may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the
concentration based limitations.
(4) The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control
authority, may develop best management practices (BMPs), by
resolution or in wastewater discharge permits, to implement local
limits and the requirements of this section.
A. Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with
all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the
prohibitions set out in § 550-10 of this article within the time limitations
specified by EPA, the state, or the control authority, whichever is more
stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided,
operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the control authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the
control authority before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to the control authority under the
provisions of this article.
B. Additional pretreatment measures.
(1) Whenever deemed necessary, the control authority may require
users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate
sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this
article.
§ 550-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-11
1:243
§ 550-12. Wastewater discharge permit application.
(2) The control authority may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their
expense, a suitable storage and flow control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued
solely for flow equalization.
(3) Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided by the user
when, in the opinion of the control authority, they are necessary for
the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for residential users. All interception units shall be of type
and capacity approved by the control authority and shall be so
located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such
interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as
needed, by the user at their expense.
(4) Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas
detection meter.
C. Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The control
authority shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs
an accidental discharge/slug control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The control authority may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the
control authority may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the control authority of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by this article; and
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants,
including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
D. Hauled wastewater. The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority does not accept septic tank waste or industrial waste from
haulers or RCRA hazardous wastes.
§ 550-11 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-12
1:244
A. Wastewater dischargers. It shall be unlawful to discharge to the POTW
or in any area under the jurisdiction of the control authority, and/or to
the POTW, any wastewater except as authorized by the control
authority in accordance with the provisions of this article, subject to
state and federal laws and regulations.
B. Wastewater analysis. When requested by the control authority, a user
must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its
wastewater within 30 days of the request. The control authority is
authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically
require users to update this information.
C. Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
(1) No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from
the control authority. A permitted user may discharge for the time
period specified in the permit.
(2) The control authority may require other users to obtain wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this
article.
(3) Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the
wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this
article. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a
permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state
pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other
requirements of federal, state, and local law.
D. Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging
wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this article and
who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall within 30
days after said date, apply to the control authority for a wastewater
discharge permit in accordance with this article. Said user shall not
cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 30 days of the
effective date of this article except in accordance with a wastewater
discharge permit issued by the control authority.
E. Wastewater discharge permitting; new connections. Any user required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or
recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit from
the control authority prior to the beginning or recommencing of such
discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge permit, in
accordance with this article, must be filed at least 90 days prior to the
date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
F. Wastewater discharge permit application contents.

§ 550-14. Reporting requirements.
contributing municipality's ordinance or impose and enforce
pretreatment standards.
A. Baseline monitoring reports.
(1) Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is
later, existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to
or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the control
authority a report which contains the information listed in
Subsection A(2) below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of
their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard, shall submit to the control authority a report
which contains the information listed in Subsection A(2), below. A
new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to
use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also
shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.
(2) Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.

sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this subsection.
[3] Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow
use of the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR
403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment
standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit
has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e)
this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the control authority.
[4] Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with § 550-14J.
§ 550-13 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-14
1:254
[5] The control authority may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long
as the data provides information sufficient to determine
the need for industrial pretreatment measures.
[6] The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place
of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that
such sampling and analysis is representative of normal
work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
POTW.
(c) Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized
representative as defined in § 550-9C57 and certified to by a
qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment
standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the
shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the
compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment
standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must
meet the requirements set out in § 550-14B of this article.
(e) Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be signed and certified in accordance with § 550-14N(1)
of this article and signed by an authorized representative as
defined in § 550-9C.58
B. Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required by § 550-14A(2)(d) of this article:
(1) The schedule shall contain progress increments (milestones) in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable
pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited
to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and
completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine
operation);
(2) No increment referred to above shall exceed six months;
57.Editor's Note: See the definition of the term "authorized or duly representative of the
user" in said section.
58.Editor's Note: See the definition of the term "authorized or duly representative of the
user" in said section.
§ 550-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-14
1:255
(3) The user shall submit a progress report to the control authority no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final
date for compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay,
and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return the
construction to the established schedule; and
(4) In no event shall more than one month elapse between such
progress reports to the control authority.
C. Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the control authority a report containing
the information described in § 550-12F(1)(f) and (g) and
§ 550-14A(2)(b) of this article. For users subject to equivalent mass or
concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in
40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the
user's long term production rate. For all other users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during
the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with § 550-12G of this article.
D. Periodic compliance reports. All SIUs are required to submit periodic
compliance reports even if they have been designated a nonsignificant
categorical industrial user under the provisions of § 550-14D(3).
(1) Except as specified in § 550-14D(3), all significant industrial users
must, at a frequency determined by the control authority submit no
less than twice per year [June and December (or on dates
specified)] reports indicating the nature, concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the control
authority or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the
compliance status of the user.
(2) The control authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a
pollutant regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the
industrial user has demonstrated through sampling and other
technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected
to be present in the discharge, or is present only at background
levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
§ 550-14 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-14
1:256
due to activities of the industrial user [see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)].
This authorization is subject to the following conditions:
(a) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined
to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged
from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not
regulated by an applicable categorical standard and otherwise
includes no process wastewater.
(b) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit,
but in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a
new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted
for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit.
See § 550-12F(1)(g)[6].
(c) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of
the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment
present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater
from all processes.
(d) The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in
accordance with the definition of "authorized or duly
representative of the user" in § 550-9C, and include the
certification statement in § 550-14N(1) [40 CFR
403.6(a)(2)(ii)].
(e) Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a
demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPAapproved
method from 40 CFR 136 with the lowest minimum
detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis.
(f) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the control authority
must be included as a condition in the user's permit. The
reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted
by the user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by
the control authority for three years after expiration of the
waiver.
(g) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
user's permit by the control authority, the industrial user must
certify on each report with the statement in § 550-14N(3)
below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
waste stream due to activities of the industrial user.
(h) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the
user's operations, the user must immediately comply with the
monitoring requirements of § 550-14D(1), or other more
frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the control
authority, and notify the control authority.
§ 550-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-14
1:257
(i) This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment
standards, except as otherwise specified in the categorical
pretreatment standard.
(3) Eligibility for reduced reporting requirements.
(a) The control authority may reduce the requirement for periodic
compliance reports [see § 550-14D(1), (40 CFR 403.12(e)(1))]
to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard
or by the EPA, where the industrial user's total categorical
wastewater flow does not exceed any of the following:
[1] One thousand two hundred eleven gallons per day [0.01%
of the POTW's design dry-weather hydraulic capacity
(12.11 mgd) of the POTW], or 5,000 gallons per day,
whichever is smaller, as measured by a continuous effluent
flow monitoring device unless the industrial user
discharges in batches.
[2] One and twenty-five hundredths pounds per day [0.01% of
the design dry-weather organic treatment capacity
(12,500 pounds per day) of the POTW]; and
[3] The loading for any pollutant regulated by the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard for which approved
local limits were developed in accordance with § 550-10D
of this article shall be below 0.01% of the maximum
allowable headworks loading as set forth below:
Parameter
0.01% MAHL
(0.001 pounds per day)
Arsenic 0.140
Cadmium 0.040
Chromium 1.800
Copper 1.483
Cyanide 1.453
Lead 0.365
Mercury 0.032
Nickel 1.160
Silver 2.732
Zinc 2.400
(b) Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have
in the last two years been in significant noncompliance, as
§ 550-14 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-14
1:258
defined in § 550-17 of this article. In addition, reduced
reporting is not available to an industrial user with daily flow
rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the control authority,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user
would result in data that are not representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
(4) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 550-12G of this article.
(5) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities
shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good
working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for
the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its
discharge.
(6) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling
location more frequently than required by the control authority,
using the procedures prescribed in § 550-14J of this article, the
results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
E. Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the control
authority of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
(1) The control authority may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under § 550-12F of this article.
(2) The control authority may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under § 550-13G of this article or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under § 550-13D of this article in response to
changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(3) For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
F. Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature,
a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug discharge or slug load,
that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the
§ 550-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-14
1:259
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the control authority, submit a detailed written report to
the control authority describing the cause(s) of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other
damage to person or property nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this article.
(3) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the
event of a discharge described in Subsection F(1), above.
Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a
discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification
procedure.
(4) Significant industrial users are required to notify the control
authority immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
G. Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
control authority as the control authority may require.
H. Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
result of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if
the control authority monitors at the user's facility at least once a
month, or if the control authority samples between the user's initial
sample and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
I. Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sample
techniques, to be submitted as a part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for
the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part
136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by
using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling
and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
control authority or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 550-14 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-14
1:260
J. Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements
must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on
data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
(1) Except as indicated in Subsection J(2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the control authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136 and appropriate
EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twentyfour-
hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the control authority, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in § 550-14A and C [40
CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and
volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the control authority may authorize a
lower minimum. For the reports required by § 550-14D [40 CFR
403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure
compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
K. Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date
or receipt of the report shall govern.
L. Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities
required by this article, any additional records of information obtained
§ 550-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-14
1:261
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent
of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best
Management Practices established under § 550-10I. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the
name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall
remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning
the user or the control authority, or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the control authority.
M. Discharge of hazardous waste. The discharge of Hazardous Waste into
the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority system is strictly
prohibited.
N. Certification statements.
(1) Certification of permit applications, user reports and initial
monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is
required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit
applications in accordance with § 550-12G; users submitting
baseline monitoring reports under § 550-14A(2)(e); users
submitting reports on compliance with the categorical
Pretreatment Standard deadlines under § 550-14C; users
submitting periodic compliance reports required by § 550-14D(1)
through (4) and users submitting an initial request to forego
sampling of a pollutant on the basis of § 550-14D(2)(d). The
following certification statement must be signed by an authorized
representative as defined in § 550-9C:59
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision
in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the
best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I
am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations.
(2) Annual certification for nonsignificant categorical industrial users.
A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial
user by the control authority pursuant to Subsection (3) of the
definition of "significant industrial user" in § 550-9C and
§ 550-12G(3) must annually submit the following certification
59.Editor's Note: See the definition of the term "authorized or duly representative of the
user" in said section.

1:262
§ 550-15. Compliance monitoring.
statement signed in accordance with the signatory requirements in
the definition of "authorized or duly representative of the user" in
§ 550-9C. This certification must accompany an alternative report
required by the control authority:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the categorical pretreatment
standards under 40 CFR _____, I certify that, to the best of my
knowledge and belief that during the period from __________,
__________ to __________, __________ [months, days, year]:
(a) The facility described as __________ [facility name] met the
definition of a nonsignificant categorical industrial user as
described in 1.3(48)(c);
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting
period.
This compliance certification is based on the following
information.
(3) Certification of pollutants not present. Users that have an approved
monitoring waiver based on § 550-14D(2) must certify on each
report with the following statement that there has been no increase
in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of the user.
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with the pretreatment standard for 40
CFR __________ [specify applicable National Pretreatment
Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, there has been no increase in the level of __________ [list
pollutant(s)] in the wastewaters due to the activities at the facility
since filing of the last periodic report under § 550-14D(1).
A. Right of entry; inspection and sampling. The control authority or its
designated representative shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the control authority or its
designated representative ready access to all parts of the premises for
the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying,
and the performance of any additional duties. A user shall not obstruct,
block or otherwise interfere with access to the sampling point(s).
§ 550-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-15
1:263
§ 550-16. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, monitoring programs, and from the control
authority's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the control authority, that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
(1) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the control
authority or its designated representative shall be permitted to
enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
(2) The control authority or its designated representative shall have
the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of,
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering
of the user's operations.
(3) The control authority or its designated representative may require
the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its
own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and
quality shall be calibrated semiannually to ensure their accuracy.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction of safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the control
authority or its designated representative and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the
user.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the control authority or its
designated representative access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this article.
B. Search warrants. If the control authority or its designated
representative has been refused access to a building, structure, or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause
to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a
need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program of the control authority designed to verify
compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the control authority may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania.
§ 550-15 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-16
1:264
production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state
law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user
furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses
related to NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40
CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be
available to the public without restriction.
§ 550-17. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The control authority shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions
served by the POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the
previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall be applicable to all significant industrial users (or any
other industrial user that violates Subsections C, D, or H of this section) and
shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in § 550-10;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by § 550-10, multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for
all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by § 550-10 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the control authority determines has
caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or
pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or
the general public;
D. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the control
authority's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
§ 550-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-17
1:265
§ 550-18. Administrative enforcement remedies.
E. Failure to meet, within 30 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the control authority determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
A. Notification of violation. When the control authority finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may serve
upon that user a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific
required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the control authority.
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the control authority
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
B. Consent orders. The control authority may enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents
establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to be
taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force
and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to § 550-18D
and E of this article.
C. Show cause hearing. The control authority may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the control
authority and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed
§ 550-17 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-18
1:266
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return
receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice
may be served on any authorized representative of the user, as defined
in § 550-9C60 and required by § 550-12G(1). A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
D. Compliance orders. When the control authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may issue
an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any
violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
E. Cease-and-desist orders.
(1) When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past
violations are likely to recur, the control authority may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge.
(2) Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
F. Administrative civil penalties.
60.Editor's Note: See the definition of the term "authorized or duly representative of the
user" in said section.
§ 550-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-18
1:267
(1) When the control authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may
fine such a user in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per day for
each violation regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, penalties
shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. The
foregoing administrative civil penalties shall be enforced in
accordance with the provisions of §§ 550-19B and 550-20D of this
article.
(2) A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges,
fines and penalties.
(3) Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the control authority to reconsider the fine along with full payment
of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the control authority may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful,
the payment, together with any interest accruing there on, shall be
returned to the user. The control authority may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
(4) Issuance of an administrative fine shall not a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
G. Emergency suspensions.
(1) The control authority may immediately suspend a user's discharge
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The control
authority may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with
the operation of the POTW, or which represents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the control authority may take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
control authority may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the control authority that the period of endangerment has
§ 550-18 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-18
1:268
§ 550-19. Judicial enforcement remedies.
passed, unless the termination proceedings in § 550-18H of
this article are initiated against the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
occurrence, to the control authority prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under § 550-18C or H of
this article.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
H. Termination of discharge.
(1) In addition to the provisions in § 550-13F of this article, any user
who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to
discharge;
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 550-10 of this
article.
(2) Such user will be notified of proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 550-18C of
this article why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise
of this option by the control authority shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
I. Notification to contributing jurisdictions. The control authority shall
provide to the contributing municipality a true and correct copy of any
administrative enforcement remedy, judicial enforcement remedy, or
supplemental enforcement action initiated by the control authority with
reference to an industrial user within the municipality, pursuant to
§§ 550-18, 550-19 and 550-20 of this article. The failure to provide a
copy to the contributing municipality shall not be a defense to any third
party who is a subject of an administrative enforcement remedy, judicial
enforcement remedy, or supplemental enforcement action.
§ 550-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-19
1:269
A. Injunctive relief. When the control authority finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the control authority may
petition the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania for appropriate legal and equitable relief, including the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater
discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this article
on activities of the user. Relief requested may also include requirements
for environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a
user.
B. Civil penalties.
(1) A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the control authority for a maximum civil penalty
of $25,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other
long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each
day during the period of the violation. Each violation for each
separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense under
this section.
(2) The control authority may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the control authority.
(3) In determining the amount of civil liability, there shall be taken into
account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and
duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the
user's violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance
history of the user, and any other factor as justice requires.
(4) Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
C. Criminal prosecution. A user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, order issued
hereunder, any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or who
willfully or negligently introduces any substance into the POTW which
causes personal injury or property damage, or any user who knowingly
makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any
application, record, report, plan, or other document filed, or required to
be maintained pursuant to this article, a wastewater discharge permit
or order issued under this article or who falsifies, tampers with or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device of method
§ 550-19 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-19
1:270
§ 550-20. Supplemental enforcement action.
required under this article may be subject to criminal prosecution in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Crimes
Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
D. Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are
not exclusive. The control authority may take any, all, or any
combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement
of pretreatment violations will generally he/she in accordance with the
control authority's enforcement response plan. However, the control
authority may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the control authority is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
A. Performance bonds. The control authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond,
payable to the control authority, in a sum not to exceed a valued
determined by the control authority to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
B. Liability insurance. The control authority may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to
comply with any provision of this article, a previous wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, unless the user submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to
the POTW caused by its discharge.
C. Public nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public
nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the control
authority. Any person(s) creating a public nuisance shall be subject to
the provisions of the Second Class Township Code or Borough Code,61
as the case may be, and applicable ordinances governing such
nuisances, including reimbursing the control authority for any costs
incurred in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
D. Assessment of civil penalties.
(1) Pursuant to the provisions of Act 9 of 1992, providing for enhanced
penalty authority for publicly owned treatment works which are
authorized to enforce industrial pretreatment standards for
industrial waste discharges, and in addition to proceeding under
any other remedy available at law or equity for violation of
61.Editor's Note: See 8 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
§ 550-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-20
1:271
pretreatment standards and/or requirements, the control authority,
as the operator of a publicly owned treatment works, may assess a
civil penalty upon an industrial user for violation of any of the terms
and provisions of this article. The penalty may be assessed whether
or not the violation was willful or negligent. The civil penalty
shall not exceed $25,000 per day for each violation, regardless
of jurisdictional boundaries. Each violation for each separate day
shall constitute a separate and distinct offense under this section.
(2) As part of any notice of assessment of civil penalties issued by the
control authority to an industrial user, there shall also be included a
description of the applicable appeals process to be followed,
including the name, address and telephone number of the person
responsible for accepting such appeal, on behalf of the control
authority.
(3) For purposes of this section, a single operational upset which leads
to simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard
or requirement shall be treated as a single violation as required by
Federal Water Pollution Control Act.62 The control authority may,
however, recover its costs for reestablishing the operation of the
treatment works in addition to any civil penalty imposed under this
section.
(4) The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control
authority shall publicly adopt a formal, written civil penalty
assessment policy and make it publicly available. Each industrial
discharger participating in the pretreatment program shall be
given written notice of the policy. The penalty assessment policy
shall consider:
(a) Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and their uses;
(b) Costs of restoration and abatement;
(c) Savings resulting to the person in consequence of the violation;
(d) History of past violations;
(e) Deterrence of future violations; and
(f) Other relevant factors.
(5) Uses for penalties. All civil penalties collected pursuant to this
section shall be placed by the control authority in a restricted
account and shall only be used by the control authority and the
publicly owned treatment works for the following uses:
62.Editor's Note: See 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.
§ 550-20 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-20
1:272
(a) The repair of damage and any additional maintenance needed
or any additional costs imposed as a result of the violation for
which the penalty was imposed;
(b) Pay any penalties imposed on the Lower Perkiomen Valley
Regional Sewer Authority as control authority or the publicly
owned treatment works by the federal or state government for
violation of pretreatment standards;
(c) For the costs incurred by the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional
Sewer Authority as control authority or publicly owned
treatment works to investigate and take the enforcement
action that resulted in a penalty being imposed;
(d) For the monitoring of discharges in the pretreatment program
and for capital improvements to the treatment works,
including sewage collection lines, which may be required by
the pretreatment program; and
(e) Any remaining funds may be used for capital improvements to
the treatment works, including collection lines.
(6) Injunctive relief.
(a) The control authority shall have the power to obtain injunctive
relief to enforce compliance with or restrain any violation of
any pretreatment requirement or standard pursuant to and in
accordance with the provisions of Act 9 of 1992, and 40 CFR
403.8(f)(1)(vi)(A). Injunctive relief shall be available upon the
showing of one or more of the following:
[1] A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent
danger or substantial harm to the POTW or the public;
[2] A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the environment;
[3] A discharge from an industrial user causes the POTW to
violate any condition of its discharge permit; or
[4] The industrial user has shown a lack of ability or intention
to comply with a pretreatment standard.
(b) Notwithstanding the preceding subsection, an injunction
affecting an industrial operation not directly related to the
condition or violation in question may be issued if the court
determines that other enforcement procedures would not be
adequate to affect prompt correction of the condition or
violation. In addition to an injunction, the court in any such
proceedings may levy civil penalties in accordance with Act 9
of 199263 and this article.
63.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 550-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-20
1:273
§ 550-21. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
(7) Appeal. An industrial user assessed with a civil penalty under the
terms of this section shall have 30 days to pay the proposed penalty
in full, or, if the industrial user wishes to contest either the amount
of the penalty or the fact of the violation, the industrial user must
file an appeal of the action within 30 days pursuant to 2 Pa.C.S.A.
(relating to administrative law and procedure). Failure to appeal
within this period shall result in a waiver of all legal rights to
contest the violation or the amount of the penalty.
(8) The penalty authorized in this section is intended to be concurrent
and cumulative, and the provisions of this section shall not abridge
or alter any right of action or remedy, now or hereafter existing in
equity, or under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil,
available to a person, the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority as control authority, or the commonwealth.
E. Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this article, or wastewater discharge permit, or who
falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring
device or method required under this article, shall be prosecuted in
accordance with the provisions of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code
pertaining to perjury and falsification in official matters pursuant to 18
Pa.C.S.A. § 4901 et seq.
A. Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does
not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational
error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection A(3), below, are met.
(3) A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(a) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
§ 550-20 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 550-21
1:274
(b) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures; and
(c) The user has submitted the following information to the control
authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must
be provided within five days):
[1] A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
[2] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue; and
[3] Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
(6) Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility
until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is
provided. This requirement applies in situations where, among
other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility
is reduced, lost, or fails.
B. Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance
with the general prohibitions in § 550-10A of this article or the specific
prohibitions in § 550-10B of this article except § 550-10B(1)(a), (b) and
(h), if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources,
would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
(1) A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass-through or interference; or
(2) No local limits exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior
discharge when the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority as control authority was regularly in compliance with the
NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance
with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
§ 550-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 550-21
1:275
C. Bypass.
(1) For the purposes of this section:
BYPASS  The intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE  Substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
(2) A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if
it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C(3)
and (4) of this section.
(3) Bypass notification.
(a) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the control authority at least 10 days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.
(b) A user shall submit oral notice to the control authority of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of
the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass.
The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause, the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue, and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass.
(4) Bypass.
(a) Bypass is prohibited, and the control authority may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
[1] Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
[2] There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods
of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed in
the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to

[Added 12-2-2015 by Ord. No. 576]
Whereas, the Water Services Act, 53 P.S. § 3102.101 et seq., requires the
municipality to turn off water service to delinquent sewer rental accounts,
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal period of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
[3] The user submitted notices as required under Subsection
C(3) of this section.
(b) The control authority may approve an anticipated bypass after
considering its adverse effects if the control authority
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
Subsection C(4)(a)of this section.
A. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to provide for the recovery of
costs from users of the Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer
Authority's wastewater disposal system for the implementation of the
program established herein. The applicable charges or fees shall be set
forth in a schedule of charges and fees.
B. Charges and fees.
(1) The Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control
authority may adopt by resolution charges and fees which may
include:
(a) Fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating
the pretreatment program;
(b) Fees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures;
(c) Fees for reviewing accidental discharge procedures and
construction;
(d) Fees for permit applications;
(e) Fees for filing appeals;
(f) Fees for consistent removal of pollutants otherwise subject to
federal pretreatment standards; and
(g) Other fees as the control authority may deem necessary to
carry out the requirements contained herein.
(2) These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this article and
are separate from all other fees or sewer rentals chargeable by the
Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority as control
authority or any municipality contributing wastewater flows to the
POTW.

ARTICLE III
County Waste Flow System
[Adopted 9-19-1990 by Ord. No. 380 (Part 5, Ch. 6, Art. C, of the
1985 Code of Ordinances)]
§ 565-15. Background and findings.
A. Whereas, the Solid Waste Management Act of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, Act of July 7, 1980, P.L. 380, No. 97, 35 P.S. § 6018.101 et
seq., (Purdon Supp. 1990) ("Act 97"), was enacted to establish a
comprehensive planning and regulatory framework to deal with the
storage, collection, transportation, and processing of solid waste,
including municipal waste, as defined in Section 103 of Act 97, 35 P.S.
§ 6018.103 (Purdon Supp. 1990); and
B. Whereas, Act 97 made each municipality responsible for the collection,
transportation, processing and disposal of municipal waste generated
or present within its boundaries and authorized municipalities to
contract with any other person or municipality, including a county or an
authority, to carry out such responsibilities and authorized
municipalities to adopt ordinances, regulations and standards that
require disposal of all municipal waste generated within their
jurisdiction at a designated facility; and
C. Whereas, Act 97 required the preparation of municipal waste
management plans, 35 P.S. § 6018.201 (Purdon Supp. 1985); and
D. Whereas, Section 103 of Act 97 gave counties, cities, townships,
boroughs and authorities created by such municipalities concurrent
responsibility for the planning and regulation of municipal waste
collection, transportation and disposal by defining all such entities as
municipalities; and
E. Whereas, in 1982 and 1983, pursuant to the requirements of Act 97, the
several municipalities in the county adopted resolutions requesting the
County Board of Commissioners ("County Board") to prepare on the
municipalities' behalf a comprehensive municipal waste management
plan; and
F. Whereas, pursuant to the requests of the various municipalities and the
county's independent authority under Act 97, the County Board
developed a municipal waste management plan for solid waste disposal
(the plan) in which the County undertakes to assist such municipalities
with the disposal of acceptable waste (as hereinafter defined) so as to
enable the county and such municipalities to fulfill their responsibilities
as set forth in Act 97; and
G. Whereas, the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling, and Waste
Reduction Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Act No. 101 of
July 28, 1988, P.L. 556 ("Act 101"),65 was enacted in 1988 to empower,
and assign the duty to, the county to develop municipal waste
§ 565-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 565-15
1:291
management plans and otherwise insure adequate capacity for
permitted processing and disposal of the municipal waste which is
generated within its boundaries and empowers, and assigns the duty
to, each municipality other than a county, to assure the proper and
adequate transportation, collection and storage of municipal waste
generated within its boundaries; and
H. Whereas, Act 101 was also enacted to provide for strategies to
encourage recycling and to confer various additional powers upon
counties and other municipalities; and
I. Whereas, the county supplemented the plan and submitted it to the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for
technical approval pursuant to Act 97 and Act 101; and
J. Whereas, on January 26, 1989, DEP advised that it had granted
technical approval of the plan; and
K. Whereas, Act 101 provides that the plan may serve as the county's basic
planning document for municipal waste, pending the later development
of a plan in accordance with the provisions of Act 101, upon approval by
a majority of the affected municipalities within the county representing
a majority of the county's population; and
L. Whereas, a majority of the municipalities, including each of the
municipalities (as hereinafter defined) representing a majority of the
county's population, timely adopted resolutions approving the plan; and
M. Whereas, the plan was thereafter declared by DEP to have been
grandfathered under the provisions of Act 101; and
N. Whereas, pursuant to Act 101, the County Board has subsequently
effectuated certain revisions to the municipal waste management plan
for solid waste disposal (the plan revision), which plan revision is to be
ratified by a majority of the affected municipalities within the county
representing a majority of the county's population; and
O. Whereas, prompt and effective action to implement the plan and the
plan revision is necessary in order to protect and save the public's
health, safety and welfare; and
P. Whereas, pursuant to the plan and the plan revision, the county has
enacted an ordinance (the County Waste Flow Ordinance) requiring the
disposal of all municipal waste (as hereinafter defined) generated
within the municipalities in former Municipal Waste Districts 4, 5, and
6, now referred to collectively as the "Western District," of the county
(the municipalities) at the facilities comprising the municipal waste
disposal system for the county applicable to the municipalities (the
Western County System), forbidding the collection and transportation
of municipal waste within the Western District of the county by

1:292
collectors or transporters of municipal waste not properly licensed to
dispose of waste at the Western County System and providing for the
development of additional necessary rules and regulations concerning
solid waste collection, transportation and disposal; and
Q. Whereas, the county, in consultation with its technical and financial
advisors, and in the implementation of the plan and the plan revision,
has created the Western County System whereby the municipal waste
to be generated within the Western District will be disposed of from and
after a certain future date; and
R. Whereas, the county has created the Waste System Authority of
Western Montgomery County (the Waste Authority) and has assigned
and delegated to the Waste Authority certain of its powers to operate
the Western County System; and
S. Whereas, in further implementation of the provisions of the plan and
the plan revision, the county plans to enter into an intergovernmental
agreement with the Waste Authority and the municipalities (the
municipalities signing such agreement are hereinafter referred to as
"municipalities") designated "Inter-Municipal Agreement for the
Disposal of Western Montgomery County Municipal Solid Waste" (the
IMA) providing, among other things, for the delivery of certain
acceptable waste (as hereinafter defined) from the municipalities to the
Western County System for disposal; and
T. Whereas, it is intended that the Western County System shall be
available to the municipalities and other users for the disposal of their
acceptable waste; and
U. Whereas, it is understood that the tipping fees (as hereinafter defined),
to be charged to users of the Western County System (including, where
appropriate, the municipalities) must be sufficient to pay the costs of
the Western County System; and
V. Whereas, the Borough of Collegeville, after due consideration of the
undertaking, and taking into account the long term waste disposal
services being provided by the Waste Authority pursuant to the plan
and the plan revision, regards the Western County System as necessary
to its long-term health, safety, and welfare and has determined that any
tipping fees to be charged by the Waste Authority are or will be
reasonable in light of the long-term services provided; and
W. Whereas, the Borough of Collegeville has determined that it is
appropriate and in its interest to enact this article (the municipal waste
flow ordinance) directing the flow of all acceptable waste generated
within its jurisdiction to the Western County System; and
X. Whereas, the municipalities have responsibility for collection and the
transportation of such acceptable waste to the Western County System
in accordance with Act 97 and Act 101; and
§ 565-15 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 565-15
1:293
§ 565-16. Definitions.

General Provisions
§ 580-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "MS4 Stormwater
Management Ordinance."86
§ 580-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 580-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 580-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
86.
§ 580-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 580-3
1:305
§ 580-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality also is empowered to regulate land use activities that
affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247,
The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,87 as amended.
§ 580-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 580-6. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 580-7. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or ordinance.
§ 580-8. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
action may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the Municipality
purporting to validate such a violation.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and
groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the municipality.
H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two broad categories
or measures: structural or nonstructural. In this chapter, nonstructural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff
whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
A. Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the singular
number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender; and
words of feminine gender include masculine gender.

§ 580-14. Rate controls.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual101) is applicable to
any size of regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling
based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the postdevelopment total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour duration
precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (predevelopment) nonforested pervious areas must be
considered meadow in good condition.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual102) provided below is
independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm
Method is not followed. This method is not applicable to regulated
activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not
be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth. Removal
options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 580-14, Rate
controls.
A. Areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan. Postdevelopment discharge rates shall
not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year twenty-four-hour storms.
If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour

storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary
to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. Areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan. For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year storms, the postdevelopment peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps.
For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates.

removed, repaired or otherwise made safe. The permittee is
responsible for repair or restoration of the portion of the highway
damaged by a structure or facility. The permittee's obligation to
repair or restore the highway necessitated by a damaged structure
or facility under this subsection is separate from the obligations to
restore the highway and obtain a bond relating to restoration and
maintenance of the highway.
(16) Damage to highway. Responsibility of the permittee for restoration
of the highway includes the following:
(a) If there is a failure of the highway, including a slope or other
appurtenance thereto, in the area of the permitted work within
two years after the acknowledged completion of the permitted
work and there is no similar failure of the highway beyond the
area of the permitted work, the permittee has absolute
§ 592-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 592-14
1:345
responsibility to make temporary and permanent restoration
of this area unless the permittee delivers clear and convincing
evidence to the Borough office demonstrating that the highway
failure was caused by another person.
(b) In situations where the permittee has the responsibility to
restore the highway, including slope or another appurtenance
thereto, the permittee has the duty to restore the improved
area in accordance with the permit. If the permittee fails to
restore the improved area properly, the Borough will have the
authority to do the work at the expense of the permittee. The
permittee shall reimburse the Borough for the costs within 30
days after receipt of the Borough's invoice.
(c) The obtaining of a bond, other security or an agreement to
secure restoration costs does not relieve the permittee of the
restoration obligations imposed. The obtaining of a bond, other
security or an agreement will not act as a release of the
permittee from liability under principles of tort law with
respect to a failure of the highway in the permitted area
occurring after the expiration of the bond, other security or
agreement.
(17) Future highway changes. If in the future the highway is altered for
public convenience or necessity, the permittee shall at its own cost
and expense, change or relocate all or a part of the structures or
facilities authorized by the permit which interfere with the highway
alterations or which is inconsistent with the purpose of the highway
alterations.
(18) Acknowledgment by inspector. Acknowledgment, by the inspector
of the Borough that all or part of the permitted work has been
completed, does not constitute approval or acceptance of the work
or agreement that the work was performed in accordance with the
permit. Acknowledgment of completion by the inspector will not act
as a release of the permittee or waiver by the Borough of its right to
seek performance or restitution from the permittee.
N. Special conditions; subsurface operations.
(1) Drilling, boring, driving or tunneling across improved area.
Drilling, boring, driving or tunneling across improved areas shall

Plan Submission, Processing, and Review
§ 600-9. Applicability.
The standards, requirements, and procedures contained in this article shall
govern the submission and processing of all applications for subdivision
and/or land developments in the Borough.
§ 600-10. Types of plans.
All applications for subdivision and/or land development shall be classified
as sketch plans, preliminary plans, final plans, or minor plans, as further
regulated herein. Figure 600-3.1115 graphically presents the general plan
processing procedure.
§ 600-11. Sketch plan submission requirements.
A. Sketch plans. The Borough strongly recommends applicants submit a
preapplication sketch plan for all plans in accordance with the
requirements of § 600-11, Sketch plan submission requirements, and
§ 600-12, Sketch plan review procedure. Where only a portion of the
property is currently proposed for subdivision or land development, a
sketch plan shall show how the immediate proposal can fit logically into
an overall plan for the entire site.
B. Preliminary plans. A preliminary plan is required to be submitted for all
proposals for subdivision and/or land development in accordance with
the requirements of § 600-13, Preliminary plan submission
requirements, and § 600-14, Preliminary plan review procedure.
C. Final plans. A final plan is required to be submitted for all proposals for
subdivision and/or land development in accordance with the
requirements of § 600-15, Final plan submission requirements, and
§ 600-16, Final plan review procedure.
D. Minor plans. Applications which qualify as minor plans are not required
to submit a sketch plan and may be submitted for concurrent
preliminary and final plan processing and approval, in accordance with
the standards and requirements of § 600-18, Minor plan submission
requirements and review procedure.
A. Purposes. The purposes served by a sketch plan are as follows:
(1) To inform the Borough of an applicant's intent to subdivide and/or
develop a property, and graphically show the concepts and extent
of the proposal.
(2) To allow the Borough to provide advice and guidance to an
applicant so that:
115. Editor's Note: Said figure is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 600-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-11
1:389
(a) Overall layout and circulation issues can be resolved prior to
preparation of preliminary plans.

proceed more efficiently.
(3) To show how a tract of land may be further subdivided or developed
in cases where only a portion of a property is currently under an
active proposal.
(a) This plan shall show a logical and efficient pattern of roads,
lots, and/or buildings, as appropriate for the type of plan
proposed, and shall not be acceptable if it proposes lotting or
development which is obviously impractical or questionable for
reasons of floodplain, steep slopes, relationships to other
properties, or other site planning constraints.
(b) This plan may be shown on the preliminary plan for the subject
site in the form of a reduced-scale inset drawing, although
larger scale drawings are encouraged for review and
discussion purposes.
(c) Preapplication sketch plans shall have no legal standing with
regard to the formal plan approval process mandated by the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq., but shall be considered as a tool for discussion and
guidance regarding development issues.
B. Sketch plan information. A sketch plan should be drawn legibly and to
scale, but it need not be a precisely surveyed or engineered plan, and it
should show the following information:
(1) The entire tract boundary, total acreage, and acreage of each lot.
(2) Existing and proposed streets, lots, buildings, and approximate
building envelopes.
(3) Significant physical features such as floodplain, steep slopes,
woodlands, and existing structures.
(4) Contour lines at five- to ten-foot intervals, based on USGS datum.
(5) Approximate locations for stormwater control facilities, if
necessary.
(6) Location plan showing the relationship of the subject tract to the
surrounding road network and major physical features.
(7) North point and scale.
(8) Name and address of the owner.

ARTICLE IV
Design Standards
§ 600-20. General standards.
The following principles, standards and design requirements shall be used
in the evaluation of all subdivision and land development proposals. Other
design requirements as established in the Zoning Ordinance125 or other
municipal ordinance shall be used in addition to the following:
§ 600-21. Conformance with plans.
A. All portions of a tract shall be designated as to their use, such as lots,
roads, open space, parking areas, etc.
B. Applicants shall preserve scenic areas, historic sites, other community
assets and landmarks, and natural amenities such as trees and
waterways.
C. Plans shall be designed to avoid excessive disturbance of vegetation
and movement of earth.
D. Floodplain land areas shall be governed by additional standards
contained in this chapter, the Borough Zoning Ordinance, and the
Borough's Building Code.126
E. The applicant shall construct, install, and guarantee, at no expense to
the Borough or its authorities, all improvements required as part of
plan approval, including, but not limited to, streets, curbs, sidewalks,
water and sewage facilities, stormwater management facilities,
streetlights, fire hydrants, road signs, monuments, lot pins, utilities,
and shade trees.
F. The standards contained within this article are the minimum standards
and requirements for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of
the residents of the Borough and are to be used in all subdivisions and
land developments. Applicants are always encouraged to exceed
minimum standards. In addition, Borough Council reserves the right to
require standards in excess of the minimum requirements if warranted
due to the unique characteristics of a particular property.
A. Comprehensive Plan. Proposals for land development or subdivision
shall be generally consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, especially
as to the use of land, intensity of development, transportation,
community facilities and resource protection. Residential development
should also be consistent with the housing element of the plan. All
proposals should be located in areas designated for development in the
future land use plan element and be serviced by currently available
125. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning.
126. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning, and Ch. 270, Uniform Construction Codes,
respectively.
§ 600-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-21
1:413
§ 600-22. Site organization.
Proposed land developments and subdivisions should address the
opportunities and limitations present on a site and its adjacent
surroundings. Site opportunities should be maximized to enhance the
overall quality of the development and sincere steps should be taken to
lessen potential negative impacts upon a site and the surrounding
community. The physical, social, and psychological needs of the users of
the site should be evaluated and appropriately incorporated into the final
subdivision layout or site design. The impacts of the proposed development
on the natural environment and surrounding land uses should be given a
high priority and made an integral part of the overall design for the land
development and subdivision. The following site organization guidelines
should be used:
infrastructure or infrastructure that will be developed concurrent with
the development.
B. State, regional, and county plans. Proposals shall be generally
consistent with appropriate state, regional, and county adopted
Comprehensive Plans. Where regional facilities are proposed in the
plan, such as highways, effort shall be made to preserve needed rightsof-
way in the proposed land development or subdivision for future
infrastructure projects.
C. Public service improvements. Proposals shall be consistent with the
location and timing of public service improvements, such as water and
sewage facilities in accordance with the appropriate infrastructure
plans governing those facilities. In addition, the location of public
service facilities as outlined in a capital improvement program or
Official Map should be considered in locating and planning
development.
A. Site improvement layout. Building placement should provide a
functional relationship with a site's topography, existing vegetation,
surrounding land uses, taking into account energy conservation, polar
exposure, and pertinent natural features.
B. Existing natural features. Existing natural features should be
recognized and integrated into the site layout. Natural features such as
streams, hillsides, wetlands, unique habitat, woods, and similar natural
resources should be considered strong design determinants and be
incorporated into the overall site plan to strengthen the unique quality
of the land.
C. Open space and scenic views. The placement of open space and
preservation of scenic views should be a fundamental design decision.
Open space offers more than an opportunity to provide recreation. It
can protect important natural systems, reduce the perceived density of
development and effectively buffer different land uses.
§ 600-21 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-22
1:414
§ 600-23. Lots.
D. Circulation. Movement within a site and access to the site should
consider the safety and convenience of various types of users. Cross
access between properties and joint access are encouraged to improve
circulation.
E. Relationship to surrounding uses. The proposed design should
compliment positive surrounding uses through building set backs,
buffers, and separation of uses. Various potential negative impacts upon
surrounding land uses, including noise, light, and loss of privacy should
be mitigated.
F. Sustainable development. The development of a site should use
methods that reduce energy and water consumption needs of the land
development. Opportunities to utilize renewable energy sources and
conserve and reuse water resources should be considered.
A. Lot size and width. Each lot shall meet or exceed the minimum area and
width requirements of the Zoning Ordinance127 and be generally
sufficient in size and shape to adequately accommodate the
development or use proposed for it. Lots that contain natural
restrictions such as wetlands, water bodies, steep slopes or other
features shall be made large enough to provide suitable area for the
intended use of the lot without requiring encroachment upon natural
amenities. Lots with existing or planned public improvements such as
fuel pipe lines, underground utility easements, stormwater detention
basins, high voltage power lines or other facilities should be sized to
allow suitable room for the intended use of the lot without requiring
encroachment on the public facilities or easements.
B. Lot shape. Deep, narrow lots and wide, shallow lots are to be avoided
except that lots containing uniquely designed structures, such as
certain types of attached dwelling units, may receive special
consideration. Every lot shall contain a building envelope suitable for
the type(s) of development proposed.
C. Lot frontage. Every lot shall have frontage along the right-of-way of a
public, private or common street, in accordance with the Zoning
Ordinance.128 Sufficient frontage is the minimum width required to site
a driveway into the property in accordance with the design
requirements in this section and other appropriate state, federal, and
local regulations. Corner lots will have to meet lot frontage
requirements on two streets.
D. Lot lines. Lot lines shall be drawn parallel, concentric, at right angles,
or radial to the street right-of-way line unless not feasible or
undesirable due to existing, permanent, natural or man-made features.
127. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning.
128. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning.
§ 600-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-23
1:415
Where possible lot lines shall coincide with abutting lot lines and
lot lines across streets. Generally, lot corners of several lots should
coincide.
E. Reverse frontage lots. Reverse frontage lots may be used as an
alternative to marginal access streets, or normal lotting when the lots
abut a major collector street or street of a higher classification, or steep
grades (over 15%) at the street right-of-way line. When reverse
frontage lots are used and the total lot depth is less than 200 feet, 25
feet adjacent to the major collector street or street of a higher
classification, shall be planted as a screening buffer in accordance with
§ 600-53.
F. Flag lots.
(1) In unique situations, flag lots may be permitted by special
exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the
Zoning Ordinance.129 In reviewing flag lots proposals, the following
factors will be considered by Borough Council, the Planning
Commission, and Engineer.
(a) The amount of road frontage and configuration of the property
being subdivided.
(b) The sizes and number of lots proposed, including both the total
number of lots and the number of flag lots.
(c) The type and character of road that the tract abuts.
(d) The type and character of the neighborhood and abutting
parcels.
(e) The topography of the parcel being subdivided, with an
emphasis on saving trees, avoiding steep slopes, and
preserving floodplain, wetlands and other environmental
features if present.
(f) The location and safety of access points and street
intersections.
(g) The economic impact on the municipality of maintaining a road
as compared to using flag lots.
(h) The visual and physical impacts of road construction from
excessive regrading, for example, as compared to the use of
access strips.
(2) Parts of a flag lot. Flag lots shall be comprised of two parts, the
access strip and the body of the lot. The body of the lot shall begin
at the point at which the lot width meets the minimum lot width
requirement specified in the Zoning Ordinance.130
129. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning.
§ 600-23 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-23
1:416
§ 600-24. Blocks.
(3) Design standards for flag lots.
(a) The length of the access strip shall be kept to a minimum. As a
guide, the preferred length is approximately equal to the depth
of one lot which complies with the minimum lot width and area
requirements of the district in which it is located.
(b) The location of the access strip should be logical relative to the
body of the flag lot, surrounding lot configurations, and natural
features of the land, and it shall intersect the public street at a
safe, visible location.
(c) Turns greater than 45° or with a radius less than 150 feet and
vertical grades in excess of 10% are prohibited in access strips.
It may be necessary to widen the access strip at such sharp
turns and steep slopes to accommodate grading, drainage, tree
preservation, or emergency vehicles.
(d) Beginning at the edge of road pavement, the first 15 feet of
driveways within an access strip shall be paved.
(e) No more than one tier of flag lots shall be permitted on a tract.
In other words, a flag lot may not be located behind another
flag lot.
(f) In a subdivision of five or more lots, flag lots may comprise no
more than 15% of the total number of lots, rounded to the
nearest whole number.
(g) Flag lots are not permitted to gain access from a single access
street.
(h) The access strip must serve as the primary access point for the
lot.
A. The minimum block length shall be 300 feet unless the Zoning
Ordinance131 specifies a different minimum length.
B. The block width shall be two lots deep when the lots are laid out back to
back according to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.132 When
reverse lotting is designed, the block width shall be in accordance with
the reverse frontage lot standards in § 600-23.
C. Blocks shall be designed to continue the Borough's grid pattern and
provide efficient, convenient, and safe pedestrian and vehicular
circulation, including the reduction of intersections with arterial
streets.

subdivision and land development.
A. Borough Council shall determine the need for additional community
facilities to serve the proposed subdivision or land development.
B. Where deemed essential by Borough Council upon consideration of the
particular type of development proposed, and especially in large-scale
residential developments, Borough Council may require the dedication
or reservation of such areas or sites of an extent and location suitable to
the needs created by the development for schools, parks and other
purposes in accordance with the park and recreation plan, community
facilities plan, or Official Map.
C. Areas provided or reserved for such community facilities shall be
adequate to provide for building sites, related activity areas,
landscaping, and off-street parking as appropriate to the use proposed.
D. Where a proposed park, playground, school or other public use shown
in the Comprehensive Plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision
or land development, Borough Council may require the dedication or
reservation of land within the subdivision or land development.
A. Subdividers and developers shall provide recreation facilities and open
space land in the amount and character prescribed in the Zoning

to pay the costs of remedial maintenance, the costs of
corrective action by the Borough shall be assessed ratably, in
accordance with tax assessments, against the properties that
have the right of enjoyment of the common facilities and shall
become a lien on said properties. The Borough, at the time of
entering upon such common facilities for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file a notice of such lien in the Office of the
Prothonotary of Montgomery County, upon the properties
affected by such lien.
(5) All plans finally approved, whether or not recorded, shall be
binding upon the subdivider or developer, his heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns; shall limit and control the
use and operation of all open space designated in such plans, to the
conditions appearing in such plans and cited in any associated
formal agreement for the approval thereof.
A. Open space criteria. Open space set aside in fulfillment of the
requirements of this article shall be in accordance with the following
standards and principles.

§ 600-28. Preservation of existing vegetation.
Preservation of existing woodlands, mature trees, and unique vegetation is
required to maintain habitat, protect soil from erosion, reduce energy costs,
and enhance local aesthetics.
softball, football, soccer, or other field sports, while maintaining the
neighborhood use character.
(3) By creating one or more park-like facilities rather than several sets
of scattered facilities.
(4) Tot lots may be adjacent to other types of recreation facilities but
not to other tot lots so that they may be dispersed throughout the
development and only require short walking distances from all
homes.
A. Preservation of existing vegetation.
(1) All subdivisions and land developments shall be laid out in such a
manner as to minimize the removal or disturbance of healthy trees
and shrubs. Existing woodlands should be incorporated into
common open space, buffer areas, and on large lots. Special
consideration shall be given to mature specimen trees and
ecologically significant woodlands.
(2) It shall be incumbent on the applicant to prove that tree removal is
minimized. If challenged by the Borough, the applicant shall
produce evidence, such as written documents or plans certified by
a registered landscape architect or other professional showing that
no alternative layouts are possible and that no alternative clearing
or grading plan would reduce the loss of mature trees, tree masses,
or woodlands.
(3) Mature trees, tree masses, or woodlands proposed for removal by
the applicant during construction shall be labeled. "TO BE
REMOVED." All other trees, tree masses, or woodlands shall be
designated "TO REMAIN."
(4) Trees over six inches in caliper within a tract proposed for
subdivision or land development shall not be removed unless any of
the following conditions exist:
(a) Immediate danger to life or property.
(b) Affliction by a disease which threatens to injure or destroy
other trees.
(c) There exists an approved land development plan showing
landscape material to be retained or removed. Tree removal
pursuant to such a plan shall be limited to those trees within 15
feet of a proposed structure, six feet of a proposed impervious
§ 600-27 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-28
1:428
§ 600-29. Wetland protection.
surface or an area to be graded pursuant to an approved
grading plan.
(5) All specimen trees which are not to be removed shall be preserved
in their natural condition.
(6) In the event that a tree over six inches in caliper must be removed
for reasons stated in Subsection A(4) above, said trees shall be
replaced with approved trees of 2 1/2 inches caliper at a rate of two
new trees to each one tree removed. Acceptable species for
replacement trees are listed in Appendix 600-A.135
B. Protection of existing vegetation.
(1) Existing vegetation to remain shall be identified "TO REMAIN" in
the field and on the erosion and sediment control plan prior to any
clearing and physically protected during construction. A temporary
physical barrier such as a snow fence shall be erected a minimum
of one foot outside the dripline on all sides of individual trees, tree
masses, and woodlands prior to clearing and construction. The
barrier shall be placed to prevent disturbance to or compaction of
soil inside the barrier, and shall remain until construction is
complete.
(2) It is recommended that trees to be preserved near developed
portions of a site are pruned and fertilized prior to beginning of
construction in order to ensure their health.
A. The presence of hydric soils may indicate the presence of wetlands.
When hydric soils are indicated on the site, a wetlands study should be
conducted in accordance with the Federal Manual for Identifying and
Delineating Wetlands. In the event no wetland study is undertaken, the
location of hydric soils on site will be assumed to be wetlands for the
purpose of this chapter and so noted on the plan.
B. Wetlands, as defined by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in accordance with Section 404 of
the Federal Clean Water Act of 1977 and (25 Pa. Code) Chapter 105 of
the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act Amendments of 1978 shall be
preserved in subdivisions and land developments. Required permits
shall be obtained at an early stage to determine the extent and location
in proposed subdivision and/or land development.
C. A twenty-five-foot setback shall be maintained around the perimeter of
all wetlands. This area will be known as the "wetland buffer." No
removal of vegetation, except the optional removal of dead trees or
periodic mowing of existing lawns or fields, shall take place within this
buffer area without the specific permission of the Borough.

1:429
§ 600-30. Riparian corridor management.
D. Required building setbacks as described in the Zoning Ordinance136
shall be measured from the edge of the wetland buffer.
A. Whenever a pond, watercourse, stream, or intermittent stream as
identified in the Soil Survey of Montgomery County is located within a
development site, it shall remain open in its natural state and location
and shall not be piped.
B. Unless otherwise described in the Zoning Ordinance137 a fifty-foot
buffer (25 feet from each bank of the water body) shall be maintained
along all intermittent or perennial watercourses and ponds. This buffer
area will be known as the "riparian corridor." No removal of vegetation,
except for removal of dead trees and shrubs or periodic mowing of
existing lawns or fields, shall take place within this buffer area without
the specific permission of the Borough.
C. The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered without the written approval of the
affected landowners.
D. No stormwater runoff or natural drainage shall be so diverted as to
overload existing drainage systems, or create flooding or the need for
additional drainage structures on the other private properties or public
lands. In cases where additional stormwater flows will overload
adjacent structures, the applicant shall be responsible for enlarging the
facilities.
E. Within any riparian corridor, no construction, development, use,
activity, or encroachment shall be permitted unless a corridor
management plan is submitted and approved by Borough Council and
the effects of such development are mitigated by the implementation of
the corridor management plan. The corridor management plan shall
meet the following requirements:
(1) Plan contents. The corridor management plan shall contain the
following information:
(a) Existing conditions, including the corridor boundaries, steep
slopes, swales, wetlands, streams, ponds, floodplains,
woodlands, other vegetation, and existing structures. A written
description of unusual or significant conditions should also be
included.
(b) Management goals for the entire tract and long-range goals for
the riparian corridor.

137. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning.
§ 600-29 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-30
1:430
(c) Proposed activities, including a plan drawn to scale that shows
all proposed activities within and adjacent to the corridor. The
plan shall differentiate areas that will be disturbed from those
that will be protected and preserved.
(d) Proposed management, including an explanation of how the
goals will be met given the proposed activities. The plan shall
specify when the construction, planting, or other activities are
to begin and end and shall address long and short-term
maintenance, mitigation, and improvement activities
necessary for preservation of the corridor, including
application of herbicides, removal of invasive plants, spacing
and types of newly planted trees and shrubs, mowing
schedules, farming practices, and other related functions.
(2) Management, mitigation, and restoration measures. The proposed
management plan shall comply with the following management,
mitigation, and restoration measures:
(a) Management practices. The following management practices
shall be integrated into the management plan:
[1] Existing woody and other vegetation should be preserved
to the greatest extent possible.
[2] Fallen branches and other organic material should be
allowed to remain where they have fallen, provided that
they do not create a hazard.
[3] Stream crossings should be done at a 90° angle to the
stream.
[4] Stream banks should be stabilized in accordance with "A
Streambank Stabilization and Management Guide for
Pennsylvania Landowners," by PADEP.
[5] Degraded landscapes should be restored or converted to a
more effective landscape for maintaining water resources.
(3) Mitigation measures. Disturbance of vegetation within the riparian
corridor shall be mitigated by at least one of the following
measures, with a total amount of mitigated area, measured
horizontally, that is equal to or greater than the total amount of
disturbed area, measured horizontally:
(a) Increasing the width of the corridor. The width of the riparian
corridor, measured from the defined edge of a watercourse, is
increased to at least 75 feet.
(b) Converting to a more effective landscape. The existing
landscape is converted to a more effective landscape. The
following landscapes are listed in order of effectiveness, from
§ 600-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-30
1:431
most effective to least effective: woodland, meadow, shrub, oldfield,
lawn.
(c) Increasing the effectiveness of the corridor. In existing
degraded wooded areas or proposed new wooded areas, the
riparian corridor is planted with three distinct layers of
vegetation:
[1] Canopy trees, such as oak, hickory, maple, gum, beech,
sycamore, spruce, pine, and fir.
[2] Shrubs that provide an understory, such as elderberry,
viburnum, azalea, rhododendron, holly, laurel, and alders.
[3] Herbaceous plants that serve as ground cover, including
ferns, sorrel, trillium, violet, Virginia creeper, nettle,
phlox, aster, and worts. All three layers shall be planted at
a density sufficient to create a fully functioning,
naturalized riparian corridor.
(4) Restoration and conversion of landscapes.
(a) Landscapes shall be restored by removing invasive vines,
removing invasive trees, cleaning out trash, correcting soil
erosion problems, planting appropriate plants, and properly
maintaining all new plantings.
(b) Landscapes shall be converted to a more effective landscape by
removing existing, incompatible vegetation, planting plants
that are appropriate for the proposed landscape type and the
site, and maintaining and protecting the plantings from
invasive plants, deer, and other long-term problems.
F. Vegetation selection. To function properly, vegetation in the corridor
management plan shall be selected from the Recommended Plant
Materials List in Appendix 600-A.138 Plants not included on the list may
be permitted by Borough Council when satisfactory evidence is
provided from qualified sources certifying their suitability. The Borough
may require species suitability to be verified by qualified experts in the
Montgomery County Conservation District, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, the
United States Fish and Wildlife Service, or state and federal forest
agencies.
(1) Existing tree cover should be surveyed and inventoried to assess
the need for any new plantings. Existing species included on the
Pennsylvania Noxious Weed Control List should be removed where
conditions warrant.

§ 600-30 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-30
1:432
§ 600-31. Topsoil protection and grading.
(2) Adjacent to the watercourse, dominant vegetation shall be
composed of a variety of native riparian tree and shrub species and
appropriate plantings necessary for stream bank stabilization.
(3) Away from the watercourse, dominant vegetation shall be
composed of riparian trees and shrubs, with an emphasis on native
species and appropriate plantings necessary to stabilize the soil.
(4) Disturbed areas shall be revegetated with riparian corridor plants,
in compliance with an approved corridor management plan.
(a) Canopy tree and shrub plantings shall be located along the
streambank to provide shade for the stream, soil erosion
control and stormwater benefits, according to accepted
streambank restoration practices.
(b) New canopy trees shall be planted at a minimum rate of 15 feet
on center or one tree per 225 square feet in staggered
naturalized rows or an equivalent informal arrangement within
the area within 25 feet of the top of each bank of the stream.
One new shrub or understory tree shall be planted for every
four new trees required for riparian corridor revegetation.
(c) New trees shall be a variety of sizes ranging from a minimum
four- to five-foot branched whip to an approximate 1 1/2 inch
caliper balled and burlapped planting stock.
(5) Areas that cannot be revegetated shall be restored using
management practices accepted by experts qualified in riparian
corridor management.
A. The top six inches of soil that existed naturally on the site prior to
subdivision or land development shall be stockpiled on the site.
B. Following construction, the stockpiled soil shall be redistributed
uniformly on the site to a minimum depth of six inches.
C. All disturbed areas excluding the stockpile soil of the site shall be
stabilized and protected against erosion in compliance with the
Pennsylvania Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.
D. Any topsoil in excess of the six inches depth that existed prior to
subdivision or land development may be stockpiled separately for other
uses by the applicant. Topsoil may be removed from the site only upon
issuance of a permit by Borough Council to ensure that sufficient topsoil
will remain on the site and in the municipality.
E. Grading. All permanent and temporary cutting, filling, grading,
regrading, and/or other forms of earthmoving activities shall be known
as "grading" and shall be conducted only in compliance with the
standards as described below:
§ 600-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-31
1:433
§ 600-32. Erosion and sediment control.
The requirements of this section shall apply when they are more stringent
than those of PADEP or when PADEP has no jurisdiction.
(1) All grading shall be set back from property lines at least three feet,
or a sufficient distance, to prevent any adverse effects on adjacent
properties.
(2) No permanent excavation shall be made with a cut face steeper in
slope than three horizontal to one vertical.
(3) Wherever grading will increase the volume or velocity of
stormwater flow toward a property line, the applicant shall install
and maintain drainage facilities sufficient to prevent adverse
effects on the adjoining property. The construction and operation of
these drainage facilities shall not cause any adverse effects on
abutting properties.
(4) Along property lines, where grading creates an abrupt drop off
from the abutting property, in contrast to a previously existing
gradual change, the applicant shall be required to install a fence or
other suitable protective barrier.
(5) A permit shall be required for grading operations. Permits shall be
issued by the Zoning Officer upon recommendation of the Borough
Engineer for each tract, lot, parcel, or site which comprises a
separate operation, unrelated to or not contiguous with nearby
grading proposed or performed by the applicant. A permit shall not
be required in the following situations, however:
(a) For an excavation that does not exceed 20 cubic yards total
material removed.
(b) For a fill that does not exceed 20 cubic yards of material
deposited.
(c) For an excavation below finished grade for basements and
footings for a single-family detached or two-family dwelling,
swimming pool, or underground structure authorized by
building permits, excavation for a driveway for a single-family
detached or two-family dwelling, or the regrading of such
excavated materials into the site from which they were
excavated.
A. General.
(1) For qualifying tracts, no change shall be made in the contour of the
land; no grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the topsoil,
trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced
until such time that a plan for minimizing erosion and
§ 600-31 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-32
1:434
sedimentation has been approved by the Montgomery County
Conservation District.
(2) No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(a) There has been a plan approved by Borough Council that
provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consistent
with this section, and an improvement bond or other
acceptable securities are deposited with the Borough the form
of an escrow guarantee which will insure installation and
completion of the required improvements; or
(b) There has been a determination by Borough Council that a plan
for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
(3) Borough Council, in its consideration of any preliminary plan of
subdivision and land development shall condition its approval upon
the execution of measures designed to prevent accelerated soil
erosion and resulting sedimentation, as required by PADEP. All
applicable regulations and permit requirements of said department
as stipulated in its Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Pollution
Control Manual shall be followed by all parties engaged in
earthmoving activities. The manual is available at the office of the
Montgomery County Conservation District.
B. Performance principles.
(1) Any effective methods of minimizing erosion and sedimentation can
be included in the plan. Any questionable method should be
discussed with the Borough Engineer prior to submission.
(2) No unfiltered stormwater coming from an area which has been
disturbed shall be permitted onto an adjacent tract or discharge
into any water body.
C. Responsibility.
(1) Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation,
regrading or other development activity, it shall be the
responsibility of the person, corporation or other entity causing
such sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining surfaces,
drainage systems and watercourses and to repair any damage at
his expense as quickly as possible.
(2) It is the responsibility of any person, corporation, or other entity
doing any act on or across a stream, watercourse or swale or upon
the floodplain or right-of-way thereof, to maintain, as nearly as
possible, in its present state the stream, watercourse, swale,
floodplain or right-of-way during the activity and to return it to its
original or equal condition after such activity is completed.
(3) No person, corporation, or other entity shall block, impede the flow
of, alter, construct any structure, or deposit any material or thing,
§ 600-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-32
1:435
§ 600-33. Historic feature preservation.
or commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any
stream or watercourse without having obtained prior approval
from the Borough or PADEP, whichever is applicable.
D. Compliance with regulations and procedures.
(1) Final plans for minimizing erosion and sedimentation as approved
will be incorporated into the agreement and bond requirements as
required under this chapter.
(2) The approval of plans and specifications for the control of erosion
and sedimentation shall be concurrent with the approval of the
final plans of subdivision or land development, and become a part
thereof.
(3) At the time that a building permit is applied for, a review shall be
conducted by the Borough Engineer to insure conformance with
the plan as approved. During the construction further consultative
technical assistance will be furnished, if necessary, by the Borough
Engineer and the Montgomery County Conservation District.
During this development phase, the Borough Engineer shall inspect
the development site and enforce compliance with the approved
plans.
A. The design of subdivisions and land developments should be done in a
manner which would preserve desirable cultural and historic features
of a site wherever reasonably possible.
B. No proposal will be approved with a property line extending through
any portion of an existing building, except where that property line
follows a party wall separating semidetached or attached units, in
accordance with the Borough Zoning Ordinance.139
C. When existing buildings are retained:
(1) Unless otherwise specified in the Zoning Ordinance,140 when the
height and/or bulk of the existing building significantly exceeds
that of abutting development, building setbacks in excess of the
applicable minimums are encouraged, in respect to all new lot lines
created. For tall buildings, a setback equal to the height of the
building is suggested as a minimum. For proportionally wide or
deep buildings, a setback equal to 1/2 the width or depth of the
building is suggested as a minimum.
(2) Run down buildings shall be rehabilitated on the exterior to
conform in quality with surrounding new development.

Sidewalks shall be installed along all existing and proposed public and
private streets, common driveways, and common parking areas.
(3) Structurally deficient buildings shall be rehabilitated in
conformance with the Borough's Building Code141 and the Uniform
Construction Code.
(4) Additions to retained buildings shall be in harmony with the
character, design, building materials, and other architectural
features of the building.
(5) Historical or culturally significant buildings shall retain their
respective characters, to the greatest extent practical.
(6) New buildings abutting the retained building should reflect the
respective characters of the surrounding buildings to the greatest
extent practical.
D. When existing buildings will be removed as permitted by the Zoning
Ordinance:142
(1) The plan must show the location and include a brief description of
the building(s) to be removed.

§ 600-41. Street classifications.
In its design manual, PennDOT classifies streets according to standards
established by AASHTO. The Borough is using the same classification
system in order to coordinate highway improvements with neighboring
municipalities, the region, and the state. Every street, road, or highway
within the Borough shall be classified by its function as one of the following,
and shall be subject to the guidelines for its classification as contained in
this article and presented in Figures 600-4.7 and 600-4.8:
(7) Curbs and storm sewers shall be installed along all existing and
proposed public and private streets and common parking areas
except when this requirement is waived at the discretion of
Borough Council, upon recommendation of the Borough Planning
Commission and Engineer.
(8) Developer shall assign street names subject to approval of Borough
Council and use street numbers as assigned by the Public Works
Department.
(9) Median strips or other traffic calming devices may be required by
Borough Council to provide for public safety and traffic efficiency.
B. Private streets. Whenever a subdivider or developer proposes to
establish a street which is not offered for dedication of public use,
Borough Council shall require the applicant to submit, and also to
record with the plan, a copy of the agreement made with the Borough
on behalf of his heirs and assigns. Such streets shall be constructed in
conformance with the Borough Engineer standards for public streets.
Maintenance reliability shall be outlined and defined by the applicant
and reviewed by the Borough prior to final approval. When, in the
determination of Borough Council, it becomes necessary for the
Borough to assume responsibility for a private street in order to
maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the Borough,
the Borough may do so and assess the property owner(s) or abutting
owners who use the street for any improvements necessary to restore
the street to conformance with Borough specifications.

§ 600-42. Street alignment.
Sight distance, horizontal and vertical curvature, superelevation, and
maximum and minimum street grades shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer in compliance with the standards contained in A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, published by the American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials, most recent edition,
or PennDOT standards, whichever is more restrictive. In addition, the
following standards and guidelines shall be complied with:

1:447
§ 600-44. Single-access street regulations.
Any street which is served by only one intersection with a through street
shall be considered a single-access street, regardless of the street's
configuration within the proposed subdivision or land development.
(2) Where angled intersections are used it is preferable to design them
so that the heavier traffic flow will make the obliquely angled turn
rather than the acutely angled turn.
C. Improvements to existing intersections. When existing streets intersect
at odd angles or have more than four approaches, the applicant shall
improve the intersection, to bring it into compliance with this chapter,
as required by Borough Council, who shall first seek the advice of the
Borough Engineer and Planning Commission and other technical
advisors or agencies, as appropriate. For state and county highways,
improvements shall comply with the requirements of the appropriate
agency.
D. Waiver of improvements. Borough Council may waive the above
requirements for improvements under one or more of the following
conditions:
(1) When changes made on the applicant's land will not improve the
intersections deficiencies.
(2) When other road improvements are already planned which would
correct the problem without changes required of the applicant.
(3) When not required by PennDOT where the intersections are under
their jurisdiction.
E. Single-access street intersections.
(1) Intersections with single access shall be designed with the single
access street extending as a side street from the through street.
(2) Four-way intersections may be created using two permanent single
access streets intersecting directly opposite one another along a
through street, when the through street is a local access street.
F. All intersections shall provide clear sight distance in compliance with
PennDOT standards.

by vehicular traffic to or from properties abutting a Borough road. The
term includes proposed streets, lanes, alleys, courts, and ways.
B. Applicants shall submit sketch plans to the Borough Planning
Commission, for their evaluation and advice, in the following
circumstances:
(1) When any residential dwelling units are proposed along an existing
arterial or collector street.
(2) For all nonresidential proposals which require a new driveway or
upgrading of an existing driveway.
(3) For all proposals whose driveways would generate 25 or more
vehicular trips per day, based on ITE trip generation standards.
C. The Borough Planning Commission shall review the proposal in
accordance with the procedures of Article III of this chapter.
D. Following evaluation by the Borough Planning Commission, the
applicant may submit plans to the state or Borough for formal review
and, as appropriate, approval and issuance of permits.
E. No driveway location, classification, or design shall be considered
finally approved by the Borough unless permits have been granted by
the state and/or Borough and preliminary plan approval has been
granted by Borough Council for the subdivision and/or land
development which the driveway(s) will serve.
A. The term "driveway" as used here refers to every entrance or exit used
by vehicular traffic to or from properties abutting a Borough road. The
term includes proposed streets, lanes, alleys, courts, and ways.
B. Driveway intersections with streets:
(1) Shall provide adequate sight distance in compliance with the
standards contained in the PennDOT standards.
(2) Shall not cause or contribute to:
(a) Hazards to the free movement of normal street traffic.
(b) Traffic congestion on the street.

driveways, the number of driveways permitted to serve individual
parcels of land shall be kept to the minimum needed to adequately
serve the parcel in question.
(1) Properties with frontages of 100 feet or less may be permitted not
more than one driveway intersection with a street. Exceptions may
be made when adjacent property owners share parking, or when
the need is determined in a traffic study prepared by a qualified
traffic engineer.
(2) Not more than two driveway intersections with the same street may
be permitted for any parcel of land unless anticipated traffic
volumes warrant more than two, and then only when supported by
a traffic study prepared by a qualified engineer warrants more than
two driveway intersections.
D. Driveway intersections serving individual parcels of land may be
prohibited by Borough Council where such intersections would create
congestion, interference, and/or hazards to traffic flow and safety by
reason of street grades, land forms, vegetation, frequency of driveway
intersections, limited sight distances, and/or high speed traffic flow. In
such cases, Borough Council may permit reasonable alternative forms
of vehicular access to the parcel of land by means of:
(1) Marginal access streets or driveways.
(2) Reverse frontage lotting.
(3) Other means which are legally and technically suitable in the
opinions of the Borough Solicitor and Engineer.
E. Where driveway intersections are prohibited by Borough Council and
alternative forms of vehicular access would cause an undue burden
upon an applicant, Borough Council may permit an alternative interim
access solution in compliance with the following:
(1) It is the safest feasible alternative, acceptable to the Borough
Engineer and/or PennDOT.
(2) Suitable provisions are made for a preferable permanent access
solution, consistent with Subsection D, above, including legal
agreements to enable implementation of the permanent solution.
F. Distance from street intersections. Driveways shall be located as far
from street intersections as is reasonably possible.
G. Choice of streets. When streets of different classes are involved, the
driveway shall provide access to the street of lesser classification unless
this requirement is waived by Borough Council for reasons of sight
distance, incompatibility of traffic, grading, drainage, or other major
reasons.

the line of flow. In addition, the following information is required for
new bridge construction: the total drainage area above the bridge site;
description of watershed; length of stream from source to bridge site
and to the mouth; character of stream bed and banks; extent and depth
of overflow during floods; effect of previous floods upon bridges, their
span and clearance; whether bridge will be within backwater influence
of parent stream.
E. A complete set of structural computations and drawings shall be
submitted with plans involving construction of bridges and culverts.
A. Street names. Street names shall be determined in consultation with
the Borough. Street names should bear a reasonable relationship to
significant natural features or history of the community. Efforts should

(1) The specific purposes to be served by these requirements are:
(a) To add visual character and improve the appearance of parking
areas by reducing their massiveness into smaller units.
(b) To integrate parking areas into the pedestrian circulation
system.
(c) To provide shade for parked cars and reduce heat islands,
stormwater runoff, and air pollution.
(d) To reduce random vehicular flow across parking areas.
(e) To permit a high level of visibility for those uses for which
visibility is an important factor.
(f) To facilitate snow removal and storm drainage, and to conserve
energy in construction and resurfacing operations, by laying
out the paving surface with minimal obstructions.

areas shall not be located closer than 15 feet from any tract
boundary line and 10 feet from any legal right-of-way line.
(3) Where the edge of an existing parking area is located close to a
street, driveway, or other parking area and the property is
proposed for subdivision and/or land development, a minimum
separation of 10 feet shall be provided between these features
unless a shared parking or cross access arrangement is proposed.
(4) Dead-ended parking areas shall be discouraged when the required
parking capacity can be accommodated in a layout that permits
more convenient vehicular movements. However, extraneous
through traffic flow should be avoided.
(a) Up to 30 parking spaces may also be located in a dead-ended
parking area if there is no more desirable alternative feasible,
and sufficient back-up areas provided for the end stalls.
(b) More than 30 parking spaces may be located in a dead-ended
parking area only if a turnaround area is provided at the closed
end, suitable for passenger car turning. The turnaround area
may be circular, "T-" or "Y-" shaped, or other configuration
acceptable to Borough Council.
(5) Parking spaces designed for the exclusive use by disabled persons
shall be installed in all parking lots as close and convenient to
building entrances as is reasonable. The specific number and
locations of handicapped stalls shall be in conformance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
(6) Provisions for pedestrian safety within a parking lot shall be
required by providing sidewalks and delineated crosswalks.
(7) Planting islands shall be constructed within all parking lots with
more than 12 spaces based on the following standards:
(a) One planting island shall be provided for every 12 parking
stalls. There shall be no more than 12 continuous parking stalls
in a row without a planting island.
(b) Alternative planting islands (without planting islands located
every 12 parking stalls) must provide 1 canopy tree for every
10 parking stalls in planting island areas and perimeter
parking planting areas at the discretion of Borough Council.
(c) The ends of all parking rows shall be divided for driving lanes
by planting islands.
(d) Planting islands shall be a minimum of nine feet by 18 feet in
area. Unless designed to function as part of the stormwater

§ 600-50 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-50
1:458
management system, planting islands shall be underlain by soil
mounded up to six inches minimum above the paved parking
or drive area and shall be protected by curbs or wheel stops.
(8) Parking lots with more than 12 stalls shall require planting strips
around the entire perimeter of the parking lot except where
buildings, driveways, and walkways are located.
(9) Unless otherwise described in this chapter, where required, all
planting strips shall be a minimum of 10 feet wide and run the
length of the parking row. Unless designed to function as part of
the stormwater management system, planting strips shall be
underlain by soil mounded up to six inches above the paved parking
or drive area and shall be protected by curbs, wheel stops, or
bollards.
C. Parking area dimensions.
(1) Parallel parking stalls shall have minimum dimensions of nine feet
by 22 feet.
(2) Perpendicular parking stalls shall have minimum dimensions of
nine feet by 18 feet with a twenty-two-foot aisle.
(3) At the discretion of Borough Council the minimum length of
parking stalls may be reduced by one foot if stalls are designed to
allow vehicles to overhang an area of grass or other pervious
surface. Bumper stops shall be provided which allow the parked
vehicle to extend at least one foot over the edge of the pavement.
(4) Where parking stalls abut sidewalks, parked vehicles shall not
overhang the sidewalks unless the sidewalk is widened by two feet.
Wheel stops are encouraged in order to allow for full pedestrian
use of the sidewalks.
(5) Parking spaces for physically disabled persons shall be 13 feet wide
and equal in depth to the spaces abutting them in accordance with
standards developed under the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
D. Residential parking lots.
(1) Parallel rows of parking spaces, which are not separated by a
driveway, shall be separated by a planting strip.
(2) A single row of parking spaces located parallel to and between two
driveways, shall be separated from one of the driveways by a
planting strip, a minimum of eight feet wide.
(3) Large parking lots shall be divided into smaller parking areas of no
more than 40 stalls by planting strips.
§ 600-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-50
1:459
(4) No less than 20 feet of open area shall be provided between the
curbline of any parking area and the outside wall of the dwelling
unit.
E. Nonresidential parking lots.
(1) Parking lots with a capacity of from 41 to 100 cars shall require a
planting strip around the perimeter and an additional 10% planting
area(s) within the perimeter of the lot. Refer to Figure 600-4.15156
for an illustration of generalized locations and use of planting strips
and planting islands.
(2) Parking lots for more than 80 cars shall be divided into sections no
greater than 80 stalls each by planting strips.
(a) These planting strips shall be located parallel to the rows of
parking, to serve the following purposes:
[1] To separate main access (entrance-exit) driveways from
rows of parking spaces.
[2] To separate other major driveways (service drives, general
internal circulation) from rows of parking spaces.
[3] To separate large parking areas into smaller units at
intervals of not more than four rows of parking stalls.
(b) The ends of rows of parking shall be marked by planting
islands.
(c) For parking areas with an ultimate capacity greater than 400
cars, the requirements may be modified by Borough Council to
provide separation into units at intervals of six rows of parking
stalls, with each unit capacity no greater than 100 cars.
(d) The applicant may request the Borough to permit an
alternative design which achieves the purposes of these
parking area requirements as well or better than the
requirements herein. The final decision to permit an
alternative design shall be made by Borough Council, with the
advice of the Borough Planning Commission and Engineer.
(3) Shared access. When required by Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Borough Planning Commission, applicants
should create agreements for shared vehicular access as the
preferred means of reducing the total number of curb cuts, for
traffic safety and congestion reasons. Figure 600-4.16157 illustrates
one generalized example of this concept.

(a) Nonresidential lots shall provide cross-access easements for
parking areas and access driveways guaranteeing access to
adjacent lots. Interconnections shall be logically placed and
easily identifiable to ensure convenient traffic flow.
(b) When two or more abutting lots share an access driveway, the
driveway should be designed as the main access to those lots,
and one or more existing access driveway should then be
closed.
(c) Where development of three or more adjoining parcels
consolidates vehicular access into one shared driveway, that
driveway may be upgraded into a medium volume driveway
according to PennDOT standards.
(d) Shared access may be located entirely on one lot or be split
among a common lot line.
(e) Access easement and maintenance agreements or other
suitable legal mechanisms shall be provided, acceptable to
Borough Council in consultation with the Borough Solicitor.
(f) Liability safeguards for all property owners and lessees served
by the shared access shall be guaranteed to the satisfaction of
Borough Council in consultation with the Borough Solicitor.
F. Driveways within sites proposed for nonresidential development.
(1) The following requirements apply to all driveways within all sites
proposed for land development.
(a) A smooth transition shall be provided between the driveway
section required for access to a public street and the
driveway(s) required for internal site circulation.
(b) Main access driveways (entrance-exit), and service driveways
handling large trucks shall be a minimum paved width of 30
feet, with one lane in each direction, unless otherwise required
by PennDOT standards governing the volume of traffic
anticipated.
(c) Access driveways for cars and other small vehicles which are
clearly secondary in importance may be reduced to 20 feet in
paved width, unless otherwise required by PennDOT standards
governing the volume of traffic anticipated.
(d) Interior storefront driveways in shopping centers shall be a
minimum paved width of 28 feet, to allow one lane in each
direction and a dropoff/pickup lane along the sidewalks.
(e) Driveways along other nonresidential buildings shall be a
minimum paved width of 22 feet, except where a dropoff/
pickup lane is proposed.

§ 600-51. Curbing.
Curbing shall be installed along all existing and proposed public and private
streets, common driveways, and common parking areas.
§ 600-52. Survey monuments.
(f) Parking aisles shall be a minimum 22 feet wide with two-way
traffic flow for convenience and efficiency.
(2) Wherever feasible, internal circulation driveways shall extend from
access drives in locations which permit and encourage entering
traffic to turn and enter the parking aisles without first traveling
along a building-front driveway. This feature is intended to reduce
the volume of vehicular traffic along building-front driveway to
make it safer for pedestrian traffic.
A. General.
(1) Regardless of small size of a land development or subdivision
proposal, curbs shall be required along all existing and proposed
public streets within the right-of-way, private streets, common
driveways, and common parking areas.
(2) When utilizing an approved stormwater management technique,
Borough Council may waive curbing requirements in full or
partially. Grass swales and infiltration trenches along streets are
encouraged in appropriate locations in the Borough provided that
pedestrian safety and traffic circulation is addressed.
(3) If for any reason an interim waiver of these requirements is made, a
sufficient guaranty shall be posted for the eventual installation of
sidewalks, subject to approval by Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Borough Engineer and Solicitor, in
accordance with § 600-62 of this chapter.
(4) Curb construction. All curbing shall be constructed both as to
materials and methods, generally in conformance with applicable
portions of PennDOT Specifications Publication 408, current
edition. Curbs shall be vertical profile with a minimum of eighteeninch
structure height. Expansion joints shall be placed every 30
feet, at structures and at the end of the day's work. Concrete curb
shall have contraction joints shall be saw cut every 10 feet at a
minimum of two inches. Concrete shall be a minimum 3,000 psi in
compression strength.
(5) Intersections where sidewalks are provided shall be provided with
depressions for wheel chair use at each corner, and opposite each
corner on "T" intersections.
A. Permanent monuments shall be indicated on the record plan. All
monuments shall be constructed of precast concrete or durable stone
§ 600-50 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-52
1:462
with metal insert(s), and be four inches square with at least 36 inches
extending below ground level, or an alternate design approved by
Borough Council. Street right-of-way reference monuments shall be
located on the right-of-way lines at corners, angle points, beginning
and end of curves, and as otherwise required by the Borough Engineer
for all new and existing streets. They shall be placed after a new
street and/or lot grading has been completed. Certified copies of this
reference information shall be given to both the Borough Engineer and
the Borough Office. When final lot grading has been completed and
before the issuance of occupancy permits, permanent monuments shall
be set by the subdivider, developer, or builder, at all lot corners and
angle points, and at all street intersections and intermediate points as
may be required. Security in may be required by the Borough at the
time of plan approval if the monuments have not already been set.
B. Lot pin requirements. All lots upon which construction is planned shall
be temporarily staked or pinned, or permanently monumented and
certified to such by a registered surveyor for the owner, subdivider,
builder, or developer, before issuance of a building permit. A signed
certificate of compliance must be submitted with a building permit
application. Temporary stakes or pins with a surveyor's ribbon attached
may be acceptable on existing lots where construction of an accessory
building or an addition to the primary structure is proposed, only if
construction is begun within 30 days of the certificate of compliance
date. Temporary stakes or pins shall remain in place until witnessed
and accepted by the Borough Building Inspector. Prior to final approval
of a new subdivision plan, all new lot corner markers shall be marked
with a minimum 5/8 inch diameter metal pin extending at least 24
inches into the ground and at least one inch revealed above the ground
surface, or an equivalent metal marker, approved by the Borough
Engineer. Upon completion of construction and final grading, pins shall
be replaced with permanent monuments as described in § 600-52A.
C. Original monuments. In situations where they may be of legal or
historical importance, the original monuments and marks must not be
destroyed, defaced, hidden, or possibly confused by creating new
monuments and marks unless absolutely necessary, e.g., the originals
are decayed, destroyed, or unsafe. In some cases, to be determined by
the Borough Engineer, new monuments should be set as a reference or
witness to the original monument to avoid disturbing the original. When
in the opinion of the Borough Engineer, the angle point falls in a
location that is not appropriate to set a concrete monument, a written
request for a waiver shall be submitted for consideration by Borough
Council.
D. Bench marks. The Borough elevations are based on the USGS Datum.
Location and elevation is available to all engineers and surveyors upon
request to the Borough Engineer's office. All contours and elevations
shown on the plan must be based on this system.

(1) Applicants shall submit a landscaping plan as part of the
preliminary plan submission for all subdivisions and land
developments, except for residential subdivisions of three lots or
less. The landscaping plan shall be prepared by a certified planting
professional (landscape architect, nurseryman, arborist,
horticulturist, or urban forester). Borough Council may seek the
advice of a certified planting professional regarding compliance
with the ordinance standards.
(2) For residential subdivisions of no more than three lots, a formal
landscaping plan is not required, but the applicant's plans shall be
required to show compliance with the applicable planting
requirements herein.
B. Buffers and screens. Buffer plantings shall be installed in subdivisions
and land developments to integrate new developments with
surroundings, to separate incompatible land uses by providing
screening, and to minimize or eliminate views to certain site elements.
(1) Buffer plantings shall be required for the following types of
development and as otherwise specified in the Zoning
Ordinance:158
(a) All nonresidential development.
(b) All single-family detached development over five units.
(c) All residential infill development.
(d) All multifamily and single-family attached development.
(e) Construction of any of the following items which exceeds 2,500
square feet in ground coverage:
[1] Public utility facilities or structures.
[2] Waste collection, storage and/or treatment facilities.
[3] Any other structure of similar character or impact.
(2) An on-site investigation by the applicant shall determine the
adjacent land uses along each property boundary. In the case of
vacant land, the permitted zoning uses shall be used. The existing
or zoned uses shall be noted on the plan. In the case of several
permitted uses on a site, the most restrictive landscaping
requirements shall apply. The Borough shall have final approval of
interpretation of land uses or Zoning Map.

(3) Buffer area location and dimensions.
(a) A buffer planting area of not less than 10 feet in width shall be
established along all property lines and external street
boundaries of the site proposed for subdivision or land
development, unless otherwise specified in the Zoning
Ordinance.159
(b) Unless otherwise specified in the Zoning Ordinance,160 the
buffer area may be included within the front, side, or rear yard
setback.
(c) The buffer area shall be a continuous pervious planting area
consisting of tall canopy trees, small understory trees, and
shrubs, with grass or ground cover. No paving shall be
permitted within the buffer areas except for driveway
crossings and/or walkways.
(d) Parking is not permitted in the buffer area unless a shared
parking and/or access arrangement exists.
(e) Stormwater management facilities are permitted in the buffer
area provided that the visual screening requirement of the
buffer is still met.

in § 600-23.
(4) The minimum planting requirements shall be determined by the
intensity of the proposed land use and the adjacent land use, vacant
land, or zoning district, according to Figure 600-4.17.161
(a) Screening buffers must be adequate to visually screen the
proposed land use or development from off-site view. Several
different planting options could be used to create an effective
buffer. Grading treatments and architectural features, such as
walls, fences, and/or naturally undulating berms may be
necessary in addition to the minimum planting quantities in
order to effectively provide visual screen. The sufficiency of the
buffer shall be determined by Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Borough Planning Commission.
(b) The limited area buffer can be used in older developed areas
where space for planting is severely restricted. The planting
screen would be equivalent to an evergreen hedge planting.
Alternative planting arrangements, such as shade or flowering
trees with deciduous shrubs, could be considered in

planted with a filtering buffer as per Figure 600-4.18.174
(7) Whenever a parking lot abuts a primary arterial street, it shall be
screened by a four-foot-tall fence constructed of wood, vinyl
designed to look like wood, brick, stone, stucco over concrete block
(capped with brick, slate, or stone), or ornamental iron (or
ornamental aluminum, steel, or vinyl designed to look like iron) as
consistent with local character. This will be in addition to filtering
buffer requirements. The design shall require the approval of
Borough Council upon recommendation of the Borough Planning
Commission.
F. Stormwater basins and associated facilities. Landscaping shall be
required in and around all stormwater management basins according to
the following and as generally presented in Figure 600-4.23.175
(1) All areas of stormwater management basins, including basin floors,
side slopes, berms, impoundment structures, or other earth
structures, shall be planted with suitable vegetation such as
naturalized meadow plantings specifically suited for stormwater
basins and as recommended in Appendix 600-A.176 Landscape
designs for the basin should require minimal overall maintenance.
(a) Trees and shrubs shall be planted in and around stormwater
basins. A minimum planting of two trees and 10 shrubs per 100
linear feet of basin perimeter shall be planted in and around
the basin. No canopy trees shall be planted within 30 feet of an

function of the basin as determined by the Borough
Engineer.
(c) Mown turf grass is permitted only in the emergency spillway,
on top of berms, on outside face of berms, specified walking
paths within the basin, and access paths to allow maintenance
of inflow and outflow structures. Any other areas proposed for
turf grass requiring regular mowing should be approved by the
Borough Engineer.
[1] Areas of the naturalized basin containing lawn grass
(including top and outside berm) shall be sodded or
hydroseeded to minimize erosion during the establishment
period, and once established, these areas shall be
maintained at a height of not more than six inches.
(2) Once established a singular annual mowing of the meadow/
naturalized grass areas should be sufficient to maintain a wet
meadow and/or basin floor. A full description of basin maintenance
responsibilities should be included on the recorded subdivision
plan and a notation outlining the basin maintenance
responsibilities of the basin owner should be placed on the
property deed.
(3) Signage at basins to educate the public and/or designate the limits
of mowing is encouraged.

C. Maintenance.
(1) Required plant material shall be maintained for the life of the
project to achieve the required visual effect of the buffer or screen.
It shall be the ultimate responsibility of successive landowners to
insure that the required plantings are properly maintained. Dead or
diseased plant materials shall be removed or treated properly by
the landowner and replaced during the next growing season.
(2) All sight distances shall remain clear, and any plant materials that
could endanger safety such as unstable limbs shall be removed and
the plant materials shall be replaced if necessary. It shall be the
responsibility of all property owners to maintain all plantings and
architectural elements to insure a safe environment.
(3) Maintenance guidelines for the plantings should be developed by
the planting plan designer, to be used by grounds maintenance
personnel.
(4) The current landowner or developer shall replace any tree or shrub
that dies within 18 months of planting. Any tree or shrub that with
18 months of planting is deemed, in the opinion of Borough, not to

plants may be made with the approval of the Borough.
§ 600-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-55
1:471
§ 600-55. Stormwater management and drainage.
A. General provisions.
(1) Various forms of on-site stormwater control structures shall be
incorporated into the land development or subdivision in order to
retain or detain excess stormwater in accordance with the
standards below.
(2) Selected stormwater control devices should be compatible with the
site characteristics. Preference should be given to control systems
that provide water quality and ground water recharge benefits.
(3) When detention basins are provided, they shall be designed to
utilize the natural contours of the land whenever possible. When
such design is impracticable, the construction of the basin shall
utilize slopes as flat as possible to blend the structure into the
terrain.
(4) Prior to the granting of final approval of any subdivision or land
development plan, the Borough must be satisfied through
contractual arrangements that all stormwater facilities will be
properly maintained. If all, or a portion, of the facilities will be on
property which will be conveyed to an individual homeowners'
association or any other eventual owner, the guarantees must be in
such a form that they will carry through to the new owners.
(5) If the land of the proposed subdivision or land development will be
conveyed to two or more separate owners, the developer shall
provide written assurance and deed restrictions to the Borough
that the stormwater management structures will be properly
maintained, by the owners or if acceptable to the Borough, be
dedicated to the Borough, which shall then be responsible for
maintaining the stormwater management structures.
(6) Rainfall frequency data. The intensity of rainfall shall be
determined using the latest approved revision of the Rainfall
Duration Frequency Tables for Pennsylvania published by PADEP.
(7) Design storm. Peak discharge and runoff shall be computed based
on the twenty-four-hour Type II rainfall distribution for the two-,
five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year frequency
storm events. Overflow should have capacity for the one-hundredyear
storm.
(8) Maintenance of natural drainageways. All natural streams,
channels, swales, drainage systems and/or areas of surface water
concentration shall be maintained in their existing condition unless
an alteration is approved by the Borough or an official
representative thereof. All encroachment activities shall comply
with the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105, Water
Obstructions and Encroachments, rules and regulations of PADEP.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55
1:472
Staged discharge or water surface profile studies for the design
storm may be required to establish high water elevations.
(9) Easements and dedication. Where stormwater or surface water will
be gathered within the subdivision or land development and
discharged or drained in volume over lands within or beyond the
boundaries of the subdivision or land development, the subdivider,
developer, or builder, shall reserve or obtain easements over all
lands affected. The easements shall be adequate for such discharge
or drainage and for carrying off of such water and for the
maintenance, repair, and reconstruction of the same, including the
right of passage over, including vehicles, machinery, and other
equipment for such purposes, and which shall be of sufficient width
for such passage and work. The subdivider, developer, or builder,
shall convey, at no cost to the Borough easements to the Borough
on demand, at the completion and stabilization of all
improvements.
(10) Storm drainage directed into an adjacent municipality. When storm
drainage will be directed into an adjacent municipality, all
provisions for accommodating such storm drainage shall be
submitted to the governing body of that municipality for review.
(11) Concentration of stormwater runoff. Stormwater runoff shall not be
concentrated nor shall natural drainage water be diverted as to
overload or further overload as the case may be, existing drainage
systems, create flooding, or create the need for additional drainage
structures on other private or public lands, unless adequate
provisions approved by the Borough and the owners of the other
affected private or public lands are made for taking care of these
conditions.
(12) Discharge of roof runoff. Stormwater runoff from roofs shall not be
discharged into the street right-of-way without approval by the
Borough upon review by the Borough Engineer, nor concentrated
onto adjacent properties. It shall be returned to sheet flow or
discharge into an infiltration structure adequately designed and
approved by the Borough. However, for commercial or industrial
land developments alternate methods may be used when approved
by the Borough.
(13) Blocks and lots. Blocks and lots shall be graded to secure proper
drainage away from buildings and to allow the collection of
stormwater in catch basins. Minimum 2% slopes away from
structures shall be required.
(14) Uphill lands. Consideration shall be given to the present use of
lands uphill from the proposed development. The storm drainage
system and storage system shall be sized to provide for the
tributary watershed within the subdivision or land development
and the tributary watershed outside the subdivision, land
§ 600-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-55
1:473
development, or land disturbance. The Borough shall require the
developer of the uphill lands to maintain a zero increase in runoff.
(15) Drainage area. In large drainage areas the designer shall break up
the area into small areas to calculate the runoff.
(16) Methods of stormwater runoff detention and control. The following
is a listing of detention and control methods which may be utilized
in stormwater management systems, if appropriate. The choice of
control techniques is not limited to those appearing on the list.
(a) Detention Basins.
(b) Porous pavement and concrete lattice block surfaces.
(c) Grassed channels and vegetated strips.
(d) Routed flow over grass.
(e) Decreased impervious area coverage.
(f) Recharge beds.
(g) Rooftop gardens or green roofs.
(h) Cisterns.
(i) The use of other control methods which meet the criteria in
this section will be permitted when approved by Borough
Council upon review by the Borough Engineer. Various
combinations of methods should be tailored to suit the
particular requirements of the type of development and
topographic features of the project area.
(17) Correction of existing stormwater problems. The design and
philosophy of any stormwater management shall consider
corrective measures to existing stormwater problems that are
created in whole or in part by the developer's land, or that would
impact the end users of the development.
(18) Unnatural drainage. Wherever construction stops or concentrates
the natural flow of storm drainage in such a way to affect adjoining
properties, approval of the owners shall be obtained in writing and
a copy filed with the Borough. Approval of plans by the Borough
does not authorize or sanction drainage affecting adjoining
properties.
(19) Drainage from nonnatural sources. Water originating from other
than natural sources, such as air conditioning units, sump pumps,
or other dry weather flow, wherever practicable, shall be
discharged into natural watercourses on the property. The
discharge of water under the sidewalk through the curb into the
gutter, is prohibited.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55
1:474
B. Stormwater runoff computations.
(1) Method of stormwater runoff computations. The stormwater
analysis shall be accomplished using the latest edition of the Soil
Cover Complex Method, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds:
Technical Release No. 55 as published by the United States Natural
Resources Conservation Service) as a basis unless other methods
are reviewed by the Borough Engineer and approved by the
Borough prior to submittal. Use of the Rational Method will only be
permitted for drainage areas less than 2.5 acres in size.
(a) In some instances for small drainage areas, the Borough
Engineer may recommend and the Borough approve use of the
Rational Method as outlined in the Erosion and Sediment
Pollution Control Program Manual published by PADEP.
(b) All computations performed using an approved alternate
method shall comply with the intent of this chapter.
(2) Runoff curve numbers (CN values). All predevelopment, land
disturbance, and postdevelopment runoff computations shall be
performed using the runoff curve numbers (CN) for the ground
covers as specified below. The use of other (CN) values must be
fully justified to the Borough Engineer prior to plan approval. The
following subsections use the terms "cultivated agricultural,"
"other agricultural," and "urban." These terms pertain to the
phraseology used in TR-55.
(3) Predevelopment computations.
(a) Lands within the subdivision or land development and part of
the same watershed:
[1] Cultivated agricultural ground covers shall be considered
contoured and terraced with crop residue and in good
condition C & T + CR).
[2] Urban and other agricultural ground covers (woods,
meadow, brush, etc.) shall be considered as their existing
condition.
(b) Ground covers for lands uphill of the subdivision of land
development and part of the same watershed shall be
considered as their existing condition (urban, cultivated
agricultural, and other agricultural).
(4) Postdevelopment computations.
(a) Lands within the subdivision or land development and part of
the same watershed:
§ 600-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-55
1:475
[1] Ground covers shall be evaluated as the proposed
conditions for all areas within the boundaries of the
subdivision or land development.
[2] Ground covers shall be considered as existing condition or
at best as contoured row crops with crop residue present
for areas which will continue to be considered cultivated
agricultural.
[3] Ground covers shall be evaluated as existing condition for
all areas considered other agricultural (woods, meadows,
brush, etc.).
(b) Lands uphill from the subdivision or land development and part
of the same watershed:
[1] Ground covers shall be considered as existing condition or
at best as contoured row crops with crop residue present
for areas considered cultivated agricultural.
[2] Ground covers shall be considered as existing for all other
conditions (urban and other agricultural).
(5) Land disturbance (During Construction) computations.
(a) Lands within the subdivision or land development and part of
the same watershed:
[1] Ground covers shall be evaluated in the disturbed
condition for all areas within the boundaries of the
regulated activity.
[2] Ground covers shall be evaluated as existing condition or
at best contoured row crops with crop residue present for
areas considered cultivated agricultural outside of the
boundaries of the subdivision or land development.
[3] Ground covers shall be evaluated in the existing condition
for all urban and other agricultural areas outside the
subdivision or land development boundary.
(b) Lands uphill of the subdivision or land development and part of
the same watershed shall be considered the same as shown
Subsection B(4)(b) of these standards.
(6) Comparison of discharges. Predevelopment discharges shall be
compared to land disturbance (during construction) and
postdevelopment discharges for individual drainage basins rather
than to the combined discharges for the overall tract. If the land
disturbance discharge and/or postdevelopment discharge is
greater than the respective predevelopment discharge for a given
drainage basin, a detention facility will be required and shall be
designed to detain the greater discharge.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55
1:476
C. Design.
(1) Runoff calculations. Stormwater runoff calculations shall be
computed for the following conditions as specified in Subsection B
of these standards and submitted for the Borough to review.
(a) Predevelopment.
(b) Postdevelopment.
(c) Land disturbance activities.
(2) Design of storm drainage systems.
(a) Existing storm sewer accessibility. Where existing storm
sewers are reasonably accessible and of adequate capacity,
subdivisions and land developments shall connect to the
existing storm sewers.
(b) Existing water bodies or watercourses. Where a subdivision or
land development is traversed by or contains a pond, lake,
watercourse, drainageway, channel, storm drainage system, or
stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement that
conforms substantially with the line of such pond, lake,
watercourse, drainage way, channel, storm drainage system, or
stream of such width as will be adequate to preserve the
unimpeded flow of drainage (one-hundred-year flow) and to
provide for widening, deepening, relocating, improving, or
protecting such features or drainage facilities. Minimum
easement width shall be 10 feet from each side of the
watercourse, water body, stream, pond, or lake, but the
Borough may require wider easements when necessary. When
required by the Borough, bearings and distances shall be
provided for the boundaries of easements. Any changes in an
existing drainageway shall be subject to the approval of PADEP,
the Army Corps of Engineers, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency when each or all have jurisdiction.
(c) The subdivider/developer shall properly grade and seed slopes,
and fence open ditches when a safety hazard can result. Areas
within easements shall be kept so as to allow maintenance and
entrance.
(d) Drainage easements. Drainage easements shall be provided to
accommodate all storm drainage requirements and shall be a
minimum of 30 feet in width. Storm sewers, as required, shall
be placed in the road right-of-way, parallel to the roadway and
shall be designed as a combination storm sewer and
underdrain. When located in undedicated land, they shall be
placed within an easement not less than 20 feet wide, as
approved by the Borough Engineer.

catch basins, bridges, inlets, and culverts shall be installed
and the land graded for adequate drainage as shown on
the grading plan submitted and approved with the final
plan. Construction of these facilities shall generally
conform with PennDOT Specifications Publication 408,
latest version. Storm drains and appurtenances shall be
required to be constructed by the subdivider to take
surface water from the bottom of vertical grades to lead
water away from springs, and to avoid excessive use of
cross gutters at street intersections and elsewhere.
[2] Manholes. Manholes shall be constructed at all changes in
horizontal or vertical alignment; shall be spaced not more
than 300 feet apart on pipe of 24 inches internal diameter
or less, and not more than 450 feet apart where larger
sizes are installed. Inlets may be substituted for manholes

may be required by the Borough upon review by the
Borough Engineer. Special care shall be used by the design
engineer to select the proper endwall to fit the condition.
[7] Drainage collected by a headwall or catch basin. In all
cases where drainage is collected by a headwall or catch
basin, where inlet or outlet control may govern, the pipe
shall be designed as a culvert. The allowable headwater
should be determined by the specific entrance conditions
and sound engineering judgement. The design of culverts
shall not create excessive headwater depths.
[8] Coefficient of roughness (n).
[a] A roughness (n) value of 0.012 shall be used for all
concrete pipe.
[b] Roughness (n) values for other materials should be
fully documented with manufacturer's other reliable

erosion within watercourses and at points of discharge
from storm drainage facilities through the use of proper
ground cover or riprap.
(f) Storm sewer pipe requirements. Storm sewers shall be
adequate for the anticipated runoff when the area is fully
developed as permitted by zoning, and capable of carrying the
design storm as specified in this section.
[1] Storm drainage pipe materials. All storm drainage pipes
shall be constructed in accordance with PennDOT Section
408 road construction standards.
[2] They shall have a minimum internal diameter of 15 inches
and a minimum grade of 0.5% (2 of 1%) unless otherwise

bends, restrictions, manholes, etc. and erosion
potential at pipe outlets. The pipe manufacturer's
suggested maximum velocity, if any, shall also be
considered in the pipe design.
(g) Open channels (swales).
[1] Drainage swales. Drainage swales should be incorporated
into the land development or subdivision to convey
concentrated stormwater flows away from streets and
structures and toward stormwater control devices, storm
sewers, or water bodies. Because of their critical nature,
the design of all vegetated channels shall, at a minimum,
conform to the design procedures outlined in the
Pennsylvania Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control
Handbook.
[2] Drainage swale crossings. When drainage swales are
transversed by driveways or other crossings, design and

consideration shall be given to the effects the crossing has
on the flow of stormwater through the swale.
[3] Open channels shall be designed in accordance with good
engineering practices, using published design procedures.
[4] Open channels within street right-of-way shall be of the
parabolic type not exceeding six feet in width and one foot
in depth.
[5] The velocity in open channels shall be limited to four feet
per second.
[6] Open channels within street rights-of-way shall be
designed to carry the design storm to a maximum of 10 cfs
with three inches of free board.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55

where curbing is to be installed. Stormwater conveyance
shall be via storm sewer in these cases.
[9] Open channels shall not be used to convey stormwater
within street rights-of-way on slopes exceeding 8%. In
these cases, storm sewer shall be used. Open channels
shall have a minimum slope of 1%, and shall be designed to
avoid ponding and standing water.
(h) Standards for drainage of streets.
[1] Discharge of surface water. All streets shall be designed as
to provide for the discharge of surface water from their
rights-of-way.

Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service Technical Release No. 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, latest approved revision. Other methods may be
used with approval from the Borough.
(e) Minimum standards for earth fill dams. Detention basins which
are designed as earth fill dams shall incorporate the following
minimum standards:
[1] Height. The height of the dam shall not exceed 15 feet,
unless approved by the Borough.
[2] Minimum top width. The minimum top width of dams up to
15 feet in height shall be equal to 3/4 of the dam height,
but in no case shall the top width be less than eight feet.
[3] The area of basins which have more than 50% of the
perimeter of its sides in slopes of greater than 10% or
basins that retain stormwater for more than 24 hours shall
not be included in the open space required.

[6] Cutoff trench and core requirements. A cutoff trench at
least four feet deep of compacted relatively impervious
material (Unified Soil Classification CL or ML) is required.
If the side slopes are three horizontal to one vertical or
flatter, only a key trench is required. The key trench shall
be at least two feet deep, or extend down to stable
subgrade, whichever is deeper. Minimum bottom widths
for the cutoff and key trench shall be four feet. Maximum
side slopes for the cutoff and key trenches shall be one
horizontal to one vertical.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55
1:484
[7] A compacted impervious core at least three feet wide at
the top, having a maximum side slope of one horizontal to
one vertical, shall extend for the full length of the
embankment, and the top elevation shall be set at the tenyear
design water surface elevation.
[8] Cutoff collars. All pipes and culverts through dams shall
have properly spaced concrete cutoff collars.
[9] Allowance for settlement. The emergency spillway and top
of berm shall be constructed at least six inches above the
design elevations to allow for settlement of the
embankment.

facilities are owned by a private entity (such as a homeowners'
association), such entity shall be responsible for maintenance. In
this case a legally binding agreement between the entity and the
Borough shall be made providing for maintenance of all permanent
control facilities, and allowing inspection by the Borough of all such
facilities deemed critical to the public welfare at any reasonable
time.
§ 600-55 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-55
1:488
§ 600-56. Water supply.
(2) Maintenance by individual lot owners. When any stormwater
management facility is located on an individual lot, and when
maintenance thereof is the responsibility of that landowner, a
description of the facility or systems and the terms of the required
maintenance shall be incorporated on a plat of the property. The
plat shall be recorded with the Montgomery County Recorder of
Deeds within 90 days following Borough approval. In addition, the
Borough may require as a condition of approval that any deed
conveying any interest in such lot contain language indicating that
the conveyance is subject to an express covenant by the grantee
that the grantee will maintain the stormwater management facility.
(3) Maintenance note. The following maintenance note shall be
lettered on the record plan for any stormwater management facility
maintained under Subsection F of these standards: "The Borough
shall have the right, but not the duty, to repair, replace or maintain

Commission or an application for such certificate, a cooperative
agreement, or a commitment or agreement to serve to area in question,
whichever is appropriate, shall be acceptable evidence.
B. Fire hydrants shall be located at accessible points throughout the
subdivision and shall be located according to the Borough Engineer. As
a general rule, hydrants should be located at each street intersection
and at intermediate points as recommended by the state Insurance
Services Office. Generally hydrant spacing may range from 350 to 600
feet depending upon the area being serviced. The type and methods of
construction to be employed in the installation of fire hydrants shall be
in accordance with current state and local regulations.
§ 600-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-56
1:489
§ 600-57. Wastewater disposal.
§ 600-58. Solid waste storage.
Central trash storage and recyclable storage areas shall be developed as
follows:
C. Public water supply facilities design. The design for public water supply
facilities shall be in accordance with PADEP Water Supply Manual.
A. Wastewater from a subdivision or land development must be disposed
of in an environmentally safe manner. All sanitary sewers shall be
installed and connected to the Municipal or Authority sanitary sewer
system following review of plans and approval by PADEP and the
Municipal Authority. In areas not presently served by central sanitary
sewers, appropriate sewage disposal must be provided in accordance
with the regulations of PADEP and in addition, the installation and
capping of sanitary sewer mains and house connections may be
required if studies by Borough Council indicate that extension of
sanitary sewers to serve the property subdivided appears probable or
necessary to protect public health. PADEP and the Montgomery County
Department of Health as may be appropriate shall approve the
wastewater disposal systems.
B. Wastewater facilities design standards.
(1) Sewage facilities. The type of sewage facilities developed for a
particular site shall be based upon the recommendations of the
Borough Sewage Facilities Plan developed in accordance with Act
537.
(2) Sewage facilities design. The design and installation of domestic
sewage facilities shall be done in accordance with the Pennsylvania
Domestic Wastewater Facilities Manual prepared by PADEP.
(3) On-site sewage facilities design. The design and installation of onlot
subsurface disposal systems shall be done in accordance with
25 Pa. Code Chapter 73, regulations and the Technical Manual for
Sewage Enforcement Officers and under direction and approval of
the Montgomery County Health Department.
(4) Community sewage facilities. Sewage disposal for more than one
lot on a shared basis, by means of community sewage facilities may
be permitted in compliance with PADEP regulations and Borough
Sewage Facilities Plan.
A. Design.
(1) All trash collection equipment should be placed within enclosures.
Enclosures should be at least large enough to adequately contain
all trash and recyclable material containers. Generally the sizing
and type of storage containers will depend upon the amount of
§ 600-56 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-58
1:490
§ 600-59. Traffic impact study.
trash and recyclables expected to be generated in the buildings
they service.
(2) Enclosures should be six feet high or at least one foot higher than
the proposed collection container.
(3) Enclosures should be made of durable material, including masonry
blocks or steel reinforced wood fencing. In most cases, garden type
fencing or landscaping is not durable enough.
(4) The entrance to the enclosure should be at least 10 feet wide to
accommodate front loading trucks. Gates placed on the entrance
should be durable and equipped with piston type bolts to secure
gates in both a closed and open position.
(5) The trash storage area should be placed on a concrete pad. The
dimensions of the pad are dependent on the number and size of
proposed containers. Ideally, the pad should extend six feet to 10
feet in front of where the proposed container is to be placed to
support the front wheels of the trash truck servicing the site. The
area above the container should be free of obstructions. Generally,
a fifteen-foot clearance above the storage area is sufficient.
B. Locations. In locating a trash storage area several objectives should be
balanced, including spatial demands, distance from source of trash
generation, setback from adjoining property, and access for disposal
trucks. Trash storage may be placed near building service entrances or
loading docks. In apartment or condominium complexes with
centralized waste storage, containers are may be located in an area
which is convenient to each grouping of 10 to 15 units. Spatial
consideration (i.e., loss of parking area or loading space) is important.
During the servicing of these containers (up to five minutes) it is
important that internal circulation at the site is not impeded. Trash
containers ideally should be within a building setback in a given zoning
district. At a minimum, they should be setback in accordance with
accessory structures.
C. Operations. Trash storage containers should be serviced at least once a
week. Recycling containers can be serviced at a less frequent interval.
If a dumpster contains food it should be serviced every three days. A
storage container should have tight fitting lids, secured at all times, and
be leak free. It should also be cleaned out at least two times a year.
A. Purpose. The traffic impact study will enable Collegeville Borough to
assess the impact of the proposed development on the transportation
system, both highways and public transportation, in the Borough.
Purpose of the impact study is to insure that proposed developments do
not adversely affect the transportation network and to identify any
traffic problems associated with access between the site and the
§ 600-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-59
1:491
existing transportation network. The study's purpose is also to
delineate solutions to potential problems and to present improvements
to be incorporated into the proposed development. The study shall
assist in the protection of air quality, conservation of energy and
encouragement of public transportation use.
B. A traffic impact study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic engineer
and/or transportation planner with previous traffic study experience.
Procedures and standards for a traffic impact study are as set forth
herein. Applicant may provide funds to the Borough to enable the
Borough to hire a traffic engineer of its choice to conduct the study, if
this procedure is deemed appropriate and approved by the Borough.
C. Applicability. A traffic impact study shall be submitted as part of all
subdivision, land development and conditional use applications for all
residential subdivisions of 20 lots or more and all commercial, office,
industrial, institutional or other uses requiring land development
approval. Borough Council, at its discretion, may require any other
subdivision or land development application to be accompanied by a
traffic impact study; provided, however, that Borough Council notify the
applicant within 60 days following Borough Council's first meeting to
consider the proposal. Such a notification shall specify the reason for
the requirement, citing the proposal's particular location or existing
problems or type of use. The Collegeville Borough Council, at its
discretion, may waive the requirement for a traffic impact study. If
required by Borough Council, the developer of a land development shall
provide emergency signal preemption for any traffic signals located
within or immediately adjacent to the development. An application
which requires a traffic impact study shall not be considered complete
until the traffic impact study is submitted to the Borough in accordance
with the provisions of this section.
D. Definitions.
ENGINEERING AND TRAFFIC STUDIES  Shall be prepared in
accordance with 67 Pa. Code Chapter 201, Engineering and Traffic
Studies.
LEVEL OF SERVICE  As described in the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual, indicates how well traffic moves on a particular highway
facility or through a specific intersection. There are six levels of
servicing ranging from "A" through "F." Level of Service "A" indicates
generally free movement. Level of Service "F" represents maximum
capacity of the facility. Level "F" indicates congestion. Level of Service
"C" is considered the design level of service, representing a stable
traffic flow and a relatively satisfactory travel speed.
MAJOR INTERSECTION  Any intersection where traffic generated
by the proposal will have significant impact on the operation of the
intersection and/or any other intersection involving an arterial road.
Where doubt exists, the traffic engineer shall seek guidance from
Borough Engineer prior to the submission of the traffic impact study.
§ 600-59 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-59
1:492
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION  Transportation service for the general
public provided by a common carrier of passengers generally on a
regular route basis, or a private operator offering service to the public.
QUEUE ANALYSIS  This procedure includes the average queue and
maximum queue of vehicles which will be observed in each traffic
stream and intersection approach, measured in both feet and vehicles.
Various statistical and/or computer models may be applied.
STUDY AREA  This area will extend approximately 1/2 mile along
the adjacent roadways in all directions from all access points or the
first major intersection along these roadways. Where doubt exists, the
traffic engineer shall seek guidance from the Borough Engineer prior to
the submission of the traffic impact study.
TRIP GENERATION RATES  The total count of trips to and from a
study site per unit of land use as measured by parameters such as
dwelling units, acres, etc.
VOLUME/CAPACITY ANALYSIS  This procedure compares the volume
of a roadway or intersection approach to its capacity (maximum number
of vehicles that can pass a given point during a given time period). The
procedures described in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual or latest
Highway Research Board Special Report 209 shall be followed.
WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLATION  This is a series
of warrants which detail the minimum traffic or pedestrian volumes or
other criteria necessary for the installation of a traffic signal. These
warrants are contained in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control
Devices for Streets and Highways, United States Department of
Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, 2003, as amended, or
the most recent version, whichever is later.
E. General requirements and standards. A traffic impact study shall
contain the following information:
(1) General site description. The site description shall include the size,
location, proposed land uses, construction staging and completion
date of the proposed subdivision or land development. If the
development is residential, types of dwelling units shall also be
included. A brief description of other major existing and proposed
developments within the study area shall be provided. The general
site description shall also include probable socioeconomic
characteristics of potential site users to the extent that they may
affect the transportation needs of the site (i.e., number of senior
citizens).
(2) Transportation facilities description. The description shall contain
a full documentation of the proposed internal and existing external
transportation system. This description shall include proposed
internal vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian circulation, all proposed
ingress and egress locations, all internal roadway widths and
rights-of-way, parking conditions, traffic channelization and any
§ 600-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-59
1:493
traffic signals or other intersection control devices at all
intersections within the site. The report shall describe the entire
external roadway system within the study area and include
discussion of existing design deficiencies and potential safety
hazards. Major intersections in the study area shall be identified
and sketched. All existing and proposed public transportation
services and facilities within a one-mile radius of the site shall also
be documented. Report shall include review and discussion of all
available accident reports within the study area during the prior
three years. All future highway improvements, including proposed
construction and traffic signalization, shall be noted. The four-year
regional transportation improvement program maintained by the
Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission and the PennDOT
twelve-year plan shall be used as a source of information when
determining if any future roadway improvements are scheduled for
the adjacent road network. Any proposed roadway improvements
due to proposed surrounding developments shall be recorded.
(3) Existing traffic conditions. Existing traffic conditions shall be
measured and documented for all roadways and intersections in
the study area. Existing traffic volumes for average daily traffic,
peak highway hour(s) traffic, and peak development generated
hour(s), and documentation shall be included in the report. Traffic
counts are to be performed from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and from
3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Traffic count data shall not be more than one
year old. Traffic counts shall be taken on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday of a nonholiday week. Traffic counts shall be taken during
the school year. Traffic counts shall be collected during average
volume conditions, during fair weather, and in consideration of any
construction activities or special events which may be taking place
in the area. Additional counts (conducted on a Saturday for a
commercial development or residential development in close
proximity to the commercial district or tourist attractions) may also
be required in some cases. The Borough Engineer shall make such
determinations. Traffic counts shall be submitted in electronic
format to the Borough. Roadway characteristics shall be described
and illustrated. Features to be addressed shall include lane
configurations, geometry, signal timing, traffic control devices,
posted speed limits, and sight distance limitations. Existing levels
of service shall be calculated for all intersections and turning
movements within the study area. This analysis will determine the
adequacy of the existing roadway system to adequately serve the
existing traffic demand. Roadways, intersections, or individual
movements experiencing levels of service below C, and/or volume/
capacity ratios greater than or equal to 1.0 shall be noted as
deficient. A volume/capacity analysis based upon existing volumes
shall be performed during the peak highway hour(s) and the peak
development generated hour(s) for all roadways and major
intersections in the study area. Levels of service shall be
determined for each location using the current edition of the
§ 600-59 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-59
1:494
Highway Capacity Manual methodology. All analysis must utilize
Highway Capacity Software, version 4.1e, or latest.
(4) Transportation impact of the development. Estimation of vehicular
trips to result from the proposal shall be completed for the average
daily peak highway hour(s) and peak development-generated
hour(s). Vehicular trip generation rates to be used for this
calculation shall be obtained from the manual, Trip Generation,
Seventh Edition, Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2003 (as
amended). These development-generated traffic volumes shall be
provided for the inbound and outbound traffic movements as
estimated, and the reference source(s) methodology followed shall
be documented. All turning movements shall be calculated. These
generated volumes shall be distributed to the study area and
assigned to the existing roadways and intersections throughout the
study area. Documentation of all assumptions used in the
distribution and assignment phase shall be provided. Traffic
volumes shall be assigned to individual access points. If school
crossings are to be used, pedestrian volumes shall be assigned to
each crossing. Any characteristics of the site that will cause
particular trip generation problems shall be noted.
(5) Analysis of transportation impact. The total future traffic demand
shall be calculated. This demand shall consist of the combination of
the existing traffic expanded to the completion year (using a
background growth rate for the area from PennDOT, Pennsylvania
Traffic Data, latest edition), the development-generated traffic, and
the traffic generated by other proposed developments in the study
area. A separate trip distribution figure shall be provided. A
second/volume capacity analysis shall be conducted using the
future conditions volumes without development. This analysis shall
be performed during the peak highway hour(s) and peak generated
hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the study area.
Level of service calculations shall be completed for all major
intersections. A third/volume capacity analysis shall be conducted
using the total future demand and the future roadway capacity. If
staging of the proposed development is anticipated, calculations
for each stage of completion shall be made. This analysis shall be
performed during the peak highway hour(s) and peak developmentgenerated
hour(s) for all roadways and major intersections in the
study area. Level of service calculations shall be completed for all
major intersections. It is usually at these locations that capacity is
most restricted. All access points and pedestrian crossings shall be
examined as to the feasibility of installing traffic signals. This
evaluation shall compare the projected traffic and pedestrian
volumes to the warrants for traffic signal installation.
(6) Sight distance analysis. Sight distance measurements shall be
performed at any proposed driveway and/or existing driveway to
determine sufficient sight distance to the left and right of the
§ 600-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-59
1:495
driveway. Sight distances shall be compared to the desirable sight
distance standards as specified in 67 Pa. Code Chapter 441, Access
to and Occupancy of Highways by Driveways and Local Roads,
January, 1992. Sight distance shall also be compared to PennDOT's
safe stopping sight distance (SSSD) requirements as specified in
A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, of the
American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials (AASHTO), Chapter III, Elements of Design, 1994.
(7) Auxiliary lane analysis. An auxiliary lane analysis shall be
completed utilizing Highway Research Record (HRR) 211. HRR 211
provides graphs based upon the speed of the roadway and the
percentage of left turns. Utilizing the future build with
development traffic volumes, points shall be plotted on the graphs.
Based on the plotted points it should be determined that the study
area intersections associated with the proposed developments do
or do not satisfy the left turn lane warrant. Right turn lane analysis
should be based upon the Access Management, Location and
Design Participant Notebook, Publication Number FHWAHI-
92-033, United States Department of Transportation, Federal
Highway Administration NHI Course Number 15255, October
1991. Deceleration lanes should be provided for all high volume
driveways. For low and medium volume driveways, the designer
should refer to the Colorado and Virginia DOT deceleration lane
warrants.
(8) Conclusions and recommended improvements. Levels of service for
all roadways and intersections shall be listed. All individual turning
movement of roadways and/or intersections showing a level of
service below "C" shall be considered deficient, and specific
recommendations for the elimination of these problems shall be
listed. This listing of recommended improvements shall include,
but not be limited to the following elements: internal circulation
design, site access location and design, external roadway and
intersection design/safety improvements, traffic signal installation
and operation, including signal timing, and transit design
improvements. All physical roadway improvements shall be shown
in sketches. Existing and/or future public transportation service
shall also be addressed. A listing of all actions to be undertaken to
increase present public transportation usage and improve service,
if applicable shall be included. The listing of recommended
improvements for both roadways and transit shall include, for each
improvement, the party responsible for the improvement, the cost
and funding of the improvement and the completion date for the
improvement. The study shall outline mitigation measures and
demonstrate any changes to the level of service achieved by these
measures. Any alternatives or suggested phasing of improvements
shall be described. The mitigation measures may include
recommendations such as roadway widening, turning lanes,
deceleration lanes/tapers, changes to signalization, use of access
§ 600-59 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-59
1:496
management techniques, or a reduction in the proposed intensity
of the use. The responsibility and timing of all recommended
roadway improvements shall be described within the traffic impact
study.
F. Time of submission. The traffic impact study shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission with the preliminary plan submission. Revisions
to preliminary plans may constitute the need for resubmission of the
traffic impact study for the revised conditions. Improvement plans shall
not be submitted to PennDOT until after review by the Montgomery
County Planning Commission and Borough Council.
G. Implementation. Borough Council shall review the traffic impact study
to analyze its adequacy in solving any traffic problems that will occur
due to the land development or subdivision. Borough Council may
determine that certain improvements on and/or adjacent to the site and
within the study area are necessary requirements for land development
or subdivision plan approval and may attach these as conditions to the
approval. If Borough Council determines that such additional
improvements are necessary, the developer shall have the opportunity
to submit alternative improvement designs to obtain plan approval.
H. Emergency response organizations. The Borough shall submit all land
development plans proposing the construction of nonresidential
buildings or multifamily residential dwellings to the Fire Department,
Police Department and any other emergency response organization
having jurisdiction within the area of the proposed development for
review and comment.

ARTICLE V
Improvement Construction Requirements
§ 600-60. Applicability.
Before the final plan is signed and made ready for recording or prior to
the issuance of any permits needed for construction or occupancy of any
subdivision or land development, all applicants are required to complete
to the satisfaction of Borough Council all required public improvements in
manner set forth in this article.
§ 600-61. Completion or guarantee of required improvements.
No final plan shall be approved until the applicant has either:
A. Completed all of the improvements required by Borough Council for
final plan approval, in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
B. Provided a proper financial security for those improvements, as
required by this article, in compliance with the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., to cover the
estimated costs for completion of those improvements.
(1) The work completed or guaranteed shall be in strict accordance
with the approved plans and the requirements of this chapter.
(2) No lot in a subdivision may be sold, and no permit to erect, alter, or
repair any building upon land in a subdivision or land development
will be issued unless and until a subdivision and/or land
development plan has been approved, and where required,
recorded, and until the required improvements in connection
therewith have either been completed or guaranteed for
completion as required herein.
(3) The applicant shall also guarantee that no lot will be sold or
building constructed in any floodplain area except in compliance
with the floodplain management requirements of this chapter, the
Zoning Ordinance, and the Building Code.178
(4) Deferral or waiver of required improvements. Borough Council may
defer or waive at the time of final plan approval, subject to
appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all required
improvements, as in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests
of public health, safety and welfare, or which are inappropriate due
to the inadequacy or nonexistence of connecting facilities. A
separate public improvement agreement may be executed by
Borough Council guaranteeing completion of any deferred
improvement.
178. Editor's Note: See Ch. 680, Zoning, and Ch. 270, Uniform Construction Codes,
respectively.
§ 600-60 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 600-62
1:499
§ 600-62. Financial security.
A. In lieu of the completion of improvements required for final plan
approval, financial security, in an amount required, shall be guaranteed
to the Borough in compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq. Such
financial security shall assure the complete installation of all the
required improvements to be completed on or before the date fixed in
the plan approval, subdivision agreement, and/or development
agreement for completion of such improvements.
B. The amount of such security to be posted for the completion of required
improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion
estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by
the developer. Annually, the Borough may adjust the amount of the
required financial security by comparing the actual cost of
improvements which have been completed and the estimated cost for
the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of
the ninetieth day after the original scheduled date for completion or a
rescheduled completion date.
C. In determining the cost of the completion of improvements for setting
the amount of financial security required in § 600-62, such cost shall be
based upon an estimate of the cost of completion of required
improvements submitted by the applicant or developer, and prepared
by a professional engineer and certified to be fair and reasonable. The
Borough under recommendation of the Borough Engineer may refuse to
accept the estimate for good reasons provided to the applicant. If the
applicant or developer and the Borough are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by
another professional engineer which is mutually chosen by the Borough
and the applicant. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall be
presumed to be fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate.
D. When requested by the applicant in order to facilitate financing,
Borough Council shall furnish the applicant with a signed copy of a
resolution indicating approval of the final plan contingent upon the
applicant obtaining a satisfactory financial security. Final plans will not
be signed or recorded until the financial improvements agreement is
executed. The resolution of contingent approval shall expire and be
deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within 90 days, unless a written extension is granted by
Borough Council.
E. The Borough at its option, may accept financial security in cash in the
form of an irrevocable letter of credit, escrow account or surety bond
with a bonding company or commonwealth or federal chartered lending
institution chosen by the party posting financial security provided said
institution or company is authorized to conduct such business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
§ 600-62 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 600-63
1:500
§ 600-63. Release from liability.
Borough Council may release all or parts of the posted financial security
as completion of improvements proceeds, in compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.
§ 10101 et seq.
A. Partial release of security. As the work of the installation of the required
public improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security
may request the Borough to release or authorize the release, from time
to time, such portions of the financial security necessary for the
payment of the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any
such request shall be done in writing addressed to the Borough. Upon
receipt of the request for release of a portion of the improvement
security, the Borough shall within 45 days allow the Borough Engineer
to certify, in writing, that such portion of the public improvements has
been completed in accordance with the approved plan at which time the
Borough shall authorize the release to the applicant or his designee by
the bond company or lending institution of an amount of funds that the
Borough Engineer feels fairly represents the value of the work
completed. If the Borough fails to act upon a request for release of
security within 45 days, the Borough shall be deemed to have approved
the full release of security as requested.
B. Incomplete improvements. If the required improvements are not
completely installed within the period fixed or extended by Borough
Council, Borough Council may:
(1) Declare the financial security in default and require that all
improvements be installed regardless of the of the extent of the
building development at the time the agreement is declared in
default.
(2) Suspend final plan approval until the development improvements
are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose
of public notice.
(3) Obtain funds under the security and complete improvements.
(4) Assign the right to receive funds under the security to any third
party, including a subsequent owner of the property wherein
improvements were not completed in exchange for that subsequent
owner's promise to complete improvements.
(5) Exercise any other available rights under the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
C. Postcompletion security. The applicant shall be responsible for
maintenance of all improvements until they are offered for dedication
and accepted by the Borough. Fifteen percent of the financial security
may be held back to ensure that the public improvements are
maintained until they are dedicated.

Certain improvements beyond the geographical boundaries of a site to
be subdivided and/or developed, including but not limited to road
improvements, may be required to be constructed where it can clearly be
demonstrated that such improvements have been made necessary solely
through the additional burden imposed by the subdivision and/or
development of the site. All such improvements or contributions for future
off-site improvements shall be considered voluntary and will not be
refunded to the developer. The developer may also be requested to cover
certain costs which must be incurred by the Borough or other governmental
jurisdiction in order to make these improvements feasible. The legal and
financial arrangements to cover costs of the off-site improvements shall be
the same as those prescribed in § 600-62.

have authority to place on any vehicle parked in violation of any provision
of this article or of any other parking prohibition or restriction in force in

§ 648-3. Temporary outside storage of certain motor vehicles.
Whenever any motor vehicle, as referred to in § 648-2, is stored or parked
out of doors on private land, the owner or occupant of the land (unless that
storage or parking constitutes a trespass of which the owner or occupant
has no knowledge), or the owner, custodian or driver of the vehicle shall
promptly, but not later than 72 hours after the parking or storage is
discovered or occurs, notify the Police Department or any other duly
authorized and constituted representative of the Borough of that storage
and parking, giving the name and address of the owner or occupant of the
land and, if known, the name of the owner, or custodian of the vehicle or
A. The Vehicle Code192 contains adequate provisions on the subject of
"abandoned vehicles," defined as "a vehicle (other than a pedalcycle):
(i) that is inoperable and is left unattended on public property for more
than 48 hours; (ii) that has remained illegally on public property for a
period of more than 48 hours; (iii) without a valid registration plate or
certificate of inspection or title left unattended on or along a highway;
or (iv) that has remained on private property without the consent of the
owner or person in control of the property for more than 48 hours;" and
B. Sections 5-2001 through 5-2004193 of this Code of Ordinances deal
adequately with vehicles that are abandoned, discarded or junked on
private property; there is need for additional provisions on certain
motor vehicles stored out of doors on private property temporarily or
for repair. This article is intended to meet that need for additional
provisions to cover those situations mentioned in these findings that are
not covered by the Vehicle Code or Sections 5-2001 through 5-2004.
A. The term "motor vehicle" as used in this article shall apply to a motor
vehicle that is wrecked, damaged, dismantled or partially dismantled or

occupant of the land and the owner or occupant of the land or the owner,
custodian or driver of the motor vehicle, is not engaged in the business of

of the land or the owner, custodian or driver of the motor vehicle, as
the case may be, shall apply to the Police Department, or any other duly
authorized and constituted representative of the Borough, for a permit for
the outside storage or parking of the motor vehicles during the course of its

§ 648-5. Temporary outside storage for repair by person engaged in
business of automotive repair.
Where the owner or occupant of the property is engaged in the business
of automotive repair and a motor vehicle has been placed in the custody
of the owner of the property for storage, parking and/or repair, the owner
or occupant of the property shall apply to the Police Department or any
other duly authorized and constituted representative of the Borough for a
permit for the outside storage or parking of the vehicle while waiting or
during the course of its repair, that permit to be valid for a period of 60 days
from the date of the storage or parking; provided the owner or occupant
presents proof to the Police Department or any other duly authorized and
constituted representative of the Borough, that there is a bona fide contract
or agreement between himself and the owner or custodian of the vehicle
for the repair of that vehicle. Otherwise, the vehicle shall not remain stored
or parked out-of-doors after the expiration of 30 days from the date of the
storage or parking thereof as provided in § 648-3.
§ 648-6. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates or fails to conform with any provision of this article

§ 659-1. Introductory note.
§ 659-2. Application for water service; conditions for grant.
Any person, firm or corporation desiring to be supplied with water from the
Borough shall make application to the water superintendent according to
the form prescribed by Council. The superintendent of the water works and/
A. Beginning with Ordinance No. 51, when the Borough authorized
Horace L. Saylor, his successors, lessees or assigns, to construct and
operate a water system, the Borough encouraged establishment of
water systems through private enterprise. The Saylor Water Company
served customers on Third Avenue. Ordinance No. 54 (February 8,
1922) granted what was intended to be a more inclusive franchise to
Francis W. Wack and his assigns, which seems to have been nullified
automatically through failure of that grantee to have a system in
operation within two years of the date of final passage of the ordinance,
as provided in the ordinance. Then, in 1933, Ordinance No. 82 granted
a fifty-year water franchise to Louis J. Cota, his heirs, administrators or
assigns, again with a two-year completion date stipulated. By
Ordinance No. 87 (1/7/1936) the Borough: (a) repealed Ordinance No.
82 on the grounds that Cota had not started and completed the work
within the time stated in the ordinance; (b) prohibited the further grant
of water franchises by the Borough; and (c) declared the intention of
the Borough to unite with the Borough of Trappe in establishing a joint
waterworks system to serve both Boroughs. The joint system went into
effect soon afterward, and the first regulations were adopted by
Ordinance No. 89 (August 10, 1936).
B. The Collegeville-Trappe Joint Water System is governed by a joint water
committee composed of three members from each of the two Boroughs,
chosen by the respective Borough Councils from their own
membership. The Committee elects one of its members as joint
Chairman, and appoints the Water Superintendent and any other
needed employees, as well as a Secretary-Treasurer. The Committee
meets quarterly.
C. The joint system takes care of the waterworks property, including wells,
storage tanks and pumps.
D. Each member Borough, using money from its general fund, installs and
maintains locally within its own limits, determining in each case the
location and size of the mains. It further regulates use of the mains, by
ordinance. This chapter comprises the water regulations for
Collegeville.
E. Although the joint system pays the personnel and makes contracts,
social security and municipal retirement for the personnel is
administered through Collegeville, because of the social security
requirement that papers and documents must be signed by the proper
officials of one of the Boroughs.

development agreement is approved or a building permit is
requested, whichever first occurs.
B. In the event of subdivision, subsequent expansion of commercial,
industrial, residential, institutional or any other construction use, each
unit will be obligated to pay the before mentioned charge in proportion
to the number of EDUs subdivided or expanded. This capital
contribution charge shall include conversions of single-family homes
into two-family homes for each additional EDU, or fraction thereof,
where the property has been previously connected to the Collegeville-
Trappe Joint Water System. In case of commercial, industrial,
institutional or other nonresidential construction, or subsequent
expansion, the initial EDUs will be estimated based on information
provided by the commercial, industrial or institutional establishment
and as accepted by the Collegeville-Trappe Joint Water System's
engineer. At the end of a one-year period, or in subsequent annual
evaluation at the discretion of the Collegeville-Trappe Joint Water
System, the said system will review the commercial, industrial,
institutional or other nonresidential establishment and its water usage,
divide the water usage per quarter by the then current value of water
usage per EDU to determine the number of EDUs or fraction thereof.
Should the EDUs calculated by the above method be greater than the
anticipated EDUs paid at the time that the owner sought a building
permit, the commercial, industrial, institutional or other nonresidential
establishment shall pay the Borough the additional EDUs. That
payment will be within 30 days of the date of notice form the
Collegeville-Trappe Joint Water System to the property owner. If the
payment is not made, the Joint Water System may turn off the water
supply to the property owner until payment is received. In the event
that the EDUs calculated is less than the initial EDUs anticipated, no
reimbursement will be made.

that the proposed change is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and
intent of this chapter and Comprehensive Plan.
B. Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or
detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character of
the neighborhood and that the use of the adjacent property is
adequately safeguarded.
C. Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interests of the
Borough, the convenience of the community (where applicable), and the
public welfare.
D. Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical, efficient,
and economical extension of public services and facilities such as public
water, sewers, police and fire protection, and public schools.

probable effects upon highway traffic, and assure adequate access
arrangements in order to protect major roads from undue congestion
and hazard.
F. Be guided in its study, review, and recommendation by sound standards

1:634
§ 680-20. Specific standards for variances and special exceptions.
(but are not limited to) harmonious design of buildings, planting and

offensive or hazardous elements, and adequate standards of parking,
loading, and sanitation.
H. The Zoning Hearing Board shall be limited to consideration of
applications as they relate to ordinance provisions in effect at the time
of the application. The Borough Council shall retain the exclusive right
to enact and amend ordinances.
A. Variance. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that the provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship
upon the applicant. The Board may grant a variance provided that all of
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
and not the circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation at issue.
B. Special exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide
requests for special exceptions in accordance with the standards and
criteria found in the particular section of this chapter that permits
application for said special exception, and with the general standards in
§ 680-19 of this article.
C. Burden of proof. For variances, the burden of proof shall be on the
applicant. For special exceptions, the applicant shall be entitled to the
§ 680-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 680-20

special exception unless others can prove that it would adversely affect
the public health, safety, morals, or welfare.
A. Time limitations on appeals.
(1) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
(2) Appeals designed to secure reversal or limit the approval of any
application for development, preliminary or final, shall be filed with
the Board no later than 30 days after the application is approved by
an appropriate Borough officer or agency, unless the person filing
alleges and proves that he or she had not notice, knowledge, or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
succeeded to his or her interest after such approval, he or she shall
be bound by the knowledge of his or her predecessor in interest.
B. Effect of filing. When an appeal is filed, further development or official
action pursuant to the appealed determination or approval shall be
stayed until issuance of a final decision or findings by the Board. If the
Zoning Officer or other Borough agency presents facts to the Board
indicating that such a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, development or official action can only be stayed by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
C. Substantive validity challenge. A landowner who desires to challenge,
on substantive grounds, the validity of a map or ordinance provision
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
or she has an interest, may submit the challenge either to the Zoning
Hearing Board or, with a request for curative amendment, to the
Borough Council.
(1) The written application to the Zoning Hearing Board shall contain
the reasons for the challenge.
(2) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question, and shall specify the place and
time where a copy of the request and its accompanying materials
may be examined by the public.
(3) Based upon the testimony at the hearing(s), the Board shall
determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective,
as alleged. If the challenge is found to have merit, the decision of
the Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.
§ 680-20 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-21
1:636
§ 680-22. Expiration.
Unless otherwise specified by the Board, a special exception or variance
shall expire if the applicant fails to obtain any and all permits within six
months of the date of authorization thereof.
§ 680-23. Appeal to court.
Any persons aggrieved by the decision of the Board may within 30 days
thereafter appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County
in accordance with the provisions of the Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended.217
(4) In reaching its decision, the Board shall consider the plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner, and shall also
consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools, and other public service facilities.
(b) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(c) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed, by
the site's soils, slopes, woodland, wetlands, floodplains,
aquifers, natural resources, and other natural features.
(d) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodland, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources,
and other natural features, the degree to which these are
protected or destroyed, the tolerance of the resources to
development, and any adverse environmental impacts.
(e) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture
and other land uses which are essential to public health and
welfare.
(5) If the Board fails to act on the request within 45 days of the last
hearing, a denial of the request is deemed to have occurred.

B. Noise.
(1) Sound measurement procedures:
(a) Insofar as practicable, sound will be measured while the
source under investigation is operating at normal, routine
conditions and, as necessary, at other conditions, including,
but not limited to, design, maximum, and fluctuating rates.
(b) Prior to taking noise measurements, the investigator shall
explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any
other sound sources that could affect measurements to
establish the approximate location and character of the
principal sound source and to select suitable locations from
which to measure the sound from the source in question.
(c) When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained
for more than one second at a time, the SLM shall be set for Aweighting,
slow meter response speed, and the range (if the
SLM is designed to read levels over different ranges of SPLs)
shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to
the maximum end of the scale. When the measured sound level
is variable or fluctuating over a range greater than three dBA
using the slow meter response speed, the fast meter response
§ 680-54 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-54
1:662
speed shall be used. In either case, both the minimum and
maximum reading shall be recorded to indicate the range of
monitored values.
(d) The SLM shall be placed at a minimum height of three feet
above the ground or from any reflective surface. When hand
held, the microphone shall be held at arm's length and pointed
at the source at the angle recommended by the SLM
manufacturer.
(e) If extraneous sound sources, such as aircraft flyovers or
barking dogs, that are unrelated to the measurements increase
the monitored sound levels, the measurements should be
postponed until these extraneous sounds have become of such
a level not to increase the monitored sound levels of interest.
(2) Sound measurement procedures. No person shall cause, suffer,
allow, or permit the operation of any sound source on a private
property or any public space or right-of-way in such a manner as to
create a sound level that exceeds the background sound level by at
least 10 dBC during daytime (7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.) hours and by
at least five dBC during nighttime (9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.) hours
when measured at or within the property line of the receiving
property except as provided in Subsection B(1)(a).
(a) If the background sound level cannot be determined, the
absolute sound level limits set forth in Table 1 shall be used.
Residential
Commercial
or Industrial

Table 1 shall be reduced by five dBA.
(c) Nonrepetitive impulsive sound source shall not exceed 80 dBC
at or within a residential real property line using the fast meter
response speed.
(d) In multidwelling unit buildings, if the background sound level
cannot be determined, the daytime limit is 46 dBA and the
nighttime limit is 35 dBA for sounds originating in another
dwelling within the same building.

§ 680-71. Student homes. [Added 3-7-2007 by Ord. No. 526]
A. All student homes must register in conformity with Chapter X226 of the
Collegeville Borough Code.
B. Legislative intent of separation requirements. Certain uses in the
various zoning districts, while compatible with other lawful uses, can be
detrimental to the quiet use and enjoyment by others of their property if
concentrated in the same neighborhood. Borough Council has
determined that undue concentration can be avoided by mandating a
minimum distance of separation between these uses in residential
districts. Thus, the essential nature of the various districts can be
maintained while providing a broad level of inclusion for the variety of
uses that enrich our community.
C. No permitted use allowed conditioned upon compliance with this
subsection shall be located on a lot, any portion of which is closer to
another lot lawfully used for a permitted use allowed conditioned upon
compliance with this subsection than a distance determined by
multiplying by 15 times the required street frontage for a single-family
detached or, if permitted as a use, a single-family semidetached
dwelling in the district in which the use is located. This section shall be
construed to prevent an existing lawful use from being rendered
unlawful by the application hereof.

ARTICLE XXV
Floodplain Conservation District
[Amended 3-2-2016 by Ord. No. 578]
§ 680-191. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,238 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of Collegeville Borough does hereby order
as follows.
§ 680-192. General provisions.
A. Intent. The intent of this article is to:
(1) Protect areas of the floodplain necessary to contain floodwaters.
(2) Permit only those uses in the floodplain that are compatible with
preserving natural conditions and stream flow.
(3) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community
by preventing development in areas prone to flooding.
(4) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(5) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(6) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents, by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
(7) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
B. Applicability. The Floodplain Conservation District is defined and
established as a district applicable to those areas of the Borough
subject to inundation by the waters of the one-hundred-year flood as
delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania, as prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, dated March 2, 2016, and subsequent revisions
thereto. Said floodplain areas shall consist of the following specific
areas:
(1) Zones A and AE identified on the effective FIRM or identified after
the FIRM effective date through the letter of map revision (LOMR)
process.
238. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 680-191 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 680-192
1:775
(2) Soils with a frequency of flooding of 1% or greater per year, as
delineated by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, United
States Department of Agriculture Web-Based Soil Survey (available
online at http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/), including the
following soils:
(a) Bowmansville (Bo).
(b) Knauers (Bo).
(c) Gilbraltar (Gc).
(d) Hatboro (Ha).
(e) Rowland (Rt).
(f) Rowland (RwA).
(g) Rowland (RwB).
(h) Urban Land Occasionally Flooded (UIA).
(3) In lieu of the above, Collegeville Borough may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Borough.
(4) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be delineated according
to FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Collegeville
Borough, which is hereby made a part of this article, and additional
area based on soils as described in this article. The FIRM is
available for inspection at the Borough office.
(5) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be deemed an overlay on
any zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot.
(6) It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any
construction or development anywhere within Collegeville Borough
unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator.
(7) A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures.
C. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in the Floodplain
Conservation District. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
§ 680-192 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-192
1:776
§ 680-193. Definitions.
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions
of this article, the more restrictive shall apply.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the article, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain
Conservation District, or that land uses permitted within such
areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of Collegeville
Borough or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this article or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

§ 680-194. Identification of floodplain areas.
required in 44 CFR § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4),
or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
A. Identification.
(1) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be any areas of
Collegeville Borough classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2, 2016 and
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or
the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) The Floodplain Conservation District shall also include areas with
soils listed in this article, along with any community identified flood
hazard areas.
(3) The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments are hereby adopted by Collegeville
Borough and declared to be a part of this article.
B. Description and special requirements of the Floodplain Conservation
District. The Floodplain Conservation District shall consist of the
following specific areas/districts:
(1) The AE Floodway Area shall be those areas identified as floodway
within Zone AE on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS. The floodway represents the channel of a
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
(a) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice
that the proposed encroachment would not result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(b) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection regional office.
§ 680-193 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 680-194
1:783
(2) The AE Area shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood
elevations have been provided.
(a) No permit shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area/District without floodway
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development would not, together with all other
existing and anticipated development, increase the BFE than
one foot at any point.
(b) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless the appropriate permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection regional
office.
(3) The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no onepercent-
annual-chance flood elevations have been provided. For
these areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal,
state, or other acceptable source shall be used when available.
Where other acceptable information is not available, the elevation
shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the
boundary of the Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest
the construction site. In lieu of the above, the municipality may
require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic
and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review
by the municipality.
(4) Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where Collegeville Borough has identified local flood hazard or
ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a Local Flood Hazard
Map using best available topographic data and locally derived
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks, soils
or approximate study methodologies.
C. Changes in identification of area. The Floodplain Conservation District
may be revised or modified by Borough Council where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the
need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval
must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but
not later than six months after the date such information becomes
available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
§ 680-194 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-194
1:784
§ 680-195. Uses permitted in Floodplain Conservation District.
D. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
Collegeville Planning Commission and any party aggrieved by this
decision or determination may appeal to Borough Council. The burden
of proof shall be on the appellant.
E. Corporate boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in areas
where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are proposed
or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data
affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation
or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR
60.3.
A. Uses permitted by right. The following uses are permitted by right in
the Floodplain Conservation District in compliance with the
requirements of this section:

District. The following provisions shall apply whenever any
improvement is made to an existing structure located within any
Floodplain Conservation District:
§ 680-195 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-195
1:786
§ 680-196. Variances.
(1) No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be
allowed within any floodway area that would cause any increase in
the elevation of the base flood elevation.
(2) No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be
allowed within any AE Floodway Area, as defined in § 680-194B,
that would, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
(3) No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be
undertaken in the direction of the stream bank.
(4) Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement, of
any kind to an existing structure, to an extent or amount of 50% or

(a) That there is good and sufficient cause, including:
[1] That there are unique physical circumstances or
conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is
due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the
zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located.
[2] That because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be
developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
zoning ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
§ 680-196 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 680-196
1:789
§ 680-197. Technical provisions for granting a variance.
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
[3] That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by
the appellant.
[4] That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(b) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(c) That the granting of the variance will:
[1] Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense;
[2] Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances and regulations.
(5) A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
be maintained by Collegeville Borough. In addition, a report of all
variances granted during the year shall be included in the biennial
report to FEMA.
A. General. In granting any variance, Collegeville Borough shall attach the
following technical provisions to the proposal for which the variance
has been granted. These conditions and safeguards are necessary in
order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the residents of
the municipality.
(1) Pertaining to the alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(a) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall
be made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities

SSC Steep Slope Conservation District
§ 680-200. Declaration of legislative intent.
In expansion of the statement of community development objectives found
in Article I of this chapter, the specific intent of the Steep Slope
Conservation (SSC) District is to:
A. To combine with other zoning requirements, as an overlay, certain
restrictions for steep slope areas to promote the general health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of the Borough of Collegeville.
B. To prevent inappropriate development of steep slope areas, in order to
avoid potential dangers for human usage caused by erosion, stream
siltation, soil failure leading to structural collapse or damage, and/or
unsanitary conditions and associated hazards.
C. To minimize danger to public health and safety by promoting safe and
sanitary drainage.
D. To permit only those uses that are compatible with development of
steep slope areas in order to avoid accelerated erosion, soil failure,
accelerated seepage, or other conditions which may create a danger to
life and/or property.
E. To permit only those uses in steep slope areas that are compatible with
the preservation of existing natural features, including vegetative
cover, by restricting the grade of steep slope areas.
F. To promote the ecological balance among those natural system
elements (such as wildlife, vegetation, and aquatic life) that could be
adversely affected by inappropriate development of steep slope areas.
G. To prevent development that would cause excessive erosion and
siltation, and a resultant reduction in the water-carrying capacity of the
watercourses which flow through or around the Borough with the
consequences of increased flood crests and flood hazards within the
Borough and to both upriver and downriver municipalities.
H. To prevent landowners in the Borough and/or other municipalities from
the possible harmful effects of inappropriate grading and development
on steep slope areas.
I. To protect the entire Borough from inappropriate development on steep
slope areas, which could have an effect upon subsequent expenditures
for public works and disaster relief and, thus, adversely affect the
economic well-being of the Borough.
J. To promote the provision of safe and reliable accessways, parking areas
and utility systems serving developments on or around steep slope
areas, where most sensitive grading and siting is essential.

application, in which event, the provisions of this article shall apply to
such subdivision and land development. Development of land with slopes in
excess of 15% on lots in single and separate ownership after the effective
date of this article, which are not the subject of a subdivision or land
development application or the issuance of a granting permit on terms
determined by the Borough Engineer, are not affected by this chapter.
§ 680-208. Administration.
Administration of this article is governed by Article III of this chapter. In
addition, the following requirements shall apply:
E. Extractive uses and barrow pits, when permitted in the underlying

pools, unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Borough Council
that the proposal will be sound from architectural, engineering and
environmental perspectives, the proposal will have no adverse impacts
on the health, safety, and welfare of the community, and there are no
viable alternatives. If the applicant can so demonstrate, the use may be
permitted by conditional use (§ 680-205, above).
B. The filling or removal of topsoil except when related to an activity
related to an approved special exception use.
C. Solid waste disposal or recycling uses.
D. Junkyards or other outdoor storage uses.
A. Application procedures. Before a permit is issued for any construction
or land disturbance activity on land within or affecting the SSC District,
the following material, in full or in pertinent parts, shall be submitted
for review by the Borough:
§ 680-205 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 680-208
1:813
(1) An earthmoving plan of the property which indicates existing
grades with contour lines at two-foot intervals and proposed grades
within the area of any proposed activity, disturbance, or
construction. All areas of prohibitive and/or precautionary slope
shall be shaded accordingly.
(2) A site plan indicating existing and proposed structures, other
impervious surfaces, storm drainage facilities and retaining walls.
The site plan also shall locate and identify existing vegetation and
ground cover within areas of prohibitive and precautionary slopes,
as well as proposed landscaping material to be installed.
(3) Architectural plans, elevations, and sections.
(4) A statement, signed and sealed by a registered architect or
engineer, explaining the building methods to be used in overcoming
foundation and other structural problems created by slope
conditions, preserving the natural watersheds and preventing soil
erosion and excessive surface water runoff to neighboring
properties and/or streets.
(5) Plan, profile, and typical cross-section of any proposed street,
emergency access or driveway within areas of steep slopes, with
the seal of a registered professional engineer thereon.
(6) A statement, signed by the owner or future occupant at the time of
subdivision, land development or building permit application, that
there is a full understanding of any difficulties associated with
access stemming from steep slopes. No zoning permit shall be
issued by the Zoning Officer, and no conditional use shall be
granted by the Borough Council, without the Borough Engineer's
review of this material and his recommendations thereon.
B. Standards and criteria for review of conditional use applications. In
evaluating any application for conditional use within areas of steep
slopes, the Borough Council shall determine consistency of the proposal
with the following:
(1) Disturbance to particularly sensitive features on the site shall be
minimized; special emphasis in planning for the site should be
given to the protection of:
(a) The steepest areas of slope, i.e., those approaching 25%.
(b) Soils with seasonal high water table.
(c) Underlying geology which comprises, or contributes to, a
major groundwater resource, including the flow of existing
springs.
(2) Disturbance shall be minimized where the length or area of steep
slope, both on the site and on adjacent lands within 200 feet of the
slope, is extensive.
§ 680-208 COLLEGEVILLE CODE § 680-208
1:814
(3) The proposed development, any impervious ground cover and the
resultant disturbance to the land and existing vegetative cover will
not cause runoff and/or related environmental problems off the
site.
(4) Removal of, or disturbance to, existing vegetation on the site shall
be minimized. The proposed impacts on existing vegetation shall be
evaluated in terms of the potentially detrimental effects on slope
stability, transportation and recharge of stormwater, aesthetic and
traditional characters of the landscape, and existing drainage
patterns. Mitigation measures may be required by Borough Council
as it deems appropriate.
(5) Important visual qualities of the site shall, to the maximum extent
feasible, be retained; in addition to vegetation, these may include
hilltops/ridgelines, rock outcroppings and the natural terrain and
contours of the site.
(6) Road construction shall follow the natural topography, with cuts
and grading minimized.
(7) Innovative, imaginative building techniques that are well-situated
to slope conditions, shall be encouraged, consistent with other
applicable codes and regulations.
(8) The equilibrium of the slope, as characterized by the existing
interrelationships among the soil, water, and vegetation, shall be
disturbed as little as possible.
C. Uses and/or structures rendered nonconforming by the adoption of this
district. Following the adoption of this article, any use or structure
which is situated within the boundaries of the SSC District and which
does not conform to the permitted uses specified in §§ 680-204 and
680-205 of this article shall become a nonconforming use or structure,
regardless of its conformance to the district in which it is located
without consideration of this article. The expansion or continuance of
said nonconforming use or structure shall be governed by the
requirements of Article VII of this chapter. However, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall also ensure that the standards contained in
Subsection B of this section are applied to the expansion or continuance
of said nonconforming use or structure.
