Chapter 40. Personnel Policies
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Commissioners of the Township of North Versailles as indicated in
article histories. Amendments noted where applicable.]
Article I. Drug and Alcohol Policy
[Adopted 12-18-1995 by Ord. No. 943 (Ch. 1, Part 8, of the 1987 Code of Ordinances)]
§ 40-1. Applicability.
All employees of North Versailles Township who operate equipment for which the operator must
possess a CDL are covered by this article.
§ 40-2. Declaration of policy; conditions of employment.
It is declared to be the policy of North Versailles Township that drugs and alcohol will not be permitted
in the workplace, that all commercial drivers must be in full compliance with the UCDL Act and that
North Versailles employees will be governed by this article and the UCDL Act.[1]
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of illegal drugs or alcohol is
prohibited in the Township workplace.
Illegal drug usage, whether on or off the job, may adversely affect an employee's job performance
and jeopardize the safety of other employees and the general public. As such, it is just cause for
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Employees are not permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions within four hours after using
alcohol. Employees are not permitted to use alcohol during work hours. No driver shall use alcohol
for eight hours following an accident or until he or she undergoes a postaccident alcohol test,
whichever comes first.
If an employee reports to work in a condition giving a supervisor reasonable cause to suspect the
influence of alcohol or illegal drugs, the employee may be required to submit to blood or a breath
and urine drug test. If the tests reveal that the employee has an alcohol level greater than 0.04 or
has illegal drugs in his or her system, the employee may be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment. An employee with an alcohol level of 0.02 to 0.039 will not
be permitted to perform safety-sensitive functions for 24 hours.
When there is reasonable cause, vehicles, lockers and/or related personal areas may be searched
without prior notice to ensure a work environment free of alcohol and illegal drugs. Any employee
found to have illegal drugs in his or her vehicle, locker and/or related personal area will be subject
to immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
Any employee who may be undergoing medically prescribed treatment with a controlled substance
which may limit his or her ability to perform on the job must report this treatment to his or her
supervisor prior to beginning work. Failure to report as required by this subsection shall be cause
for disciplinary action.

It is a condition of continuing employment with the Township for an employee to notify the
Township if he or she is convicted under federal or state statute for the use, sale or distribution of
drugs. Such notification must occur within five days of conviction.
Editor's Note: The Uniform Commercial Drivers License Act (UCDL Act) is codified at 75 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 1601 et seq.
§ 40-3. Drug and alcohol testing circumstances.
The Township may, at its option, conduct drug testing for the following reasons: preemployment
testing, at random, with reasonable suspicion, post-accident, fitness for duty and follow-up to a positive
drug test. Alcohol will be tested for all the above circumstances.
Preemployment. Prior to employment, all applicants will be required to undergo drug screening.
Applicants who test positive will be denied employment. Failure to consent to this screen will be
considered as withdrawal of one's application for employment.
Random testing. To encourage year round avoidance of illegal drugs, and to be in compliance with
governmental regulations, Township will conduct random tests of CDL drivers at an annualized
rate of 50% for drugs and 25% for alcohol. Those to be tested will be selected at random, which
means that every driver, whether previously tested or not, has an equal chance to be tested every
time tests are conducted. Once an individual is notified of the test, he or she must go to the
collection site immediately.
Reasonable suspicion testing. May be conducted based upon, among other things:
Direct observation of drug use or possession and/or physical symptoms of being under the
influence of an illegal drug or alcohol.
A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior.
Arrest, indictment or conviction for a drug or alcohol related offense or identification of the
employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession, use or

rem lien may be entered against such property and a personal obligation against any person, and
shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are

said zones and provides for enforcement, assessment of violation penalties, an appeals process, and
judicial review.
§ 81-2. Relation to other zone districts.
The Airport District Overlay shall not modify the boundaries of any underlying zoning district. Where
identified, the Airport District Overlay shall impose certain requirements on land use and construction
in addition to those contained in the underlying zoning district.

§ 81-4. Establishment of airport zones.
There are hereby created and established certain zones within this chapter, defined in § 81-3 and
depicted on Figure 1[1] and illustrated on the Allegheny County Airport (AGC) Airspace Plan
(Drawings 6, 7, and 8 of 14 of the AGC Airport Master Plan, as amended), all hereby adopted as
part of this chapter, which include:
Approach Surface Zone.
Conical Surface Zone.

Editor's Note: Figure 1 is on file in the Township offices.
The North Versailles Township Zoning Map is hereby amended.
§ 81-5. Permit applications.
As regulated by Act 164[1] and defined by 14 CFR 77.13(a) (as amended or replaced), any person
who plans to erect a new structure, to add to an existing structure, or to erect and maintain any
object (natural or man-made), in the vicinity of the airport shall first notify the Department's Bureau
of Aviation (BOA) by submitting PENNDOT Form AV-57 to obtain an obstruction review of the
proposal at least 30 days prior to commencement thereof. The Department's BOA response must
be included with this permit application for it to be considered complete. If the Department's BOA
returns a determination of no penetration of airspace, the permit request should be considered in
compliance with the intent of this chapter. If the Department's BOA returns a determination of a
penetration of airspace, the permit shall be denied, and the project sponsor may seek a variance
from such regulations as outlined in § 81-6.
Editor's Note: See 74 Pa.C.S.A. § 5101 et seq.
No permit is required to make maintenance repairs to or to replace parts of existing structures

§ 81-6. Variances.
Any request for a variance shall include documentation in compliance with 14 CFR 77, Subpart B
(FAA Form 7460-1 as amended or replaced). Determinations of whether to grant a variance will
depend on the determinations made by the FAA and the Department's BOA as to the effect of the
proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable air
space. In particular, the request for a variance shall consider which of the following categories the
FAA has placed the proposed construction in:
No objection. The subject construction is determined to not exceed obstruction standards and
marking/lighting is not required to mitigate potential hazard. Under this determination, a
variance shall be granted.
Conditional determination. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to create some
level of encroachment into an airport hazard area which can be effectively mitigated. Under
this determination, a variance shall be granted contingent upon implementation of mitigating
measures as described in § 81-9, Obstruction marking and lighting.
Objectionable. The proposed construction/alteration is determined to be a hazard and is thus
objectionable. A variance shall be denied and the reasons for this determination shall be
outlined to the applicant.
Such requests for variances shall be granted where it is duly found that a literal application or
enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and that relief granted will not
be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the intent of this chapter.
§ 81-7. Use restrictions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use shall be made of land or water within the
Airport District Overlay in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or
radio communications between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between
airport lights and others, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards or
otherwise endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff or maneuvering of aircraft utilizing the
Allegheny County Airport.
§ 81-8. Preexisting nonconforming uses.
The regulations prescribed by this chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or
other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective
date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. No
nonconforming use shall be structurally altered or permitted to grow higher, so as to increase the
nonconformity, and a nonconforming use, once substantially abated (subject to the underlying Zoning
Ordinance),[1] may only be reestablished consistent with the provisions herein.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 300, Zoning.
§ 81-9. Obstruction marking and lighting.
Any permit or variance granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be conditioned according
to the process described in § 81-6 to require the owner of the structure or object of natural growth in
question to permit the municipality, at its own expense, or require the person requesting the permit or
variance, to install, operate, and maintain such marking or lighting as deemed necessary to assure
both ground and air safety.

§ 124-1. Findings; intent.
The Township Board of Commissioners finds that the Township is largely residential and that there are
significant numbers of families residing within the Township. The prevailing sense and attitude in the
Township is that nonemergency nocturnal and weekend outdoor work activity should be restricted or
reduced for the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the community.

It is further ordained that no contractor, builder, paver or other entity performing public work on behalf
of the Township shall conduct nonemergency outdoor work on Sundays unless given written
permission by the Township Code Enforcement Officer in advance of such work. The granting of such
permission shall be solely within the discretion of the Code Enforcement Officer, but the following
factors shall be utilized as guidelines:
The urgency of the need to complete the work;
The contractor's dependence on weather conditions in completing the work;
The nature of the work to be completed as related to its potential to disrupt and interfere with the
residents of the Township;

The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood
Plain Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt

citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the Township of North Versailles does hereby
order as follows.
Article II. General Provisions
§ 154-201. Intent.
The intent of this chapter is to:
Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
flood damage in the future.
Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and natural drainage.
Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental units, and its residents, by
preventing excessive development in areas subject to flooding.
Comply with federal and state floodplain management requirements.
§ 154-202. Applicability.
It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to
be undertaken, any construction or development anywhere within the Township of North Versailles
unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing buildings or structures.
§ 154-203. Abrogation and greater restrictions.
This chapter supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that
those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this
chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 154-204. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this chapter shall be declared
invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of the

are hereby declared to be severable.
§ 154-205. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods

or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

these regulations by another entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant
to the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code
of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR 59.22.
In the absence of a designated Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator duties are to

proposed work to be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of this and all other
applicable codes and ordinances.
Prior to the issuance of any permit, the Floodplain Administrator shall review the application for the
permit to determine if all other necessary government permits required by state and federal laws

537, as amended); the Pennsylvania Dam Safety and Encroachments Act (Act 1978-325, as
amended); the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Act (Act 1937-394, as amended);[1] and the U.S.

Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 750.1 et seq., 32 P.S. § 693.1 et seq., and 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.,

inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He/she
shall make as many inspections during and upon completion of the work as are necessary.

Article IV. Identification of Floodplain Areas
§ 154-401. Identification.
The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of North Versailles Township classified as special
flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated September 26, 2014, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision thereof, including all digital data
developed as part of the Flood Insurance Study.
The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions and amendments, are
hereby adopted by North Versailles Township and declared to be a part of this chapter.
§ 154-402. Description and special requirements of identified
floodplain areas.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
The Floodway Area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which
represent the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in
order to discharge the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more than one
foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those Special Flood Hazard Areas where no
floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
Within any floodway area, no new construction or development shall be allowed, unless the
appropriate permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional
Office.
The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided.

A.
The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been
provided and a floodway has been delineated.
The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA and for which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these areas,
elevation and floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable sources shall be
used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available, the base flood elevation
shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site.
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the municipality.
§ 154-403. Changes in identification of area.
The Identified Floodplain Area may be revised or modified by the Board of Commissioners where
studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision.
However, prior to any such change to the Special Flood Hazard Area, approval must be obtained from
FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes to the Special Flood
Hazard Area by submitting technical or scientific data. See § 154-501B for situations where FEMA
notification is required.
§ 154-404. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be
made by the Township of North Versailles and any party aggrieved by this decision or determination
may appeal to the Board of Commissioners. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 154-405. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are
proposed or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to
boundary changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to
annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
Article V. Technical Provisions
§ 154-501. General.
Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action have been notified by
the municipality, and until all required permits or approvals have first been obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.

No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be made to any watercourse
unless it can be shown that the activity will not reduce or impede the flood carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way.
In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development, shall be notified by the applicant prior to any alteration or relocation of any
watercourse.
When a community proposes to permit the following encroachments: any development that
causes a rise in the base flood elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in
Zones A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway, which will cause a rise of more than
one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or relocation of a stream (including but not limited
to installing culverts and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR Part 65.12):
Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to permitting the encroachments
to occur.
Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map change and prior to approving
the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased base flood elevations and/or
revised floodway reflecting the post-project condition.
Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community shall provide as-built
certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map revision upon receipt of such certifications in
accordance with 44 CFR Part 67.
Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within any identified floodplain area
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
§ 154-502. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.

Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (excluding basements) which will be used solely
for the parking of a vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an area other than a
basement shall be designed and constructed to allow for the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters for the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on exterior walls. The term "fully
enclosed space" also includes crawl spaces.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
A minimum of two openings having a net total area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed space.
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided
that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Historic structures. Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined in this chapter must comply with all ordinance requirements
that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure. Documentation
that a specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National
Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the
Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance
requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.

officer shall be to provide information and reports from governmental agencies, and scientific
and/or engineering journals, if available, and professional engineers and/or engineering
geologists, if necessary. This information and these reports must be of sufficient detail to insure
that the proposed grading will not create a hazard and that there will be a minimum of soil erosion
on the site to be graded.
A geological report may be requested to include a detailed description of the geological conditions
of the site, and include conclusions and recommendations that will demonstrate the relationship of
the geological conditions to the proposed development, including hazardous conditions, water
resources, mineral resources and environmental impact. A soil conservation report may be
required to include existing site description as to topography, drainage, cover and soils, major
resource problems as to soil limitations, erosion and sediment potential, surface runoff changes
and recommendations to minimize soil limitations, erosion and sediment, and surface water
disposal problems.
A separate grading permit shall be required for each site.
If there is no stated contract price for said work, the reasonably anticipated cost of said work and
the total cubic yards of earth to be excavated and/or filled shall be set forth.
Any or all of the above data may be required by the permit officer; such other information as
reasonably may be required by the permit officer shall be provided.
§ 160-4. Exceptions.
A grading permit will not be required in the following situations at the discretion of the permit officer:
Where grading is limited to mining, quarrying or stockpiling of coal, rock, sand, aggregate or clay
that satisfies requirements and regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Where grading is limited to solid waste disposal areas or sanitary landfills operated in accordance
with the requirements, rules and ordinances adopted by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and the Allegheny County Department of Health.
Where excavation does not exceed five feet in vertical depth, does not result in cut and/or fill slope
steeper than four horizontal to one vertical and does not exceed an area of 1,000 square feet for
areas recognized by the Soil Survey or better source as containing landslide-prone soils. Better
sources recognizing landslide-prone soil areas may be relied upon as set forth in the Pennsylvania
Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey, or by a professional engineer experienced in
geology or an engineering geologist.
Where excavation does not exceed 10 feet in vertical depth, does not result in a cut or fill slope
steeper than three horizontal to one vertical and does not exceed an area of 2,500 square feet in
areas of soils not recognized by the Soil Survey or better as landslide-prone.
Where grading does not exceed new construction authorized by a building permit properly issued
by the governing body. Grading under the authorization of a building permit should follow the
standards and requirements of this chapter.

Where soil excavated under the authorization of a building permit properly issued by the governing
body is temporarily stockpiled on the same site as excavation; provided, however, that if the
material from such excavation is thereafter to be used for fill purposes for which a grading permit
is required, such permit must be obtained prior to such use in accordance with the requirements of
this chapter. In addition, if excavated material is stockpiled on a site for a period longer than 120
days, then a permit shall be necessary when disposing of the fill material.
§ 160-5. Source of fill; destination of excavated materials.
If a fill is to be made within the Township, it must identify all sources of and the nature of all material
being used to make the fill. If an excavation or cut is to be made in the Township, applicant must
designate where all the material is to be deposited. If material is to be excavated and deposited within
the Township, two permits are required (one for each site).
§ 160-6. Hazardous conditions.
[Amended 2-22-1994 by Ord. No. 923]
Whenever the governing body, upon the recommendation of its permit officer, determines that any
existing or proposed excavation, embankment or fill has or may become a hazard, the owner of
the property upon which the excavation, embankment, or fill is located, or other person or agent in
control of said property, upon receipt of notice in writing from the permit officer, shall within the
reasonable period specified therein repair, reconstruct or remove such excavation, embankment,
or fill so as to eliminate the hazard.
If after such notification, the property owner has not made the necessary repairs within the time
adopted, then the governing body may direct government employees to make the required repairs
and the cost thereof shall be borne by the property owner by suit and/or lien filed as provided by
law.
In determining whether a hazard may endanger property, streets or alleys, or create hazardous
conditions, the permit officer shall give due consideration to possible saturation by rains, earth
movements, runoff surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the stratification and faulting
of rock, aquifers, springs and the nature and type of the soil, rock and fill material.
Whenever the permit officer determines in his sole discretion that any danger, nuisance or hazard
exists by virtue of the operations being undertaken pursuant to this chapter, he shall have
authority to stop the work being done. This shall include but not be limited to accumulations of dirt
and mud or other substances on streets, any windblown or airborne substances, or a nuisance in
any manner in and about a work site. The permit officer shall have the authority to inspect and
determine the existence of dangerous, noxious or nuisances and shall have the authority to abate
the same and order the work to discontinue until appropriate precautions are made.
§ 160-7. Permit issuance; landslide potentials.
[Amended 2-22-1994 by Ord. No. 923]
The permit officer shall issue a permit after he has determined that the proposed work meets all the
applicable rules and regulations of this chapter, all other Township ordinances and any other applicable
governmental regulations, if any. If, however, the permit officer has reason to believe that the area to
be excavated or filled is a slide-prone area or has reason to believe that a slide may be precipitated by
the work described in the application, the permit officer may demand that the applicant provide an
evaluation by a soils mechanic engineer together with plans of operation. The Building Officer shall
further have the authority at any time during which work is being performed pursuant to this chapter to
order the cessation of all work in the event that information comes to the attention of the Officer that a

landslide may be caused by the work being performed. The permit officer shall have sole discretion to
define and delineate the scope and duration of any project and thus limit duration and scope of any
permit. The permit officer may divide the proposed project into as many segments and permits as he
sees fit in his sole discretion and to prescribe and mandate that a permit be obtained for each and
every segment or area where work is to be performed.
§ 160-8. Written approval.
After the issuance of a permit by the permit officer, no changes of any kind shall be made to the
application, permit, or any of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written approval of the permit officer.
§ 160-9. Issuance of placard.
In addition to the permit, the permit officer shall issue a placard which shall be displayed on the
premises during the time when work is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit
and the date of its issuance and shall be signed by the permit officer.
§ 160-10. Performance guarantee.
Before issuance of a grading permit, the applicant shall post a bond, corporate surety, or other
approved security in the amount of 10% of the estimated cost of the grading work and erosion control
facilities proposed in the permit to guarantee said work and facilities in a satisfactory manner and
meeting the requirements of this chapter. No bond shall be required if another bond or other approved
security is posted for construction and/or site improvements. The amount of the bond shall be
determined in the sole discretion of the permit officer. When all requirements of this permit have been
met and the work has been completed in a satisfactory manner, the full amount of security shall be
returned to the person posting said security. This bond shall also be to guarantee that there is no
damage to public roadways within the Township due to weight limitations or to any other conduct of the
moving fill.
§ 160-11. Start of work; expiration of permit.
[Amended 2-22-1994 by Ord. No. 923]
The proposed work shall begin within three months after the date of issuance of the permit or the
same shall automatically expire unless an extension is granted in writing by the permit officer. If at
any time there is a continuous three-month period where no work is done on the work site, then
the permit shall be deemed to have expired.
All work to be done under such permit shall be completed within one year from the time when the
permit is granted. No permit shall be valid for more than a one-year period. If any work is to
performed or desired to be performed beyond that period of time, then a new permit must be
obtained.
§ 160-12. Inspection and revocation.
During the permitted work period, the permit officer, his representative or other authorized
Township official may inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in
compliance with the information provided on the permit application and with all applicable
municipal laws and ordinances. In the event the permit officer discovers that the work does not
comply with the permit application or with all applicable laws and ordinances, or that there has

been a false statement or a misrepresentation by any applicant, the permit officer may revoke the
permit.
If at any time during the construction of the work, the permit officer has cause to believe that the
applicant or anybody performing work pursuant to the application permit is causing damage, he
shall have the absolute right to cause the cessation of work.
§ 160-13. Permit fees.
[Amended 2-22-1994 by Ord. No. 923]
Excavation fees.
Minimum fee for each fill and/or excavation: $50.
For each cubic yard over 50 cubic yards for each fill and for each excavation there shall be
added a charge of $0.25 per cubic yard.
Drilling fees. Fees for drilling shall be as follows:
Fees for removal of natural gas: $500.
Hereinafter, the Township Board of Commissioners shall have the absolute right to set and reset
fees and charges by simple resolution, following advertisement in accordance with the law.
The permit officer in his sole discretion may request site inspections by the Township Engineer. On
each occasion the applicant must pay an inspection fee of $50 to the Township of North Versailles.
In default of payment for five days of demand, the permit officer may revoke the permit.
§ 160-14. Appeals to Zoning Hearing Board.
Any person aggrieved by any action of the permit officer may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board.
Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within 30 days after the determination by the permit officer.
Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board shall set a time and place not less than 10
days nor more than 30 days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time and place of
the hearing of the appeal shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be heard.
When the requirements of this chapter for obtaining a permit have been met, the permit officer
shall approve the proposed plan and grant a grading permit to the applicant. Approved work may
then start.
§ 160-15. Slope requirements.
Maximum slope steepness of a cut should be three horizontal to one vertical for minimizing
erosion and landslide hazard. However, a governmental review agency, professional engineer or
engineering geologist may recognize the types of soil on the site to be graded from the Soil
Survey or better. Maximum slopes can then be redetermined as follows:
Landslide-prone soils with slopes greater than 25% shall have cut slopes no steeper than
three horizontal to one vertical. Soil Survey Map are:
34-DE-6 34-E-2 34-F-1 65-E-2
Landslide-prone soils where slopes are less than 25% shall have cut slopes no steeper than
two horizontal to one vertical. Soil Survey Map symbols are:

Soils which are not or have a low probability of being landslide-prone shall have a slope no
steeper than 1 1/2 horizontal to one vertical. All Soil Survey Map symbols except the symbols
listed above denote soils of low landslide probability.
Cut slopes which are steeper than those specified above may be allowed under a grading permit,
provided one or both of the following is satisfied:
The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope steeper
than the slope specified above for recognized soil conditions on the site. A written statement,
signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer, stating that the steeper slope will
have sufficient stability and that risk of creating a hazard will be slight, must be submitted to
the permit officer.
A retaining wall or other approved support, designed by a professional engineer and
approved by the permit officer, is provided to support the toe and face of excavation.
The top or bottom edge of slopes shall generally be set back from adjacent property lines or street
right-of-way lines in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the
abutting property or street.
Guidelines for cuts in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania, shall be followed. One or a combination of guidelines should be used to minimize
hazard, depending on site conditions and proposed grading.
§ 160-16. Standards for fills.
No fill shall be placed over trees, stumps or other material which could create a hazard. Instead,
such materials may be buried in natural ground where no structures will be built or hazard created.
Limbs can be chipped and mixed with the topsoil.
All fills should be compacted to provide stability of fill material and to prevent undesirable
settlement or slippage.
Clean soil or earth should be placed over the top and exposed surfaces of the fill to a depth
sufficient to conceal all materials used in the fill other than clean soil or earth. If the filling operation
is intermittent, the top and exposed surfaces of the fill should be so covered at the completion of
each lift.
§ 160-17. Standards for minimizing erosion and sedimentation.
Guidelines for minimizing erosion and sediment in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, should be followed. One or a combination of guidelines shall be used
to minimize hazard, depending on site conditions and proposed grading; however, the administrator
may approve grading plans not meeting guidelines of the Handbook if proposed grading will not
constitute a hazard. Governmental and/or engineering reports should be used as evidence that
proposed grading will not constitute a hazard.
§ 160-18. Retaining walls.

Definition of retaining wall: A structure composed of concrete, steel or other approved building
material constructed for the purpose of supporting a cut or filled embankment which would
otherwise not comply with the requirements of the standards set forth in this chapter, and which is
more than four feet in height as measured on the exposed vertical surface of the wall.
If a retaining wall is constructed to satisfy a requirement of this chapter, a building permit, as
provided by other municipal regulations, shall not be required. The grading permit will apply to the
retaining wall, and the requirements for inspection, etc., as stated herein will govern.
Retaining walls must be constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices. The plans
submitted for approval shall bear the seal of a professional engineer.
The backfilling of retaining walls and the insertion of subterranean drainage facilities shall be done
strictly in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and appropriate municipal specifications.
In general, where a wall is replacing an exposed slope, the vertical face of the wall shall be three
feet back from the adjoining property.
A special exception to this requirement may be applied for and granted by the permit officer if
it can he satisfactorily demonstrated that such a variance is necessary to insure normal use of
the property, i.e., for a sideline driveway.
Compliance with this section may also be excused when the proposed retaining wall is a joint
venture between adjacent property owners, and appropriate documents so stating are filed
with the application for the permit.
§ 160-19. Drainage provisions.
Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent any surface or subsurface waters from damaging:
The cut face of an excavation;
The sloping surface of a fill; and
Adjacent property affected by the change in the existing natural runoff pattern.
To prevent damage, grading plans should follow vegetative control methods and ditch and conduit
control methods set forth in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Allegheny County,
Pennsylvania. The permit officer may approve methods and materials recommended by
governmental agencies and professional engineers when they are more suitable to the site in
preventing damage. Drainage facilities shall be designed to accommodate the largest size storm
that would occur on the average of every 20 years.
§ 160-20. Maintenance.
The owner, occupier or controller of any property on which an excavation or fill has been made
shall maintain in good condition and repair the excavation or fill, all retaining walls, cribbing,
drainage structures, fences, ground cover, and any other protective devices as may be a part of
the permit requirements.
If, at any time subsequent to the completion of the grading work, the cut face or fill slope shall
evidence signs of deterioration, erosion, or other evidence which might be detrimental to the
properties above and below the grading site, the permit officer may direct the property owner or
applicant to take necessary remedial steps in accordance with sound engineering practice to
restore the grading to a safe condition, and to do so in a reasonable period of time.

§ 160-21. Liability.
Neither the issuance of a permit under the provisions of this chapter nor the compliance with the
provisions herein with any condition imposed by the permit officer hereunder shall relieve any person
from any responsibility for damage to persons or property resulting therefrom, or as otherwise imposed
by law, nor impose any liability upon the Township of North Versailles for damages to persons or
property.
§ 160-22. Violations and penalties.
[Amended 11-16-1987 by Ord. No. 857; 8-15-1988 by Ord. No. 867]
Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or provisions of this chapter or who

A. Prohibited discharge standards.
General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any
pollutant or wastewater which causes pass-through or interference. These general
prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.
Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the
following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited
to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140° F. (60° C.) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;
Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or otherwise causing corrosive structural damage
to the POTW or equipment;
Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction of the flow in the
POTW resulting in interference;
Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released in a discharge at
a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other
pollutants, will cause interference with the POTW;
Wastewater with a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant
resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104° F. (40° C.);
Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in amounts
that will cause interference or pass-through;
Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW

life, or to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the treatment process,
such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions, which
consequently imparts color to the treatment plant's effluent, thereby violating MACM
NPDES permit;
Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations;
Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling

into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than 5% or any single reading over
10% of the lower explosive limit of the meter.
Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or
stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW.
National categorical pretreatment standards. The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40
CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471, are hereby incorporated.
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or
the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, MACM may impose equivalent concentration
or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater
not regulated by the same standard, MACM shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove,
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating
to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40
CFR 403.15.
State pretreatment standards. (Reserved.)
Local limits.
No industrial user shall discharge wastewater containing a mass of any pollutant which, when
taken together with the mass of that pollutant discharged by all other industrial users, will
cause the mass of the pollutant to exceed the mass of that pollutant specified in the
headworks industrial allowance which has been approved by the approval authority for the
POTW into which the industrial user discharges.
MACM may establish local limits regulating the discharge of specific pollutants by industrial
users. Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local limit or an industrial user's permit shall
constitute a violation of this article.
MACM's right of revision. MACM reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater
discharge permits, more stringent standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW.
Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a
discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a
discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. MACM may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.

Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
article and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and
the prohibitions set out in § 238-14A of this article within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
state, or MACM, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to MACM for review, and shall be acceptable to
MACM before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures
shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to
produce a discharge acceptable to MACM under the provisions of this article.
Additional pretreatment measures.
Whenever deemed necessary, MACM may require users to restrict their discharge peak flow
periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate
and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine
the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
MACM may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on his or
her property and at his or her expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of MACM, they are
necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and
oil or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All
interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by MACM and shall be so located to
be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected,
cleaned, and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense.
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
Accidental discharge/slug control plans. At least once every two years, MACM shall evaluate
whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. MACM
may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively,
MACM may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall
address, at a minimum, the following:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying MACM of any accidental or slug discharge, as required
by § 238-18F of this article; and
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
Hauled wastewater.
Septic tank waste or municipal digested sewage sludge may be introduced into the POTW
only at locations designated by MACM, and at such times as are established by MACM. Such
waste shall not violate § 238-14 of this article or any other requirements established by
MACM. MACM may require waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits.

MACM shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits.
MACM may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge
permits. MACM also may prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of
hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this article.
Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by MACM. No load
may be discharged without prior consent of MACM. MACM may collect samples of each
hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. MACM may require the
industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall
include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number,
truck identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and volume and
characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected
waste constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
§ 238-16. Wastewater discharge permit application.
Wastewater analysis. When requested by MACM, a user must submit information on the nature
and characteristics of its wastewater within 60 days of the request. MACM is authorized to prepare
a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information.
Wastewater discharge permit requirement.
No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining
a wastewater discharge permit from MACM, except that a significant industrial user that has
filed a timely application pursuant to Subsection C of this section may continue to discharge
for the time period specified therein.
MACM may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry
out the purposes of this article.
Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a
violation of this article and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set
out in §§ 238-22 through 238-24 of this article. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does
not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment
standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state, and local law.
Wastewater discharge permitting: existing connections. Any user required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
article and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall, within 60 days after said
date, apply to MACM for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with Subsection E of this
section, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 120 days of the
effective date of this article except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by
MACM.
Wastewater discharge permitting: new connections. Any user required to obtain a wastewater
discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence discharging into the POTW must obtain
such permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge. An application for this
wastewater discharge permit, in accordance with Subsection E of this section, must be filed at
least 90 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
Wastewater discharge permit application contents.
All users required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application.

If MACM fails to act within 60 days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be
denied. Decisions not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater
discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered final
administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative wastewater discharge
permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with the Allegheny County Court of Common
Pleas.
Wastewater discharge permit modification. MACM may modify a wastewater discharge permit for
good cause, including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
To incorporate any new or revised federal, state, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements;
To address significant alterations or additions to the user's operation, processes, or

mass, where required by the standard or by MACM, of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and longterm
average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The
sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in
accordance with procedures set out in Subsection J of this section.
Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in Subsection K
of this section.
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified
by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the
pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in
Subsection B of this section.
Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 238-16D of this article.
Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance
schedule required by Subsection A(2)(g) of this section:
The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction,
and beginning and conducting routine operation);
No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
The user shall submit a progress report to MACM no later than 14 days following each date in
the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the
steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to MACM.
Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following
the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of
a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user
subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to MACM a report
containing the information described in Subsection A(2)(d) through (f) of this section. For users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures
in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this

report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 238-16F of this article.
Periodic compliance reports.
All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined by MACM but in no case less
than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and
the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 238-16F of this
article.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by MACM, using the procedures prescribed in Subsection K of this
section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify MACM of any planned significant changes
to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its
wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
MACM may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to
evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 238-16E of this article.
MACM may issue a wastewater discharge permit under § 238-16G of this article or modify an
existing wastewater discharge permit under § 238-16E of this article in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow
increases of 20% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
Reports of potential problems.
In the case of any discharge that may cause potential problems for the POTW, including, but
not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify MACM of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by MACM, submit a
detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of
any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to
the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this article.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place
advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection F(1),
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur
are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to MACM as MACM may require.
Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a
violation, the user must notify MACM within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user
shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to MACM
within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if
MACM monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if MACM samples between the
user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling.
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type
of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of
such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the
mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected
to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later
than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under Subsection E of this section. The notification requirement
in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Subsections A, E, and D of
this section.
Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of Subsection I(1), above, during a calendar
month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or
of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA[1] identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste,
the user must notify MACM, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
Editor's Note: See 42 U.S.C. § 6921.
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to
be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state
law.
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the

pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures
approved by EPA.
Sample collection.
Except as indicated in Subsection K(2), below, the user must collect wastewater samples
using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional
sampling is infeasible, MACM may authorize the use of time-proportional sampling or a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For
reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States
Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make
available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities required by this article and additional records of information obtained
pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements.
Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the
person(s) taking the samples; the date analyses were performed; who performed the analyses;
the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall
remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended
for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or MACM, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by MACM.
§ 238-19. Compliance monitoring.
Right of entry: inspection and sampling. MACM shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to
determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder. User shall allow MACM ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the
performance of any additional duties.
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security
guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, MACM will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
MACM shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices
as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
MACM may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition
by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected
and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of MACM
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
Unreasonable delays in allowing MACM access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this
article.

§ 238-20. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit
applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from MACM's inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of MACM, that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available
immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will
not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.
§ 238-21. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
MACM shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the
POTW is located, a list of the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant
noncompliance" shall mean:
Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66% or more of
wastewater measurements taken during a six-month period exceed the daily maximum limit or
average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33% or more of
wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or
exceed the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
Any other discharge violation that MACM believes has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference or pass-through, including endangering the health of POTW personnel or
the general public;
Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the
environment, or has resulted in MACM's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent
such a discharge;
Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained
in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing
construction, or attaining final compliance;
Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline
monitoring reports, reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines,
periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
Any other violation(s) which MACM determines will adversely affect the operation or
implementation of the local pretreatment program.

Notification of violation. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, MACM may serve upon that user a written notice of
violation. Within five days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for
the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be
submitted by the user to MACM. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for
any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of MACM to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
Consent orders. MACM may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.
Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Subsections D and E of this section and
shall be judicially enforceable.
Show-cause hearing. MACM may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before MACM and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time
and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
Compliance orders. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, MACM may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount
of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
the user.
Cease and desist orders.
When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, MACM may issue
an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user
to:
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.

Administrative fines.
When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, MACM may assess a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed
$25,000 per day for each violation. Each violation for each separate day shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense. MACM may recover its costs for reestablishing the operating of
the POTW in addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder. In addition, MACM may recover
attorney's fees, all court costs, and all other expenses of litigation to the extent permitted by
law.
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for MACM to reconsider the
fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, MACM may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. MACM may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement
actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
Emergency suspensions.
MACM may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user,
whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons. MACM may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW,
or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, MACM may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. MACM may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of
MACM that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in Subsection H of this section are initiated against the user.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the
harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to MACM
prior to the date of any show-cause or termination hearing under Subsection C or H of
this section.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this section.
Termination of discharge.
In addition to the provisions in § 238-17F of this article, any user who violates the following
conditions is subject to discharge termination:
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;

Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring, or sampling; or
Violation of the pretreatment standards in § 238-14 of this article.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under Subsection C of this section why the proposed action should
not be taken. Exercise of this option by MACM shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
§ 238-23. Judicial enforcement remedies.
Injunctive relief. When MACM finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision
of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, MACM may petition the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County
through MACM's attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or
other requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. MACM may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user
to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Civil penalties.
A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be liable to MACM for a maximum civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per
violation per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit,
penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of violation.
MACM may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other expenses associated
with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by MACM.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other
factor as justice requires.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
Criminal penalties. Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be
maintained pursuant to this article or pretreatment permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or
knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this article shall,
upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not more
than 30 days, or both. Each occurrence shall be a separate offense. This section shall not
preclude prosecution under the Pennsylvania Crimes Code.[1]
Editor's Note: See 18 Pa.C.S.A. § 101 et seq.
Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are not exclusive. MACM may
take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of

pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with MACM's enforcement response plan.
However, MACM may take other action against any user when the circumstances warrant.
Further, MACM is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against any
noncompliant user.
§ 238-24. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
Upset.
For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because
of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of Subsection A(3), below, are met.
A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in
compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and
The user has submitted the following information to MACM within 24 hours of becoming
aware of the upset:
A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected,
the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of
the noncompliance.
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall
have the burden of proof.
Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of
power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
Prohibited discharge standards. A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with the general provisions in § 328-14A(1) of this article or
the specific prohibitions in § 238-14A(2)(c) through (q), excluding (h), of this article if it can prove
that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass-through or interference and that either:
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each
limit directly prior to, and during, the pass-through or interference; or

No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents
from the user's prior discharge when MACM was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
permit, and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
Bypass.
For the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
BYPASS
The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.
SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE
Substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections B(3) and (4) of this
section.
Time frame for notification.
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to MACM,
at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
A user shall submit oral notice to MACM of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds
applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if
the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and
steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
MACM may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
Prohibition; exception.
Bypass is prohibited, and MACM may take enforcement action against the user for a
bypass, unless:
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment
downtime or preventive maintenance; and
The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C(3) of this section.
MACM may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if
MACM determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection C(4)(a) of this
section.

§ 238-26. Title.
This article shall be known as the "North Versailles Sewer Connection Ordinance", and is designated
as Chapter 238, Article V, in the Code of North Versailles Township. The whereas clauses are
incorporated into and made a part of this article.[1]
Editor's Note: The full text of Ord. No. 1012, which adopted this article, and all amendments thereto, is
on file in the Township offices.
§ 238-27. Discharge into sanitary sewer system.
It is declared to be the intent of North Versailles Township to eliminate the discharge of surface
water into the sanitary sewer system, and to prohibit and require the removal of private
connections that allow extraneous surface water to enter the publicly owned sanitary sewers that
are directly or indirectly tributary to a public sanitary sewer system.
No structure or building shall permit any surface water to be channeled into the sanitary sewer
system. It is the intent of this article that the substantial reconstruction, demolition, razing, or
removal of any structure shall be the loss of any preexisting right, if any, to utilize or construct a
combination sewer; any reconstruction, rebuilding or repair of any structure must be in full
compliance with this article and no surface water shall be permitted to be discharged into the
sanitary sewer system.
No person or entity shall permit any extraneous surface water to enter into a publicly owned
sanitary sewer system either directly or indirectly.
Where used herein, reference to a "plumber" shall mean a person registered as a plumber with
the Allegheny County Health Department.

waters or wastes if it appears likely in the opinion of the NVTSA, or its designated agent, that such
wastes can harm the sewage disposal system or the treatment processes or equipment, or can
otherwise endanger life, limb, public property or constitute a nuisance.
In forming their opinion as to the acceptability of these waters, the NVTSA, or its designated
agent, will give consideration to such factors as to the qualities of subject wastes in relation to
flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage
treatment process, capacity of the wastewater treatment plan, degree of treatability of wastes in
the sewage treatment plan, and other pertinent factors.
In all cases, the NVTSA, or its designated agent, shall require compliance by the user with all
aspects of latest applicable ALCOSAN Pretreatment Standards and/or MACM Pretreatment
Standards.
See provisions of Part 3, MACM and Part 4, ALCOSAN Pretreatment Standards.
Plumbing to be in good repair. Every building or room occupied or used as a food preparation
facility or restaurant shall be well drained. All soil pipes, waste pipes, drains or other plumbing
fixtures shall be of adequate size to enable the passage of any waste intended to pass
through it to the main public sewer. All drains, sewers, waste and soil pipes, traps and water
in gas pipes shall, at all times, be kept in good repair and order so that no gases or odor shall
escape therefrom and so that the same shall not leak, and all vent pipes shall be kept in good
order and repair and free from obstruction.
Installation of grease interceptors and grease traps.
Every building, room or space or part thereof used as a food preparation facility or
restaurant, whether new or existing, shall install or cause to be installed, if not already
installed, a grease interceptor or grease trap. The type of installation shall be determined

by the total fixture flow through rate of potential grease-laden fixtures discharging through
the building sewage lines as determined by the Allegheny County Health Department
(ACHD) Plumbing Division. For flow through rates 35 gpm or less, an internal grease trap
may be installed in certain existing structures used as food preparation facilities and
restaurants. For flow through rates exceeding 35 gpm, an external, underground grease
interceptor must be installed in all new structures, major remodeling or renovation of
existing structures, or changes of use involving food preparation facilities or restaurants.
Said grease trap or grease interceptor shall be installed at an appropriate location along
the sewer line between the food preparation facility or restaurant and the line's entry in
the main public newline. An inspection site tee shall be installed between the interceptor
discharge and connect to the public sewer system. All installations shall be in accordance
with the ACHD Plumbing Code and Regulations. No solid waste devices, such as waste
grinders, disposals, potato peelers, etc., shall discharge through the grease trap or
grease interceptor. Only potential grease-laden fixtures may discharge through the trap
or interceptor.
All new food preparation facilities and restaurants shall be required to install an exterior,
underground grease interceptor of a minimum 1,000 gallon capacity, regardless of the
flow through rate.
In all existing food preparation facilities and restaurants there shall be installed a grease
interceptor or grease trap as determined by the flow through rate, as detailed above, if
not already installed. In existing facilities where it is determined by the NVTSA that a
grease trap is not sufficient, the NVTSA may require that a grease interceptor (as
detailed above) be installed. Such insufficiency shall be evidenced by excessive amounts
of grease being discharged into the public sewer system by a facility. All existing food
preparation facilities and restaurants shall, at a change of ownership or remodeling or
renovation thereof, install an exterior, underground grease interceptor of a minimum
1,000 gallon capacity. In all existing structures, buildings or parts thereof in which there is
a change of use or occupancy to that of a food preparation facility or restaurant, there
shall be installed a grease interceptor of a minimum capacity of 1,000 gallons, regardless
of the flow through rate.
All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the wastewater
superintendent and shall be located under cover and so as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection. Interceptors shall not be located so as to receive
rainwater or unpolluted run-off.
Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature. They shall be of substantial
construction, watertight and equipped with easily removable covers which, when bolted in
place, shall be gastight and watertight.
Maintenance of grease interceptors and grease traps.
All grease interceptors and grease traps shall be maintained and kept in good working
order at all times. The interceptor or trap shall limit the amount of grease discharge into
the public sewer system to levels not exceeding those permitted by ALCOSAN.
Oil/grease discharges shall not exceed 200 ppm downstream of the interceptor or tap.
It shall be the duty and responsibility of all owners, lessees or agents of all food
preparation facilities and restaurants to, at a minimum of annually, inspect the grease
interceptor or trap. A written record shall be kept of all inspections. The inspection record
shall, at a minimum, list the name (inspector and company), address and phone number
of the inspection/disposal company, the method and frequency of cleaning scheduled
and the date of the cleaning/inspection. Such records shall be immediately presented to
the NVTSA upon request. A more frequent cleaning/inspection schedule may be ordered

to be performed by the facility when it is determined by the NVTSA that the facility is
discharging excessive amounts of grease to the public sewer system.
Grease and all debris removed from a trap or interceptor shall only be disposed of at a
facility approved by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) and/or the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Under no circumstances
shall this material be deposited into another sanitary or storm sewer.
Where installed, all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner, at
his/her expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times. Interceptors shall be
cleaned at least once a week.
Failure by the owner to properly clean and maintain these units shall be considered
sufficient cause for disconnection of premises from the public sewer, or punitive actions
as provided for in this article.

Any person, firm or corporation who violates a provision of this article, or who fails to comply
therewith, or any of the requirements thereof, shall be, upon conviction thereof, sentenced to pay
a fine of not less than $300 nor more than $1,000 for each violation, plus court costs and cost of
persecution incurred by the NVTSA, and in default of payment of said fine and costs, to
imprisonment to the extent permitted by law for the punishment of summary offenses.

Chapter 255. Stormwater Management

Ord. No. 1115.[1] Amendments noted where applicable.]

Editor's Note: This ordinance also superseded former Ch. 255, Stormwater Management, adopted 1-
20-2004 by Ord. No. 1013.
Article I. General Provisions
§ 255-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Township of North Versailles Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 255-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases runoff volumes, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and
flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public
health and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM), including regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the
environment.
Stormwater is an important water resource that provides groundwater recharge for water supplies
and supports the base flow of streams.
The use of green infrastructure (GI) and low-impact development (LID) are intended to address
the root cause of water quality impairment by using systems and practices which use or mimic
natural processes to: 1) infiltrate and recharge, 2) evapotranspire, and/or 3) harvest and use
precipitation near where it falls to earth. Green infrastructure practices and LID contribute to the
restoration or maintenance of predevelopment hydrology.

Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater
controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) program.
§ 255-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within the municipality and its
watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in § 255-2 of this chapter
through provisions designed to:
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses of the
waters of this commonwealth.
Preserve natural drainage systems.
Manage stormwater runoff close to the source, reduce runoff volumes and mimic predevelopment
hydrology.
Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.
Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater best management practices (BMPs)
that are implemented within the municipality.
Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
§ 255-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the
Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended,
[1] and/or the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1, et seq., as amended, The
Stormwater Management Act.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 255-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff, including land development
and earth disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this chapter.
§ 255-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or provision of this chapter
invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 255-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility
to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance.
§ 255-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading or erroneous information
provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work
undertaken or use established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No action
may be taken by a board, agency or employee of the municipality purporting to validate such a
violation.
§ 255-10. Waivers.
If the municipality determines that any requirement under this chapter cannot be achieved for a
particular regulated activity, the municipality may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve
measures other than those in this chapter subject to Subsection B. The proposed area of
disturbance shall be less than one acre. The request for a modification or waiver shall originate
with the landowner, shall be in writing, and shall accompany the Stormwater Management Site
Plan submitted to the municipality. The request shall provide the facts on which the request is
based, the provisions of the chapter involved, and the proposed modification. The designated plan
reviewer shall review the request to determine if it meets the requirements of the chapter,
including Subsection B below. If acceptable to the municipality, the municipality may grant the
waiver or modification.
Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this chapter may be approved by the municipality
if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of unique physical circumstances or conditions
peculiar to the land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary or detrimental
to the public interest and will achieve the intended outcome and that the purpose of the chapter is
preserved. Hardship must be due to such unique physical circumstances or conditions and not to
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Stormwater Management
Ordinance. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modifications shall not
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property. A
request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the stormwater management site plan
submission, as directed in Subsection A above.
No waiver or modification of any regulated stormwater activity involving earth disturbance greater
than or equal to one acre may be granted by the municipality.
§ 255-11. Version of regulations and standards.
Any reference to a statute, regulation or standard shall be interpreted to refer to the latest or most
current version of that document.

zone of soil and rock.
GROUNDWATER RECHARGE
The replenishment of existing natural underground water supplies from precipitation or
overland flow.
HYDROLOGIC SOIL GROUP (HSG)
Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as
surface intake rates. Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their
minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The NRCS
defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their
group classification. The soils in the area of the development site may be identified from a soil
survey report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices.
Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS[1]).
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (IMPERVIOUS AREA)
A surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground. Impervious surfaces (or areas)
shall include, but not be limited to: roofs; additional indoor living spaces, patios, garages,
storage sheds and similar structures; and any new streets or sidewalks. Decks, parking
areas, and driveway areas are counted as impervious areas if they directly prevent infiltration.
INFILTRATION
Movement of surface water into the soil, where it is absorbed by plant roots, evaporated into
the atmosphere, or percolated downward to recharge groundwater.
INVASIVE SPECIES
DCNR defines invasive plants as those species that are not native to the state, grow
aggressively, and spread and displace native vegetation. (See
http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_010314.pdf for a list
of invasive species.)

Planning Code.[2]
LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID)
Site design approaches and small-scale stormwater management practices that promote the
use of natural systems for infiltration, evapotranspiration, and reuse of rainwater. LID can be
applied to new development, urban retrofits, and revitalization projects. LID utilizes design
techniques that infiltrate, filter, evaporate, and store runoff close to its source. Rather than rely
on costly large-scale conveyance and treatment systems, LID addresses stormwater through
a variety of small, cost-effective landscape features located on site.

Article III. Stormwater Management Standards
§ 255-13. General requirements.
For all regulated activities, unless preparation of an SWM site plan is specifically exempted in
§ 255-14:
Preparation and implementation of an approved SWM site plan is required.
No regulated activities shall commence until the municipality issues written approval of an
SWM site plan, which demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
SWM site plans approved by the municipality, in accordance with § 255-23, shall be on-site
throughout the duration of the regulated activity.
These standards apply to the landowner and any person engaged in regulated activities.
For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during the regulated earth disturbance activities
(e.g., during construction) to meet the purposes and requirements of this chapter and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law. Various BMPs
and their design standards are listed in the Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program
Manual (E&S Manual[1]), No. 363-2134-008, as amended and updated.
Editor's Note: See § 255-38D.
Impervious areas.
The measurement of impervious areas shall include all of the impervious areas in the total
proposed development even if development is to take place in stages.
For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan must be used in
determining conformance with this chapter.
For projects that add impervious area to a parcel, the total impervious area on the parcel is
subject to the requirements of this chapter, except that the volume controls in § 255-15 and
the peak rate controls of § 255-16 do not need to be retrofitted to existing impervious areas
that are not being altered by the proposed regulated activity.
Stormwater flows onto adjacent or downstream property shall not be created, increased,
decreased, relocated, impeded, or otherwise altered without written notification of the affected
property owner(s). Notification shall include a description of the proposed development and the
stormwater flows that are being created, increased, decreased, relocated, impeded, or otherwise
altered. Adjacent property shall at a minimum include any property having a shared boundary with
the subject property of the SWM site plan; however, if in the judgment of the designated plan
reviewer additional properties are being affected, additional notifications may be required. Proof of
notification (signed postal receipt for example) shall be included as part of the SWM plan

plan must include a detailed justification acceptable to the designated plan reviewer,
demonstrating that the use of LID and green infrastructure is not practicable.
Editor's Note: See § 255-38C.
Infiltration BMPs should be dispersed throughout the project site at strategic locations, made as
shallow as practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site infiltration features while still
meeting the other requirements of this chapter.
Normally dry, open-top storage facilities should completely drain both the volume control and rate
control capacities over a period of time not less than 24 and not more than 72 hours from the end
of the design storm.
The design storm precipitation depths to be used in the analysis of peak rates of discharge shall
be as obtained in PennDOT's Drainage Manual, Publication 584, Appendix 7A, or obtained from
the latest version of the Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the United States, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service, Hydrometeorological Design

Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this chapter provided the activities are performed according to the requirements of
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
Roadway resurfacing and maintenance projects which do not increase impervious area and
underground infrastructure projects are exempt from the provisions of this chapter, provided the
activities meet the requirements of all other municipal, state and federal requirements.
Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the applicant from the
requirements in § 255-13D through J.
The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this section at any time for any
project that the municipality believes may pose a threat to public health and safety or the
environment.
Voluntary green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) retrofit projects that are solely intended to better
manage runoff from existing development and are not part of new development or redevelopment
are exempt from the stormwater management provisions of this chapter. This does not exempt
such projects from any other municipal, state, or federal regulation.
§ 255-15. Volume controls.
The green infrastructure and low-impact development practices provided in the BMP Manual[1] shall be
utilized for all regulated activities wherever possible. Water volume controls shall be implemented
using the Design Storm Method in Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below, or

The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual[2]) is applicable as a method to any size of
regulated activity. This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions. The following
shall be incorporated into the CG-1 method:
Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than
the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration precipitation.
At least the first inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a facility
designed for a twenty-four- to seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated
stormwater system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a
facility designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a combined
sewer system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
For modeling purposes:
Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow in
good condition.
20% of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in good
condition in the model for existing conditions.
Editor's Note: See § 255-38C.
The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual[3]) provided below is independent of site
conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated activities greater than one acre or for projects that require design of
stormwater storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of runoff from the net increase
in impervious surfaces.
At least the first inch of runoff from the net increase in impervious surfaces shall be
permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters
of this commonwealth. Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration. If the developer provides justification that the listed removal options are not
feasible and the designated plan reviewer agrees, runoff shall be detained in a facility
designed for a twenty-four-hour dewatering time in an area with a dedicated stormwater
system (not contributory to a combined sewer system) and shall be detained in a facility
designed for a seventy-two-hour dewatering time in an area contributory to a combined sewer
system before discharge to local stormwater systems or the environment.
Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the
entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
This method is exempt from the requirements of § 255-16, Rate controls.

For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management
Plan:
Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for
the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events.
This is the equivalent to a 100% release rate area when compared to those rates shown in
the maps contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release Rate Management Districts).
[1] This predevelopment to post-development control is not to be misconstrued as the same
as the conditional direct discharge areas on the release rate maps. If it is shown that the peak
rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the
peak rates of discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for one-, two-, five-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year twenty-four-hour storms, then the requirements of this section
have been met. Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to
satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement. Peak flows should be computed using the
methods included in the chapter titled "Stormwater Calculations and Methodology" of the
PADEP Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
For areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management
Plan:
For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and 100-year, twenty-four-hour storm events,
the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate
maps. These maps are contained in Appendix A (New and Existing Release Rate
Management Districts)[2] of this model chapter. For any areas not shown on the release rate
maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge
rates for the specified design events. Peak flows should be computed using the methods
included in Chapter 8 of the PADEP Stormwater Management BMP Manual.
Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 255-17. Riparian buffers.
In order to protect and improve water quality, a riparian buffer easement shall be created and
recorded as part of any subdivision or land development that encompasses a riparian buffer. The
intent of this chapter in establishing a riparian buffer is to protect and improve stream water quality.
The riparian buffer is intended to slow overland flow to the stream through the presence of native
grasses, trees and shrubs, allowing infiltration/groundwater recharge; causing deposition of
sediment, nutrients, pesticides, and other pollutants in the buffer rather than in the stream; and
reducing erosion by providing stream bank stabilization. The trees provide shade for streams,
keeping waters cooler and reducing evaporation.
Except as required by Pa. Code Title 25 Chapter 102, the riparian buffer easement shall be
required for all streams (as defined in Article II) with a contributing watershed area of greater than
10 acres. The riparian buffer easement shall be measured to be a minimum of 35 feet from the top
of the streambank (on each side).
Minimum management requirements for riparian buffers.
No use or construction within the riparian buffer shall be permitted that is inconsistent with the
intent of the riparian buffer as described in Subsection A.
Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within the riparian buffer
easement.
Whenever practicable, invasive vegetation shall be actively removed and the riparian buffer
easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse
native plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.

The riparian buffer easement shall be enforceable by the municipality and shall be recorded in the
appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the
use of the property located therein. The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership
and shall count toward the minimum lot area required by Zoning, unless otherwise specified in the
municipal Zoning Ordinance.[1]
Editor's Note: See Ch. 300, Zoning.
Any permitted use within the riparian buffer easement shall be conducted in a manner that will
maintain the extent of the existing 100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability,
and preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.
Stormwater drainage pipes shall be permitted within the riparian buffer easement, but they shall
cross the easement in the shortest practical distance. Other structural stormwater management
facilities are not permitted within the riparian buffer easement.
The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private recreation trails are permitted by
the municipality within riparian buffers:
It is preferred that trails be designed to be permeable and for nonmotorized use only;
however, impermeable trails are permitted provided they have adequate drainage.
Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant species and other sensitive
environmental features.
Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted within the riparian buffer
easement and shall comply with setback requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.
Underground utilities shall be permitted within the riparian buffer easement; however, work shall
be performed to minimize the disturbance area and removal of trees. Restoration within the
riparian buffer easement shall be with native species of trees, grasses, and other plantings. One
tree shall be planted for each tree removed and the restoration shall be designed by a registered
professional with the requisite experience. Aboveground utilities shall only be permitted to cross
the easement perpendicular to the easement or in the shortest practical distance. Existing utilities
may remain and be maintained as required.
Article IV. Stormwater Management (SWM) Site Plan
Requirements
§ 255-18. Plan requirements.
Appropriate sections from the municipality's Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance,[1] and
other applicable local ordinances, shall be followed in preparing the SWM site plans. In instances
where the municipality lacks subdivision and land development regulations, the content of SWM
site plans shall follow the Allegheny County Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 265, Subdivision and Land Development.
The municipality shall not approve any SWM site plan that is deficient in meeting the requirements
of this chapter. At its sole discretion and in accordance with this article, when an SWM site plan is
found to be deficient, the municipality may either disapprove the submission and require a
resubmission, or in the case of minor deficiencies, the municipality may accept submission of
modifications.
The following items shall be included in the SWM site plan:

Article VII. Fees
§ 265-700. Filing fee.
The Township may assess an application filing fee sufficient to cover administrative costs including
clerical labor, advertising, storage, hardcopy and digital communication, and other similar costs
necessitated by any certain class of application, commensurate with its scale. Such fees shall be
established by resolution or ordinance of the Board.
§ 265-701. Application review fees and escrow account.
An application review escrow deposit, in an amount that may be established by resolution of the
Board, shall be payable at the time of submission of the application to guarantee payment of the
estimated application review fees required by this article. The actual amount of the review fees in
excess of the escrow deposit shall be payable within 45 days of billing by the Township as an
interim itemized bill. Any monies remaining in the escrow account after all review fees have been
paid shall be returned to the applicant.
Application review fees shall include reasonable and necessary charges by the Township's
professional consultants, Township Engineer or by the Township Solicitor, to the extent permitted
by law, for review and report on the application to the Township. Such review fees shall be based
upon a schedule established from time to time by resolution or ordinance of the Board. Such
review fees shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and customary charges by
the Township Engineer or other professional consultants for similar service in the community, but
in no event shall the fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the Township Engineer or other
professional consultants to the Township when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise imposed on
applicants.
The Township shall submit a final itemized bill or account statement no later than 15 days
following the denial, approval, or approval with conditions of a related plan. Any statement
submitted beyond that date shall be considered a supplemental invoice.
In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such review fees, the applicant shall, within
45 days of the billing date, notify the Zoning Officer in writing that such fees are disputed, in which
case the Township shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land development application
due to the applicant's request over disputed fees. Otherwise, no plan shall be released for
recording, related developer's agreement executed, or permits for any type of construction issued
until payment of the bill occurs.
In the event that the Township and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of review fees which
are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and the Township shall follow the procedure for
resolution of disputes as set forth below in § 265-702 of this chapter, provided that the
professionals resolving such dispute shall be of the same profession or discipline as the
consultants whose fees are being disputed.
§ 265-702. Inspection fees.
The Township shall require the reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with the
inspection of public and private improvements, where the inspections represent that necessary to
ensure and verify the proper construction of said improvements in connection with Township
standards.

The Board shall submit to the applicant an itemized bill showing the work performed in connection
with the inspection of improvements performed, identifying the person performing the services and
the time and date spent for each task. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant shall, no later than 30
days after the date of transmittal of a bill for inspection services, notify the Township and the
Township Engineer that such inspection expenses are disputed as unreasonable or unnecessary
and shall explain the basis of their objections to the fees charged, in which case the Township
shall not delay or disapprove a request for release of financial security, a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to development due to the applicant's
dispute of inspection expenses. Failure of the applicant to dispute a bill within 30 days shall be a
waiver of the applicant's right to arbitration of that bill under this section.
Subsequent to the final release of financial security for completion of improvements for a
subdivision or land development, or any phase thereof, the Township Engineer shall submit to the
Board a bill for inspection services, specifically designated as a final bill. The final bill shall include
inspection fees incurred through the release of financial security.
If the Township Engineer and the applicant cannot agree on the amount of expenses which are
reasonable and necessary, then the applicant shall have the right, within 45 days of the transmittal
of the final bill or supplement to the final bill to the applicant, to request the appointment of another
Township Engineer to serve as an arbitrator. The applicant and Township Engineer whose fees are
being challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint another engineer to review any bills the
applicant has disputed and which remain unresolved and make a determination as to the amount
thereof which is reasonable and necessary. The arbitrator shall be of the same profession as the
Township Engineer whose fees are being challenged.
The arbitrator so appointed shall hear such evidence and review such documentation as the
arbitrator in his or her sole opinion deems necessary and shall render a decision no later than 50
days after the date of appointment. Based on the decision of the arbitrator, the applicant or the
Township Engineer whose fees were challenged shall be required to pay any amounts necessary
to implement the decision within 60 days. In the event the Township has paid the Township
Engineer an amount in excess of the amount determined to be reasonable and necessary, the
Township Engineer shall within 60 days reimburse the excess payment.
In the event that the Township's Township Engineer and applicant cannot agree upon the arbitrator
to be appointed within 20 days of the request for appointment of an arbitrator, then, upon
application of either party, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial
district in which the Township is located (or if at the time there be no President Judge, then the
senior active judge then sitting) shall appoint such arbitrator, who, in that case, shall be neither the
Township's Township Engineer nor any Township Engineer who has been retained by, or
performed services for, the Township or the applicant within the preceding five years.
The fee of the arbitrator shall be paid by the applicant if the review fee charged is sustained by the
arbitrator; otherwise it shall be divided equally between the parties. If the disputed fees are found
to be excessive by more than $5,000, the arbitrator shall have the discretion to assess the
arbitration fee in whole or in part against either the applicant or the Township Engineer. The Board
and the consultant whose fees are the subject of the dispute shall be parties to the proceeding.
Article VIII. Post-Approval Processes and Requirements
§ 265-800. Effect of preliminary approval.
Five-year rule. When an application for approval of a plat, whether preliminary or final, has been
approved or approved subject to conditions acceptable to the applicant, no subsequent change or
amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to

affect adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete any aspect of the
approved development in accordance with the terms of such approval within five years from such
approval. Where final approval is preceded by preliminary approval, the five-year period shall be
counted from the date of the preliminary approval. In the case of any doubt as to the terms of a
preliminary approval, the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of the governing
chapters or plans as they stood at the time when the application for such approval was duly filed.
Substantial completion rule. Where the landowner has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plat within the aforesaid five-year limit, or any extension
thereof as may be granted by the governing body, no change of municipal ordinances or plan
enacted subsequent to the date of filing of the preliminary plat shall modify or revoke any aspect of
the approved final plat pertaining to zoning classification or density, lot, building, street or utility
location.
Schedule of work. In the case of a preliminary plat calling for the installation of improvements
beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed by the landowner with the preliminary plat
delineating all proposed sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final plat
approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such schedule shall be updated annually by the
applicant or before the anniversary of the preliminary plat approval until final plat approval of the
final section has been granted, and any modification in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to
approval of the governing body, in its discretion.
Failure to adhere to schedule. Failure of the landowner to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plats for the various sections shall subject any such section to any and all
changes in zoning, subdivision and other governing ordinances enacted by the Township
subsequent to the date of the initial preliminary plan submission.
§ 265-801. Approval with conditions.
Where a plan is given an approval with conditions, the applicant shall provide a written acceptance of
said conditions within 30 days of the date on which the Township provided required notice of approval
to the applicant. Failure of the applicant to provide such acceptance within the aforesaid timeline shall
result in an automatic rescinding of the plan approval.
§ 265-802. Developer's agreement.
All major plans shall, upon final approval, require the execution of a developer's agreement, prepared
by or under the direction of the Township Solicitor, and at a minimum containing the following
information:
All recording information relating to the subject site.
Inclusion of approved land development plans as an attachment, where applicable.
All conditions applied by the Board.
Timeline of development related and reference to the financial security posted, as remedy to the
developer's failure to adhere to said timeline and improvements.
Assignment of the agreement's obligations to the developer's heirs and assigns.
Seal by a notary public, the Township, and the developer's corporation, where one exists.
Reference to the certificate of completion required by this chapter.
Requirement that covenants shall be recorded prior to the issuance of building permits on the site.

The agreement shall be produced in a format recordable with the Allegheny County Recorder of
Deeds and may be recorded at the discretion of either party, at that party's expense.
§ 265-803. Financial security or performance bond.
No plat or developer's agreement shall be signed or released, nor shall any permit be issued for
related subdivisions or land developments, unless all public and private improvements are
installed or until financial security is provided as follows.
The developer may post a performance bond with a federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending
institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such lending or other
forms of financial security acceptable to the Township. Such other forms shall be posted with a
bonding company or federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending institution is authorized to
conduct such business within the commonwealth.
The performance bond shall guarantee construction prior to a date also specified in the
developer's agreement and through the plan approval. The bond shall renew or guarantee the
availability of funds to the Township at least until 30 days beyond said date.
The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of the required improvements
shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion estimated as of 90 days following the date
scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the Township may adjust the amount of the
financial security by comparing the actual cost of the improvements that have been completed and
the estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration of the
90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or a rescheduled date of
completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Township may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals said 110%. The developer
shall post any additional security in accordance with this section.
The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the cost of
completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant or developer and prepared by
a professional engineer licensed as such in this commonwealth and certified by such engineer to
be a fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township, upon the recommendation of the
municipal engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or
developer and the Township are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the estimate shall be
recalculated and recertified by another professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and chosen mutually by the Township and the applicant or developer. The
estimate certified by the third engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the
final estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said
engineer shall be paid equally by the Township and the applicant or developer.
If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date of posting of
the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from
posting of financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year
period by using the above bidding procedure.
In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Township may authorize
submission of final plats by section or stages of development subject to such requirements or
guarantees as to improvements in future sections or stages of development as it finds essential for
the protection of any finally approved section of the development.
As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial
security may request the Township to release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such

portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors performing
the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the Township, and the Township shall
have 45 days from receipt of such request within which to allow the municipal engineer to certify,
in writing, to the Township that such portion of the work upon the improvements has been
competed in accordance with the approved plat. Upon such certification the Township shall
authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as estimated by the
municipal engineer fairly representing the value of the improvements completed or, if the Township
fails to act within said forty-five-day period, the Township shall be deemed to have approved the
release of funds as requested. The Township may, prior to final release at the time of completion
and certification by its Engineer, require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements.
§ 265-804. Release of recordable plat.
The developer shall submit two recordable Mylars to the Township for the application of all
signatures and seals required, in a form as approved by the Board at final plan approval.
Upon the completion of conditions specified in the approval, posting of required bonding or
construction of improvements, and execution of the developer's agreement, the Township may
affix all signatures to a plat. In the case where a recordable plat is signed, the Township shall
require the deposit of an escrow to be released upon the delivery of a recorded Mylar to the
Township. The escrow shall be determined by resolution or ordinance and shall be sufficient to
cover the costs of obtaining a Mylar copy of the recorded document.
§ 265-805. Release of performance bond.
When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate improvements, the
developer shall notify the Township, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion of
the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township Engineer. The
Township shall, within 10 days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the Township
Engineer to inspect all of the aforesaid improvements. The Township Engineer shall, thereupon,
file a report, in writing, with the Township, and shall promptly mail a copy of the same to the
developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall be made and mailed within 30 days after
receipt by the Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board; said report shall
be detailed and shall indicate approval or rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part,
and if said improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be rejected by the
Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of reasons for such rejection.
The Board, based upon the Township Engineer's report, shall take action to approve or reject, in
whole in or in part, the aforesaid improvements and shall notify the developer within 15 days of
receipt of the Engineer's report, in writing by certified or registered mail of the Board's action with
relation thereto.
Failure of the Board to act within the aforementioned timeline shall constitute a deemed approval
of the improvements.
The Township shall require the posting of a maintenance bond for all public improvements,
including recreational equipment, to be dedicated to the Township. The bond shall equal 15% of
the accepted cost of construction accepted by the Township Engineer and developer and
approved by the Board at final approval and shall be posted for a period of 18 months from the
date of acceptance of said improvements. The bond or bonds shall be posted prior to the
acceptance of any related public improvements.
§ 265-806. Release of amenities bonds.

Where private improvements, excepting streets, are approved, including but not limited to
landscaping and private recreational facilities, the developer may separately post an amenities
bond for the private improvements in the same manner and under the same criteria, requirements,
and dispute resolution options afforded public improvements, outlined in § 265-804.
Release of amenities bonds. The developer shall follow all procedures outlined in § 265-804.
The Board, through the adoption of this chapter, authorizes the Township Engineer to finally
approve the release of said bonds. The Engineer shall provide a report in accordance with the
timelines outlined in § 265-804, except that where the report does not contain a final decision, said
decision shall be mailed to the developer via certified or registered mail within 15 days of the
mailing of said report.
§ 265-807. Rights of developer.
Nothing in this article, however, shall be construed to limit the developer's right to contest or question,
by legal proceedings or otherwise, any determination of the Board or the Township Engineer.
§ 265-808. Certificate of completion.
All land developments shall require a certificate of completion prior to the issuance of occupancy
permits for establishment or dwelling units therein.
The developer shall submit a formal request, in writing, to the Township Manager.
The Manager shall direct the Zoning Officer and Township Engineer to review the completeness of
all improvements related thereto and the fulfillment of any outstanding conditions imposed through
the Board's conditional approval.
Final acceptance of public improvements and private amenities shall occur prior to the issuance of
a certificate of completion.
The Manager, based upon the reports of the Zoning Officer and Township Engineer, shall issue or
deny the issuance of the certificate of completion within 20 days of the submitted request.
§ 265-809. As-built drawings.
Upon completion of the public and/or private improvements in a plan, as-built plans and profiles of
the public and/or private improvements, as constructed, shall be filed with the Zoning Officer by
the developer within 10 days of the mailing of a the formal remittance accepting the construction of
public or private improvements. A sepia and print of each as-built drawing for public improvements
shall be submitted. As-built plans and profiles shall be marked "as-built" and shall contain the final
grade of all sanitary and storm sewers and appurtenances.
As-built drawings shall be submitted prior to the issuance of a certificate of completion or the
Board's acceptance, by ordinance, of public streets or recreational facilities.

Twenty-five-percent requirement. Each section in any residential subdivision or land development,
except for the last phase, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the total number of dwelling units as
depicted on the preliminary plan. Provided that the landowner has not defaulted with regard to or
violated any of the conditions of the preliminary plat approval, including compliance with the
landowner's aforesaid schedule of submission of final plats for the various sections, then the
protections afforded by substantially completing the improvements depicted upon the final plat within
five years of the preliminary plat approval or the aforesaid schedule shall apply. For any section or
sections beyond the initial section in which the required improvements have not been substantially
completed within said five-year period, the aforesaid protections shall apply for an additional term or
terms of three years from the date of final plat approval for each section.
§ 265-901. Lot, block and building location design standards.
Lots shall be designed in a manner which accommodates driveway access from a street
commensurate with the requirements of this chapter without excessive grading accomplished by a
driveway not exceeding 10% of elevation with reasonable transition areas thereto from the street
to the proposed building or structure.
Lots shall be designed in a manner which permits a reasonable building area, determined by the
setbacks and related zoning requirements of the district in which the lot lies, outside of existing
steep slopes.
No block shall be longer than 2,000 feet nor less than 500 feet, except in unusual circumstances
or where comparable levels of safety are assured. Where a loop street exists, the street or block
length shall bear a minimum of 500 feet and a maximum of 4,000 feet, where the two-thousandfoot
maximum is measured from each intersection.
Where a subdivision adjoins a major highway the greater dimension of the block shall front along
such major highway to minimize the number of ingress or egress.
Lots shall be so designed that access to said lots is made to the furthest extent possible, in
consideration of street construction and design standards, through the natural or existing grades
and topography.
Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances, land located in any designated
floodplain district may be platted for development with the provision that the developer construct
all buildings and structures to preclude flood damage in accordance with this and any other laws
and ordinances regulating such development.[1]
Editor's Note: See also Ch. 154, Flood Damage Prevention.
Proposed lots shall bear a reasonable building area in consideration of disturbance limits placed
upon areas of steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, and watercourses.
Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or accommodation shall not be
permitted in any designated floodway district. Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the
floodway district if the sites or dwelling units are elevated up to the regulatory flood elevation. If fill
is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend out laterally for a distance of at
least 15 feet beyond the limits of the proposed structures.
Building sites for structures or buildings other than for residential uses shall also not be permitted
in any designated flood district. Also, such sites for structures or buildings outside the floodway
shall be protected as provided for above. However, the Township may allow the subdivision and/or
development of areas or sites for commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below the
regulatory flood elevation if the developer otherwise protects the area to that height or assures
that the buildings or structures will be floodproofed at least up to that height.

No structure, street, access drive, or parking facility shall be constructed in a manner which
disturbs areas of steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, and watercourses, other than in a manner
expressly permitted by this chapter.
Through lots, namely in residential areas, shall be discouraged.
Pedestrian easements within a ten-foot easement may be required by the Board of
Commissioners for pedestrian circulation through blocks of over 800 feet in length and shall be
integrated into open space areas, where applicable. The Board may require improvement of said
area as sidewalks according to Township specifications.
Flag lots. Flag lots are permitted under the following circumstances:
One flag lot is permitted per existing or proposed block.
The strip accessing the portion of the lot, the width of which is less than the minimum lot width
at the building line, shall not extend more than 500 feet from the right-of-way from which it is
accessed.
The access strip, as described, shall be subject to all site distance requirements otherwise
applicable to the respective type of access proposed.
The net area of the lot, excluding the access strip, shall meet the minimum lot size
requirements within the respective district as imposed by Chapter 300, Zoning.
§ 265-902. General street design and construction standards.
The arrangement of streets shall be in compliance with the Township's Official Map, where said
map exists.
In general all streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing streets and shall compose
a convenient system to insure circulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, with exception that
local streets shall be laid out to include the use of loop and cul-de-sac streets, such that their use
by through traffic will be discouraged.
All streets shall be graded to the full right-of-way width thereof to grades established by the plan.
All fills shall be thoroughly compacted by approved methods to the satisfaction of the Township
Engineer and completely settled before any paving is placed thereon.
Where in the judgment of the Township Engineer pipe and/or stone underdrains are required, the
developer shall construct such underdrains under the direction of the Township Engineer.
Streets, including access drives and alleys, shall have a grade not to exceed 7% for a distance
within 25 feet of the right-of-way line of any intersecting street.
Intersections of more than two streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such
intersection shall be designed with care for safety, and suitable curbs, barriers, signs and other
devices in accordance with PennDOT standards may be required.
Streets entering opposite sides of another street shall be laid out either directly opposite one
another or else shall have a minimum offset of 150 feet between the center lines of said opposite
streets.
Where a proposed development abuts or encompasses an existing or proposed collector or
arterial street, marginal access streets, reverse frontage lots with buffer yards, or deep lots with
rear service alleys may be required in order to protect properties and provide separation of
through and local traffic.

Major street standards. All land developments and subdivisions bearing frontage on State Route
30 shall be limited to one access per the parcel existing at the time of approval, in recognition of
the following standards.
Access drives or streets proposed within 400 feet of existing streets and access drives shall
be located the greatest distance from said intersections given site distance requirements
relating to the proposed access, greatest distance possible from public street intersections,
and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation highway occupancy permit requirements.
In cases where a subdivision of a parcel bearing frontage on Route 30 is proposed, the
applicant shall provide an access easement, in consideration of all standards outlined in this
chapter, which demonstrates one point of access and provides for a marginal access street to
all parcels involved.
The Board may require similar easements and access limitations on other arterials within the
Township based upon findings of required traffic studies, known safety issues and accident
histories, the Official Map, and the reasonable ability to utilize existing marginal access
streets.
Private street maintenance. Where private streets are proposed, maintenance shall be
demonstrated through homeowner's or condominium association declaration documents or
covenants in a form acceptable to the Township Solicitor as a means of providing maintenance of
the streets as proposed and approved, including winter maintenance. Where no such association
is proposed, namely in minor plans, a note shall be affixed to the final plat giving notice to all
owners of lots within the plan that each shall share equitably in the aforesaid maintenance.
Association documents, as required, shall be recorded with the final plat.
Where the grade of the street is above or below the grade of the adjacent land, walls or slopes

land.
Slopes exceeding 40%. No development or disturbance shall be allowed on slopes exceeding
40%. Limited disturbance for utilities may be allowed where no reasonable alternative location
exists.
Where construction is proposed in accordance with this section, within or disturbing steep slopes,
the applicant shall include a geotechnical report, acceptable to the Township Engineer. The report
shall demonstrate a safety factor of 1.5 of greater and shall outline a revegetation plan ensuring
immediate and long-term stability.
§ 265-1102. Undermined areas.
No land development involving construction of buildings and no subdivision of land intended to
create lots for building construction shall be approved on a site which has been undermined at
shallow depths or in an area where there is evidence of past subsidence unless the applicant
demonstrates that the proposed subdivision or land development will be safe and will not create
hazards for adjacent properties. Evidence of safety shall be one of the following.
If the site or any area of the site has been undermined and has 100 feet or less of
overburden, evidence of the safety of the proposed subdivision or land development shall
require site investigation and certification in writing by a professional engineer, experienced in
subsidence risk assessment, that the proposed development will be safe.
If the site has been undermined and has more than 100 feet of overburden, a subsidence risk
assessment included in a geotechnical report by a professional engineer and written
certification that the proposed subdivision or land development will be safe may be required if
the Township, Township Engineer, or applicant has knowledge of any past occurrences of
subsidence in the general vicinity of the site.
The Board may require the installation of certain construction measures accepted by the Township
Engineer as per recommendations of the risk assessment required, as a condition of building
permit(s) on the site. The Board may further require the inclusion of such standards in the plan
covenants, as a note on the plat, or through a developer's agreement applicable to the developer's
heirs and assigns.
§ 265-1103. Landslide-prone areas.
No grading, removal of vegetation, construction or other disturbance shall be permitted on soils that
are classified as slide-prone or unstable in the Soil Survey of Allegheny County or on any other areas
of a proposed development site that exhibit signs of instability, except in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
Disturbance of landslide-prone areas of construction thereon shall be severely limited.
Disturbance of unstable areas may be permitted, where alternative site designs have been
exhausted, and where the developer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Township Engineer

in writing by a registered soils engineer, engineering geologist or professional engineer with
experience in soils engineering that the proposed activity will not create or exacerbate unsafe
conditions.

§ 265-1104. Watercourses and wetlands.
Setback or open space easement required. No grading, cutting, filling, removal or vegetation, or
other disturbance of land shall be permitted within the required setback.
The minimum setback for watercourses shall be 20 feet, measured from the top of the channel
bank. In addition, land development involving the construction of new buildings shall not be
permitted within 100 feet of the top of the bank of the Monongahela River.
The setback for wetlands shall be 50 feet for wetlands one acre or greater and 25 feet for
wetlands less than one acre or at a variable setback depth, based on a wetland management plan
prepared by a certified professional wetlands biologist. In no case, however, shall the setback be
less than 10 feet from the delineated edge of a wetland less than one acre in extent; or 20 feet
from the delineated edge of a wetland one acre or more in extent.
Minor earth disturbance and construction within the area of the required setback or easement,
required for development in other areas of the site, may be allowed in accordance with all
regulations of the Department of Environmental Protection and Township floodplain regulations,
where applicable.
Construction may also be allowed within the required setback area of rivers to enable the
development of uses that require proximity or access to the river, in accordance with applicable
federal, DEP and municipal regulations.
This section shall not withstand the ability of a developer to utilize wetland mitigation measures
offered by the DEP. Approval of all applicable permits, associated bonding, and other
commitments guaranteeing the completion shall then become a condition of approval to be
provided prior to plan recording.
Article XII. Open Space and Land Dedication Standards
§ 265-1200. Purpose.
The Township aims to conserve, enhance, and promote the use and retention of common open
space, including active and passive open space, to develop a network of recreation, parks, trails,
and interconnected natural areas.
The Township also aims to protect environmentally sensitive areas including steep slopes and
wetlands as a natural resource and integral part of open space.
§ 265-1201. Dedication of open space; standards.
All developers of major residential subdivisions or land developments, excluding those creating
five or less dwelling units, shall dedicate open space commensurate with the number of dwelling
units proposed and in a manner meeting the standards of this article and the North Versailles
Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open Space Plan.
A deed for the dedication of land required for a particular phase of a plan shall be provided prior to
the release of the plat for recordation, not withstanding the Board's right to accept alternative
instruments guaranteeing the reservation of required land for public dedication or the developer's
reservation of all open space in a preliminary plan as subsequently authorized herein.

Preliminary plans. Where open space is dedicated in a phased plan, the first phase shall include
all such space required on the preliminary plat or the developer shall ensure the reservation of the
remaining land through deed covenants or reservations acceptable to the Township Solicitor.
Open space shall be dedicated at a minimum rate of 0.0223 acres per dwelling unit proposed.
Where the aforesaid rate of dedication does not provide at least an area equal to the minimum lot
size for a single-family home in the respective zoning district in which the development is located,
the developer shall provide the remaining amount as the minimum required. The Board may waive
this additional requirement when the location and size of the additional land on the site is
undesirable for the purposes recommended in the Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open
Space Plan.
The Parks and Recreation Department and Recreation Board shall provide a recommendation to
the Board within the time allotted for review by the Planning Commission. The Board shall
consider said recommendation in its implementation of the Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and
Open Space Plan through the evaluation of the open space proposed and consideration of any
mutual agreement with the developer regarding alternatives described in this article, including but
not limited to fee-in-lieu and construction of facilities.
While the Board may require public dedication of land to the Township, the Board and developer
may mutually agree to dedicate the required land to a homeowners' association. In such a case,
the Township Solicitor, prior to final approval, shall approve easements, covenants, homeowners'
association documents or condominium declarations. The aforesaid instruments shall ensure the
availability of the land to the residents of the subject plan, long-term maintenance with provisions
guaranteeing such in favor of the Township wherein properties within the Township may equitably
lien properties within the plan for work completed where the related association defaults on such
maintenance, preservation of wooded areas and other natural resources, and the perpetual usage
of the land for the intended open space or recreational purposes.
§ 265-1202. Site selection standards.
The land offered for dedication shall be accessible to residents in a manner commensurate with
National Recreation and Park Association (NRPA) standards, in terms of service radius. The land
shall bear at least 50 feet or the minimum lot frontage required for single-family homes within the
zoning district in which the plan is constructed, whichever is greater, unless portions of the land
are accepted for the use of trails by the Board.
At least 25% of the land dedicated shall be active recreational land and shall be comprised of one
contiguous tract area averaging 50 feet in width.
No more than 25% of the land required to be dedicated shall include areas of wetlands,
watercourses, and floodplains, unless the Board finds that additional dedication of such land
provides an integral asset to active or passive recreational interests and furthers the objectives of
the Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open Space Plan.
Public sewer and water shall be available to land dedicated.
Land provided shall not be unduly burned by utility easements and rights-of-way, slide-prone soils,
and undermining such that active and passive recreational uses commensurate with the
Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open Space Plan are unreasonably inhibited.
The configuration of dedicated land shall consider open space corridors, trails, and connections
noted in the Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open Space Plan, Official Map, and other
applicable plans as formally recognized by the Township.

§ 265-1203. Alternatives to land dedication.
Fee in lieu of land dedication.
The developer, upon mutual agreement with the Township, where each finds that the
provision of adequate recreational facilities for the future residents of the subject subdivision
or land development are better served by the acquisition or expansion of recreational facilities
developed directly by the Township, may provide a fee in lieu of land dedication otherwise
required.
The fee, charged on a unit basis, shall be reasonably commensurate with the average value
of undeveloped residentially zoned land throughout the Township on a per acre basis divided
by 0.223 acres required with reasonable consideration for the additional costs of grading
improvements required to provide proper active recreational areas. The per-unit fee in lieu of
land dedication shall be $800 per dwelling unit.
The fee shall be allocated to a specific park accessible to the future residents of the plan per
NRPA Standards, to be utilized in the purchase of additional land, development thereof, or
installation of additional facilities. The fee shall be deposited in an interest-bearing account
clearly identifying the recreational facility or project for which the fee was received. Interest
earned shall become a fund of that account.
Upon request of any person who paid any fee under this subsection, the Township shall
refund such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment, if the Township
has failed to utilize the fee paid for the purposes set forth in this section within three years
from the date such fee was paid.
The developer shall consent to the allocation of the fee in lieu to a particular park or project
through the acceptance of a specific condition noted such in the Board's approval of the
respective subdivision or land development.
The fee-in-lieu authorized by this chapter shall, upon receipt by the Township, be deposited in
an interest-bearing account, clearly identifying the specific recreation facilities for which the
fee was received. Interest earned on such accounts shall become funds of that account.
Funds from such accounts shall be expended only in properly allocable portions of the cost
incurred to construct the specific recreation facilities for which the funds were collected.
Upon request of any person who paid any fee under this article, the Township shall refund
such fee, plus interest accumulated thereon from the date of payment, if the Township has
failed to utilize the fee paid for the purposes set forth in this article within three years from the
date such fee was paid.
Construction of facilities.
Where the developer proposes the construction of recreational facilities accessible to the
residents of the proposed plan, the Board may accept the value of these facilities as a
fulfillment of the requirements of this section if the value meets of exceeds the fee in lieu
otherwise required for the development.
The facilities shall meet applicable safety and construction standards, including the
Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code and NRPA standards.
The Board shall find that the proposed facilities equate to the needs of the anticipated
residents of a plan and provide the types of recreation and open space recommended in the
Comprehensive Park, Recreation, and Open Space Plan.

A.
B.
The Board, upon mutual agreement with the developer, may accept a combination of land, fees,
and facilities where the value of all land, fees, and facilities equal or exceed the value of the fee in
lieu of land dedication required for the site. The land value assigned shall equal the per unit fee-inlieu
for every 0.223 acres of land offered, or fraction thereof.
§ 265-1204. Financial guarantees.
The Board shall require the posting of security necessary to guarantee the construction of facilities
or grading of active recreational land as public improvements.
Said dedication shall be required for construction and improvements to land that is approved to be
publicly dedicated and that land that shall be privately owned and maintained.
Article XIII. Waivers and Modifications
§ 265-1300. Applicability.
The Board may grant a modification or waiver of the requirements of one or more provisions of this
chapter if the literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to
the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public interest and that
the purpose and intent of this chapter is observed.
§ 265-1301. Granting of modification.
The Board may grant a request for a modification of the requirements of this chapter where the
developer or applicant demonstrates that the performance objectives of the subject provision are met
or exceeded by the modification proposed.
§ 265-1302. Application for modification.
All requests for a modification shall be in writing and shall accompany and be a part of the application
for development. The request shall state in full the grounds and facts of unreasonableness or hardship
on which the request is based, the provision or provisions of this chapter involved and the minimum
modification necessary.
§ 265-1303. Evidence required.
Where an alternative to adopted ordinance requirements is proposed, absent the claim of a hardship is
presented, the applicant shall submit sufficient evidence to substantiate the equal of greater
performance of the proposed alternative versus that required by this chapter.
§ 265-1304. Review of request.
The request shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission, wherein the Commission's
recommendation to the Board shall include specific reference to the modification of waiver requested.

Article XIV. Enforcement; Violations and Penalties
§ 265-1400. Preventative remedies.
The Township shall refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to further improve or
develop any real property which has been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of this chapter. Aforesaid development shall include any improvement of a
property substantially inconsistent with an approved land development or subdivision, any conditions
related thereto as accepted by the applicant, or the construction of a land development in violation of
this chapter. The authority to deny such a permit or approval shall apply to any of the following
applicants:
The owner of record at the time of such violation.
The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such violation without regard as to
whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the time of violation without
regard as to whether such current owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent to the
time of violation without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval to any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the development of any such real
property, the Township may require compliance with the conditions that would have been
applicable to the property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real property.
§ 265-1401. Enforcement remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the provisions of this chapter
shall, upon being found liable therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the
Township, pay a judgment of not more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable
attorney fees incurred by the municipality as a result thereof.
No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable until the date of the determination
of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment,
the Township may enforce the judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each
day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless the district justice
determining that there has been a violation further determines that there was a good faith basis for
the person, partnership or corporation violating this chapter to have believed that there was no
such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the
fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice and thereafter
each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation.
Article XV. Amendments
§ 265-1500. Procedure.

the Township and any other political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or
transfer may agree that, instead of limiting their respective rates to 1/2 of the rate herein provided,

Act formerly codified in 53 P.S. § 6901 et seq. have been revised and renumbered. See now 53

due, shall be added and collected.
§ 270-5. Exempt parties.
The United States, the commonwealth or any of their instrumentalities, agencies or political
subdivisions shall be exempt from payment of the tax imposed by this article. The exemption of such
governmental bodies shall not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the

previously recorded, but which does not extend or limit existing record legal title or interest.
A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration of property passed by
testate or intestate succession and held by covenants; however, if any of the parties take
shares greater in value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.

wife who have since been divorced, provided the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to the granting of the
final decree in divorce, between parent and child or the spouse of such child, between brother
or sister or spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a brother or
sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except
that a subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the
grantor were making such transfer.

A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an ordinary trust where the
transfer of the same property would be exempt if the transfer was made directly from the
grantor to all of the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are contingent or
specifically named. No such exemption shall be granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is
presented with a copy of the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all possible

party; or ii) from or to an agent or straw party where, if the agent or straw party were his
principal, no tax would be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that the property was acquired by
the grantee from, or for the benefit of, his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee claims an
exemption from taxation under this subsection.

division of a nonprofit corporation, except where the department reasonably determines that
the primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is avoidance of the tax imposed
by this article.
A transfer from a corporation or association of real estate held of record in the name of the
corporation or association where the grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in
the association in the same proportion as his interest in or ownership of the real estate being
conveyed and where the stock of the corporation or the interest in the association has been
held by the grantee for more than two years.

conveyed by the grantee to that agency or authority as security for a debt of the grantee or a
transfer to a nonprofit industrial development agency or authority.

directly from it, but only if: i) the grantee shall directly use such real estate for the primary
purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing, publishing, research and
development, transportation, energy conversion, energy production, pollution control,
warehousing or agriculture; and ii) the agency or authority has the full ownership interest in
the real estate transferred.
A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in default in lieu of a

The Township Board of Commissioners may hereinafter designate and regulate parking on all
public streets by simple resolution duly enacted. The Board of Commissioners may determine in
its sole discretion how parking shall be regulated on public streets by either banning parking on
one or both sides, or determining that parked vehicles must park with two wheels off the paved
portion of the roadway so long as the vehicle remains inside the public right-of-way. All such
determinations shall be posted in the sole discretion of the Township Board of Commissioners.
§ 282-3. Continuation of existing regulations.
The provisions of this chapter, so far as they are the same as those of ordinances and regulations in
force immediately before the enactment of this chapter, are intended as a continuation of those earlier
ordinances and regulations, and not as new enactments. Nothing in this chapter shall affect any act
done or liability incurred, or any suit or prosecution pending or to be instituted under any of those
repealed or superseded ordinances or regulations.
§ 282-4. Temporary and emergency regulations.
The Board of Commissioners shall have the following powers to regulate traffic and parking
temporarily and in time of emergency:
In the case of fire, flood, storm or other emergency, to establish temporary traffic and/or
parking regulations; and
In the case of emergency or to facilitate public works, or in the conduct of parades,
processions or public events, to restrict or prohibit traffic and/or parking in limited areas for
periods of not more than 72 hours.
Such temporary and emergency regulations shall be enforced by the Police Department in the
same manner as permanent regulations. Any person who shall operate or park a vehicle or tractor
in violation of any such regulations, or who shall move, remove, destroy, injure or deface any sign
or marking erected, posted or made to give notice of any such regulation, shall, upon conviction
thereof, be subject to the penalty set forth in the law or elsewhere in this chapter for a violation of
such nature, and, in case of a violation for which no specific penalty is set forth in the law or
elsewhere in this chapter, to a fine of not more than $25 together with costs of prosecution.
§ 282-5. Experimental regulations.
The Board of Commissioners may, from time to time by resolution, designate places upon and along
the highways in the Township where for a period of not more than 90 days, specific traffic and/or
parking regulations, prohibitions and restrictions shall be in force and effect, and shall designate such
locations by proper signs and markings. Such regulations, prohibitions and restrictions shall be
effective as if they had been specified in this chapter. No person shall operate or park a vehicle or
tractor in violation of any such regulation, prohibition or restriction, and no person shall move, remove,
destroy or deface any sign or marking erected, posted or made by authority of this section. Any person
who shall violate any provision of this section shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to the penalty
set forth in the law or elsewhere in this chapter for a violation of such nature, and in case of a violation
for which no specific penalty is set forth in the law or elsewhere in this chapter, to a fine of not more
than $25 together with costs of prosecution; provided, the purpose of this section is to allow for the test

the written request of such person. Thereafter, following the erection of appropriate signage in
accordance with the Motor Vehicle Code, that space may only be used by persons who are in fact
disabled persons or severely handicapped veterans in compliance with Subsection A. The
Township shall be under no obligation to create such spaces, but may do so in its sole discretion

fine of not more than $15 and costs, provided that it shall be the duty of the police officers and of
parking enforcement personnel of the Township to report to the appropriate official all violations of
any provision of this article, indicating, in each case: the section violated; the license number of
the vehicle involved in the violation; the location where the violation took place; and any other
facts that might be necessary in order to secure a clear understanding of the circumstances
attending the violation. The police officer or other person making the report shall also attach to or
place upon every such vehicle a notice stating that the vehicle was parked in violation of this
article. The notice shall contain instructions to the owner or driver of the vehicle that if he will
report to the office of the Chief of Police and pay the sum of $5 within 48 hours after the time of
the notice, or if he will place the sum of $5 within the envelope provided and mail or deliver it to
the Township office, that act will save the violator from prosecution and from payment of the fine
and costs prescribed in the first sentence of this section.
In lieu of payment of fine, the Magisterial District Judge of competent jurisdiction is authorized to
sentence a violator to 30 days in jail. It is determined that each day of parking shall be a separate
offense. In order to allow free and easy access to fire, police, ambulance and snow removal
vehicles, in the sole discretion of the Chief of Police, vehicles may be summarily towed if they
interfere with the movement and passage of such vehicles.

Commissioners shall delete from its list of approved storage garages any garage that makes any
unapproved charge in connection with any vehicle removed or impounded under this chapter.
§ 282-44. Payment of towing and storage charges.
The payment of any towing and storage charges authorized by this chapter shall, unless payment is
made under protest, be final and conclusive, and shall constitute a waiver of any right to recover the
money so paid. If payment of any towing or storage charges is made under protest, the offender shall
be entitled to a hearing before a district justice. Payment of towing and storage charges shall not
relieve the owner or driver of any vehicle from liability for any fine or penalty for the violation of the
provision of this chapter for which the vehicle was removed or impounded.
§ 282-45. Reclamation costs.
In order to reclaim his vehicle, the owner shall pay towing and storage costs, plus a fee of $25, of

property through adverse possession or any other legal claim to said property shall adhere to the
standards of its respective zoning district classification.
Zoning classifications as initially determined follow existing parcel boundaries, as defined by
recorded deeds. However, the revision, through subdivision, or current boundary lines does not
constitute any revision of zoning district boundaries, which shall retain the boundary of the original
lot line, unless an amendment to the Zoning Map and the Zoning Ordinance is approved.

In cases where the lines of a zoning district, as initially determined by the Zoning Map, cross a
parcel such that the parcel possesses multiple areas of zoning classification, said lines shall be
determined as lines extending from the most adjacent parcel or lot boundary, where the zoning
extends to said boundary, to the next immediate lot or parcel boundary to which the zoning
boundary of the particular district coincides. The aforementioned situations occur, initially, on
through lots where one face of the block on which the through lot fronts possesses one zoning and
the other lies within a different zoning district.
Permitted use interpretation.
The permitted uses defined in this chapter are based upon the North American Industrial
Classification Standard, 2002. Uses are listed by the numerical code, as defined and
presented in the aforesaid national standard. As such, uses listed at particular code levels
shall be inclusive of all specific uses classified as part of the listed code level, unless such
more detailed uses are specifically exempted or restricted.
Where any use specifically defined within this chapter conflicts with the use definitions utilized
by the North American Industrial Classification Code, the use defined in this chapter shall
prevail. Therefore, when uses specifically defined within this chapter separate from or
conflicting with the NAICS Code are presented or specifically restricted, the function and
intent of said uses shall prevail against any such conflicting interpretations as defined in the
NAICS Code.
No portion of this chapter shall be interpreted such that it violates the Federal Fair Housing
Act, the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act, and related Housing and Urban Development
regulations. In particular, the term "family" shall apply to unrelated members regardless of
their membership in classes protected by the aforementioned acts and regulations, including
handicap.
§ 300-401. Use performance standards.

shall further define the character of the use. Any use which cannot demonstrate compliance with the
following performance standards shall not be deemed as an authorized use.
No use shall, as part of its production process, emit any hazardous materials in any manner.
Storage of hazardous materials shall be within a principal structure.
Storage of hazardous waste shall be within a principal building and shall not constitute a principal
use; whereby said storage shall be temporary, being permanently disposed of off site.
No use shall be noxious or offensive by reason of the emission of odor, dust, fumes, smoke, gas,
vibration or noise detectable at the property line as to constitute a nuisance or otherwise conflict
with any municipal ordinance.
No establishment, excepting municipal and school district activities, as part of its regular
operations, shall exceed the noise levels as measured at the property lines of the parcel upon
which the establishment is operated in the following manners:
The sound level at any one point in time exceeds 90 decibels.
The sound exceeds any of the established limits in Subsection E(1) by a measured sound
level of 10 dB(A) for a cumulative total of one minute or more out of any ten-minute period.

impervious areas improved as sidewalks or paved as parking lots pursuant to the construction
standards of the respective municipality. Said areas specifically designated or intended for the use
of such displays shall not exceed 15% of the gross floor area of the associated establishment.

Article V. Establishment of Zoning Districts
§ 300-500. Establishment and purpose of Districts.
In order to encourage and promote those purposes outlined in Article II of this chapter as well as the
Planning Area's community development objectives, North Versailles Township hereby establishes the
following zoning districts, the purposes of which are hereinafter defined:
N, Neighborhood Use. The Neighborhood Use District aims to maintain and enhance the vitality
and sustainability of the traditional cores of the boroughs. The establishment of this district aims
maintain the stability of residential neighborhoods while permitting businesses which are either
ancillary to or present a low impact on these neighborhoods. Additional forms of office or smallscale
retail are permitted such that they contribute to the economic vitality of the neighborhood
and the entire planning area without negative impact upon the basic residential and small
business environment of the district. Additionally, the residential mix of this district aims to provide
for alternative housing needs, such as those of the elderly, within a pedestrian environment
offering nearby basic services.
MU, Mixed-Use. The Mixed-Use District is established to provide for single-family based
residential uses, residential uses of compatible scale, and retail and office designed to serve local
and regional market demands. The district therefore primarily aims to maintain a neighborhood
scale of development in portions of Route 30 currently bearing a traditional mixed-use scale of
development and to provide a market-based, yet compatible, transition of residences fronting key
north-south collectors of North Versailles.
M, Office and Manufacturing. The Office and Manufacturing District provides for the development
of office and production-oriented industries, along with ancillary retail uses in a park-like setting
with convenient access to arterial corridors. The Office and Manufacturing District also provides
opportunities for the development and redevelopment of smaller tracts of land speculatively
intended to be used as or initially used as industrial sites. The Office and Manufacturing District
aims to promote the development and redevelopment of said properties while protecting and
sustaining the character of adjoining residential uses.
GR, General Retail. The General Commercial District encompasses regional, large-scale retail
centers with convenient access to Route 30 and major arterial interchanges. The district may
include office and health care services of a similar nature.

R-3, Multifamily Residential. The Multifamily District aims to provide an affordable alternative form
of housing to seniors, younger families, and smaller households in an environment near
commercial and retail conveniences.
R-2, Neighborhood Residential. The district protects the stability and integrity of the Planning
Area's oldest residential neighborhoods, which are primarily situated on relatively small lots near
the traditional main corridors of the Boroughs and specific areas of the Township.
R-1, Low-Density Single-Family Residential. The R-1 District encompasses lands currently
established as suburban residential plans or comparatively larger scale residential lots in areas of
limited environmental constraints. The district encourages infill development and the sustenance
of the low-density residential development existing.
P- Neighborhood Park. The Neighborhood Park District is established to provide for the
recreational needs of the Planning Area's residents. This district is intended to enhance the quality
of life and sense of community by providing passive and active recreational amenities in parks and
general open space.
§ 300-501. General district standards.
The above districts are depicted on the Zoning Map of North Versailles Township, which is
incorporated as part of this chapter and is filed at the Township Office.

All signage shall comply with § 300-901, Signs, of this chapter.
All lighting specifications and intensities shall comply with § 300-906, Lighting standards, of this
chapter.
All parking specifications and standards shall comply with § 300-902, Parking requirements, of this
chapter.

Lots of Record, and Uses, of this chapter.
The placement and screening of buildings and parking shall be subject to § 300-907, Yard and
buffering standards, of this chapter.
All residential districts (R-R, R-1, R-2, and R-3) shall bear up to one principal structure per lot.
Mixed-Use and Neighborhood Use Districts shall bear up to one principal structure per lot.
Single-family and duplex structures in the R-3, Multifamily District, may adhere to the setbacks

Article VI. Planned Residential Development
§ 300-600. Purpose.
The municipality of the Planning Area establishes planned residential development in forms authorized
by district for the following purposes:
To provide an adequate array of housing opportunities and choices for existing and future
residents of the Planning Area; and
To encourage the preservation of wooded hillsides and open space throughout the Planning Area;
and
To facilitate connected open space throughout the Planning Area in a manner consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan; and
To encourage the development of unique nodes of residential and mixed-use development that
are properly integrated into adjacent transportation networks and uses with properly buffering and
separation from traditional neighborhoods and mixed-use development; and
To provide for development and redevelopment in sustainable forms and proportions; and
To further the general and municipal community development objectives upon which this Zoning
Ordinance is based.
§ 300-601. Residential community PRD development standards.
Common open space. Forty percent of the site shall be dedicated as common open space
adhering to the following standards.
Said open space shall be distributed in a manner that provides adequate buffering from
adjacent neighborhoods of differing housing type and design, in a manner in which adjacent
neighborhoods of varied or contrasting character are bordered by open space. Topography,
landscaping, and types of adjacent uses shall determine said adequacy.

Five percent of the open space required shall be distributed in central areas of the plan,
directly visible from and faced by housing constructed therein. Such open space shall bear at
least 50 feet of frontage on streets within the planned residential development. The grading of
said open space shall not exceed 8%.
The common open space shall be distributed in such a manner so as to preserve, by private
covenant in favor of the respective municipality in which it is located and by the PRD itself,
wooded hillsides and other valuable natural features within the plan, including jurisdictional
wetlands and floodplains.
Each phase of the PRD shall bear at least a proportional amount of open space or may
include the dedication of all open space required per the tentative approval.
Uses authorized. The following uses are authorized in the residential community PRD.
Single-family.
Duplex.
Townhouse.
Elderly residential facilities.
Neighborhood public and semipublic uses.
The amount of dwelling units permitted per acre shall be calculated as follows:
Forty three thousand five hundred sixty square feet divided by the minimum lot size in square
feet of the respective underlying zoning district shall equal the base density or units per acre.
The following table shall serve to outline the number of units by type permitted per acre for
the gross acreage included in the PRD. Each acre against which dwelling unit types are
calculated shall not be included in the calculation of other types permitted. Therefore, the
multipliers listed times the base density equal the number of units permitted per the
proportional acreage of land applied to that dwelling unit type.
Use or Dwelling Unit Type Multiplier
Single-family 1.2
Duplex 2.4
Townhouse 2.5
Elderly residential facility (number of
residents)

be capable of separate fee simple conveyance through placement on fee simple lots or
property interest created as condominiums. Generally lots proposed to bear single-family
residences shall be at least 40 feet in width at the proposed and accepted building line.
Landscaping. At a minimum, townhouse units shall be landscaped around the front of the units
which face the street or access drive bearing one high-level planting per unit or two ornamental

Applicability of Zoning Ordinance provisions, subdivision and land development ordinance, and
related ordinances. Unless expressly modified by the standards of this section, all other
requirements of this chapter, the local subdivision and land development ordinance, and local
street, grading, and other land development standards shall apply to developments proposed
under this section. Such ordinance standards may be modified only when the developer
demonstrates that literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose and intent of this chapter is observed; or that a modification meets or
exceeds standards meeting the purpose or intent of the ordinance in question. The above shall not
withstand all standard post approval requirements instituted by the local subdivision and land
development ordinance, namely the required posting of financial security for streets, public
improvements, and certain private amenities.
§ 300-602. Mixed-use community, PRD development standards.
The land area of residential components that include the uses authorized in the residential

authorized as such in the underlying district. Additionally, mixed-use buildings are authorized.
Principal structures shall provide a front yard setback of at least 50 feet.
Unless connected by party walls, structures shall provide for side and rear yard setbacks of at
least 50 feet with one additional foot of setback for each foot in height above two stories. Where
multiple principal structures exist on one lot, this setback shall be enforced between principal
structures as well.
Thirty percent of the land area in the commercial portion shall be dedicated as common open
space. Five percent of the open space required shall be provided in a central area faced by more
than one principal structure and fronting a street. Said space shall be 5% or less in grade and
shall provide for pedestrian usage.
Principal commercial structures shall be set back at least 50 feet from residentially designated
sections of the development.
Landscaping shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking lots at a rate of one high-level
planting for each 50 linear feet of perimeter, including access drives. Additionally, landscaping
shall be disbursed around visible portions of the principal structure at a rate of one high-level
planting or one ornamental tree and four low-level plantings for each 25 linear feet of the
structure's perimeter.
The residential component of the development, those uses solely authorized in the residential
community PRD, shall comprise at least 20% of the square footage of all uses within the PRD and
no more than 60% of the total square footage.
The proportion of retail, office, and manufacturing/warehouse shall be submitted as proposed and
shall be authorized given the proportion of uses reasonably related to the similar proportion in the
Planning Area at large, determined by the most recent Economic Census and subsequent permit
data. Employment within or regular utilization of ancillary establishment intended primarily for use
by residents of the PRD shall also serve as a finding of fact or justification for approved use
proportions.
All final phases approved shall contain the proportions of commercial development type
commensurate with that approved in the overall or tentative approval. Same shall also include at
least 20% of the land area as residential or may develop all residential in the first final phase
constructed. In lieu of such provisions, a developer may submit covenants in favor of the
municipality, in a form acceptable to the municipality, which restrict future development to those
uses shown on the tentative plan.
Applicability of Zoning Ordinance provisions, subdivision and land development ordinance, and
related ordinances. Unless expressly modified by the standards of this section, all other
requirements of this chapter, the local subdivision and land development ordinance[1], and local
street, grading, and other land development standards shall apply to developments proposed
under this section. Such ordinance standards may be modified only when the developer
demonstrates that literal enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will not be contrary to the public
interest and that the purpose and intent of the ordinance is observed; or that a modification meets
or exceeds standards meeting the purpose or intent of the ordinance in question. The above shall
not withstand all standard post approval requirements instituted by the local subdivision and land

receiving a copy of the official written communication of the governing body, notify the governing
body of his refusal to accept all said conditions, in which case the governing body shall be
deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development plan. In the event that the
landowner does not, within said period, notify the governing body of his refusal to accept all said

granted. The decision will be filed with the secretary of the governing body and the applicant. The
decision shall include an approved schedule of final plan application filing which shall not be less
than three months from the tentative approval date.
Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plat of the planned residential
development for recording nor authorize development or the issuance of any building permits. A
development plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted, or which has been given
tentative approval with conditions which have been accepted by the landowner (and provided that
the landowner has not defaulted nor violated any of the conditions of the tentative approval), shall
not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the municipality pending an
application or applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided an
application or applications for final approval is filed or, in the case of development over a period of
years, provided applications are filed, within the periods of time specified in the official written
communication granting tentative approval.
In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and thereafter, but prior to final
approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon said development plan and shall so notify the
governing body in writing, or in the event the landowner shall fail to file application or applications
for final approval within the required period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative
approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area included in the
development plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those local
ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time, and the same
shall be noted on the Zoning Map and in the records of the municipal secretary or clerk of the
municipality.

plan for the development of the municipality;
The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and subdivision regulations
otherwise applicable to the subject property, including but not limited to density, bulk and use, and
the reasons why such departures are or are not deemed to be in the public interest;
The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the planned residential
development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common
open space, and the adequacy or inadequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open
space as related to the proposed density and type of residential development;
The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which said design does or does
not make adequate provision for public services, provide adequate control over vehicular traffic,
and further the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment;
The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned residential development to the
neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established;
In the case of a development plan which proposes development over a period of years, the

§ 300-608. Final plan approval process.
The Zoning Officer shall review an application for final approval within one week of delivery and
shall notify the applicant of any deficiencies of certify the applicant as complete. Submissions of
deficient items shall be reviewed in the same manner. The Zoning Officer shall, when all
application materials are submitted, certify the application as complete. The date on which
completion is certified shall constitute the official filing date.
Variation from original plan. In the event that the development plan submitted contains variations
from the development plan granted tentative approval, the governing body may refuse to grant
final approval and may, within 45 days of the official filing date of the application for final approval
(provided, however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days following the
official filing date, the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the 30th day following the day
the application has been filed), advise the applicant, in writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said
notice the reasons why one or more of the variations are not in the public interest. In the event of
such refusal, the landowner may either refile the application for final approval without the
variations objected; or file a written request with the local governing body that it hold a public
hearing on the application for final approval. If the landowner wishes to take either alternate
action, he may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval, or
within 30 additional days, if the time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the
time when the landowner was advised that the development plan was not in substantial
compliance. If the landowner fails to take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall
be deemed to have abandoned the development plan. Any such public hearing shall be held
pursuant to public notice within 30 days after request for the hearing is made by the landowner,
and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner described in this article for public hearings on
applications for tentative approval. Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the
governing body shall by official written communication either grant final approval to the
development plan or deny final approval. The grant or denial of final approval of the development
plan shall, in cases arising under this section, be in the form and contain the findings required for
an application for tentative approval set forth in this article. Failure of the governing body to render
a decision on an application for final approval and communicate it to the applicant within the time
and in the manner required by this section shall be deemed an approval of the application for final
approval, as presented, unless the applicant has agreed in writing to an extension of time or
change in the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the decision, in which case,
failure to meet the extended time or change in manner or presentation of communication shall
have like effect.
In the event the application for final approval has been officially filed, together with all drawings,
specifications and other documents in support thereof, and as required by this article and the
official written communication of tentative approval, the municipality shall, within 45 days from the
date of the regular meeting of the local planning commission, whichever first reviews the
application, next following the date the application is filed, grant such development plan final
approval; provided, however, that should the next regular meeting occur more than 30 days
following the filing of the application, the forty-five-day period shall be measured from the 30th day
following the official filing date.
The developer shall post financial security and shall execute a developer's agreement as required
by the local subdivision ordinance prior to recording of the final plat. The plat shall be recorded
within 90 days of final plan approval. The developer's agreement shall at a minimum, in addition to
that required by the local subdivision ordinance, cite those provisions of the notice of tentative
approval applicable to the respective phase, include a timeline for development proposed by the
developer but not to exceed five years, reference construction inspections and responsibilities,
reference the installation of landscaping and private amenities, and address the recordation of
homeowners' association documents and covenants.

The developer shall be afforded the five-year timeline to commence and complete development as
noted in Section 508 of the Municipalities Planning Code and otherwise applicable to subdivisions
and land developments. Where the developer notifies the governing body that he has abandoned
the plan or the aforesaid timeline cited in Section 508 expires, the plan shall be deemed
abandoned and no further development or permits for such development shall take place. The
governing body shall amend its ordinance to reclassify the property to a zoning district.
§ 300-609. Modification of planned residential development
provisions.
An applicant for permits which do not conform strictly to the approved plan may request a
modification to the plan by providing all reports and plans required by final approval which are
proposed to be modified. A statement concerning consistency with the comprehensive plan and
community development objectives shall be submitted along with any required fees and forms
provided by the municipality. Upon acceptance, the application shall be afforded the timelines and
process provided for final PRD approval. The governing body, however, shall hold a public hearing
pursuant to public notice prior to voting on the application.
Modification approval shall be provided in a manner that meets all requirements and standards of
this article.
Findings regarding approval shall consider the following:
No such modification, removal or release of the provisions of the development plan by the
municipality shall affect the rights of the residents of the planned residential development to
maintain and enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in this section.
No modification, removal or release of the provisions of the development plan by the
municipality shall be permitted except upon a finding by the governing body or the planning
agency, following a public hearing thereon pursuant to public notice called and held in
accordance with the provisions of this article, that the same is consistent with the efficient
development and preservation of the entire planned residential development, does not
adversely affect either the enjoyment of land abutting upon or across the street from the
planned residential development or the public interest, and is not granted solely to confer a
special benefit upon any person.
No part of the approval shall conflict with private covenants that run in favor of residents or
property owners within the entire PRD.
Article VII. Traditional Neighborhood Development

§ 300-704. TND standards.
The following outline the standards by which all proposed TNDs shall be evaluated and also constitute
the regulations to which all future uses and improvements within those approved TNDs must adhere.
Bulk standards and public improvements.
The following definitions shall apply to this article:
COMMON OPEN SPACE
Space provided for the use and enjoyment of residents of a plan or patrons and
employees of an establishment, or of the public at large.
MIXED-USE BUILDING
Any structure containing residential dwelling units combined with commercial uses
permitted as of right in the respective zoning district of the Traditional Neighborhood
Development in which it is located, where the commercial component comprises at least
20% of the gross square footage of the structure.
A build-to line shall be established, which shall be between 15 and 30 feet. Unenclosed
porches may invade said line by eight feet. Both the proposed character of the development
and the present character of adjacent neighborhoods shall determine the build-to line. Twenty
percent of the proposed structures are encouraged to deviate from the build-to line by five to
10 feet and may be between 15 feet to 40 feet from the right-of-way line. Namely, the offset of
larger nonresidential structures is encouraged in the aforementioned manner as approved by
the governing body.
All lighting, parking, signage, and accessory structure standards cited in this chapter shall
apply to this article, unless expressly modified herein.
Lighting. Street lighting shall be required within 10 feet of the right-of-way. Covenants in favor
of the respective municipality shall require the maintenance of said lighting. The height of said
lighting shall be limited to 15 feet and shall be approved by Council based on designs
appropriate to a residential and pedestrian scale.
Numbers of units and size of TND development. Each phase of a TND proposed shall contain
at least five dwelling units which may include up to two repaired units as outlined in §§ 300-
704B(5) and 300-704C(4).
Trees. Street trees shall be provided as follows.
One high level planting every 100 feet, alternating every 50 feet on each side of the
street; or one ornamental tree every 50 feet, alternating every 25 feet on each side of the
street.
Trees shall be planted a uniform distance from the right-of-way, ranging from three to 10
feet from the right-of-way line. Covenants in favor of the municipality requiring
maintenance or replacement of said trees shall be recorded.
Sidewalks shall be along all street frontage of the area proposed for development or
redevelopment. Sidewalks shall be constructed according to municipal standards and shall
connect to existing adjacent sidewalks or pedestrian corridors.
Where a tentative plan will result in 15 or more dwelling units or where a combination of
dwelling units and uses results in more than 150 average daily trips, a traffic impact study
compiled and sealed by a registered traffic engineer shall be submitted. Said study shall
confirm or reject the adherence to the following minimum standards. Where proposed

intersections or streets fail to meet minimum requirements, the study shall make
recommendations for improvements that would serve to satisfy the minimum standards of this
chapter. All streets and intersections impacted by the trip generation of the proposed TND
shall demonstrate a minimum level of service of D according to the latest edition of the Trip
Generation Manual published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers. All proposed
intersections shall demonstrate a minimum service level of C.
Landscaping. In addition to street trees, landscaping shall be provided in the following areas
and according to the following standards:
All common land reserved for townhouse development and nonresidential use shall
provide landscaping at the following rates: one low-level per 1,000 square feet of land
area; and one high-level landscaping for every 7,500 square feet of land area. (Two
ornamental trees may be substituted for a high-level planting.)
Priority of landscaping placement. Landscaping shall be installed between residential and
nonresidential uses; along the perimeter of the TND; and along the building perimeter of
parking lots, nonresidential buildings, and townhouses.
Steep slopes and hazardous development.
No buildings shall be erected within an area of steep slope.
No more than 20% of a steep slope area shall be disturbed through clear cutting or
grading due to the construction of streets, driveways, or access roads.
Common open space requirements.
Twenty percent of the total site area shall be designated as common open space per the
following standards.
Common open space shall be provided as a corridor around the perimeter of the TND
site not fronting on a street. Said corridor shall be at least 20 feet in width and shall
provide a reasonable integration with existing and proposed pedestrian and green space
corridors. This requirement may be waived by the governing body where the TND is
bordered by a public park, natural features such as streams, or where the TND is directly
integrated into a previously approved TND or neighborhood of similar character.
Common open space may be provided as a central plaza, the boundaries of which shall
be defined by landscaping or other amenities as approved by the governing body. The
plaza shall be traversed by a minimum of one sidewalk meeting the minimum standards
of this article. Plazas shall cover a minimum of 3,750 square feet. Plazas shall provide a

Several uses as specified in the district regulations of this chapter are deemed conditional uses. Said
uses have been identified as having potential impacts and concerns which are, firstly, beyond those
and greater than those of permitted uses, and, secondly, having impacts which might vary considerably
depending on the character of the facility, structure, or business proposed, and may require special
conditions as recommended by the Planning Commission, and approved by the governing body.
§ 300-801. General standards.
The Planning Commission shall make recommendations and findings of fact based in the following
general and specific criteria, wherein the governing body shall review said finding and conditional use
application and shall issue a decision, which may contain reasonable conditions. Said findings,
conditions, and recommendations shall consider the following.
The maximization of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare through adequate buffering and
building location recognizing the need to adequately provide for a certain use or class of uses.
The safety and requirements of the clients, residents, or patrons of a potential use through the
design of internal pedestrian and vehicular circulation, site ingress and egress, general manner of
operation, signage, lighting, and related improvements.
The site design of the proposed use shall promote the least intrusive options in regards to
signage, vehicular circulation, deliveries, and hours of operation as possible while accommodating
the basic requirements of the use's regular business operations.
The overall costs versus the benefits in regards to public services, tax revenues, and benefits to
the Planning Area's residents as related to reasonable site design or associated modifications
provided by the applicant.

deemed a denial of the conditional use. A copy of the decision shall be filed at the governing
body's office. The decision shall be mailed to the applicant no later than one day following the date
of the decision.
Where the governing body fails to render the decision within 45 days of the conclusion of the
required public hearing or fails to commence the required hearing within 60 days from the date of
the applicant's request for a hearing or fails to complete the hearing in accordance with Section
908 (1.2) of the Municipalities Planning Code,[1] the decision shall be deemed to have been
rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to an
extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the
failure of the governing body to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the governing
body shall give public notice of the decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to
render a decision in the same manner as required by the public notice requirements of this act. If

Where lots of record exist at the time of adoption of this chapter, the following shall apply. Where
adjacent nonconforming lots of record under common ownership exist at the time of adoption of this

The expansion represents the minimum impact to neighborhood character necessary to
accommodate the reasonable expansion.
In no case shall an expansion cumulatively exceed an additional 40% of the site or area
currently occupied by the establishment or use since the adoption of this chapter.
Nonconforming uses shall lose their status when said use ceases to operate for more than 12
consecutive months and where the structure and business are not actively marketing for sale
for a period of more than 12 consecutive months. In said cases, the Zoning Officer shall not
register said uses as nonconforming uses.
Where the structure in which a nonconforming use operates is completely demolished or
destroyed and where a total loss of the ability to repair said structure occurs, the structure and
land upon which said structures was situated shall lose its nonconforming use status. The
phrase "completely demolished" shall be defined as a total loss of the structure's value and
the inability to repair the structure without rebuilding substantial structural portions of the
structure, as determined by the Municipal Engineer.
Change of nonconforming use. A property owner may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board for a
change in nonconforming use, where a similar use is proposed. The Board shall evaluate the
application in terms of the level of impact on surrounding properties, wherein the applicant shall
demonstrate that the use proposed is generally within the same three-digit NAICS classification or

which the steps must be completed, which shall be 30 days from the issuance of the notice.
That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within a
prescribed reasonable period of time in accordance with procedures set forth in this chapter.
That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless extended by appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions as described in

Enforcement remedies. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this zoning ordinance shall, upon being found liable
therefor in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the governing body, pay a judgment of
not more than $500 plus all court costs, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by a
municipality as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or payable
until the date of the determination of a violation by the district justice. If the defendant neither pays
nor timely appeals the judgment, the governing body may enforce the judgment pursuant to the
applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate
violation, unless the district justice determining that there has been a violation further determines
that there was a good-faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating the ordinance
to have believed that there was no such violation, in which event there shall be deemed to have
been only one such violation until the fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation
by the district justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate

The Board shall grant a variance only when findings of fact are supported by all of the
following where relevant in a given case and therefore constitute an unnecessary hardship
inflicted by the Zoning Ordinance.
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical property
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances
or conditions generally created by the provisions of the zoning ordinance in the
neighborhood in which the property is located.
That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant.
That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards
as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this article and the zoning ordinance.
Special exception. The Board is authorized to consider special exceptions.
Expansions and changes of nonconforming uses shall be evaluated as per the following
standards cited in Article X and the general standards cited in this section.
The landowner shall submit an application to the Zoning Officer including a survey showing
existing structures and the location and detail of the proposed activity or structure for which
the applicant requires the special exception, including representations of parking and
circulation; the required fee for the special exception fee as outlined in the schedule of the
governing body, and a completed application with all required contact information as well as
additional information, if any, required by the Board.
Special exceptions for nonconforming uses shall be evaluated by the following criteria at a
minimum.
The impact of any proposed use on the neighborhood of which it is a part compared with
the impact of the existing nonconforming use. A proposed use shall not present a greater
adverse impact as compared with the existing use.
The impact of an expansion of the nonconforming use and the manner in which the
expansion changes or redefines the impact of the current nonconforming use.
The extent to which a proposed expansion changes the scale of use such that the use
itself may be changed such that it does not present an adverse impact on the
neighborhood and district in which it is located. The expansion shall be considered a
natural outgrowth necessary to the economic vitality and sustainability of the current
nonconforming use.
The consistency of any proposed expansion with the current character of a neighborhood
or district.

zoning ordinance.
Proposed additions shall conform dimensionally and otherwise to the standards of the present
ordinance, or shall otherwise require a dimensional variance.
Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer. The Board shall hear appeals from the
determination of the Zoning Officer in matters concerning the denial of a permit, a cease-anddesist

as amended. The aggrieved party shall make application to the Zoning Officer for the appeal of
the disputed decision. The application shall include the fee as defined in the governing body's
adopted fee schedule, name and contract information, copies of the permit application, and any
additional details relating to the denial or order issued.
Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10909.1.
The Zoning Hearing Board recognizes its jurisdiction as defined above and as additionally defined

other public service facilities;
If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal upon regional housing
needs and the effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of a type actually
available to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the
challenged provisions of the ordinance or map;
The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural features;

§ 300-1202. Compliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed,
reconstructed, enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions
of this article and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this article.
§ 300-1203. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this article is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not imply that areas outside
the floodplain districts or that land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damages.
This article shall not create liability on the article of the Township, or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative
decision.
§ 300-1204. Basis of districts.
The various floodplain districts shall include areas subject to inundation by waters of the onehundred-
year flood. The basis for the delineation of these districts shall be the Flood Insurance
Study for the governing body prepared by the Federal Insurance Administration dated August 15,
1979, effective February 15, 1980, as amended.
The FW (Floodway District) is delineated for purposes of this article using the criteria that a certain
area within the floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the one-hundred-year flood
more than one foot at any point. The areas included in this area are defined in the Floodway Data
Table contained in the Flood Insurance Study as prepared by FEMA and shown on the recorded
FIRM. Where no floodway has been delineated in the FIS, such information contained in any other
available federal, state or other acceptable source should be used.
The FF (Floodfringe District) shall be that area of the one-hundred-year floodplain not included in
the floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the one-hundred-year
flood elevations contained in the flood profiles provided in the FIS. Where elevation information is
not provided in the FIS, such information provided in any other available federal, state or other
acceptable source should be used.
The General Floodplain District (FA) shall be that floodplain area for which no detailed flood
profiles or elevations have been provided. They are shown on the maps accompanying the FIS
prepared by FIA. Where the specific one-hundred-year flood elevation cannot be determined for
this area using other sources of data such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Floodplain
Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey, Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant
for the proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the governing body.

Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, having a lowest floor which is not elevated to at least
1 1/2 feet above the one-hundred-year flood elevation shall be floodproofed in a completely or
essentially dry manner in accordance with the W1 or W2 space classification standards contained
in the publication entitled "Floodproofing Regulations" published by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(June 1972) or with some other equivalent standard. All plans and specifications for such
floodproofing shall be accompanied by a statement certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect which states that the proposed design and methods of construction are in
conformance with the above referenced standards.
District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the Floodplain Districts may be revised by the
Township where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or
other qualified agency or individual documents the notification for such change. However, prior to
any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the Floodplain
Districts shall be made by the Zoning Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of
any of the districts, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determination. The
person questioning or contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so
desires.
Within any identified floodplain district, fully enclosed spaces below the lowest floor of any new or
substantially improved structure shall be prohibited.
All uses, activities and development occurring with any Floodplain District shall be undertaken only
in strict compliance with the provisions of this article and with all other applicable codes and
ordinances such as the Uniform Construction Code, and the local Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.[1] In addition, all such uses, activities and development shall be
undertaken only in compliance with federal or state law including Section 404 of the Federal Water
Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 265, Subdivision and Land Development.
Under no circumstance shall any use, activity and/or development adversely affect the capacity of
the channels or floodways of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or
system.
Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream, watercourse, etc., within the Planning
Area, a permit shall be obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection, Dam Safety,
Obstructions and Storm Water Management Division. Further, notification of the proposal by the
Township shall be given to all affected adjacent municipalities. Copies of such notifications shall
be forwarded to both the Federal Insurance Administration and the Department of Community And
Economic Development.
§ 300-1206. Floodway District.
Floodway District (FW). In the Floodway District, no development shall be permitted except where
any rise in flood heights caused by the proposed development will be fully offset by accompanying
improvements which have been approved by all appropriate local and/or state authorities as
required above.
Permitted uses.
Public and private recreational uses and activities such as parks, day camps, picnic grounds,
golf courses, boat launching and swimming areas, hiking, and horseback riding trails, wildlife

substantially improved structure shall be prohibited.
§ 300-1207. Flood-Fringe District (FF).
In the Flood-Fringe District, the development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance with
the regulations of the underlying district provided that all such uses, activities, and/or development
shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained in all
other applicable codes and ordinances.
§ 300-1208. General Floodplain District (FA).
In the General Floodplain Conservation District, the development and/or use of land shall be permitted
in accordance with the regulations of the underlying district provided that all such uses, activities
and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related
provisions contained in all other applicable codes and ordinances.
§ 300-1209. Special exception and variances, additional criteria.
In passing upon applications for special exceptions and variances, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider all relevant factors and procedures specified in other sections of this chapter and the
following:
The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by
encroachments. No special exception or variance shall be granted for any proposed use,
development, or activity that will cause any increase in flood levels in the Floodway District.
The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or downstream to the injury of others.
The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent
disease, contamination, and unsanitary conditions.
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such
damage on the individual owners.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location.
The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.

The Zoning Hearing Board may refer any application and accompanying documentation pertaining
to any request for a special exception or variance to any engineer or other qualified person or
agency for technical assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and
velocities, and the adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters.
Special exceptions and/or variances shall only be issued after the Zoning Hearing Board has
determined that the granting of such will not result in (a) unacceptable or prohibited increases in
flood heights, (b) additional threats to public safety, (c) extraordinary public expense, (d) create
nuisances, (e) cause fraud or victimization of the public, or (f) conflict with local laws or
ordinances.
In considering the presence of a hardship on a subject property, extraordinary justification shall be
required for properties over 1 1/2 acres.
