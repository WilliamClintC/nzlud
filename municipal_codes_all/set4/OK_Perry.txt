DIVISION 7
PROCLAMATION OF RABIES
Section 4-170 DOGS AND CATS CONFINED; WHEN.
A. When the health officer or chief of police determines
and certifies that a dog, a cat, or other animal in the city or
within five (5) miles of the city is or was infected with rabies
and that an epidemic of rabies threatens the city, the council,
4.2.2018 ADDITION
by resolution, may order all dogs to be confined, and if deemed
desirable, all cats to be confined, during a period of time to
be determined by the council. Such resolution or an adequate
notice of its passage shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the city and shall go into effect on
the day following such publication unless the resolution
prescribes a later time.
B. While such resolution is in effect, it is unlawful or
any owner to permit a dog or cat to be at large in violation of
such resolution, or for any dog or cat to be at large in
violation thereof.
Section 4-171 QUARANTINE OF ANIMALS FOR OBSERVATION.
A. The identity and address of the owner of any animal
that bites a person shall be promptly furnished to the animal
control officer and the county health department. The animal,
regardless of its immunization status, shall be securely
quarantined at a veterinary hospital of the owner's choice at
the owner's expense. The animal shall be observed by a licensed
veterinarian for a period of ten (10) days and may not be
released until such reasonable determination has been made that
the animal is not infected with rabies, unless the bite was a
severe bite by an unimmunized animal. In circumstances of a
severe bite (bite on the head, face, neck or upper extremities;
or deep laceration; or multiple bite wounds) by an unimmunized
animal, the biting animal should be humanely killed immediately,
without damaging the head, and the head should be humanely
shipped, under refrigeration, for examination at the Oklahoma
State Department of Health. If the animal is not immediately
available for testing, the individuals exposed should consult
with their physicians concerning the need for immediate
initiation for rabies prophylaxis. In case of animals whose
ownership is unknown, such quarantine shall be at the city
animal shelter. If an owner becomes known, the animal may be
reclaimed by the owner if adjudged free of rabies, and such
owner shall then pay any related charges for confinement. Signs
of rabies in wild animals cannot be interpreted reliably;
therefore, any wild animal that exposes a person should be
killed at once (without unnecessary damage to the head) and the
head submitted for examination for evidence of rabies.
B. It is the duty of every physician, veterinarian or
other practitioner to report to the animal control officer the
4.2.2018 ADDITION
names and addresses of persons treated for bites inflicted by
animals, together with such other information as will be helpful
in rabies control.
C. It is the duty of every licensed veterinarian to
report to the animal control officer his diagnosis of any animal
observed by him to be a rabid suspect.
Section 4-172 SECURING SUPPORT INFORMATION ON DIAGNOSED
ANIMALS.
When an animal under quarantine has been diagnosed as being
rabid or is suspected of having rabies by a licensed
veterinarian and dies while under such observation, the animal
control officer, veterinarian, the city health officer, or other
designated emissary shall immediately send the necessary part of
such animal to the state health department for pathological
examination and shall notify the proper public health officer of
any reports of human contact.
Section 4-173 RABIES CRISIS DECLARATION.
When a report gives a suspected or a positive diagnosis of
rabies, or when the city, county or state health officials feel
that a rabies crisis may be imminent, the health officials may
recommend to the mayor citywide quarantine, and upon the
invoking of such quarantine by the mayor no animal shall be
taken into the streets or permitted to be in the streets, except
for short periods of exercise under leash and control of a
competent adult. During the quarantine no animals may be taken
or removed from the city without written permission of the
animal control officer. This declaration must be made by notice
in a general circulated newspaper of the community and will last
as long as health officials determine the situation requires
such action.
Section 4-174 DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS UNDER CRISIS PERIOD.
A. During the period of rabies quarantine as mentioned
every animal bitten by an animal adjudged to be rabid shall be
forthwith destroyed, or at the owner's expense and option, shall
be treated for a rabies infection by a licensed veterinarian, or
held under six (6) month quarantine by the owner in the same
manner as a female in season. The period of quarantine may be
extended from time to time.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
B. In the event there are additional positive cases of
rabies occurring during the period of the quarantine, such
period of quarantine may be extended for an additional six
months.
C. No person shall kill or cause to be killed any rabid
animals, any animal suspected of having been exposed to rabies,
or any animal biting or scratching a human, except as herein
provided, nor to remove same from the city limits without
written permission from the health officer of the city or the
animal control officer.
D. The carcass of any dead animal exposed to rabies shall
upon demand be surrendered to the animal control officer.
E. The animal control officer shall direct the
disposition of any animal found to be infected with rabies.
Section 4-175 SURRENDER OF ANIMALS UNDER SUSPECT.
No person shall remove from the city any animal suspected
of having been exposed to rabies, or any animal which has bitten
a human, except as herein provided. The carcass of any dead
animal exposed to rabies shall be surrendered to the animal
control officer upon demand, and the animal control officer
shall direct disposition of the animal. No person shall refuse
to surrender any animal for quarantine or destruction when such
demand is lawfully made by the animal control officer.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, one (1) TSC or
similar container may be stored on property within any district

the structure is undergoing renovation, repair or

The City Manager or designee may extend the time during which

container on such owner or person’s real property as a storage
shed or accessory building or for any other purpose or time
period not provided under this section, shall file an
application, and pay a fee in the same amount as a zoning
application, together with all costs with the building official,

public hearing held before the Planning Commission, the City

container in any particular zone for a purpose and/or time
period not provided by this section. Any evidence as may be
necessary to enable the Planning Commission and City Council to
properly consider the request should accompany the application.

prior to the public hearing. In addition, at least ten (10)
days prior to the hearing, a written notice shall be mailed to
all owners of real property located within a three hundred (300)

Council until it finds that the value and qualities of the
neighborhood surrounding the TSC or similar container’s location
are not substantially injured by the placement of the TSC or
similar container. The City Council can approve the application
with any conditions that may be appropriate, which conditions
shall be provided on the face of the permit issued under this
procedure.
E. If approved, the location of the TSC or similar container
in such location shall thereafter be lawful, subject to any
future enactment of an ordinance further regulating or governing
the location and/or use of TSC or similar container.
F. Any owner or person in lawful possession of any real
property who shall by act or omission violate this section by
the placement of a TSC or similar container in violation of this
section, or fail to remove such unlawfully placed TSC or similar
container after being directed by the building official, or by
the violation of any other term or condition of this section, by
act or omission, shall be guilty of an offense and if convicted
shall be subject to a maximum fine of Two Hundred and Fifty
Dollars ($250.00) plus the payment of court costs, fees and

further not be applicable to the location of TSC or similar

DIVISION 2
PERRY WATERSHED DRILLING OPERATION/PRODUCTION RULES
Section 5-820 LOCAL REGULATIONS IN ADDITION
The following rules and regulations do not replace the
present rules and regulations of the Oklahoma State Corporation
Commission governing oil field operations but are in addition to
those rules. Full compliance with these rules and regulations is
a condition precedent to the right to use any public property
including but not limited to streets, roads, alleys, or rightsof-
way or any other publicly owned real property.
Section 5-821 PROHIBITED LOCATIONS
Except as may be permitted by written agreement by the City
and based on special conditions, no well-prospecting for oil,
gas or any other substance shall be permitted within 660 feet of
CCC Lake or Perry Lake. For the purpose of this regulation, 660
feet shall be measured from the well-prospecting site to the
high water shoreline of CCC Lake or Perry Lake.
Section 5-822 REGULATIONS
Any well permitted under these regulations to be located
within one (1) mile of CCC Lake or Perry Lake shall comply with
the following rules:
4.2.2018 ADDITION
A. The design criteria for all wells shall consider all
pertinent factors for well control including formation pressures
and casing setting depths such that the well bore can be
maintained under control at all times. The application for
permit to drill shall include the information indicated by
Attachment A, which Attachment A is no file in the Office of the
City Clerk and is incorporated herein by reference. A new
permit is required in order to change the classification of a
well, for example, from producing well to injection well.
B. Prior to the commencement of any drilling operation,
an artificial barrier shall be constructed completely
surrounding the well site no closer than fifty (50) feet from
the well bore. The top of the artificial portion of the barrier
to be constructed down drainage from the well shall be level at
all points, at a compacted height of not less than two (2) feet
above the ground level at the well bore, in order that any
deleterious material from the well or operations thereon would
be trapped and stored before such material can enter the
drainage to the reservoir. An adequate diversion ditch or dike
shall be constructed across and around the uphill edge of the
well site so that no surface drainage water can enter the area
of the well location. Any fluid trapped within the well site
shall be immediately pumped into steel tanks for storage and
removal.
C. In addition, the permittee or applicant shall submit a
Deleterious Substance Spill Contingency Plan (hereinafter the
“Plan”) that will be followed in reporting, cleanup, and
prevention of the spread of any pollution resulting from a
deleterious substance spill which might occur during drilling or
production activities. The Plan shall:
1. include the description of procedures, personnel,
equipment, and materials which will be used in combating any
such spill.
2. address two degrees of response effort (1) a
deleterious substance spill resulting in pollutants being
carried outside the dike surrounding the well or facility site,
and (2) a deleterious substance spill resulting in pollutants
being carried into CCC Lake or Perry Lake, as may be
appropriate.
3. include provisions to assure that full resource
4.2.2018 ADDITION
capability is known and can be committed during a spill,
including the identification and inventory of applicable
equipment and materials which are available locally and
regionally.
4. include the establishment of procedures for the purpose
of early detection and timely notification of a spill, including
a current list of names, telephone numbers and addresses of the
responsible persons and alternates on call to receive
notification of a spill, and the names, telephone numbers and
addresses of regulatory organizations and agencies to be
notified when a spill is discovered.
5. include pre-designation of a spill response coordinator
who is charged with the responsibility and is delegated
commensurate authority for directing and coordinating response
operations.
6. include provisions for disposal of recovered spill
materials.
7. address the installation of a secondary protection dike
located between the well or facility site and the reservoir to
be protected. When the City Manager or designee of the City
(“Director”) considers a secondary dike to be effective and
practical, the permittee shall construct and maintain a
secondary protection dike at some point between the well site
and the reservoir across any drainage channels in such a manner
that any fluid flowing downstream from the well or facility site
could be trapped. This secondary dike shall contain a simple
slide gate or valve, sized to pass surface water, which can be
closed by one man. The gate shall be left open at all times
except when and if control of the well is lost, in which event
the gate in the secondary dike shall be immediately closed and
left closed until control of the well is regained. If any
contaminants have entered the secondary dike pool, the pool
shall be pumped dry and the pool area cleaned of contaminants
before the gate in the secondary dike is reopened.
Approval of the Plan by the Director shall be a requirement
for obtaining a permit. The Plan shall be reviewed annually by
the permittee and revised as appropriate to compensate for any
changes in conditions at the well or facility site or at the
area to be protected. The permittee shall submit a Plan or
revised plan to the Director on an annual basis. Upon written
4.2.2018 ADDITION
agreement by the City, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s
UPCC Plan can be substituted for the Plan so long as it has been
appropriately engineered.
D. No earthen slush pits or reserve pits shall be
constructed. When the well is located inside the drainage area
of a water reservoir and within one (1) mile of the high water
shoreline of CCC Lake or Perry Lake, drilling mud operations
shall be conducted in steel tanks, and the drilling mud shall be
removed from the property immediately upon completion of the
well. Concrete shale removal tanks may be substituted for steel
tanks. Concrete shale removal tanks shall be permitted to be
constructed at grade upon submission of plans and approval of
design of such tanks by the Director.
E. All casing shall meet the American Petroleum Institute
(API) specifications, including:
1. Surface casing shall be set at a minimum depth as
defined by the Oklahoma Water Resource Board or at a greater
depth if required by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission or the
Director in order to protect both fresh water-bearing strata and
to remove any possibility of contaminating fluids or gasses
reaching the surface through vertical fracture systems or along
fault planes. Surface casing shall be constructed of steel
casing grade J-55, K-55 or higher grade and shall have a minimum
burst strength rating of 2940 PSI. The casing shall be suspended
off bottom while the cement is placed and allowed to set. The
cement shall be circulated to the surface and allowed to set
under pressure for at least twelve (12) hours or any longer time
required for the cement to reach a compressive strength of 500
PSI before re-entering the well bore. The cement is considered
to be under pressure if one or more float valves are used and
are shown to be holding or if other means of holding pressure is
used. If cement is not circulated to the surface, the cement
shall be permitted to set for eighteen hours, and small diameter
pipe shall be run down the outside of the surface casing to the
top of the hardened cement. Cement shall be pumped down the
small pipe to fill the annulus to the surface. The casing shall
be pressure tested by applying a surface pressure of 1,500 PSI
or 0.2 PSI per foot of vertical depth whichever is greater.
2. Production casing and all related equipment items such
as the wellhead, valves, etc., shall have a working pressure
rating sufficiently in excess of the highest formation pressure
4.2.2018 ADDITION
encountered in the well. This string of casing shall be
installed before completing the well for production. The casing
shall be cemented in a manner to isolate all potentially
producible hydrocarbon zones, and the annular space shall be
filled with cement at least 500 feet above the uppermost
producible hydrocarbon zone. When a liner is used as a
production string, the seal between the liner and the next
larger casing string shall be tested by a fluid entry or
pressure test to determine whether a seal between the liner and
the next larger string has been achieved. The test results shall
be recorded in the Driller's log. Prior to drilling the plug
after cementing and prior to completing the well, the production
string shall be tested to 1,500 PSI or 0.2 PSI per foot of
vertical depth, whichever is greater, except that eighty percent
(80) of the internal yield pressure of the casing shall not be
exceeded.
3. Prior to the running or cementing of each casing
string, the Operator shall notify the Director of his intentions
to set and to cement casing. Such notice shall be given
sufficiently in advance of such operation so as to permit the
Director to be present when said casing is run and cemented if
he so elects.
F. Blowout preventer and related well-control equipment
shall be installed, used and tested in a manner necessary to
prevent blowouts. Prior to drilling below the surface casing and
until drilling operations are completed, blowout prevention
equipment shall be installed and maintained ready for use as
follows:
1. Before drilling below the surface casing strings, the
blowout prevention equipment shall include a minimum of one
remotely controlled, hydraulically operated blowout preventer
with a working pressure which exceeds the maximum anticipated
surface pressure. The blowout preventer shall consist of a
minimum of one annular type. A choke line and manifold and a
separate kill line with working pressures at least equal to 3000
PSI pressure shall be installed ready for use. A fill-up line
shall also be installed ready for use, and the fill-up line
shall be located above the annular BOP.
2. The Blowout Preventer shall be tested as follows:
a. Blowout preventer shall be tested with water to
4.2.2018 ADDITION
the rated working pressure of the stack assembly.
The pressure test required for blowout preventer
installed on surface casing shall be 1500 PSI.
b. Pressure tests shall be performed:
i) When a BOP is installed.
ii) Before drilling out after each string of
casing is set.
iii) Following repairs that require disconnecting
a pressure seal in the assembly.
iv) Not less than once each 45 days.
c. All pressure tests shall be recorded in the
Driller's log.
d. While drill pipe is in use, annular type
preventer shall be actuated on the drill pipe
once each week. All actuation of the blowout
preventer shall be recorded in the Driller's log.
3. A blowout prevention drill shall be conducted each week
for each crew to ensure that all equipment is in working order
and to ensure that crews are properly trained to carry out
emergency duties. The Director may require a blowout prevention
drill at any time, well bore conditions permitting, after
conferring with the Operator's representative.
4. All BOP drills shall be recorded in the Driller's log.
5. Blowout preventer shall be installed prior to workingover
an old well or testing new zones. If tubing is to be pulled
from or installed in a producing well, blowout preventer and
related equipment shall be installed and operative.
G. The use of mud and the testing and control of mud
properties shall be such as are necessary to maintain pressure
control of the well at all times. Quantities of mud and/or mud
materials sufficient to insure well-control shall be readily
available for use at all times. Before starting out of the hole
with drill pipe, the mud shall be properly conditioned by
circulating with the drill pipe near bottom until the annular
volume is displaced and the properties of the return mud are
within the normal range. When removing drill pipe from the
hole, the annulus shall be filled with mud before the mud level
4.2.2018 ADDITION
drops 100 feet below the flow line. As a minimum, the hole shall
be filled every five (5) stands of drill pipe and every stand of
drill collars. The number of stands of drill pipe and drill
collars that may be pulled before filling the hole shall be
determined and posted on the rig floor. The number of barrels of
mud (and the number of pump strokes) required to fill the hole
corresponding to the determined number of stands of drill pipe
and drill collars shall also be posted.
H. In the event any well blows out or becomes out of
control, the Operator shall immediately notify the Director by
telephone or personal contact, and the Director and his agents
shall have full access to the well site and surrounding area.
All condensate, oil, mud, salt water, and other wastes from the
well shall be blocked off and shall not be permitted to enter
the reservoir or surface streams. The operator will anticipate
the worst possible blowout or overflow conditions and shall have
readily available at all times sufficient materials and
equipment to prevent pollutants from entering the reservoir
under any conceivable conditions. The permittee conducting
operations shall be solely responsible for all damages and shall
restore the surface to its original condition.
I. Drill stem testing is permitted only during daylight
hours. Fluid removed from the well during testing must be flowed
or pumped into steel pits or tanks and promptly removed from the
location at the conclusion of testing. The formation fluids in
the hole shall be circulated or reversed-out prior to removing
drill stem test tools from the hole.
J. From the time drilling operations are commenced until
the well is completed or abandoned, a trained member of the
drilling crew, tool pusher, or operator's representative shall
maintain rig floor surveillance at all times unless the well is
secured with cement plug(s), packer, or blowout preventer.
K. The following information shall be posted on the rig
floor at all times after drilling is commenced.
1. Procedure for closing-in the well using blowout
preventer when:
a. the operation is drilling or circulating with the
bit on bottom, and
b. the operation is tripping the drill string.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
2. Pre-recorded data which includes the items indicated in
Attachment B.
L. Posted data must be revised as conditions change. The
circulating pump rates and pressures must be rechecked and the
posted data revised at least once each twenty-four (24) hour
period when drilling.
M. The Director shall have access to all information
pertaining to a well drilled under these rules.
N. The permit to drill does not include the right to
convert the well from a producing well to an input well
(injection well, enhanced recovery well or disposal well, etc.).
O. Upon completion of a well, all oil, salt, or other
contaminated soil shall be physically removed from the area.
1. If the well is completed as a dry hole, the area shall
be restored to normal and re-seeded to prevent erosion, except
that the drilling pad and/or access road may be left in place
upon written request by the surface owner.
2. No drains shall be placed in the dike wall and any
existing drains shall be removed. Any rainwater or other
substance present inside the diked area and outside the tanks
shall be promptly removed.
P. The production facility shall consist of piping from
the well bore to the tank battery, the tank battery, associated
equipment and applicable lease roads. Prior to commencement of
operations, a spill prevention control and countermeasure’s plan
shall be developed pursuant to 40 CFR, Part 112, and submitted
to the Director for review. Approval will be received in
writing prior to commencement of production activity.
Q. Upon completion of a well, all lines located outside a
diked area, including the flow lines, gas lines, water lines,
and electric lines shall be buried to a minimum depth of three
(3) feet. Unless local codes, or state or federal regulations
specify otherwise, all pipe lines shall:

3. Be effective corrosion control measures shall be
employed for both internal and external corrosion, when pipe
lines are constructed from steel materials. Without regard to
the pipe material, when a pipe line is permitted to deteriorate
to the point where leaks have occurred or there is a high
probability of leaks occurring, in the Director's opinion, with
resulting pollution, the Director shall require the pipe line to
be replaced.
4. Be pressure tested to the design working pressure using
water after being placed in the trench, but before being
backfilled. The test leaks shall be corrected and the test
repeated until successful. After being covered, all ditch
rights-of-way shall be planted, sodded, or seeded to restore
grass.
5. Clearly indicate their routes with permanent markers.

license in accordance with the provisions of the Nonresident
Violator Compact. Such notice and request shall be on a form
approved or furnished by the State Department of Public Safety.

provided for in this subsection if, with respect to such
charges:
1. The defendant was arraigned, posted bail, paid a fine,
was jailed, or otherwise settled the case;

clerk shall notify the home jurisdiction of the defendant as
listed on the citation, if such jurisdiction is a member of the
Nonresident Violator Compact, and shall in all other cases,
notify the State Department of Public Safety of the resolution
of the case. The form of proof and the procedures for
notification shall be approved by the State Department of Public
Safety. Provided however, the court or court clerk's failure to
furnish such proof or notice in the manner provided for in this
subsection shall in no event create any civil liability upon the
court, the court clerk, the state or any political subdivision
thereof, or any state department or agency or any employee
thereof but duplicate proof shall be furnished to the person
entitled thereto upon request.

and the City; effective on and after November 1, 2006, the

DIVISION 2
COMPETITIVE BIDDING
Section 7-109 PURPOSE AND EFFECT.
The primary purpose of Division 2 of this Article is to
codify in the Perry Municipal Code, 1994, the essential
statutory requirements of the Competitive Bidding Act of 1974
(Title 61, Section 101 et seq. of the Oklahoma Statutes (1998
Supplement)) and the essential requirements of the Title 60,
Section 1076 H, known as competitive bidding requirements of the
“Public Trust Law.” A secondary but equally important purpose
of this Division is to establish local competitive bidding
procedures, which procedures are guidelines, but not
requirements, to be considered for use during those times that
neither the Competitive Bidding Act of 1974 nor any other state
law requires competitive bidding. In that state law does not
require municipalities to competitively bid professional
services or the purchase of equipment, materials and supplies,
in order to “fill the gap” and thereby reduce the potential for
improprieties, these local competitive bidding procedures are
adopted. Since such local competitive bidding procedures are
merely guidelines, with respect to any individual purchase, the
procedures may be followed or waived. The City Council may waive
compliance with the local competitive bidding procedures, which
waiver may often occur due to advantageous conditions in the
marketplace or for such other reasons as listed in this
Division. However, in each and every instance of such waiver
under this Division, the City Manager or his designee shall
certify in writing the reason for the waiver as provided by
Section 7-114 and the City Council shall approve such waiver. In
addition, since these local competitive bidding procedures are
discretionary and not mandatory, no resident, competing vendor
or seller, or any other person, firm or corporation, may secure
a temporary restraining order, injunction (temporary or
permanent), or sue for damages, costs, or attorney fees, based
on the City Council’s waiver of competitive bidding, or any
other failure to follow the procedure contained herein, unless
such person proves that a violation of federal or state law has
occurred.

years following the year of acceptance of this
franchise shall be effective on January 1 of the next
succeeding calendar year through and including
December 31 of such calendar year. The calculation
shall be subject to review by the City for
mathematical correctness and the City shall notify
Grantee in writing within forty-five (45) calendar
days after submission if the City deems such
calculation to be incorrect. The volumetric rate
calculation shall be based on the average of the
4.2.2018 ADDITION
average Settlement Prices for the twelve-month period
beginning in July of the immediately preceding year
and ending in June immediately preceding the July 31
calculation. The average Settlement Prices for each
month during said twelve-month period shall be
calculated by adding the Settlement Prices for such
month and the previous eleven (11) months as published
and dividing by twelve. The average Settlement Prices
for each of the twelve months shall then be summed and
divided by twelve to determine the average of the
average Settlement Prices and then multiplied by four
and one-quarter percent (4.25%) to obtain the
Volumetric Rate; provided, in the event the thencurrent
average of the average Settlement Prices as
calculated above and entered on the Volumetric Rate
Calculation Form, attached as Exhibit A (see line
designated on Exhibit “A” as “settlement price
average”), exceeds the Index price for ONEOK Gas
Transportation, L.L.C., that is listed in the issue of
Platt’s “Inside FERC’s Gas Market Report” published on
the first business day of the respective month
(“Platt’s Index price”), then the Platt’s Index price
shall be used to calculate the Volumetric Rate for
that delivery month in lieu of the average of the
average Settlement Prices entered on the Volumetric
Rate Calculation Form (Exhibit A) (i.e., for that
respective delivery month, the Volumetric Rate shall
be determined by taking the Platt’s Index price and
multiplying that price by 4.25% or the then applicable
increased percentage determined in the same manner set
out in Paragraph 7-811.A(2) of this franchise).
R. “Volumetric Rate Fee” or “Volumetric Rate Fees” shall
mean the fee or fees based on the Volumetric Rate to
be collected and remitted to the City by Grantee as
required by Paragraph 7-811.A(2) of this franchise
upon the enactment of an ordinance as described in
Paragraph 3.B(1).

notice to Grantee, given so as to afford Grantee an
opportunity to commence and complete such work within
a reasonable time. The cost of such construction,
maintenance or restoration incurred by Grantor upon
Grantee’s failure shall then be charged and collected
from the Grantee.
D. Grantor reserves the right to make and enforce
reasonable regulations concerning the construction of
Grantee’s Distribution System located within, along,
across, over, or under the Public Ways and to
reasonably designate where the Distribution System’s
works and pipelines shall be placed, so long as such
regulations are not in conflict with the laws of the
State of Oklahoma and the United States or the orders,
rules or regulations of the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission or other regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over Grantee.
Section 7-805. REGULATION OF SERVICE
A. The Distribution System of the Grantee shall at all
times be installed, operated and maintained in
accordance with accepted good practice and in such
condition as will enable the Grantee to furnish
adequate and continuous service as required by the
orders, rules and regulations of the Corporation
Commission of Oklahoma or other regulatory authority
having jurisdiction. The requirements set forth in
this Section shall not relieve Grantee of any other
obligations set forth herein.
B. In the event that the Corporation Commission of
Oklahoma or other state regulatory authority shall be
deprived of the authority to regulate Grantee, then
Grantor shall have the authority to set rates, terms
and conditions of service for transportation,
4.2.2018 ADDITION
distribution or sale of natural gas by Grantee within
the municipal corporate limits of the City.
Section 7-806. DEPTH OF PIPELINES

lateral lines installed or replaced in Public Ways shall be
installed or replaced at depths which comply with all applicable
state and federal rules and regulations establishing minimum
safety standards for the design, construction, maintenance and
operation of pipelines. Depth shall be measured from the lower
of existing grade or proposed future grade as set forth on plans
or other specifications existing at the time such lines are
installed or replaced.
Section 7-807. DUTY TO MOVE OR ALTER LINES
A. Grantor reserves the right to lay or permit to be laid
cables, electric conduits, water, sewer, gas or other
pipelines and to do or permit to be done any
underground work deemed necessary and proper by the
Grantor, along, across, over or under the Public Ways.
In permitting such work to be done, the Grantor shall
not be liable to the Grantee for any damage to
Grantee’s pipeline unless Grantor or its agents or
contractors are negligent in causing said damage.
B. Whenever by reason of establishing a grade or changes
in the grade of any street or in the location or
manner of construction of any public way, cables,
electric conduits, water, sewer, gas or other
underground structures, it shall be deemed necessary

portion of Grantee’s Distribution System located in
the Public Ways, such alterations or changes shall be
made within a reasonable time by the Grantee, as
ordered in writing by the Grantor, without claim for
reimbursement or compensation for damages against
Grantor; provided, however, that this Section is not
intended to require Grantee to alter, change, adapt or
conform any portion of its Distribution System without
reimbursement or compensation where the right to
locate the same, whether by private right-of-way
grant, utility easement or otherwise, was acquired
prior to its location in the public way.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
C. If Grantor shall require the Grantee to adapt or
conform its Distribution System or in any way to
alter, relocate or change its property to enable any
other person, firm, corporation or entity (whether
public or private), other than the Grantor, to use the
Public Ways, the Grantee shall be reimbursed by the
person, firm corporation or entity desiring or
occasioning such change for any and all loss, cost or
expense occasioned thereby.

forever save harmless the Grantor from any and all damages,
judgments, reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney

municipal corporate limits of the City by the Grantee pursuant
to the terms of this Ordinance or resulting from the negligent
exercise by the Grantee of any of its privileges or by reason of
its carrying on its business in the City (except where such
damages, judgments, reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorney fees, result from the negligence of Grantor or its
agents or contractors); provided, however, that in the event of
such claim or claims being prosecuted against the Grantor, the
Grantee shall have the right to defend against the same, and to
settle or discharge same in such manner as it may see fit, and
the Grantor shall give prompt written notice to the Grantee of
the presentation or prosecution of such claims.

reasonable rules and regulations as it may deem necessary for
the extension of its facilities, the sale of its gas and the
prudent conduct of its business, provided that such rules and
regulations shall neither be in conflict with the laws of the
State of Oklahoma, with the orders, rules or regulations of the
Corporation Commission of Oklahoma or other regulatory authority
having jurisdiction, nor with the ordinances and regulations of
the Grantor insofar as they are consistent with the jurisdiction
of the Corporation Commission of Oklahoma or such other
regulatory authority.
Section 7-810. INSPECTION OF RECORDS
Grantee shall permit Grantor or its agents to inspect,
during regular business hours, the books, papers and records
kept by Grantee in the ordinary course of business and
pertaining to the natural gas business carried on by it in the
City, such as plats, maps and atlases identifying Grantee’s
pipelines in the City, and the books and records necessary to
verify the franchise fee payment provided for in 7-811 hereof.
Notwithstanding the obligation herein, Grantee shall have the
right to request the reasonable protection of proprietary
information and to provide redacted documents or require Grantor
or its agents to enter into such agreements pertaining to
confidentiality as may reasonably protect the proprietary
information of Grantee but which do not unreasonably frustrate
the purposes of this Section. Grantor shall promptly notify
Grantee in writing of areas newly annexed into or de-annexed
from the corporate limits of Grantor, and Grantee shall update
its records for the purpose of payment of franchise fees as soon
as reasonably practicable after receiving such notice.
Section 7-811. CONSIDERATION FOR FRANCHISE: FRANCHISE FEE
A. In consideration for the rights and privileges enjoyed
under this franchise, Grantee agrees to pay Grantor as
follows:
(1) Grantee shall pay Grantor a franchise fee the sum
of which is equal to Four and One-Quarter Percent
(4.25%) of the Gross Receipts received by
Grantee, per billing period, from the
transportation, distribution, and sale of natural
4.2.2018 ADDITION
gas for domestic, commercial or industrial
consumption within the municipal corporate limits
of the City. All sums due from Grantee shall be
in lieu of all other franchise, license, or
occupational taxes or fees, which may be levied
or attempted to be levied on Grantee by the City.
(2) In the event that Grantor, pursuant to Section 7-
803.B(1) of this Article, requires persons
transporting gas pursuant to a Transportation
Tariff Arrangement to pay compensation to Grantor
for use of the Public Ways in connection the sale
of Transport Gas, said compensation shall be
calculated as a Volumetric Rate fee for such
Transport Gas, which shall be the sum equal to
the then current Volumetric Rate multiplied by
the number of Dth of Transport Gas reported or
distributed through Grantee’s facilities within
the municipal corporate limits of the City by
Grantee or by any third-party to transport
customers for consumption within the City.
Grantee will in that event collect such
Volumetric Rate Fees from persons transporting
gas pursuant to a Transportation Tariff
Arrangement and remit the same to Grantor.
B. In the event a customer of Grantee does not pay a
monthly bill from Grantee in full, Grantee shall
prorate its payments of remissions to the City for
sums due on that particular bill so that the amount
actually paid by the customer to Grantee on the bill
is distributed to Grantee for the natural gas
commodity and transportation or distribution service
and to the City for sums due on the bill in proportion
to the percentage of the total bill actually paid by
the customer. In the event Grantee actually collects
any outstanding amounts due on a past due, unpaid or
partially paid monthly bill to a customer, then
Grantee shall pay Grantor its proportionate share of
sums due to the City on such bill.
C. Grantee’s franchise fee based upon a percentage of
gross cash receipts or a volumetric rate shall be
payable monthly on or before the 25th day of each
4.2.2018 ADDITION
month, on its gross cash receipts for the preceding
calendar month.
D. All sums due from Grantee under this Section shall be
in lieu of all other franchise, license, or occupation
taxes or fees, which may be levied or attempted to be
levied on Grantee by the City.
E. The City’s chief administrative officer or his
designee may waive the Volumetric Rate Fee or any part
thereof due from a Transport Gas Consumer, but such
waiver shall only be granted if:
(1) The Transport Gas Consumer could otherwise obtain
its energy needs from another source that would
not be subject to the fees imposed in
Subparagraph 2 of Subsection 7-811.A above and
sufficient evidence is produced by the Transport
Gas Consumer so as to substantiate such
alternative source; and
(2) Such alternative source, including all other
fees, would be less than the cost of utilizing
Grantee to furnish and transport the gas or
transport alone, as the case may be.
F. Grantee shall update its records for the purpose of
franchise fee payments as soon as reasonably
practicable after receiving such notice.
G. Should Grantee accept any franchise from any other
municipality in Oklahoma in which Grantee provides
consumers with natural gas service, and should such
other franchise provide for a franchise fee, exaction
fee or other similar assessment greater than the
applicable rate specified above in Subsection 7-
811(A)(1) of this Article for a specified class of
service, whether domestic, commercial or industrial,
then the franchise fee rate provided for herein for
the same class of service in the City shall be
automatically increased as of the date of Grantee’s
acceptance of the other franchise to such higher rate.
Grantee will promptly notify the City of the
acceptance of such franchise by such other
municipality and the effective date thereof.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
H. In the event the accounting rendered to Grantor by
Grantee is found to be incorrect, then payment shall
be made on the corrected amount, it being agreed that
Grantor may accept amount offered by Grantee, but the
acceptance thereof by Grantor shall not be deemed a
settlement of such item if the amount is in dispute or
later found to be incorrect. Grantee shall have no
obligation, however, to make payment upon Transport
Gas for which Grantee has not been paid. Grantee
shall provide notice to Grantor of such delinquent
accounts within ninety (90) days and Grantor shall
hold Grantee harmless from the cost or liability for
the collection of franchise fees on such delinquent
accounts.
I. Grantor agrees that the franchise fee percentage rate
set forth in Subsection 7-811.A, at Paragraphs (1) and
(2), of this Article shall in no event exceed the
percentage rate hereafter approved to calculate any
fee paid to Grantor by any other person or entity for
use of the Public Ways if such fee or volumetric rate
is based in any way on the amount of revenues or gross
receipts from the transportation, distribution, or
sale of natural gas or electric energy, excluding any
municipally-owned electric utility, by such other
person or entity to ultimate Consumers within the
City. If at any time after the effective date of this
Article the fee or rate required to be paid by another
is less than the percentage rate set forth in
Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of 7-811, then the percentage
rate set forth in Paragraphs A(1) or (2) of Section 7-
811 of this Article shall be reduced to equal such
lesser percentage rate on the date such lesser
percentage rate becomes effective and without any
further action by the City or the qualified electors
residing therein.
Section 7-812. CONDITIONS OF FRANCHISE
This contract, franchise, grant and privilege is granted
and accepted under and subject to all applicable laws and under
and subject to all of the orders, rules, and regulations now or
hereafter adopted by governmental bodies now or hereafter having
jurisdiction.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
Section 7-813. INVALIDITY OF ORDINANCE
If any clause, sentence, or section of this Ordinance shall
be held to be invalid, it shall not affect the remaining
portions of this Article, which shall remain valid and effective
as if such invalid provision did not exist, although the parties
shall be entitled to a judicial interpretation or construction
of this Article to address the validation of such provision by
minimal amendment thereof. Further, should any governmental
body now or hereafter having jurisdiction determine that Grantee
shall not be permitted to collect in whole or in part the
compensation due Grantor by others for Transport Gas as set
forth in Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of Section 7-803 and
Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 7-811 of this Article,
Grantee shall thereafter have no obligation to make such payment
to Grantor and Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of Section 7-803
and Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of Section 7-811 shall be of
no force and effect.
Section 7-814. ELECTION REQUIRED

approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon
residing within the municipal corporate limits of the City at an
election called for that purpose, and a special election is

An emergency is hereby declared to exist by reason of the
fact that no other person, firm or corporation has a franchise
to furnish natural gas to residents and inhabitants of the City,
and for the preservation of the public peace, health and safety,
and by reason whereof this Article shall be effective
immediately from and after its passage, approval and

2. The City Manager or his designee is hereby designated

specified in this Article. A hearing shall be held by the City
Manager or his designee of the city to determine if the property
is dilapidated and has become detrimental to the health, safety,

including the cost of notice and mailing. The city clerk shall

dismantling and removal of the buildings and a demand for
payment of such costs, by mail to the property owner. In
addition, a copy of the statement shall be mailed to the

the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property
owner or mortgage holder, the city shall obtain a receipt of

the labor, maintenance, and equipment required for the
dismantling and removal of the dilapidated buildings. If
dismantling and removal of the dilapidated buildings is done on
a private contract basis, the contract shall be awarded to the
lowest and best bidder.
B. When payment is made to the city for costs incurred,
the city clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment
attributable to the actual cost of the dismantling and removal
4.2.2018 ADDITION
of the buildings is not made within six (6) months from the date
of the mailing of the statement to the owner of such property,
the city clerk shall forward a certified statement of the amount
of the cost to the county treasurer of the county in which the
property is located. The costs shall be levied on the property
and collected by the county treasurer as are other taxes
authorized by law. Until finally paid, the costs and the
interest thereon shall be the personal obligation of the
property owner from and after the date of the notice of
dilapidation and lien is filed with the county clerk. In
addition, the cost and the interest thereon shall be a lien
against the property from the date the notice of the lien is
filed with the county clerk. The lien shall be coequal with the
lien of ad valorem taxes and all other taxes and special
assessments and shall be prior and superior to all other titles
and liens against the property. The lien shall continue until
the cost is fully paid. At the time of collection, the county
treasurer shall collect a fee of Five Dollars ($5.00) for each
parcel of property. At any time prior to collection as provided
for in this paragraph, the city may pursue any civil remedy for
collection of the amount owing and interest thereon including an
action in personam against the property owner and an action in
rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral
interest, if severed from the surface interest and not owned by
the surface owner, shall not be subject to any tax or judgment
lien created pursuant to this Section. Upon receiving payment,
the city clerk shall forward to the county treasurer a notice of
such payment and shall direct discharge of the lien.

prevent the municipality from abating a dilapidated building as
a nuisance or otherwise exercising its police power to protect
the health, safety, or welfare of the general public.
D. The officers, employees or agents of the city shall
not be liable for any damages or loss of property due to the

Section 8-504 BOARDING AND SECURING DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS,
PROCEDURE, NOTICE.
A. After a building has been declared dilapidated, as
4.2.2018 ADDITION
provided in this Article, and before the commencement of the
tearing and removal of a dilapidated building, the city council
may authorize such a building to be boarded and secured.
However, if the dilapidated building is vacant and unfit for
human occupancy, the city may authorize the structure to be
demolished pursuant to this Article.
B. The city may cause the premises on which an unsecured
building is located to be cleaned of trash and weeds in
accordance with Article 1.
C. The City Manager or his designee is hereby designated
by the City Council to carry out the following duties of the
City Council. The City Manager or his designee may cause an
unsecured building to be boarded and secured in accordance with
the following procedures:
1. Before the City orders such action, at least ten (10)
days' notice that such unsecured building is to be boarded and
secured shall be given by mail to any property owners and
mortgage holders as provided in Section 8-502. At the time of
mailing of notice to any property owner or mortgage holder, the
city clerk shall obtain a receipt of mailing from the postal
service, which receipt shall indicate the date of mailing and
the name and address of the mailee. A copy of the notice shall
also be posted on the property to be affected. However, if
neither the property owner nor mortgage holder can be located,
notice may be given by posting a copy of the notice on the
property or by publication as defined in 11 O.S. Section 1-102.
Such notice shall be published one time, not less than ten (10)
days prior to any hearing or action by the city or City Manager
or his designee pursuant to the provisions of this Section. If
a municipal governing body anticipates summary abatement of a
nuisance in accordance with subsection C.9. of this Section, the
notice shall state: that any subsequent need for boarding and
securing the building within a six-month period after the
initial boarding and securing of the building pursuant to such
notice may be summarily boarded and secured by the municipal
governing body; that the costs of such boarding and securing
shall be assessed against the owner; and that a lien may be
imposed on the property to secure such payment, all without
further prior notice to the property owner or mortgage holder.
2. The owner of the property may give his written consent
to the city authorizing the boarding and securing of such
unsecured building and to the payment of costs incurred thereby.
By giving the written consent, the owner waives any right the
4.2.2018 ADDITION
owner has to a hearing by the city council;
3. If the property owner does not give his written consent
to such actions, a hearing may be held by the city council to
determine whether the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building would promote and benefit the public health, safety or
welfare. Such hearing may be held in conjunction with a
hearing on the accumulation of trash or the growth of weeds or
grass on the premises of such unsecured building held pursuant
to the provisions of Article 1. In making such determination,
the city council shall apply the following standard: the city
council may order the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building when the boarding and securing thereof would make such
building less available for transient occupation, decrease a
fire hazard created by such building, or decrease the hazard
that such building would constitute an attractive nuisance to
children. Upon making the required determination, the municipal
governing body may order the boarding and securing of the
unsecured building.
4. After the city council orders the boarding and securing
of the unsecured building, the city clerk shall immediately file
a notice of lien with the county clerk describing the property,
stating the findings of the city at the hearing at which such
building was determined to be unsecured, and stating that the
city claims a lien on the property for the costs of boarding and
securing the building and that such costs are the personal
obligation of the property owner from and after the date of
filing the notice;
5. Pursuant to the order of the city council, the agents
of the city are granted the right of entry on the property for
the performance of the boarding and securing of the building and
for the performance of all necessary duties as a governmental
function of the city;
6. After an unsecured building has been boarded and
secured, the city council shall determine the actual costs of
such actions and any other expenses that may be necessary in
conjunction therewith including the cost of the notice and the
mailing. The city clerk shall forward a statement of the actual
costs attributable to the boarding and securing of the unsecured
building and a demand for payment of such costs to any property
owners and mortgage holders as provided in Section 8-503. At
the time of mailing of the statement of costs to any property
owner or mortgage holder, the city clerk shall obtain a receipt
4.2.2018 ADDITION
of mailing from the postal service, which receipt shall indicate
the date of mailing and the name and address of the mailee. If
the city boards and secures any dilapidated building, the cost
to the property owner shall not exceed the actual cost of the
labor, materials and equipment required for the performance of
such actions. If such actions are done on a private contract
basis, the contract shall be awarded to the lowest and best
bidder.
7. When payment is made to the city for costs incurred,
the city clerk shall file a release of lien, but if payment
attributable to the actual costs of the boarding and securing of
the dilapidated building is not made within thirty (30) days
from the date of the mailing of the statement to the owner of
such property, the city clerk shall forward a certified
statement of the amount of the costs to the county treasurer of
the county in which the property is located. The costs shall be
levied on the property and collected by the county treasurer as
are other taxes authorized by law. The costs and the interest
thereon shall be the personal obligation of the property owner
from and after the date the notice of unsecured building and
lien is filed with the county clerk. In addition, the costs and
the interest thereon shall be a lien against the property from
the date the notice of the lien is filed with the county clerk.
The lien shall be coequal with the lien of ad valorem taxes and
all other taxes and special assessments and shall be prior and
superior to all other titles and liens against the property. The
lien shall continue until the costs and interest are fully paid.
At any time prior to collection as provided for in this
paragraph, the municipality may pursue any civil remedy for
collection of the amount owing and interest thereon including an
action in personam against the property owner and an action in
rem to foreclose its lien against the property. A mineral
interest if severed from the surface owner, shall not be subject
to any tax or judgment lien created pursuant to this Section.
Upon receiving payment, the municipal clerk shall forward to the
county treasurer a notice of such payment and shall direct
discharge of the lien.
8. The property owner or mortgage holder shall have a
right of appeal to the City Council from any order of the City
Manager or his designee. Such appeal shall be taken by filing
written notice of appeal with the city clerk within ten (10)
days after the administrative order is rendered.
9. If the city causes a structure within the city limits
4.2.2018 ADDITION
to be boarded and secured, any subsequent need for boarding and
securing within a six-month period constitutes a public nuisance
and may be summarily boarded and secured without further prior
notice to the property owner or mortgage holder. At the time of
each such summary boarding and securing, the city clerk shall
notify the property owner and mortgage holder of the boarding
and securing and the costs thereof. The notice shall state that
the property owner may request an appeal with the city clerk
within ten (10) days after the mailing of the notice. The notice
and hearing shall be as provided for in subsection 1 of this
Section. Unless otherwise determined at the hearing the cost of
such boarding and securing shall be determined and collected as
provided for in subsection 7.
10. The city council may determine that a building is
unsecured and order that such building be boarded and secured in
the manner provided for in this Section even though such
building has not been declared, by the governing body, to be
dilapidated.
11. For the purposes of this subsection:
a. "boarding and securing" or "boarded and secured" means
the closing, boarding or locking of any or all exterior openings
so as to prevent entry into the structure,
b. "unsecured building" shall mean any structure which is
not occupied by a legal or equitable owner thereof, or by a
lessee of a legal or equitable owner, and into which there are
one or more unsecured openings such as broken windows, unlocked
windows, broken doors, unlocked doors, holes in exterior walls,
holes in the roof, broken basement or cellar hatchways, unlocked
basement or cellar hatchways or other similar unsecured openings
which would facilitate an unauthorized entry into the structure,
and
c. "unfit for human occupancy" means a structure that due
to lack of necessary repairs is considered uninhabitable and is
a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the general
public.

Section 9-407 NATURE OF NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE AND INSTALLATION
REQUIREMENTS.
A. There is hereby granted by the City to the Grantee the
right and privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain,
in, upon, along, across, above, over and under the streets,
alleys, easements, public ways and public places not laid out or
dedicated, and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto, in
the City, poles, wires, fiber, cables and underground conduits,
manholes, and other conductors and fixtures necessary for the
maintenance and operation in the City of a Broadband
Telecommunications Network.
B. The right to use and occupy said streets, alleys,
easements, public ways, and places for the purposes herein set
forth shall not be exclusive and the City reserves the right to
grant a similar use of said streets, alleys, easements, public
ways and places, to any person at any time, during the term of
this nonexclusive franchise.
C. Grantee will provide service to all residents within
the city limits with the exception of where residents reside in
a remote or relatively inaccessible area or in annexed areas
already served by another Broadband Telecommunications Network.
The Grantee will build to these remote and inaccessible areas
and extend service inside the city limits on the following
schedule. For every one-fourth mile of cable plant required to
serve a particular Section of the City, ten (10) or more
customers must have placed orders for service. In franchised
areas with less than ten (10) homes per one-quarter (1/4) mile
4.2.2018 ADDITION
of cable plant necessary to serve those residents desiring
service, service shall be provided on a pro-rated cost sharing
basis. Each subscriber shall bear their pro-rated share of
construction costs required to extend the cable line from either
the line extension start point or the service point of the
previous subscriber physically located upstream on the extended
line to their respective service point. Pro-rated cost sharing
shall be determined in accordance with the following:
Initial No. of Subscribers Subscriber's
Per 1/4 Mile Pro-rated Shares of Total
Construction Costs*

9 90% 10%
8 80% 20%
7 70% 30%
6 60% 40%
5 50% 50%
4 40% 60%
3 30% 70%
2 20% 80%
1 10% 90%
*Actual cost per 1/4 miles of cable plant will vary depending
upon whether it is aerial or underground; according to system
design criteria and actual footage between service points.
Grantee shall determine the actual cost per foot which will be
multiplied by the appropriate percentage of construction cost.
The product of this calculation shall then be multiplied by each
subscriber's actual footage between service points to determine
individual subscriber charges.
All line extension provided in accordance with this Section
shall at all times remain the property of Grantee. Each
subscriber's pro-rated shares of construction costs shall be
individually negotiated with the Grantee according to the above
guidelines and shall be payable prior to commencement of
construction. Grantee will provide the City with design maps
showing footage and construction costs of each area where
residents enter into a pro-rated cable construction.
D. If technologically and financially feasible, Grantee
shall have constructed its system sufficient to make its service

areas with less than ten (10) homes per one-quarter (1/4) mile
of cable plant. Where an extension of the distribution system
is required, service must be extended (1) within 30 days of the
request for an extension of one-half mile or less or extension
to any person residing within the existing city limits as of the
effective date of this ordinance; or (2) in other cases, within
six (6) months.
F. Grantee will maintain a place of business and have
system personnel available in the City; provided however,
Grantee may alter this with prior written consent of the council
and it shall not be unreasonably withheld.

make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the
Grantee, but agreement therefore with the Grantee cannot be
reached, the Council may require the Grantee to permit such use
for such considerations and upon such terms as the Council shall
determine to be just and reasonable, if the Council determines
that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not
unduly interfere with the Grantee's operations.

(3) disinterested parties, one of such parties to be selected by
the Mayor, another to be selected by the Grantee, and the two
(2) parties so selected shall mutually agree upon a third party.
When all three (3) parties have been selected, they shall
proceed to appraise the system and determine the fair market
value to the Grantee, which determination shall be binding upon

third party, then the presiding District Judge of Noble County,
Oklahoma, or his designee shall serve as the third party. The
party selected by the Mayor shall be with approval of the
Council. However, if the City no longer desires to acquire the

receiving notice from the City, a cable operator shall file with
the City, its current rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the
reasonableness of its rates.
C. Expedited determination and public hearing.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
1. If the City Council is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator’s rates for the basic service tier and
associated equipment are within the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the City
Council shall:
a. hold a public hearing at which interested persons may
express their views; and

cable operator files its basic cable rates with the City.
2. If the City Council takes no action within 30 days
from the date the cable operator filed its basic cable rates
with the City, the proposed rates will continue in effect.
D. Extended review period.
1. If the city Council is unable to determine whether the
rates in issue are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
based on the material before it, or if the cable operator
submits a cost-of-service showing, the City Council shall,
within 30 days from the date the cable operator files its basic
cable rates with the City and by adoption of a formal
resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as
applicable, to make a final determination:
a. 90 days if the City Council needs more time to ensure
that a rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
b. 150 days if the cable operator has submitted a costof-
service showing seeking to justify a rate above the
applicable benchmark.
2. If the City Council has not made a decision within the
90 or 150 day period, the City Council shall issue a brief
written order at the end of the period requesting the cable
operator to keep accurate account of all amounts received by
reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are
paid.
E. Public hearing. During the extended review period and
before taking action on the proposed rate, the City Council
shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested
persons may express their views and record objections.
4.2.2018 ADDITION

an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the
City Clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or
may submit the objection in writing any time before the decision
resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the
objector’s name and address.
G. Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its
current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with
the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, the City Council shall
review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with
the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City
Council’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be
established as follows:
1. If the current basic cable rates are below the
benchmark, those rates, shall become the initial basic cable
rates and the cable operator’s rates will be capped at that
level.
2. If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
the rates shall be the greater of the cable operator’s per
channel rate on September 10, 1992, reduced by 10 percent, or
the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change
in the number of channels occurring between September 10, 1992
and the initial date of regulation.
3. If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark,
but the cable operator’s per channel rate was below the
benchmark on September 10, 1992, the initial basic cable rate
shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation.
H. Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does
not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the cable
operator shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service
showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic cable rates
above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. The City Council will
review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards
for cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve initial
basic cable rates above the benchmark if the cable operator
makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service
determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below
the cable operator’s September 10, 1992 rates minus 10 percent,
will prescribe the cable operator’s new rates.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
I. Decision.
1. By formal resolution. After completion of its review
of the cable operator’s proposed rates, the City Council shall
adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall
include one of the following:
a. If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, if any,
the City Council shall approve the initial basic cable rates
proposed by the cable operator; or
b. If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable
rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not
justify the proposed rates, the City Council shall establish
initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC’s reasonable
rate standard or that is justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
2. Rollbacks and refunds. If the City Council determines
that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the
reasonable rate standard or that the cable rates as submitted
exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator’s
cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the City Council
may order the rates reduced in accordance with Paragraph (g) or
(h) above, as applicable. In addition, the City Council may
order the cable operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the
excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at
applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for
tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to

or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to
the proposed rates, the resolution must give public notice of
its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once
in the official newspaper of the City.

B. Expedited determination and public hearing.
1. If the City Council is able to expeditiously determine
that the cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable
service is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as
determined by the applicable price cap, the City Council shall:

express their views; and
b. act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from

City.
2. If the City Council takes no action within 30 days
from the date the cable operator filed its request with the
City, the proposed rates will go into effect.

rate increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based
on the material before it, or if the cable operator submits a
cost-of-service showing, the City Council shall, by adoption of
a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of
time, as applicable, to make a final determination, as follows:
a. 90 days if the City Council needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard as determined by the applicable price cap; and

proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the amounts are paid.
D. Public hearing. During the extended review period and
before taking action on the requested rate increase, the City
Council shall hold at least one public hearing at which
interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
E. Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an
objection to the proposed rate increase may request the City
Clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may
submit the objection in writing any time before the decision
resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the
objector’s name and address.
F. Delayed determination. If the City Council is unable to
make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase
within the extended time period, the cable operator may put the
increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the City
Council later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the
increase.
G. Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its
request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the
FCC’s price cap, the City Council shall review the rate using
the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form
authorized by the FCC. Based on the City Council’s findings, the
basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
1. If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the
price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall
become the new basic cable rates.
2. If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the
price cap established by the FCC, the City Council shall
disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that
is in compliance with the price cap.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
H. Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a
cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase
above the price cap, the City Council will review the submission
pursuant to the FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The
City Council may approve a rate increase above the price cap if
the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a costof-
service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap
or below the cable operator’s then current rate will prescribe
the cable operator’s new rate.
I. Decision. The City Council’s decision concerning the
requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution.
If a rate increase proposed by a cable operator is disapproved
in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties
to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public
hearing by a person requesting the City Clerk to record the
objection or may be submitted in writing at anytime before the
decision resolution is adopted.

extended time period as described in Paragraph (c) above; and
b. the cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end
of the extended review periods; and

submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the rate
increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that
the cable operator failed to justify the rate increase by a
cost-of-service showing, and the City Council disapproves any
portion of the rate increase.
2. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate
will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the

non-disclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations.
If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public

4.2.2018 ADDITION
If the request does not present a case for non-disclosure and

Section 9-444 AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
A. Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC
regulations, the cable operator may adjust its capped base per
channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final
GNP-PI index.
B. Other external costs.
1. The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to
increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to
reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the
increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These
factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable
television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The
total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be
automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard
to its relation to the GNP-PI.
2. For all categories of external costs other than
retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for
measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service
per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the
basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28,
1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge
4.2.2018 ADDITION
may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or
changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994.
C. Notification and review. The cable operator shall
notify the City at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase
based on automatic adjustment items. The City shall review the
increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as
automatic adjustments. If the City makes no objection within 30
days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go
into effect.
Section 9-445 ENFORCEMENT.
A. Refunds. The City may order the cable operator to
refund to subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under
the following circumstances:
1. A portion of the previously paid rates have been
determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above
the actual cost of equipment; or
2. The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid
rate order issued by the City.
B. Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a
rate decision or refund order, the cable operator shall be
subject to a fine of $100 for each day the cable operator fails
to comply.
Note: Approved as Ordinance No. 94-3206 passed on April 4,

Section 12-274 RESERVED
Section 12-275 HOME OCCUPATIONS.
A. Purpose
Home occupations:
1. Can be an incubator for new business;
2. Can help people enter or stay in the work force who might
otherwise be unable to work; and/or
3. Can provide jobs for the elderly or those who do not wish
to work in a conventional work setting, and those for whom a
conventional work setting does not exist or work.
On the other hand, home occupations can sometimes be
intrusive on a residential neighborhood and can become
nuisances. This section takes into consideration the effect of
a home occupation on traffic patterns, parking availability,
4.2.2018 ADDITION
aesthetics, and nuisances and is designed to maintain a
residential character in residential neighborhoods.
B. Definition
“HOME OCCUPATION” is an accessory use of a dwelling unit
located in any residential district for the purpose of gainful
employment conducted by a member of the family residing in the
dwelling which is clearly customary, incidental and a
subordinate secondary use of the dwelling unit as a residence
and does not alter the exterior of the property or affect the
residential character of the neighborhood.
C. Home Occupations Permitted by Right
The following home occupations shall be permitted by right,
but shall comply with the provisions set out in subsection E:
Artists
Authors and Composers
Catering/Food Service
Computer Programming
Home cooking and preserving
Home crafts
Ironing
Sewing
Telephone answering and/or solicitation
Tutorial service
D. Prior to commencement of a Home Occupation, accessory
uses of a dwelling unit used for gainful employment, that meet
the definition of Home Occupation and which comply with the
provisions set out in subsection E, but which are not permitted
by right to be a Home Occupation as provided in subsection C,
are subject to a use by review process as provided in Section
12-287C, D, E, F & G entitled “Uses by Review.” The Planning
Commission and/or City Council may provide for any specific
condition or requirement necessary to further the purpose of the
Home Occupation, including but not limited to requiring
additional parking spaces, if necessary. In the event the Home
Occupation is granted, such use shall be terminated in the
event:
1. Ownership of the property changes. The approval of a
Use By Review for a home occupation is intended to be for the
existing land owner only. Any transfer of ownership after the
4.2.2018 ADDITION
home occupation is approved nullifies the particular approved
use.
2. The nature of home occupation changes from that which
was reviewed.
3. The home occupation lapses for a period of ninety (90)
days.
4. Reviewed conditions and agreements are not followed.
E. Requirements for all Home Occupations, whether by
right or permitted according to the use by review process.
1. The use is conducted entirely within:
a. The principal dwelling unit and attached garage and/or
b. One accessory building.
Such use is limited to members of the family or other
residents residing in the dwelling unit; provided however, one
additional employee may be specifically permitted by Board
recommendation and Commission approval.
2. No vehicular traffic shall be generated by the home
occupation business in greater volumes than would reasonably be
expected in the residential neighborhood or create unreasonable
parking or traffic congestion for the abutting or adjoining
neighbors or for the immediate neighborhood. Any parking or
traffic of such character, intensity and continued duration,
which substantially interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of
private homes by persons of ordinary sensibilities, shall be
considered unreasonable. It shall be a defense to prosecution
under this subsection that the parking or traffic created was
reasonable under the totality of the circumstances existing in
the neighborhood.
3. The use is clearly incidental and secondary to the
residential use of the dwelling and may not alter the existing
residential character of the principal dwelling or
garage/accessory building to comply with nonresidential
construction code is prohibited, except for accessibility
requirements.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
4. Except as herein provided, a change in the outside
appearance of the dwelling unit or lot indicating the use or
conduct of a home occupation, including advertising signs or
displays is prohibited. All equipment, goods, wares, merchandise
or materials associated with home occupation, including
equipment, goods, wares, merchandise or materials located in or
on vehicles, must not be visible from any public street or
public right-of-way or from other location off the premises.
5. The direct sale of commodities, goods, wares,
materials, merchandise or products to the general public is
prohibited unless:
a. The sale was made after an appointment to view the
commodities, goods, wares, materials, merchandise or products
occurred between the seller and purchaser;
b. The sale was made pursuant to an order filled on the
premises pursuant to a prior individual oral or written
invitation; or

than two (2) square feet in an area attached to the main or
accessory building or located on the real property and/or
advertising on a vehicle as herein provided. For purpose of
this section “vehicle” is defined as a passenger automobile,
passenger van, motorcycle or pick-up truck. All advertising on
vehicles shall be mounted flat against or painted on the vehicle
and shall not refer to the street address of the home occupation
business.
7. All off-site advertising, including signs, displays,
billboards, television, radio, and/or any other advertising
medium uses that refers to the street address is prohibited,
other than business stationary, business cards, the home
occupation business website, newsletters and applicable trade
directories.
8. No mechanical equipment shall be used which will be
obnoxious or offensive by reason of vibrations, noise, odor,
dust, smoke or fumes. No combustible materials shall be
4.2.2018 ADDITION
permitted on the premises that are in violation of the city’s
fire code.
9. Any use permitted by right which use materially
violates any of the above listed subsections herein may be
required by the Planning Commission to secure a use by review
approval pursuant to this section prior to continuing such home
occupation or otherwise forfeit the right to continue such
permitted home occupation.
10. No use involving a vehicle, boat or small engine
repair, painting, welding or metal shop, restaurant, or child
care facility for more than five (5) children shall be

Section 12-276 Z-0 ZERO LOT-LINE DISTRICT OVERLAY
A. General Description. The Zero Lot-Line District is a
supplemental district designation designed to facilitate
development of high density single family housing in which
houses may be located directly on one of the side lot lines.
Designation of an area as a Zero Lot-Line District will be
accomplished through the adoption of an overlay zoning district
which amends and supersedes the applicable requirements set out
in Section 12-263, Residential General (R-G) or Section 12-273,
Residential Single Family (R-1) areas.
B. General Provisions
1. Intent and Purpose. The purpose of this overlay
district is to permit the development of higher density housing,
such that detached dwellings may, where permitted, be located in
such a manner that an exterior sidewall is constructed with no
setback from an interior property line as required in Section
4.2.2018 ADDITION
12-263 and 12-273, but otherwise in conformance with such
Section.
2. Conflicts and Interpretations. In the event any
provision of this Section, or any district ordinance which is
adopted pursuant to these regulations, conflicts with or is
inconsistent in any manner with any other Section of the Zoning
Ordinance, or any Section of the Municipal Code, the provision
of this Section or the district ordinance shall supersede and
take precedence over such portions or portion in conflict.
3. Designation Procedure.
a. Generally. An area shall be designated a Zero Lot-
Line District in accordance with the minimum regulations set
forth below:
(1) No windows, doors, or other openings are permitted in
the zero setback sidewall.
(2) The side yard opposite the zero setback side on the
same property shall be a minimum of ten (10) feet in width.
(3) A perpetual ten-foot easement for the purpose of
building maintenance and separation between structures shall be
provided on the lot adjacent to the exterior dwelling sidewall
along the zero setback line provided that:
(4) The maintenance easement shall allow access to
principal buildings and to any accessory structures or
vegetation that do not otherwise have reasonable access to their
full height and width along the zero setback side for the
purpose of maintenance.
(5) Such easement must be shown on a subdivision plat, or
otherwise recorded by an irrevocable covenant which shall run
with the land, whereby proof of such recorded documents shall be
submitted with applicable for a building permit for any
structure to be so constructed.
(6) Roof overhangs from principal buildings may penetrate
the easement on the adjacent lot a maximum of two (2) feet
excluding gutter, but the roof shall be so designed that water
runoff from the structure placed on the lot line is limited to
the easement area.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
(7) Spacing between structures shall be no less than ten
(10) feet, measured from the outermost projections of
combustible materials.
(8) If a driveway is to be located along the lot line a
note of waiver must be recorded on the plat, or permission
otherwise obtained from the zoning officer, for a curb-cut
turning radius encroachment on the frontage of the adjacent
property.
b. Initiation procedure. Preliminary plat reviews with
planning staff members are encouraged. Once the staff members
have determined that an area meets the criteria for designation
as a Zero Lot-Line District, a hearing shall be set where the
Planning Commission will receive input and consider the proposed
plat for the district. Public notice shall be provided to the
same extent as notice for all re-zoning applications. Should
the Perry Planning Commission fail to approve the proposed plat,
the zero lot-line district designation process will not
continue.
c. Adoption. The City Council may designate an area as a
Zero Lot-Line District after meeting the following criteria:
i) Review: The overlay district shall be reviewed by the
administrative staff and the Perry Planning Commission for
compliance with this and other Section in the Municipal Code and
comprehensive plan. Other matters which may be considered
include, the effect of the proposed district on traffic
conditions, utilities and other public services, and the impact
on properties surrounding the areas proposed to be designated.
The findings and recommendation of the administrative staff and
Perry Planning Commission shall then be reported to the City
Council. Upon required notice being given, the City Council
shall review the application at a public hearing at which time
they shall receive comments from interested parties and receive
the recommendations of administrative staff and the Perry
Planning Commission.
ii) Approval. The City Council may approve or deny the
request for district designation. If approved, the district
shall become a part of the comprehensive plan of the City and
shall be shown on the Zoning Map as an overlay to the existing
zoning.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
iii) A drawing of the lot plan of such district is attached
to this adopting ordinance and is incorporated herein by
reference as if fully set out.

Section 12-286 SITE PLAN REVIEW.
A. PURPOSE. By reason of potential adverse effect on
public service, community appearance, environment, welfare, and
to neighboring land uses, Site Plan Review and approval shall be
required of development. For the purpose of assuring proper
accessibility, circulation, functional relationships of uses,
and compatibility with adjoining and nearby development, no
Building or Occupancy Permit shall be issued, nor use commenced,
except in accordance with a Site Plan submitted and approved by
the City in accordance with this section.
B. INTENT. The Site Plan Review process recognizes that
the developments to which it is made applicable, even though
generally suitable for location in a particular district or on a
particular site are because of their nature, size, complexity,
or other indicators of probable impact, capable of adversely
affecting the purposes for which these regulations are
established, unless careful consideration has been given to
critical design elements. Therefore, it is the intent of this
process to insure that all elements are reviewed for
compatibility with the provisions of these regulations. A Site
Plan, much like a preliminary plat of subdivision, is intended
to serve as a working document for the developer and the City.
It shall provide sufficiently detailed information to allow an
informed decision concerning the overall acceptability of the
4.2.2018 ADDITION
proposed development.
C. APPLICABILITY. Site Plan Review shall be required, as
a precondition to the issuance of a Building or Occupancy
Permit, in the following instance:
The development or establishment of any commercial or
special or industrial use.
D. RESERVED.
E. DESIGN STANDARDS. The following design standards
shall apply to any development requiring Site Plan Review:
1. Access. All developments requiring Site Plan Review
shall have adequate and safe vehicular access to adjacent
streets. All entrance and exit driveways to public streets
shall be located with due consideration for traffic flow so as
to afford minimum conflict to traffic on public streets. All
such entrances and exits shall be so located and designed so as
to comply with the Traffic Control Policies of the City and in
the case of State Highways, with the Oklahoma State Highway
Commission's Driveway Regulations for Oklahoma Highways.
2. Drainage. Proper surface drainage shall be provided
so that removal of surface waters will not adversely affect
neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system and
will, so far as practicable, avoid flooding, erosion, and
detrimental depositing of silt, gravel or stone. Surface water
shall be removed from all roofs, canopies, paved and other areas
and disposed of in an appropriate drainage system as approved by
the Building Official.
3. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be included as an
integral part of the development to provide a quality of life
and amenities in keeping with the natural physical surroundings
of the City. All developments shall be landscaped with trees,
ornamental shrubs and green areas according to the following
standards:
a. No less than five percent (5%) of the total land area
of the development shall be landscaped with trees, ornamental
shrubs, walkways, and green areas. At least seventy-five percent
of this area shall be in the front or side yards.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
b. All Site Plans shall include a detailed landscaping
plan indicating the type and number of plants to be provided.
c. Artificial grass or any form of synthetic plant shall
not be permitted as landscaping.
d. The use of gravel as ground cover shall not be
considered as meeting the minimum requirements of this Section.
e. The plan shall not interfere with sight triangles at
intersections as provided in the Subdivision Ordinance.
f. A Certificate of Occupancy shall not be issued until
landscaping has been installed in accordance with the approved
Site Plan. If the season of the year will not permit planting,
a temporary Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued until
growing season. Failure to plant landscaping shall be a
violation of these regulations.
g. All landscaping improvements shall at all times be
maintained in a live and healthy manner.
h. The Planning Commission and the City Council may
require that existing landscaping and vegetation on the site be
retained in order to satisfy the requirements of this Section.
i. The Zoning Officer, with approval from the City
Manager, can exempt any industrial development from compliance
with any or all of these landscaping provisions but shall
provide the reasons therefore in a written memorandum,
containing appropriate zoning and planning considerations, and
provided to the Planning Commission and City Council at the time
of the consideration of the Site Plan Review.
4. Lighting. All lighting in parking areas, as part of
signs and advertising or special lighting, shall be so arranged
to avoid unreasonable reflection, glare, or radiation onto
operators of motor vehicles, pedestrians, and neighboring land
uses or properties. Outdoor lighting when provided, shall have
an arrangement of reflectors and an intensity which will not
interfere with adjacent land uses or the use of adjacent
streets. No flickering, moving or flashing lights shall be
permitted.
5. Parking. The location, width and layout of interior
4.2.2018 ADDITION

it, an appropriate soil test and certification
from a licensed engineer shall be required for the
installation of a permeable pavement system.
d. The decision whether to permit an alternate pavement
system for overflow parking areas shall be based on
its intended location, utility, aesthetic
considerations, surrounding uses and such other
factors as the Planning Commission and City Council
deem appropriate. No alternative pavement system may
be used on an approach to or from any property, which
approach shall be in concrete.
(3) Provisions applicable to both types of alternative
paving systems:

remedy the occurrence or shall be subject to a fine and costs.
6. Relation of proposed structures to environment.
Proposed structures on the site shall be related in style and
design and shall also relate visually to the terrain and
existing buildings and roads in the vicinity. The achievement
4.2.2018 ADDITION
of such harmonious relationship may include the enclosure of
space in conjunction with other existing buildings or other
proposed buildings and the creation of focal points with respect
to avenues of approach, terrain features or other buildings.
Proposed structures shall be so cited as to minimize any adverse
impact upon the surrounding area, and particularly upon nearby
residences, by reason of:
a. Building location, height, bulk and shadows;
b. Location, intensity, direction and time usage of
outdoor lighting;
c. Likelihood of nuisances;
d. Other similar considerations.
Appropriate screening shall be required to minimize any
such adverse impact.
7. Screening. Development and maintenance of plantings,
fences, and walls shall be provided as an aesthetic barrier
against traffic, noise, heat, glare, and dust for the protection
and conservation of property. Whenever any lot located in any
commercial or special use or industrial zone is to be developed
or occupied by a commercial or special use or industrial uses(s)
and it abuts a lot located in any residential zone or a lot
developed residentially, or it otherwise abuts any property or
lot which should be visually protected from such use as
determined by the Planning Commission and/or the City Council,
the lot shall be screened by the development with a minimum 75%
opaque barrier not less than 5 feet in height along the entire
abutting lot line. Said screening or barrier shall be dense
landscaping, earthen berm, solid lumber or masonry fence, wall,
or combination thereof. Solid lumber fencing shall be treated
or painted in earth tone colors. More extensive screening may
be required by the Planning Commission and City Council in
instances where the above described screening does not
adequately protect adjacent properties from unsightly or
distractive activity. The screening shall be maintained in good
condition. Prescribed screening need not be provided along a
lot line if a building, fence, wall or dense landscaping of at
least equivalent height, capacity, and maintenance exits
immediately abutting on the opposite side of said lot line. In
addition, the Planning Commission and the City Council may
4.2.2018 ADDITION
require that existing landscaping and vegetation on the site
which serves a partial or full screening be retained in order to
satisfy the requirements of this Section. The Zoning Officer,
with the approval of the City Manager, can exempt any
industrial development from compliance with any or all of the
these screening provisions but shall provide the reasons
therefore in a written memorandum, containing appropriate zoning
and planning considerations, and provided to the Planning
Commission and City Council at the time of the consideration of
the Site Plan Review.
8. Special Features. Outside storage areas, service and
machinery installations, service areas, truck loading areas,
utility buildings, and structures, and similar accessory areas
and structures shall be subject to such setbacks, screen
plantings or other screening methods as shall reasonably be
required to prevent any adverse effect upon the environment or
nearby property.
9. Waste disposal. All containers for the disposal of
wastes can be required to be located on a concrete pad and shall
be screened to the extent that the container cannot be viewed by
the public.
10. Public Rights-of-Way, Streets and Easements. Each
Site Plan shall provide for the appropriate dedication and
improvement of needed rights-of-way and easements as are
necessary to adequately serve the proposed development and
occupancy and the minimum design standards of the City.
11. Signs. Except as otherwise hereinafter provided, all
signs submitted as a part of Site Plan Review Process shall
conform to the sign regulations provided for in Chapter 12,
Article 5 of this municipal code (hereinafter “Sign Ordinance”).
In the case of an application for a sign that does not meet the
terms of the Sign Ordinance the applicant may apply to the Board
of Adjustment for a variance, or as a part of the Site Plan
Process, to the Planning Commission and City Council for a
special exception as specifically hereinafter provided. Any
request for a special exception to the Sign Ordinance regarding
a discretionary decision on the part of the governing body may
only be considered with respect to the location, height, size or
lighting of the sign. The specific criteria to be considered by
the Planning Commission and City Council when considering a
special exception to the Sign Ordinance are the following:
4.2.2018 ADDITION
A. The special exception sought must not violate the terms of
any applicable International Code; and
B. The special exception must, as best as possible, take into
consideration the natural environment, and the health, safety
and welfare of the residents and landowners immediately adjacent
to the sign, including issues concerning location, height, size
or lighting of the sign; and
C. Whether the special exception is for a temporary or
permanent sign.
Reasonable conditions may be required in conjunction with the
approval of a special exception to the Sign Ordinance and such
reasonable conditions shall be memorialized in writing in the
ordinance or resolution or motion (with official minutes)
approving the special exception as a part of the site plan.
Moreover, the specific special exception sought to the Sign
Ordinance must be identified in the required site plan public
notice.
F. PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW. Prior to submission of a Site
Plan, the applicant should discuss with the Zoning Officer the
procedure and the requirements of the general layout of the
site, utilities, access to arterials, general design and
narrative, the availability of existing services, and similar
matters. The intent of the pre-application review is to

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
DIVISION 1
STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FINDINGS OF FACT STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
AND METHODS
SECTION 12-401 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in Oklahoma
Floodplain Management Act, Sections 1601 through 1620.1 of Title
82 of the Oklahoma Statutes, delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City Council of Perry,
Oklahoma does hereby ordain that these Flood Damage Prevention
Ordinances, as set forth herein, including Sections 1.1 through
5.8, and any lawfully enacted amendments thereto, be hereby
enacted and effective on July 19, 2018.
SECTION 12-402 FINDINGS OF FACT.
1. The flood hazard areas of the City of Perry, Oklahoma,
are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life
and property, health, and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures
for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are created by the cumulative
effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in
flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood
hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed
or otherwise protected from flood damage.
SECTION 12-403 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this Article to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by
provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
4.2.2018 ADDITION
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects;
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense
of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
such as water, and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer
lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner
as to minimize future flood blight areas; and
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that
property is in a flood area.
SECTION 12-404 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this section uses the
following methods:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to
health, safety or property in the times of flood, or in case of
excessive increase in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood
damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in
the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other
development which may increase flood damage;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands.

reasonable application.
“Accessory Structure” means structures which are on the
same parcel of property as the principle structure and the use
of which is incidental to the use of the principle structure
(such as garages and storage sheds).
“Alluvial Fan Flooding” means flooding occurring on the
surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates
at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active
processes of erosion, sediment transport, deposition; and
unpredictable flow paths.
“Apex” means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform
below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the
fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur.
“Area of Future Conditions Flood Hazard means the land use
that would be inundated by the 1-percent-annual chance (100
year) flood based on future conditions hydrology.
“Appeal” means a request for a review of the flood plain
administrator's interpretation of this section or a request for
a variance.
“Area of shallow flooding” means a designated AO, AH,
AR/AO, AR/AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) with a 1 percent or greater annual chance of flooding
to an average depth of 1 to 3 feet. Such flooding is
characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
“Area of special flood hazard” is the land in the flood plain
within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone
A, on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed rate
making has been completed in preparation for publication of the
FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE,

performed. The term does not, however, include either, 1) any
project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary
conditions, or 2) Any alteration of a "historic structure"
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a "historic structure".
“Variance” is a grant of relief to a person from the
requirements of this Article when specific enforcement would
result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits
construction, or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by
this ordinance. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program Regulations.)
“Violations” means the failure of a structure or other
developments to be fully compliant with the community's flood

A. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination
that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.
B. Variances shall only be issued upon, (i) showing a
good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to
grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
C. A written notice will be provided to any person
granted a variance to build a structure below the base flood
elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced
lowest floor elevation.
11. Variances may be issued by a community for new
construction and substantial improvements and for other
development necessary for the conduction of a functionally
dependent use provided that (i) the criteria outlined in
Division 4, Section 12-416 (1)-(9) are met, and (ii) the
structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.

SECTION 12-420 STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW FLOODING (AO/AH
ZONES).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard
established in Division 3, Section 12-407, are areas designated
as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards
associated with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow: therefore,
the following provisions apply;
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential structures have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's
FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified);
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures;
(a) Have the lowest floor (including basements) elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth
number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
feet if no depth number is specified), or;
(b) Together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to
the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of
effects of buoyancy.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
3. Registered professional engineer or architect shall
submit a certification to the Floodplain Administrator that the
standards of this Division 4, as proposed in Section 12-415, are
satisfied.
4. Require within Zones AH, or AO adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes, to guide flood waters around and
away from proposed structures.
SECTION 12-421 FLOODWAYS
Floodways - located within areas of special flood hazard
established in Division 3, Section 12-407, are areas designated
as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris,
potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
(1) Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other development
within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed
in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood
levels within the community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
(2) If Division, Section 12-421(1) above is satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all
applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Division 5.
(3) Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of
the National Flood Insurance Program Regulations, a community
may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway
that would result in an increase in base flood elevations,
provided that the community first completes all of the
provisions required by Section 65.12.

ordinance or regulations within this jurisdiction.
2. Signs in rights-of-way. No sign other than an
official traffic sign or similar sign shall be erected within 2
feet of the edge of any street, or within any public way, unless
specifically authorized by other ordinances or regulations of
this jurisdiction or by specific authorization of the code
official.
3. Projections over public ways. Signs projecting over
public walkways shall be permitted to do so only subject to the
projection and clearance limits either defined herein or, if not
so defined, at a minimum height of 8 feet from grade level to
the bottom of the sign. Signs, architectural projections or
sign structures projecting over vehicular access areas must
conform to the minimum height clearance limitations imposed by
the jurisdiction for such structures.
4. Traffic visibility. No sign or sign structure shall
be erected at the intersection of any street in such a manner as
to obstruct free and clear vision, nor at any location where by

the view of or be confused with any authorized traffic sign,
signal or device.
5. Computation of frontage. If a premises contains walls
facing more than one property frontage bounded by more than one
street or other property usages, the sign area(s) for each
building wall or property frontage will be computed separately
for each building wall or property line facing a different
frontage. The sign area(s) thus calculated shall be permitted
to then be applied to permitted signs placed on each separate
wall or property line frontage. For instance, businesses located
in commercial and industrial zones proximate to Interstate 35
may have two frontages for wall and free-standing sign purposes.
6. Animation and changeable messages. Animated signs,
except as prohibited in Section 12-506, are permitted in
commercial and industrial zones. Changeable signs, both

otherwise deemed unsafe by the code official, or if any sign
shall be unlawfully installed, erected or maintained in
violation of any of the provisions of this Article, the owner
thereof or the person or firm using same shall, upon written
notice by the code official forthwith in the case of immediate
danger, and in any case within nor more than ten (10) days, make
such sign conform to the provisions of this Article, or shall
remove it. If within ten (10) days the order is not complied
with, the code official shall be permitted to remove or cause
such sign to be removed at the expense of the owner and/or the
user of the sign.
8. Obsolete sign copy. Any sign copy that no longer
advertises or identifies a use conducted on the property on
which said sign is erected must have the sign copy covered or
removed within thirty (30) days after written notification from
the municipal code official; and upon failure to comply with
such notice, the code official is hereby authorized to cause
removal of such sign copy, and any expense incident thereto
shall be paid by the owner of the building, structure or ground
on which the sign is located. Historically significant signs
are exempt from this provision.
9. Nonconforming signs. Any sign legally existing at the
time of the passage of this Article that does not conform in
use, location, height or size with the regulations of the zone
in which such sign is located, shall be permitted to continue in
such status until such time as it is either abandoned or removed
by its owner, subject to the following limitations:
A. Structural alterations, enlargement or re-erection are
permissible only where such alterations will not increase the
degree of nonconformity of the signs.
B. Any legal nonconforming sign may be rebuilt without
increasing the existing height or area if it is damaged or
deteriorated but must be removed if the cost of repair or
restoration exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost

WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS
Section 12-601 PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish general
guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and
antennas. The goal of this section is to:
1. Protect residential areas and land uses from potential
adverse impacts of towers and antennas;
2. Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential
areas;
3. Minimize the total number of towers throughout the
community;
4. Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing
tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of
additional single use towers;
5. Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them,
to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
6. Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure
them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the
towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscaping,
and innovative camouflaging techniques;
7. Enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the
community quickly, effectively, and efficiently;
8. Consider the public health and safety of communication
towers; and
4.2.2018 ADDITION
9. Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from
tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower
structures. In furtherance of these goals, the City shall give
due consideration to the master plan, zoning map, existing uses,
and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the
location of towers and antennas.

special use permit, although the planning commission may waive
or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these
criteria if the planning commission concludes that the goals of
this section are better served thereby:
4.2.2018 ADDITION
(1) Height of the proposed tower;
(2) Proximity of the tower to residential structure and
residential district boundaries;
(3) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(4) Surrounding topography;
(5) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(6) Design of the tower, with particular reference to
design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
(7) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(8) Availability of suitable existing towers, other
structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of
towers or structures, as discussed in Section 6062c.

subject to the review and approval of the Mayor (hereinafter the
“eligible costs”). The developer shall be paid 90% of the
eligible costs reimbursed from third parties as provided herein,
with the City retaining 10% as an administrative fee. The City
and the developer shall enter into a contract providing for the
reimbursement of such costs by the City to the developer for
such extension, including the provision of excess capacity, from
third parties desiring to connect to such utility main as
provided herein. The eligible costs as approved by the Mayor
shall be attached to and made a part of such contract.
B. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to connect to
any utility main subject to this section shall pay to the City a
fee equal to the percentage that such person, firm or
corporation’s usage volume of such utility main relates to the
total main’s capacity X the eligible cost (“pro-rata share”).
(Connector’s usage volume/utility main capacity X eligible costs=pro-rata
share)
4.2.2018 ADDITION
The City’s engineer shall make such determination at the time
the person, firm or corporation makes application for a
connection to the utility main or the City may make such
determination by reference to the water and sewer tables
attached to this ordinance, found in the files of the City Clerk
and incorporated herein by reference. Such person firm or
corporation shall pay their pro-rata share prior to approval of
the connection. In the event a permit, tap, connection or
permission is given or granted by the City to any third party to
a utility main governed by the terms of this section, without
the payment of such required pro-rata share, by negligent act or
omission or otherwise, the City may, after at least ten (10)
days written notice of such fact is given to such offending
person, firm or corporation, disconnect such person, firm or
corporation’s water utility service until such pro-rata share
is paid.
C. Only utility mains subject to this section and
constructed after June 3, 2002, shall be subject to the prorata
share payback program.
D. Each person, firm or corporation identified in
subsection (b)and subject to the pro-rata share payback program
shall pay their pro-rata share subject to an Inflation/deflation
adjustment. Such adjustment shall be calculated using an
inflation factor from the Engineering News Record Construction
Cost Index. The inflation factor shall be a percentage increase
or decrease applied to the pro-rata share that adjusts the
amount due for these costs. The year that the utility main
improvement is constructed shall constitute the base year. The
latest available year before the new tap is made shall be the
comparison year. The inflation factor will be calculated by
dividing the base year index into the comparison year index
times the pro-rata share. The value of the base factor in place
at the time the City Council adopts the contract with a
developer will be applied to that project until all funds are
paid back or the obligation expires, whichever occurs first.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
E. Beginning at year sixteen (16) after the utility main
is completed and accepted by the City and continuing through
year twenty (20), the eligible costs shall decrease at a rate of
twenty (20) percent of the eligible cost amount existing at the
end of the fifteenth year until the eligible cost obligation is
reduced to zero dollars ($0.00) and thus terminates at the end
of the twentieth year from the date of construction and
acceptance of the utility main.
F. This ordinance shall not apply in the event that an
easement or other contract approved or accepted by the City
specifically provides for a different or no-cost requirement, or
if the City Council declares an exception to the rule by a 3/4
vote of all the members of the City Council.
G. The City’s sole responsibility to the developer shall
be to reimburse funds received by it from third parties pursuant
to the terms of this section. The City shall have no liability
or indebtedness or other obligation whatsoever to the developer.
H. Any person, firm or corporation who deems himself
aggrieved by the terms and conditions of this section shall have
a right of appeal to the City Council. The City Council’s
decision shall be final in all respects.
I. For purpose of this section “public utility main” or
“utility main” shall mean:
Six inches (6")or larger for water mains
Eight inches (8") or larger for sewer mains

Fee shall be One Dollar ($1.00); for all installations exceeding
2 feet in width, the Fee shall be Two Dollars ($2.00). The
minimum Fee shall be One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each
manhole, junction box and any other fixtures.
2. The Occupancy Permit Fee will be reviewed annually and
adjusted based on the increase or decrease of the CPI-Urban
Users Index. The purpose of this review is to examine whether
the Fee is under or over recovering costs associated with ROW
use.
Section 14-406 ENGINEERING STANDARDS
A. Allocation of Space in the Rights-of-Way. The City
Manager shall have the power to establish reasonable limitations
on the placement of new or additional Facilities within specific
congested segments of the Rights-of-Way if there is insufficient
space to accommodate all of the requests of ROW Occupants. In
making such decisions, the City Manager shall strive to the
extent possible to accommodate all existing and potential users
of the Rights-of-Way, but shall be guided primarily by
considerations of the public interest, the public's needs for
the particular utility service, the width and physical condition
of the Rights-of-Way, the protection of existing Facilities in
the Rights-of-Way, and future City plans for public improvements
and development projects which have been determined to be in the
public's interest.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
B. Overhead/Underground Policy. Facilities may be
installed above ground in areas where existing utility
Facilities are above ground and shall, unless otherwise approved
by the City Manager, be installed underground in areas where
existing Facilities are installed underground, subject to all
applicable safety codes. The City encourages the sharing of
underground and overhead Facilities. Leasing of excess space in
ducts, conduits and on poles is a matter between interested
parties; however, lessees of such physical Facilities must still
comply with the terms of this Article, unless otherwise
expressly exempted by the City Manager. Underground Facilities
shall be placed in such a manner so they can be located by the
owner of the Facilities or his representative.
C. Location Criteria.
1. Corridors. The City Manager shall assign specific
corridors within the Rights-of-Way, or any particular segment
thereof as may be necessary, for each type of facility that is
now or as the City Manager concludes may in the future be
located within the Rights-of-Way. The City Manager shall
establish an ideal cross section identifying the lateral and
vertical position of each class of potential user. ROW
Permittee's shall have the right to occupy only one corridor or
section of each Rights-of-Way within the vertical zone
established for the applicable class of user, as established by
the City Manager. Additional corridors in the same portion of
the Rights-of-Way may be granted only upon consideration of
future utility uses and a demonstration by the requesting party
that its current corridor does not afford sufficient space to
install its Facilities. All permits issued by the City Manager
or involving the installation or replacement of equipment shall
be reviewed as to the proper corridor for the Facility.
2.
2. Interference. A ROW Occupant shall not place any
fixtures or equipment where the same will interfere with any
existing Facility. A ROW Occupant shall locate its lines and
equipment in such a manner as not to interfere unnecessarily
with the usual traffic patterns (vehicular or pedestrian) or
with the rights or reasonable convenience of owners of property
that abuts any Rights-of-Way.

(whether frivolous or otherwise), or proceeding, as well as the
reasonable value of any services rendered by the City Attorney,
or City staff or employees.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
D. Nothing in this Article shall be construed to waive
any immunity the City enjoys under applicable law, or the
Oklahoma Constitution.
E. Acceptance of the provisions of this section shall be
a condition of all Rights-of-Way Construction Permits.
Section 14-409 NO LIMITS ON LIABILITY.
Neither the provisions of this Article nor any damages
recovered by the City shall be construed to limit the liability
of an Occupant for damages to the City, its elected and
appointed officials, officers, boards, commissions,
commissioners, agents, employees, volunteers and any other
person or persons.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
Section 14-410 RELOCATION OF EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES
An Occupant shall promptly and at its own expense, with due
regard for seasonal working conditions, permanently relocate its
equipment and Facilities in the Rights-of-Way upon written
notification by the City Manager. The City Manager shall
forward a recommendation upon careful determination of the best
interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the public
regarding any such relocation. Such relocation shall include
restoring the Rights-of-Way to the same condition it was in
prior to said relocation, in accordance with the terms of this
Article. An Occupant shall, within three months, at its own
expense, protect, or modify any part of its Facility when
required by the City by reason of traffic safety, public safety,
road construction, change of street grade, installation of
water, stormwater, or sanitary pipes, traffic signal devices, or
any other types of City improvement projects. The Public Work
Director may recommend such actions in order to prevent
interference by the Permittee’s Facilities with: a present or
future City use of the Arterial Rights-of-Way; or a capital
improvement project funded and scheduled to be undertaken by the
City; or an economic development project in which the City has
an interest or investment. The City Manager may also recommend
such actions: when the public health, safety and welfare
require it; or when necessary to prevent interference with the
safety and convenience of ordinary travel over the
Rights-of-Way, both vehicular and pedestrian; or when
aboveground equipment is located in such a manner as to create
an obstruction to a driver's line of sight. The Occupant may
for due cause make application to the City Manager for an
extension to complete such relocation as required by this
section.
The foregoing does not alter an Occupant’s prior rights or
obligations within an existing easement established prior to the
dedication of Rights-of-Way in establishing the party
responsible for the expense of any required relocation of
equipment.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
Section 14-411 PRE-EXCAVATION LOCATION OF EQUIPMENT
Before an Occupant shall commence to excavate in a roadway,
street, alley or other Rights-of-Way as defined in this Article,
such Occupant, unless otherwise exempt by state statute, shall
first notify all operators in the City who are on file with the
county clerk as to having underground Facilities within the
county, pursuant to the Underground Facilities Damage Prevention
Act, 63 O.S.1991, §§ 142.1, et seq., as supplemented; said
notice shall be either directly or by notice to the statutory
"Okie" One-call notification center. Each Occupant served with
notice in accordance with 63 O.S.1991, § 142.6, shall locate and
mark or otherwise provide the location of the underground
Facilities of the operator in such a manner as to enable the
excavator to determine the precise location of the underground
Facilities in advance of excavation. In any event, should the
excavator in the course of excavation discover and damage an
unmarked utility, the City of Perry shall be indemnified from
liability for any damage that should occur due to the failure on
the part of either the excavator or the Occupant.
Section 14-412 DAMAGE TO OTHER FACILITIES
A. Damage to Other Facilities. Each Occupant shall
comply fully with the Underground Facilities Damage Prevention
Act, 63 O.S.1991, §§ 142.1, et seq., as supplemented.
Section 14-413 ABANDONED AND UNUSABLE FACILITIES
A. Discontinuing Operations. An Occupant that has
determined to discontinue its operations in the City must
either:
1. Obtain the consent of the City to transfer ownership
control of its Facilities pursuant to Section 14-417 and ensure
that the new owner or controlling entity has applied for
registration prior to closing; or
2. Submit to the City, within ninety (90) days of the
planned date for discontinuance of operation, a proposal and
instruments for transferring ownership of its Facilities to the
City. If a Permittee proceeds under this clause, the City may
at its option:
a. Purchase the Facilities; or,
4.2.2018 ADDITION
b. Require the Permittee, at its own expense, to remove
the Facilities.
B. Abandonment. Facilities of an Occupant who fails to
comply with the preceding paragraph and which, for twelve (12)
months, remains unused, shall be deemed to be abandoned.
Abandoned Facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. Upon thirty
(30) days' notice to the occupant, the City may exercise any
remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not
limited to:
1. Abating the nuisance;
2. Taking possession of the Facilities and restoring them
to a useable condition;
3. Requiring removal of the Facilities at the expense of
the Occupant; or
4. Removing abandoned Facilities in any Rights-of-Way in
conjunction with a proposed construction project.
Section 14-414 RESERVATION OF REGULATORY AND POLICE POWERS
No provision of this Article, nor any action taken by the
City pursuant to this Article, shall be deemed to surrender,
waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights to
regulate the use or occupancy of the Rights-of-Way that now or
may be hereafter vested in the City under the Constitution and
statutes of the state of Oklahoma or under the Charter of the
City of Perry. By accepting a Rights-of-Way Construction Permit
an Occupant is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject
to the regulatory and police powers of the City as exist under
applicable law to adopt and enforce general Articles necessary
for the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree
to comply with all applicable general laws and Articles enacted
by the City, pursuant to such powers. Unless otherwise
expressly provided by a Rights-of-Way Construction Permit, any
conflict between the provisions of any such authorization and
any other present or future lawful exercise of the City's
regulatory or police powers shall be resolved in favor of the
City.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
Section 14-415 APPEALS
An appeal may be taken to the City Council by any person
aggrieved, where it is alleged there is an error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination made by any person in the
enforcement of this Code. The appeal must be presented upon
written request to the City Clerk or his/her designee.
Section 14-416 REVOCATION
If a regulatory body or a court of competent jurisdiction
should determine by a final, non-appealable order that any
franchise, permit, right or registration issued under this
Article or any portion of this Article is illegal or
unenforceable, then any such franchise, permit, right or
registration granted or deemed to exist hereunder shall be
considered as a revocable permit with a mutual right of either
party to terminate without cause upon giving sixty (60) days'
written notice to the other. The requirements and conditions of
such a revocable permit shall be the same requirements and
conditions as set forth in the franchise, permit, right or
registration, respectively, except for conditions relating to
the term of the permit and the right of termination. If a
franchise, permit, right or registration shall be considered a
revocable permit as provided herein, the permittee must
acknowledge the authority of the City Council to issue such
revocable permit and the power to revoke it.
Section 14-417 TRANSFERS
A. Notification Required. No Transfer shall occur
without prior notice to the City Manager. Notice of the
Transfer must meet the requirements of Section 14-413, as
applicable, and provide complete information on the proposed
transaction, including the legal, financial, technical and other
pertinent qualifications of the transferee as deemed necessary
by the City Manager.
B. No Waiver or Release. A transfer of a Rights-of-Way
Construction Permit shall not constitute a waiver or release of
any of the rights of the City.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
Section 14-418 EXEMPTIONS
This Article applies, to the greatest extent permissible
under applicable law, to all ROW Occupants. If, on the
effective date of this Article, a person holds a Franchise, or
has prior rights under a contract, and the terms of this Article
conflict with or impose additional requirements or obligations
not contained in the franchise or contract, that person is
exempted from such terms of this Article and the terms of the
Franchise shall control, to the extent required by the Franchise
or contract and applicable law.
Section 14-419 ENFORCEMENT
A. Remedies for Violations. If a ROW Occupant violates
any provision of this Article, the City Attorney may, after
providing notice to the Occupant at the address provided in the
Permit and a hearing in which the Occupant may appear and be
heard, take one or more of the following actions:
1. Impose liquidated damages in the amount, if any,
provided in the Rights-of-Way Construction Permit, whether per
day, incident, or other measure of violation. Payment of
liquidated damages by the Occupant does not relieve the Occupant
of its obligation to meet the requirements of this Article;
2. Impose penalties pursuant to Section 14-420;
3. Reduce the duration of the Rights-of-Way Construction
Permit on any basis the City determines is reasonable and
affords the Occupant reasonable due process;
4. Revoke the Rights-of-Way Construction Permit pursuant
to its terms or applicable law.
B. City Attorney’s Discretion. In determining which
remedy or remedies are appropriate under subsection 14-419A, the
City Attorney shall consider the nature of the violation, the
person or persons bearing the impact of the violation, the
nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further
violations, and any other matters the City Attorney determines
are appropriate. In addition to or instead of these remedies,
the City Attorney may seek legal or equitable relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction.
4.2.2018 ADDITION
C. Opportunity to Cure. Before initiating a remedy under
this section, other than revocation of the Rights-of-Way
Construction Permit, the City shall give the Occupant written
notice of the violations claimed and at least twenty (20)
working days to correct the violations.
Section 14-420 PENALTIES
The City Attorney shall have the authority to assess
penalties against a ROW Occupant for failure to comply with the
terms of its Rights-of-Way Construction Permit or any other
portions of this Article. Any such assessment must be provided
to the Occupant in writing with a Notice of Violation, and
provide for a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation,
provided that the violation is not a result of inclement
weather. If the Occupant fails to remedy the deficiency by the
end of the twenty (20) day period, the penalty amounts shall
begin to accrue and shall continue to accrue until the date that
the deficiency is corrected.
A. For effecting or attempting to effect a transfer
without approval: $100.00 per day for each violation for each
day the violation continues;
B. For failure to supply information, reports, or filings
lawfully required under the terms of a ROW Construction Permit
or applicable law or by the City: $100 per day for each
violation for each day the violation continues;
C. For failure to restore or repair damages to private
property: $300 per day, in addition to the cost of the
restoration;
D. For any other violations of the City Code,
Rights-of-Way Construction Permit, or other applicable law:
$200 per day for each violation for each day the violation
continues;
F. For any other violations of the Perry Municipal Code,
Occupancy Permit, Rights of way Construction Permit, or other
applicable law: $200 per day for each violation for each day the
violation continues.

Section 16-303 AIRPORT ZONES.
In order to carry out the provisions of this Article, there
are hereby created and established certain zones which include
all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces,
transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces
as they apply to the Perry Municipal Airport. Such zones are
shown on the Perry Municipal Airport Airspace Drawing, which is
part of the Airport Layout Plan for the Perry Municipal Airport,
and which sheet is located in the City Clerk’s Office and
available for inspection and review. An area located in more
than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in
the zone with the more restrictive height limitation. The
various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
A. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum
Greater Than 3/4 Mile Non-Precision Instrument Approach Zone.
The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of
the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The approach zone
extends outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
B. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum
As Low As 3/4 Mile Non-precision Instrument Approach Zone. The
inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone
expands outward uniformly to a width of 4,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
C. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. The inner
edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the
primary surface and is 1,000 feet wide. The approach zone
expands outward uniformly to a width of 16,000 feet at a
horizontal distance of 50,000 feet from the primary surface.
Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the
runway.
D. Transitional Zones. The transitional zones are the
areas beneath the transitional surfaces.
4.2.2018 Addition
E. Horizontal Zone. The horizontal zone is established
by swinging arcs of 10,000 feet for Runway 17 (Precision Runway)
radii from the center of the end of the primary surface of such
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent
to those arcs. The horizontal zone is established by swinging
arcs of 10,000 feet for Runway 35 (Precision Runway) radii from
the center of the end of the primary surface of such runway and
connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those
arcs. The floor of the horizontal surface is 150 feet above the
highest elevation of the runway (1152 feet). The horizontal zone
does include the approach and transitional zones.
F. Conical Zone. The conical zone is established as the
area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and
extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
Section 16-304 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, no structure
shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by this Article to a height
in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for
such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
A. Runway Larger Than Utility With A Visibility Minimum

C. Precision Instrument Runway Approach Zone. Slopes
fifty (50) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the
end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline; thence slopes upward forty (40) feet
horizontally for each foot vertically to an additional
horizontal distance of 40,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline of Runway 17. In addition, slopes fifty (50) feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the
same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the extended runway
centerline; thence slopes upward forty (40) feet horizontally
for each foot vertically to an additional horizontal distance of

foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone
and at 150 feet above the airport elevation and extending to a
height of 350 feet above the airport elevation.
G. Excepted Height Limitations. Nothing in this Article
shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or
maintenance of any structure, or growth of any tree to a height
up to 50 feet above the surface of the land.
4.2.2018 Addition
Section 16-305 USE RESTRICTIONS.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, no
use may be made of land or water within any zone established by
this Article in such a manner as to create electrical
interference with navigational signals or radio communication
between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots
to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in
glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility
in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or
otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing,
takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the
airport.
Section 16-306 NONCONFORMING USES.
A. Regulations Not Retroactive. The regulations
prescribed by this Article shall not be construed to require the
removal, lowering, or other changes or alteration of any
structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the
effective date of this Article, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein
shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or
intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of
which was begun prior to the effective date of this Article, and
is diligently prosecuted.
B. Marking and Lighting. Notwithstanding the preceding
provision of this Section, the Owner of any existing
nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers
and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Airport Manager
to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers
and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the
expense of the City of Perry.
4.2.2018 Addition
SECTION 16-307 PERMITS.
A. Future Uses. Except as specifically provided in
subsections 1, 2, and 3 hereunder, no material change shall be
made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any zone
hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied
for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate
the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient
particularity to permit it to be determined whether the
resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the
regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the
affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article shall be
granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with
Section 16-307.4.
1. In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal
zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree
or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour,
or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend
above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
2. In areas lying within the limits of the approach
zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet
from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any
tree or structure less than seventy-five feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when such tree or structure would
extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach
zones.
3. In the areas lying within the limits of the transition
zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit
shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventyfive
feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such
tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such transition zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall
be construed as permitting or intending to permit any
construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any
tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this
Article except as set forth in Section 16-304.5.
4.2.2018 Addition
B. Existing Uses. No permit shall be granted that would
allow the establishment or creation of any obstruction or permit
a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater
hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of
this Article or any amendments thereto or than it is when the
application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all
applications for such a permit shall be granted.
C. Nonconforming Uses Abandoned or Destroyed. Whenever
the Airport Manager determines that a nonconforming tree or
structure has been abandoned or more than 80 percent torn down,
physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted
that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable
height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
D. Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase
the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree,
or use property, not in accordance with the regulations
prescribed in this Article, may apply to the Board of Adjustment
for the City of Perry (hereinafter “Board of Adjustment”) for a
variance from such regulations. The application for variance
shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal
Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the
operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient
use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed
where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement
of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and
relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest,
will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial
justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this
Article. Additionally, no application for variance to the
requirements of this Article may be considered by the Board of
Adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished
to the Mayor for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the Mayor does not respond to the application
within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the Board of Adjustment
may act on its own to grant or deny said application.
4.2.2018 Addition
E. Obstruction Marking and Lighting. Any permit or
variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to
effectuate the purpose of this Article and be reasonable in the
circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the
structure or tree in question to install, operate, maintain, at
the owner’s expense, such markings and lights as may be
necessary. If deemed proper by the Board of Adjustment, this
condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the
City of Perry, Oklahoma, at its own expense, to install,
operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights.
Section 16-308 ENFORCEMENT.
It shall be the duty of the Airport Manager to administer
and enforce the regulations prescribed herein. Applications for
permits and variances shall be made to the Airport Manager upon
a form published for that purpose. Applications required by
this Article to be submitted to the Airport Manager shall be
promptly considered and granted or denied. Application for
action by the Board of Adjustment shall be forthwith transmitted
by the Airport Manager.

BILLINGS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 17-201 UTILITY FEES AND BILLINGS IN GENERAL.
All fees and charge in connection with any customer's use
of the sanitary sewer system, the water facility system, the
collection and disposal of refuse and garbage, or the electrical
service system are billed in accordance with applicable rates
set by motion or resolution of the authority. All fees and
charges owing for any of these utility services shall be billed
monthly. The utility bills submitted under the terms of this
Section are payable on or before the past due date which is
printed on the bill.
Section 17-202 UTILITY TAPS AND CONNECTIONS; FEES; UTILITY
DEPOSITS.
A. The appropriate city department head shall approve any
request for a water tap and connection, a sewer tap to an
existing line or a sewer tap to a new line and any electrical
service connection. Approvals shall be based on engineering and
legal considerations. An appeal from the denial of an
application request may be taken by filing a written appeal to
the City Council within ten (10) days of the denial. Prior to
granting this approval, the customer shall have paid the deposit
and connection or charge as applicable and set by motion or
resolution. The deposit shall serve as a guarantee for the
payment of charges for utility service and other amounts owed in
connection with the utility service. It shall be held in trust
by the authority. When a customer's utility service is
disconnected, the deposit or any part of such amount deposited
which remains after all such charges and amounts due the city
have been satisfied, shall be returned to the customer, or to
the state if unclaimed by the customer, after notice as required
by law.
4.2.2018 Addition
B. The following deposits shall be collected for the
respective utility services for new customers and for any
customers who have been disconnected prior to the re-initiation
of such utility service:
Residential Effective April 30, 2015
Water Initial $50.00 *
Electric Initial $250.00 *
Commercial or Industrial
Water Initial $100.00**
Electric Initial $300.00**
All customers must show sufficient proof of rights as a tenant
to the rental property (For Example: lease agreement, or signed
letter from landlord) or ownership of the real property (For
Example: deed, or closing documents) as a part and condition of
receiving utility service.
* Notwithstanding the fact that an initial deposit is charged,
for a new residential customer, a reasonable time, normally not
to exceed three (3) months, shall be allowed to determine the
deposit. The deposit should be at least equal to an average
thirty (30) days use of the particular utility service. If this
procedure provides for a greater deposit, after the City
provides written notice of the same to the customer by letter or
door hanger, the additional deposit must be paid within 10
business days in order to continue receiving that particular
utility service. Provided however, if the customer’s place of
business has a prior twelve (12) months utility history, the
City may charge an average thirty (30) days usage as the initial
deposit if such usage is greater than $300.00.
4.2.2018 Addition
** Notwithstanding the fact that an initial deposit is charged,
for a new commercial or industrial customer, a reasonable time,
normally not to exceed three (3) months, shall be allowed to
determine the deposit. The deposit should be at least equal to
an average forty-five (45) days use of the particular utility
service. If this procedure provides for a greater deposit,
after the City provides written notice of the same to the
customer by letter or door hanger, the additional deposit must
be paid within 10 business days in order to continue receiving
that particular utility service. Provided however, if the
customer’s place of business has a prior twelve (12) months

days usage as the initial deposit if such usage is greater than
$400.00.
C. At any time the person having made the deposit, should
desire to discontinue the use of utility services, he shall
notify the city clerk, in writing, and shall accompany his
notice with all arrears, if any. In the case the notice is not
accompanied with the charges, then the city shall deduct from
the deposit the amount of the utility charges against the meter,
and the balance, if any, shall be returned to the person making
the request for discontinuance.
D. All utility customers shall be eligible to have their
utility deposit refunded after a period of five (5) years from
January 1 following the posting of said deposit. A refund may
be made if all payments due and owed the city have been made in
a timely manner. Payment in a timely manner is defined as no
more than one late payment penalty having been assessed during
the calendar year preceding the request for refund.
E. Upon request, the City Clerk will cause an examination
of the payment histories and a determination made of those
customers eligible for a refund of their utility deposits. The
qualifying refunds may then be made. All refunds may be made by
applying the deposit as a credit to a current utility billing or
upon the customer’s request, by a refund check.
F. Whenever the utility termination procedures as set out
in Sections 17-208 through 17-210 have been fully complied with
by the City and a customer’s utility bill remains delinquent,
the City Manager or designee shall direct a city employee, by
appropriate work order, to disconnect the utility service(s).
Whenever a work order is issued to disconnect any utility
service(s), a customer service charge of Twenty Dollars ($20.00)

(for reconnections occurring during normal business hours,
Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m.), plus payment in
full of the past bill and penalties, shall be charged and
collected prior to reconnection of any utility service(s), and
without regard to whether the utility service(s) was actually
disconnected. In addition, if the respective utility deposit is
less than $300.00 for residential service or a minimum of
$400.00 for commercial and industrial service, the delinquent
utility customer’s utility deposit shall be increased to $300.00
or $400.00, respectively, prior to the restoration of service.
For each cut-off thereafter, the utility customer shall be
required to post an additional $50.00 deposit prior to the
restoration of service. Provided however, any residential
customer who has had continuous service with the City for at
least five (5) years, and has received no more than one (1)
assessed late payment penalty in the past three (3) years, shall
receive one (1) waiver from the requirement to increase the
deposit.
G. Notwithstanding any other provision in this municipal
code, all utility customer payments received by the City, and
made pursuant to a unified city billing statement, shall be
credited the customer’s account in the following order, and

The monthly charges to any premises for utility services
shall be billed monthly on a single bill or statement to each
owner or occupant liable therefor; provide however, that such

rendered, who shall be deemed the agent of the owner of the
premises for the purpose of notice, specifying the amount due,
with penalties and/or setting out specifically the enumerated
reason for termination of utility service, and advising of the
utility department's intention to terminate service on a given

service will create a condition on the utility customer’s
premise that is dangerous to persons or property.
9. Refusal to grant access at reasonable times for the
purpose of installation, inspection, maintenance, replacement,
or reading of City equipment installed upon the premises of the
utility consumer, or obstructed city easement of right-of-way,

premises.
10. Potential adverse effect of the service required by
the consumer on the service of other utility customers of the
City, provided the utility customer has been notified and given

if:
1. No hearing before a trust officer or employee has been
requested; or
2. After such hearing such charges are found to be
properly imposed and/or the enumerated reasons found to have
occurred;
then the utility service may be terminated.
4.2.2018 Addition
C. In the event that a tenant terminates its tenancy and
the City does not receive the delinquent utility amount owed,
prior to the re-establishment of service to a new tenant at such
same residence or business, both the new tenant and the landlord
shall establish utility service with the City, with both the new

and known as a "rural user".
4.2.2018 Addition
Section 17-212 RURAL UTILITY USERS.
A. Rural water service will be granted only after a
request has been made in writing to the city. The Water
Superintendent shall consider, and if appropriate, approve the
request. The approval shall be based on engineering
considerations such as the availability of potable water at
adequate pressure and legal considerations, if appropriate. An
appeal from the denial of an application request may be taken by
filing a written appeal to the City Council within ten (10) days
of the denial. Water extensions outside of the city limits of

A. When an application for utility services has been
approved, the city shall cause to be installed a meter or tap as
appropriate and connect the same with the authority for utility
service. The city, at all times, shall have the right to enter
upon the premises for the purpose of inspecting, maintaining,
(including tree-trimming), reading of meters, and for the
purpose of repair or adjustments of meters, lines and wires of
the authority. The application and the installation of a meter
or tap on the premises shall constitute a contract and agreement
between the city and the persons making the application to pay
for utility services applied for at the rate and manner
specified by the city. The city does specifically reserve the
right to charge and collect the rate and enforce the penalties
in the manner herein provided, to change the rates at any time
by ordinance or resolution, to temporarily discontinue the
service at any time, without notice to the customer when
necessary for repairs or some other emergency at the discretion
of the city. Unreasonable impediments to the reading of any
utility meter shall constitute sufficient grounds for
discontinuation of service (following proper notice) until the
impediment has been removed by the customer or his agent to the
satisfaction of the city.
B. The city will use reasonable diligence to supply
steady and continued service at the point of delivery but will
not be liable to the customer for any damages occasioned by
irregularities or interruptions. The city may, without further
notice, discontinue service to any customer when a defective
condition of wiring or equipment upon the premises of the
customer results, or is likely to result, in danger to life or
property, or interfere with proper service. In order to make
repairs or changes in the city's facilities for supplying
utility service, or some other emergency, the city reserves the
right without incurring any liability therefore to suspend
service without notice to the customer for such periods as may
be reasonably necessary.
4.2.2018 Addition
Section 17-214 CUSTOMER REGULATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
A. The customer will not sell the utility service
purchased from the city to any other person unless the rate
schedule under which he is served provides for such a resale.
The customer will not be permitted to extend or connect the
installation of lines across or under a street, alley or other
public space in order to obtain service for adjacent property
through one meter or tap unless such adjacent property is a part
of the same business, actually continuous except for intervening
public space.
B. The customer will be responsible for all damage to, or
loss of, the city's property located upon his premises, unless
occasioned by causes beyond his control, and shall not permit
anyone who is not an agent of the city to remove or tamper with
the city's property.
C. As costs for handling and processing, Fifty Dollars
($50.00) shall be charged any person making a payment to the
City with a credit card, debit card, ACH (Automated Clearing
House) or other negotiable instrument or method or means of
payment absolutely upon an account containing funds insufficient
to pay the charge.
Section 17-215 COLLECTION FEE

of the unpaid debt or account shall be added to the amount of
the unpaid debt or account and assessed and collected.
4.2.2018 Addition
Section 17-216 AVERAGE BILLING PROGRAM
There is hereby created the Average Billing Program for the
City of Perry, Oklahoma (hereinafter the "Program"). The Program
provides for the establishment of a revolving average monthly
utility payment plan which is calculated using the current bill
and outstanding balance added to the previous 11 months bill
(recalculation shall occur at least every four (4) months or
whenever the account balance is 1 times over or under the
current calculated average monthly utility payment plan). In
order to participate in the Program, the customer must:
1. Be a utility customer of the City for at least one
year at the same address prior to the date of signing up for the
Program and on that date have a zero utility balance;
2. Have had no late fees assessed and/or returned checks
or drafts for at least one (1) year prior to the date of signing
up for the Program.
3. Must remain enrolled in the Program for at least one
year from the date of signing up for the Program; and
4. Enroll in the Program during the months of October
through December of each successive year (Enrollment in the
Program will not be permitted at any other time during the year
for new enrollees).
Under the terms of the Program, if any single payment is
late or if a payment is not made, the account will be subject to
automatic removal from the Program, the account balance becomes
due in full, and the account may become subject to cut-off for
non-payment.
A customer must stay enrolled in the Program for at least
one (1) year; thereafter, a customer may elect to be removed
from the Program at any time. Whenever any customer properly
elects to be removed from the Program, such customer's current
account balance will be paid in full immediately. Whenever
termination of service at any address occurs, such account
balance must be paid in full immediately prior to the initiation
of the Program at the customer's new address. Except when a
customer changes their Program address and fully complies with
the aforementioned provisions, new customers seeking to enroll
in the Program may only apply from October 1 through December 31
of each successive year (hereinafter "enrollment period").
4.2.2018 Addition
If the Program is canceled by the City with respect to any
customer or the customer properly withdraws from the Plan, the
customer will not be eligible to enter into the Program for at
least one full calendar year and thereafter only during the
enrollment period. If the customer's account has a credit
balance, this balance cannot be used for payment unless the
customer withdraws from the Plan.
At times it may be impossible or impracticable to
accurately determine the average monthly billing for accounts;
sizable adjustments may be necessary to be made based on actual
or historical usage. In addition, the City Manager is authorized
to make adjustments to the implementation of this policy which
are reasonable and/or in the best interest of fairness and
responsible utility practices.
Section 17-217 DISTRIBUTED GENERATION RULES AND REGULATIONS
A. IN GENERAL. This section provides for the rules and
regulations concerning customer-owned, grid-connected nonutility

employees and customers.
2. All customers shall ensure that any back feed of
electricity into the City’s system is safe and
constructed and/or operated in accordance with all state
and local electrical codes and the City has the right to
inspect the customer’s system to ensure such connection
standard.
