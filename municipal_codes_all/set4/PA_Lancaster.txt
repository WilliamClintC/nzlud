The provisions of this Code, insofar as they are substantively the same as

The adoption of this Code and the repeal of ordinances provided for in

and obligations, which are hereby expressly saved from repeal; provided,
however, that the repeal of ordinances pursuant to § 1-3 or the saving from

revive any ordinance previously repealed, superseded or no longer of any
effect:

benefit the former active police officer would have received had he/she
lived until that date when he/she would have attained 25 years of

benefit equal to the monthly benefit the pensioner was collecting as of

beginning on the date which is one year prior to separation from service

pension benefit shall be paid to the legal guardian of or for the benefit
of the member's surviving children who are under the age of 18 in equal
shares, which payments shall continue until the youngest such child
attains the age of 18, which benefits shall be equal to the benefits the
surviving spouse would have received under this § 64-10 had he/she
been eligible for benefits.

§ 64-11. Military buy-back time.
An active police officer may purchase, through payroll deduction, all or

years of service requirement under this article upon such active police
officer's contribution to the Fund the amount required in accordance with
Subsection B. Military buy-back time may only be used after completing 20
years of service. An active police officer may purchase back no more than

later dies or remarries, a monthly pension benefit shall be paid to the
legal guardian of or for the benefit of the former active police officer's
surviving children who are under the age of 18 in equal shares, which
payments shall continue until the youngest such child attains the age
of 18, which benefits shall be equal to the benefits the surviving spouse
would have received under this § 64-10 had he/she been eligible for
benefits and not died or remarried.
H. If a member dies and leaves no survivors who are eligible for pension
benefits, the deceased member's estate shall receive from the Bureau,

member has actually received from the Fund.

the pension list of this Bureau, dies other than in the line of duty as an
active police officer, the Bureau shall pay to his/her heirs or appointees,
the sum of $1,000, provided such active police officer shall have
completed 25 years of service at the time of his/her death. If, at the time
of death, the deceased active police officer shall have completed less
than 25 years of service, the amount to be paid to such heirs or
appointees will be an amount determined by multiplying $1,000 by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of his/her years of
service and the denominator of which shall be 25. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the sum payable to such heirs or appointees
be less than $150, or the amount contributed by such active police
officer to the Fund during his employment with the Bureau of Police,
whichever is greater.
J. Except as otherwise provided in Subsections E through K of this
§ 64-10, neither unmarried members nor their families, heirs, or estates
shall receive benefits under this section.

officers as of January 1, 2003. The survivor benefit received by the
spouse or children of any former active police officer or pensioner as of
January 1, 2003, will be determined pursuant to the provisions of the
prior § 64-7 that was in effect as of the date of his/her retirement.

§ 64-12. Applications and determinations.
A. Military buy-back time may be repurchased under this section only if

forms.)
B. The purchase price of military buy-back time shall be equal to the
product of 10% of a Lieutenant's salary times each year of military buyback
time, or portion thereof rounded to the lowest whole month, being
purchased, plus interest at the rate of 6% per annum, compounded
annually, from each year of military service to the date of payroll
deduction for its purchase from the Bureau;
C. Payment of such purchase price shall be made through payroll
deductions until fully repaid (subject to the right of the active police
officer to prepay at any time without prepaying interest);
D. The active police officer must purchase the most recent years of
military service first if the active police officer is buying back only a

25 Years of Service may elect to participate in the DROP,
continue employment with the City, and defer receipt of the
retirement benefit under the Fund by filing a written
application with the City.
(b) In addition to filing a written application electing to participate
in the DROP, an eligible Active Fire Fighter must do the
following:
[1] Execute an irrevocable written election to participate in
the DROP that states the date on which the Member's
participation in the DROP will terminate [provided that
such termination date must comply with § 64-26F(2)(b)]
and that includes the following acknowledgments:
[a] That, as of the date on which participation in the
DROP commences, the Member's pension calculation
§ 64-26 ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS § 64-26
59:137
under the other terms of the Fund will freeze and no
service rendered nor compensation received during
the period of participation in the DROP will be
considered for pension benefit calculation purposes
under the other provisions of the Fund;
[b] As of the date on which the Member's participation in
the DROP commences, the Member will continue to
make pension contributions to the Fund as provided in
§ 64-23A at the then-prevailing wage rate;
[c] Participation in the DROP will in no way limit or
diminish the City's right to terminate or suspend a
Member for misconduct.
[2] Complete all other retirement documents requested by the
City, Bureau or any other governing body.
(c) A Member who chooses to terminate DROP participation prior
to the DROP participation termination date given at the time of
the DROP election, as provided in § 64-26F(1)(b)[i], shall
provide the City with a minimum of 90 days written notice
prior to the amended DROP participation termination date
[provided that such amended termination date must comply
with § 64-26F(2)(b)]. Failure to provide the City with written
notice 90 days prior to the amended DROP participation
termination date will result in the Member's DROP election
being permanently revoked. In that event, the pension at
retirement is calculated as if DROP had never been elected. If
extenuating circumstances exist, the City maintains the
discretion to waive this requirement. In all cases, the final
decision of whether or not to waive this requirement rests with
the City.
(2) Benefit under DROP.
(a) A Member's participation in the DROP shall commence on the
first day of the month following the City's receipt of the

participation in the DROP shall be fixed.

less than three years after commencement of participation, but
no more than five years after commencement of participation.

(c) The Member's frozen retirement benefit shall be calculated as
provided in §§ 64-26A and 64-27 as of his/her effective date of
participation in the DROP.
(d) The Member's participation in the DROP does not guarantee
his/her employment with the City during the participation
period specified in his/her election.
(3) DROP account.
(a) During the first three years of participation in the DROP, the
Member's frozen monthly retirement benefit plus the
Member's contributions under § 64-23A shall be credited to
his/her DROP account on the last day of each month.
Additionally, interest shall be credited to a Member's DROP
account on the last day of each month at the rate of 5.0% per
annum, provided that the balance of the Member's account on
the first day of such month shall be used when determining the
interest to be credited to the Member's account.
(b) During each month of participation in the DROP after the first
three years of participation, a Member's DROP account shall
only be credited with the Member's contributions under
§ 64-23A on the last day of such month and shall no longer be
credited with the Member's frozen monthly retirement benefit.
Additionally, a Member's DROP account shall be increased or
decreased each month by the amount determined by

(a) A Member's participation in the DROP shall terminate on the
date on which the Member elects to terminate participation in
the DROP pursuant to § 64-26F(1)(b)[1] [provided that such
termination date must comply with § 64-26F(2)(b)].
(b) Upon termination of participation in the DROP:

Active Fire Fighter terminates prior to the third anniversary of
his/her participation date in the DROP (except for attainment
of age 60), the DROP election is permanently revoked and the

Fund is calculated as if the Member had never elected to
participate in the DROP.

DROP, the balance of the Member's DROP account will be
distributed in a lump sum to the Member's designated beneficiary,
or if no beneficiary exists, to the Member's estate. Such lump sum
shall be in addition to the death benefits determined in accordance
with § 64-32 based upon the frozen retirement benefit determined
under § 64-26F(2)(c).

prevention and education, recognizing that major crime is encouraged
when neighborhoods are allowed to deteriorate. The approach will balance
reactive responses to calls for services with proactive problem-solving
centered on the causes of crime and disorder. Community policing will
encourage positive relationships, shared responsibilities and mutual trust
and respect between officers and the community that they serve. In support
thereof, the Bureau on an ongoing basis will do the following:
§ 67-14. Applicability.
The foregoing shall apply to the entire Lancaster Bureau of Police.
A. The Chief of Police will divide the City into sectors for the purpose of
establishing areas of service for the Officers;
B. Officers shall patrol those sectors to which they are assigned in
manners that result in high visibility and interaction with residents.
Such patrolling should employ bicycles and foot patrols as is
practicable;
C. Officers assigned to sectors shall be involved in developing a plan for
policing their sector, which shall be reviewed and updated by their
Sergeant who shall approve and monitor its implementation;
D. Officers assigned to sectors shall be involved in and with those
community-based organizations which represent or are composed of
residents in that sector;
E. Officers shall receive training in the community policing approach;
F. A priority of the Bureau, pursuant to the community policing approach,
shall be to provide courteous and professional police services and
responses at every level; and
G. The Chief of Police shall report to Council, on a quarterly basis, the
implementation of the community policing approach.
57.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Art. III, Neighborhood Policing
Program, adopted 12-22-1998 by Ord. No. 15-1998.

§ 84-1. Intent and purpose.
The Council, finding that there has been a proliferation of installation and
use of commercial and residential automatic burglar and robbery alarm
systems within the city and a substantial increase in the number of false
alarms being reported from these systems which have required police
response and that the unregulated use of such alarm systems poses a
substantial threat to the orderly and effective provision of emergency
services by the Bureau of Police, hereby declares it to be necessary to
provide for the greater control and more effective regulations of alarm
systems, alarm businesses and users.
§ 84-2. Short title.

where a colony is kept less than 25 feet from a property line of the
lot upon which the apiary is located, as measured from the nearest
point on the hive to the property line, and any entrances to the hive
face that lot line, the beekeeper shall maintain a flyway barrier at
least six feet in height between the hive entrance and the property
it faces. The flyway barrier may consist of a wall, fence, dense
vegetation or a combination thereof, such that bees will fly over
rather than through the material to reach the colony. If a flyway
barrier of dense vegetation is used, the initial planting may be four
feet in height, so long as the vegetation normally reaches six feet in
height or higher. The flyway barrier must continue parallel to the
apiary lot line for two feet in either direction from the hive, or
contain the hive or hives in an enclosure at least six feet in height.
A flyway barrier is not required if the property adjoining the apiary
lot line 1) is undeveloped, or 2) is zoned agricultural, industrial or is
outside the City limits, or 3) is a wildlife management area or
naturalistic park land with no horse or foot trails located within 25
feet of the apiary lot line.

revoking a license or suspending a license. The Board of Health may,
upon recommendation of the Health Officer, refuse to grant or renew a
license, and/or suspend or revoke a license of any applicant or licensee.
All decisions of the Board of Health in support of any action or
recommendation of the Health Officer shall be based upon one or more
of the following reasons:

Floodplain Areas
§ 109-3. Identification; description; base flood elevation; change in
identification; boundary disputes.
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of the City of
Lancaster, classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) dated April 19, 2005, and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the most recent revision
thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the Flood
Insurance Study. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any
subsequent revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted by the City
of Lancaster and declared to be a part of this Part 2.
B. Description; special requirements of identified floodplain areas. The
identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
(1) Floodway area.
(a) Description: the area identified as floodway in the FIS which
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point. This term shall
also include floodway areas which have been identified in other
available studies or sources of information for those special
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the
FIS.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] Any encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Regional
Office.
(2) Special flood hazard area (one-hundred-year floodplain).
(a) Description: the areas identified as Zone AE in the FIS which
are subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance
65.Editors Note: Additional Floodplain And Flood Area Provisions And/Or Requirements Of
The City Can Be Found In Ch. 260, Stormwater Management; Ch. 265, Subdivision And
Land Development; And Ch. 300, Zoning.
§ 109-3 BRUSH, GRASS AND WEEDS § 109-3
105:227
flood event determined by detailed methods and have base
flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
(b) Special requirements. No new residential construction or
development, including accessory structures, shall be
permitted within Zone AE. Nonresidential construction or
development may be permitted in Zone AE, provided that there
shall be no increase in flood heights.
(c) In special hazard areas without a designated floodway, no new
development shall be permitted unless it can be demonstrated
that the cumulative effect of all past and projected
development will not increase the BFE.
(3) Approximate flood hazard area (one-hundred-year floodplain).
(a) Description: the areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by the one-percent-annual-chance flood
event determined using approximate methodologies. Because
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no BFEs
or flood depths are shown.
(b) Special requirements. Nonresidential construction or
development may be permitted in Zone A, provided that there
shall be no increase in flood heights. In the absence of a
detailed flood study, new development shall be located a
minimum of 50 feet from the top of bank of any tributary,
swale, drainage channel or other watercourse within Zone A.
(4) Special flood hazard area X.
(a) Description: the areas identified as Zone X in the FIS which are
subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance flooding
where average depths are less than one foot; however, Zone X
also contains tributaries, swales, and drainage channels with
flood elevations exceeding three feet. In the absence of a
detailed flood study or other information acceptable to the City,
new development shall be located a minimum of 30 feet from
the top of bank of any tributary, swale, drainage channel or
other watercourse.
(b) Special requirements. The property owner must establish
drainage paths to guide floodwaters around and away from
structures and elevate structures to avoid flooding.
C. Base flood elevation determination.
(1) When available, information from other federal, state, and other
acceptable sources shall be used to determine the BFE, as well as a
floodway area, if possible. When no other information is available,
the BFE shall be determined by using a point on the boundary of
§ 109-3 LANCASTER CODE § 109-3
105:228
the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site
in question.
(2) In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to
determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City of Lancaster.
D. Changes in identification of area. The identified floodplain area may be
revised or modified by FEMA where studies or information provided by
a qualified agency or person documents the need for such revision. Any
such technical or scientific data regarding changes in the base flood
elevation shall be submitted by the City floodplain administrator to
FEMA within six months of receipt so that insurance and floodplain
management can be based on current data.
E. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified
floodplain boundary arise, an initial determination shall be made by the
floodplain administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision or
determination may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant.

ARTICLE IV
Administrative Provisions
§ 109-16. Variances.
A. If compliance with the elevation or floodproofing requirements stated
above would result in an exceptional hardship for a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City Building Code Board of Appeals
(hereafter known as the "Board") may, upon request, grant relief from
the strict application of the requirements. Requests for relief to the
strict application of the provisions of this Part 2 and its subsections may
be granted by the Board having jurisdiction as noted above and in
accordance with the following procedures and criteria:
(1) No variances shall be granted for any construction, development,
use or activity within any AE-designated floodplain area that would,
together with all other existing and anticipated development, allow
any rise in the BFE.
(2) Except for a possible modification of the regulatory flood elevation
requirement involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the
other requirements pertaining specifically to development
regulated by floodplain permit (or prohibited activities) or to
development which may endanger human life.
(3) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief, and in no case shall a variance permit
less than 1 1/2 feet of freeboard elevation for any proposed
manufactured home, nursing home, hospital, jail, prison or
structure used for the storage or production of materials or
substances considered dangerous to human life, plant life, animal
life or infrastructure.
(4) In granting any relief, the Board may attach whatever reasonable
conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to
protect the public health, safety and welfare and to achieve the
objectives of this Code.
(5) Whenever relief is granted, the Board shall notify the applicant in
writing that:
(a) The granting of the variance request may result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance; and
(b) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
B. In reviewing any request for relief, the Board of Appeals shall consider,
but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Whether there is good and sufficient cause to grant the variance;

administrator. Time extensions shall be granted only if a written
request is submitted by the applicant, which sets forth sufficient and
reasonable cause for the floodplain administrator to approve such a
request. The "actual start of construction" means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as
the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction
of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing,
grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or

substantial damage or repetitive loss (when a repetitive loss provision is
used), regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include either any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions or historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined in this Part 2 must
comply with all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's
continued designation as an historic structure. Documentation that a
specific ordinance requirement will cause removal of the structure from the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places
must be obtained from the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic
Preservation Officer. Any exemption from ordinance requirements will be
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the

public through reduction of juvenile violence and crime within the City of

DISCRIMINATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Housing  See Ch. 169.
§ 125-1. Findings and declaration of policy.
A. Findings.
(1) The population of the City consists of people representing a broad
spectrum of races, creeds and ethnic groups. The practice or policy
of discrimination against individuals or groups by reason of their
race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, sex, familial
status, sexual orientation, marital status, possession of a General
Education Development Certificate (GED), handicap or disability or
use of a support animal because of the handicap or disability of the
user or because the user is a handler or trainer of support or guide
animals is a matter of concern to the City. Such discrimination
encourages domestic strife and social unrest, while threatening the
rights and privileges of all the inhabitants of the City. [Amended
11-27-2001 by Ord. No. 10-2001]
(2) Employment discrimination deprives persons of earnings necessary
to maintain decent standards of living, tends to impair the City's
productive capacity, reduces public revenues and contributes to
group tensions and conflicts. Housing discrimination results in
overcrowded, segregated areas which tends to promote
substandard, unsafe and unsanitary living conditions. These
adverse conditions foster crime, vice, juvenile delinquency and
similar evils which are all detrimental to the welfare of the City.
[Amended 11-27-2001 by Ord. No. 10-2001]
(3) Discrimination in educational institutions precludes equal
opportunities. Lack of equal education opportunity impedes the
students' abilities to compete for gainful employment when the
educational phase is completed.
(4) Discrimination in places of public accommodation causes
humiliation, embarrassment and is an inconvenience to citizens
and visitors alike.
B. Declaration of policy. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City to
promote the right and opportunity of all persons to participate in the
§ 121-13 CURFEW § 125-1
121:293
§ 125-2. Scope and application. [Amended 11-27-2001 by Ord. No.
10-2001]
This chapter applies to discriminatory practices, including but not limited to
discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations
and lending, which occur within the corporate limits of the City.
§ 125-3. Right to freedom from discrimination. [Amended
11-27-2001 by Ord. No. 10-2001]
The opportunity for an individual to secure employment for which he is
qualified, to obtain an equal education opportunity and to obtain all the
accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of any place of public
accommodation without discrimination and of housing accommodation and
commercial property without discrimination and to obtain credit without
discrimination because of race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin,
age, sex, familial status, sexual orientation, marital status, possession of a
GED, handicap or disability or the use of a support animal or because the
user is a handler or trainer of support or guide animals is hereby recognized

the distinctive historic character of the building or structure or the
area where the change is to occur; or

proposed activity as set forth and described in the application.
E. Withholding recommendation of denial. In the event that the HARB

historical character of the Historic District. The HARB shall withhold its
written recommendation to the City Council if the applicant agrees at
the conclusion of the meeting or meetings to appear before the HARB
at its next regularly scheduled meeting with a revised application for
its consideration.
A. Deliberations of City Council. Following the HARB's provision of its
recommendation concerning issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness as set forth in § 155-9D, the City Council may consider
the written recommendation of the HARB, any additional presentation
by representatives of the HARB, and the presentation of evidence by
the applicant at a regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council. In its
discretion, the City Council may refer the matter to such City Council
committee or committees as it deems appropriate either before or after
its first consideration of the application at a Council meeting. The
committee or committees to which the matter is referred shall consider
the recommendation of the HARB, any additional presentations by the
HARB, and evidence by the applicant at a public meeting of the
committee. The committee shall make a report to the full City Council at

following the Council's first consideration of the application at a

appropriateness for work covered by applications reviewed by the

of the proposed construction, alteration, repair, restoration or
demolition of all or part of any building or structure within the Historic
District, the Council shall consider the same factors as the HARB, as set
forth in § 155-9C as well as the written recommendation of the HARB.
The Council shall either:
(1) Issue a certificate of appropriateness authorizing a building permit
for the proposed regulated activity;
(2) Issue a certificate of appropriateness subject to specified changes
and conditions not included in the application as submitted, but
which would protect the distinctive historic character of the
building, structure or area which is proposed to be changed; or
(3) Issue a written denial to the applicant, with a copy to the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, setting forth the
reasons for the disapproval. The City Council shall also indicate
what changes in the applicant's plans and specifications would

meet its conditions for protecting the distinctive historical

City Council, the City shall send written notification to the applicant of
the decision of the City Council. Failure of the City to so act within said
period shall be deemed to constitute a decision in favor of the applicant,
and a certificate of appropriateness shall thereupon be issued. In the
event that approval is granted subject to conditions, the applicant may,
within 15 days after receiving a written copy of the decision, give
written notice of his, her or its refusal to accept all of the conditions, in
which case the City Council shall be deemed to have denied a certificate
of appropriateness. In the event the applicant does not, within said
period, notify the City in writing of his or her or its refusal to accept all
of the conditions, the approval, with all conditions, shall stand as
granted.
D. Legal Status of City Council's decision. Any building permit, sign permit
or demolition permit issued pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
shall be subject to any conditions made part of the certificate of
appropriateness issued by the City Council. Failure of the applicant to
meet all conditions shall subject him or her or it to revocation of the

C. The application for a certificate of appropriateness for any regulated
activity shall be filed with the Building Official by the owner, equitable
owner or authorized agent. The application shall be accompanied by
information required in § 155-27A, Demolition, Subsection A(2) and/or

applicant, if necessary, and prepare a written report for the Historical
Commission evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed regulated
activity. A copy of the written report shall be provided to the applicant
prior to the Historical Commission meeting. [Amended 2-22-2005 by

§ 155-23 LANCASTER CODE § 155-25
146:398

of the Historical Commission shall be rendered within 75 days of the
meeting at which the application is first considered, unless the
applicant agrees, in writing, to grant the Commission additional time

the Historical Commission meeting when the application will be
considered. The applicant shall post the property where the regulated
activity is to occur with the placard provided by the City at least 10 days
prior to the Historical Commission meeting. Failure on the part of the
applicant to post the placard in a location easily seen by the public shall
be grounds for postponing consideration of the application. Continuing
failure on the part of the applicant to post the property shall be grounds
for recommending against approval of the application within the
Commissions seventy-five-day review period, which shall begin to run
on the meeting date set forth on the placard. In addition, the City shall
provide the Lancaster Newspapers, Inc., with the agenda of each
Historical Commission meeting for publication prior to the Historical

meetings provided for in Subsection A, shall submit to City Council, in
writing, its recommendation concerning the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness. A copy of the recommendation and the time and place
of the Council meeting shall be sent to the applicant at the time the
recommendation is forwarded to City Council. The Commission shall
recommend one of the following:
(1) The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness authorizing the
issuance of a building permit for the proposed regulated activity.
(2) The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness subject to specified
changes and conditions not included in the application as
submitted, but which, in the opinion of the Historical Commission,
would protect the distinctive historic character of the building,
structure or area which is proposed to be changed.
(3) The denial of the application for a certificate of appropriateness
with respect to the proposed regulated activity.
D. Acceptance of conditions. In the event that the recommendation for a
certificate of appropriateness is subject to conditions and the applicant

§ 155-26. Proceedings of City Council. [Amended 2-22-2005 by Ord.
No. 4-2005]
indicates his or her or its refusal to accept all conditions, the Historical
Commission shall be deemed to have recommended against the
issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. If the applicant accepts
all of the said conditions, the recommendation of conditional approval
shall stand as stated in the recommendation.
E. Withholding recommendation of denial. In the event that the Historical
Commission recommends against the issuance of a certificate of
appropriateness, the Historical Commission shall withhold its written
recommendation to City Council if the applicant agrees to appear
before the Historical Commission at its next regularly scheduled
meeting with a revised application for its consideration. The applicant
shall also submit a written extension of the seventy-five-day review
period.
A. Deliberations of City Council. The Historic Preservation Specialist shall
submit the Historical Commissions written recommendation,
referencing the appropriate standards of the Secretary of the Interior
with which the proposed regulated activity complies, to the City Council
for consideration. City Council may consider the report of the Historical
Commission, any additional presentation by representatives of the
Historical Commission, and the presentation of evidence by the
applicant at a regularly scheduled meeting. In its discretion, City
Council may refer the matter to such City Council committee or
committees as it deems appropriate either before or after its first
consideration of the application at a Council meeting. The committee or
committees to which the matter is referred shall consider the
recommendation of the Historical Commission, any additional
presentations by the Historical Commission, and evidence by the
applicant at a public meeting of the committee. The committee shall
make a report or recommendation to the full City Council at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. City Council may schedule a presentation
of committee reports or recommendations, the presentation of
testimony or documents from all interested parties and, if deemed
necessary, from the public, at such meeting or meetings as it shall
consider appropriate.
B. Decision of City Council. City Council shall, within 60 days following the
Councils first consideration of the application at a Council meeting,
either:
(1) Issue a certificate of appropriateness authorizing a building permit
for the proposed regulated activity.
(2) Issue a certificate of appropriateness subject to specified changes
and conditions not included in the application as submitted, but
which would protect the distinctive historic character of the
building, structure or area which is proposed to be changed.

146:400
§ 155-27. Activities requiring certificates of appropriateness.
(3) Issue a written denial to the applicant, with a copy to the
Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, setting forth the
reasons for the denial.
C. Notification to applicant. Within 30 days following the decision of City
Council, the City shall send written notification to the applicant of the
decision of City Council. Failure of the City to so act within the said
period shall be deemed to constitute a decision in favor of the applicant
and a certificate of appropriateness shall thereupon be issued. In the
event that approval is granted subject to conditions, the applicant may,
within 15 days after receiving a written copy of the decision, give
written notice of his, her or its refusal to accept all of the conditions, in
which case City Council shall be deemed to have denied a certificate of
appropriateness. In the event the applicant does not, within the said
period, notify City Council in writing of his or her or its refusal to accept
all of the conditions, the approval, with all conditions, shall stand as
granted.
D. Legal status of City Councils decision. Any building permit issued
pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness shall be subject to any
conditions made part of the certificate of appropriateness issued by City
Council. Failure of the applicant to meet all conditions shall subject him
or her or it to revocation of the building permit and to all sanctions and
penalties as provided for in § 155-30, Notice of violation; violations and
penalties, of this article.

primary residence, and who has an elevated blood lead level
exceeding the current Center for Disease Control blood lead
§ 182-13 LANCASTER CODE § 182-13
177:450
level of concern, currently defined as five micrograms per
deciliter of whole blood or higher as determined by recent
medical testing, a tenant:

lead safe as determined by this chapter. Once a dwelling or
dwelling unit has been certified as lead safe, the tenant
will be responsible for paying the balance of the rent for
the month in which the property is found to be lead safe,
and all future rent. If the owner is otherwise in compliance
with this chapter as determined by the City of Lancaster,
and there is a delay in attaining the lead-safe certification
caused by licensed lead abatement company availability,
the tenant shall be responsible for resuming all other rent
payments after the first month that rent was abated.

the owner or its designated responsible agent within 30
days of receiving notice of a child's elevated blood level,

deposit refunded at the time he/she vacates the property.
The tenant must vacate the property no later than one
month following notification of the child's elevated blood
level test.
[3] Tenants are required to cooperate with the owner, all City
departments, and all other contractors associated with the
owner's actions to obtain the lead safe certification. An
owner may seek to collect any rent that is abated by the
tenant based on the tenant noncooperation.
Noncooperation shall include failure to be present for
inspections and repairs when notified, and without good
cause and failure to permit City inspectors and health
officials into a unit for inspections.
(b) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the tenant from
exercising any other rights he/she may have under law.
(7) Retaliatory eviction. [Added 11-14-2017 by Ord. No. 14-2017]
(a) The owner of an affected property covered by this chapter may
not illegally evict or take any other retaliatory action against a
tenant as a result of the tenant providing information to the
owner, or the owner's responsible agent, or the City in
accordance with this chapter; i.e., complaining about
hazardous lead paint conditions or chipping, peeling, or flaking
paint in a targeted property. Prohibited retaliatory actions

entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs, as allowed
under Pennsylvania law. This subsection does not affect the
owner's or the tenant's rights arising from a material breach of
a lease.

City from instituting appropriate action by injunction or any other legal
remedy to prevent or correct any violation of this chapter and collecting

retains the right to enforce these remedies irrespective of any other
ordinance or code enforcement efforts.

identified in Chapter 36, Municipal Claims, including attorney's fees.
A. The City, through its agents or employees, is authorized to make
inspections upon display of proper identification to determine
compliance with this chapter.

177:452
§ 182-17. Liability of City.

violation notice has been abated does not subject the City to any claims for
liability if the issuance of the statement was made in good faith.

the sales disclosure statement to the City.
C. If the dwelling is an investment property, and a child with an elevated
blood lead level has been identified in a dwelling unit in the investment
property prior to the sale, the new owner will be required to complete
the remediation and submit to the City a clearance examination and a
lead safe certification by a Lead-Based Paint Risk Assessor that the
dwelling unit is lead (paint) safe or lead (paint) free.

agent of the City regarding lead-based paint shall have the right to file

Furthermore, the Board may require the party bringing the appeal to
pay any costs associated with hearing the appeal, including, but not
limited to, attorney's fees in excess of the appeal fee, regardless of
other expenses incurred, whether or not the Board partially or fully
upholds the City's issuance of the appealed decision.
C. Any party aggrieved by a decision of the Board may appeal to the Court
of Common Pleas of Lancaster County as provided by law, within 30
days of receiving the Board's decision.

or operates any sound source which does not comply with the
provisions or standards of this chapter.
(2) Application. The application shall state the standard, provision or
section from which the variance is being sought and the period of
time and reasons for which the variance is sought. It shall contain
information which demonstrates that bringing the sources of sound
or activity for which the variance is sought into compliance with
this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on the
applicant, and it shall contain any other supporting information
which may reasonably be required.
(3) Public notification. Public notice of an application and the date,
time and place of the public hearing to be held thereon for a
variance shall be given by publishing notice thereof in a newspaper
of general circulation in the City at least once, not less than three
days prior to the scheduled public hearing, and by, if practicable,
conspicuously posting the premises that is the source of the sound
for which the variance is sought.
(4) Hearing. The Board shall hold a public hearing to decide variance
applications presented to it. Any person who claims to be affected
by allowance of the variance may become a party to the hearing.
(5) Review standards. In determining whether to grant or deny the
application, the Board shall balance the hardship to the applicant
versus the adverse impact to the public health, safety and welfare
and shall consider at a minimum the following conditions:
(a) The physical characteristics of the emitted sound;
(b) The times and duration of the emitted sound;
(c) The geography, zone and population density of the affected
area;
(d) Whether the public health and safety is endangered;
(e) Whether the sound source predates the receivers; and
§ 198-6 LANCASTER CODE § 198-7
194:490
(f) Whether compliance with the standards from which the
variance is sought would produce hardship without equal or
greater benefit to the public.
(6) Decision. The Board shall render a written decision in granting or
denying the application for variance and, if denied, shall state the
reasons therefor. The Board's decision shall be made available to
the applicant and any other person who requests it in writing. In
granting a variance, the Board may attach reasonable conditions,
including but not limited to placing a time limit on the permitted
activity and/or establishing a time schedule within which the
source of sound or activity for which the variance was sought must
be brought into compliance with this chapter. Where the grant of a
variance is conditioned, the variance shall not become effective
until all conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance
with any condition of the variance shall terminate it and subject the
person holding it to those provisions of this chapter regulating the
source of sound or activity for which the variance was granted.
Variances may be granted for a period of up to one year. The person
obtaining the variance may reapply for additional variance periods
under terms set forth by the applicant and the Board.
(7) Appeals. Appeal from an adverse decision of the Board shall be
made to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County.
B. Special variances. The Chief of the Bureau of Police or his designee
may, upon application and guided by the standards for use as set forth
in Subsection A(5) hereof, grant special variances for infrequent events
or activities, including but not limited to band concerts, block parties,

privately sponsored and presented at any public or private space
outdoors. Such special variances are not renewable except by action of
the Board pursuant to Subsection A hereof. The Board shall hear and
decide all appeals from the denial of a special variance, the practice and
procedure thereon to be in accordance with Subsection A hereof.

provision or preservation of housing, commercial or industrial
property. In addition, an attorney licensed with the Commonwealth

powers. Although its function is primarily to provide for reasonable

Board shall have the power to make variances and grant extensions of
time in cases where strict enforcement of this Property Maintenance
Code would cause undue or unnecessary hardship. The Board may,
in specific cases, authorize such variances to the provisions and
requirements of this Property Maintenance Code as will not be
contrary to the public interest.
1. In applying to the Board for such variance, the applicant must show:
(a) That his property was acquired in good faith.
(b) That by reasons of existing topographic conditions, or by reason
of other peculiar and exceptional conditions, pertaining to a specific
piece of property, literal enforcement of the provisions or
requirements of this Property Maintenance Code would cause undue
or unnecessary hardship. A claim or even proof merely of a more
profitable use, if the variance were granted, is not in itself evidence
of such hardship.
2. No variance to the provisions or requirements of this Property
Maintenance Code shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board
finds that all the following facts and conditions of unnecessary
hardship exist:
§ 223-3 PROPERTY, PERSONAL § 223-3
219:529
(a) The hardship arises from unique circumstances applying to the
applicant's property which are not the general condition in the
neighborhood.
(b) The hardship is not self-inflicted by the applicant.
(c) The strict application of the provisions of this Property
Maintenance Code would impose an unreasonable restraint or
unnecessary hardship on the use of the property inconsistent with the
general purpose and intent of this Property Maintenance Code.
(d) The granting of the variance will not create or cause an adverse
effect on any adjacent property.
P. Section 111.6 is amended to read as follows:
111.6 Board decision. In deciding the appeals brought before it, the
Board may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the

be made.
Q. Section 111.7 is amended to read as follows:

forth that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the
grounds of illegality, which petition must be presented to the court
within 30 days after the filing of the decision by the Board.

disruptive occupants, upon eviction, shall not reoccupy any unit on the
same property involved for a period of at least one year from the date of
eviction. This subsection is not intended to limit or inhibit the owner's

property management company of such action. The license may also be
revoked for failure to inform the City of the designation of a property
manager or property management company or to properly designate a
responsible agent, for failure to pay the annual fee, for failure to pay
water, sewer, solid waste, or recycling fees or City taxes with respect to
the unit, for being in violation of the Lead Poisoning Prevention and
§ 238-8 LANCASTER CODE § 238-9
236:552
§ 238-10. Inspections.
Lead Hazard Control Ordinance152 and/or for failure to comply with
any other provision of this article. If a license is revoked and the
unit is vacant, it shall remain vacant until such time as the license

which is inspected annually by that agency to assess compliance with
federal standards established by the United States Department of
Housing and Urban Development or state standards established by the

provided for by the City and shall receive said exemption upon

officials to all units subject to inspections hereunder, and failure to
permit such access shall be deemed a violation of this article.

(6) Should the unit, or any combination of this unit and other units of
the owner or any related party of the owner receive three notices of
violation within any twelve-month period; or
(7) For any other reasonable cause.
E. Application, inspection, issuance and reinspection. The Code Official
shall, upon receipt of an application for a license, inspect the unit. In
the event such dwelling is in compliance with this article, the license
applied for shall be issued upon 1) payment of the license fee; 2)
confirmation that a proper responsible agent has been designated, if
required; and 3) there are no outstanding water, sewer, solid waste or
recycling fees or municipal taxes owed to the City related to such
property or unit. The Code Official shall inspect each such unit at least
once every four years following the issuance of a license. These periodic
inspections shall occur notwithstanding more frequent inspections
which may be required in the investigation of complaints regarding the
dwelling. Additional more frequent periodic inspections may occur as
deemed necessary by City Code Officials, for reasons such as
reasonable threats to the safety of occupants of the unit, reasonable
threat to the safety of users of rights-of-way and adjoining properties
and reasonable concern that the unit is the subject of additional code
violations. The licensee shall maintain and make copies of all written
leases under which each unit is occupied and available for inspection
§ 238-10 LANCASTER CODE § 238-10
236:554
§ 238-11. Violations and penalties.
upon request of the Code Official. Such written leases shall indicate
the name of the occupants of each unit and the term of the lease. In
the event the unit is not in compliance with the codes of the City of
Lancaster, the Code Official shall notify the applicant in writing and
shall specify the noncompliance with the Code. Upon abatement of
the violations, the Code Official shall inspect the property and/or unit
and, upon the unit passing the inspection, issue the license applied
for. If any violation still exists, reinspections shall be scheduled. For
any reinspections, the fee for each reinspection shall be established by
resolution of City Council.
F. If the Code Enforcement Official, upon completion of the inspection,
finds that the applicable codes have not been met, the Code
Enforcement Official shall issue notices and, if appropriate, may
commence enforcement actions under the procedures set forth in the
code which has been violated or under any other applicable ordinance
of the City. Notice provided to a property manager or property
management company shall be deemed notice provided to the owner.
The following notices shall be issued to the owner of the property, the
property manager or the property management company:
(1) If the Code Enforcement Official finds violations of the unit under
the Property Maintenance Code,153 in addition to the remedies
under the Property Maintenance Code, the Code Enforcement
Official shall:
(a) Issue a notice of violation that establishes a timeline for
abatement.
(b) If, after the abatable period expires, an inspection reveals that
the violations are not corrected and arrangements satisfactory
to the Code Enforcement Official have not been made, the
license for the unit may be revoked. If the unit is vacant, it shall
remain vacant.
A. Violations. It shall be a violation of this article to commit or to permit
any other person to commit any of the following acts:
(1) To lease, let, or allow the occupancy of a unit without obtaining a
license where required by this article.
(2) To fail to register a residential rental property as required by this
article.
(3) To refuse to permit inspections required under this article for a
unit.

§ 238-10 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 238-11
236:555
(4) To fail to perform the duties established by this article if such
person is an owner, property manager or property management
company.
(5) To fail to perform the duties established by this article if such
person is an occupant of a unit.
(6) To place false information onto, or omit relevant information to
register a unit from, an application for a license.
(7) To fail to comply with any other provision of this article.
B. Penalties and remedies.
(1) Allowing occupancy of a unit after the license has been revoked: a
fine of not less than $500 per unit for each month the violation
exists or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or both.
Each month the violation exists constitutes a separate violation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no fines shall be imposed for any
period during which the unit is vacant and the owner, property
manager, and/or property management company is taking
affirmative action to correct the violations.
(2) Failure to seek a license: The owner, property manager or property
management company shall be sent a thirty-day notice of violation,
warning him/her of his/her failure to comply with the terms of this
article. If he/she does not comply at the end of 30 days, there shall
be a fine of not less than $500 per unit for each month the violation
exists or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or both.
Each month the violation exists constitutes a separate violation.
(3) Failure to pay annual license fee. If the owner, property manager or
property management company fails to pay the annual license fee,
and therefore the City holds the release of the license, but the
owner, property manager or property management company
continues to rent the unit, there shall be a fine of not less than $500
per unit for each month the license fee goes unpaid, or a term of
imprisonment not exceeding 90 days, or both.
(4) Whoever violates any other provisions of this article shall be
subject to a fine of not more than $1,000 or a term of imprisonment
not exceeding 90 days, or both. Each month that a violation exists
constitutes a separate violation.
(5) In addition to prosecution of persons in violation of this article, the
Code Enforcement Official or any duly authorized agent of the City
may seek such civil or equitable remedies, including injunctive
relief and other measures, to enforce this article in any court of
record of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, against any person
or property, real or personal, to effect the provisions of this article.

§ 238-12. Appeals; identification of violations; liability of City;
promulgation of rules and policies; tenant right to report violations.
(6) The provisions of this section and the provisions of this article
governing revocation, suspension or nonrenewal of licenses shall
be independent, nonmutually exclusive, separate remedies, all of
which shall be available to the City as may be deemed appropriate.
(7) No person whose license has been revoked by the City may,
pursuant to the Act of July 7, 1947 (P.L. 1368, No. 542) (the
"Act"),154 as amended, purchase property in Lancaster County at
any tax sale governed by the Act. The City shall furnish, to the
Lancaster County Tax Claim Bureau at least 48 hours in advance of
the sales, documentation regarding license revocations.
(8) If a Magisterial District Judge determines that an owner, property
manager or property management company has evicted the tenant
in retaliation for notifying the City of code violations as defined in
the City Code, and specifically Chapter 182 and Chapter 223, the
City may rescind the license for the unit previously occupied by the
tenant and not allow a new license to be issued for a period of up to
one year.
A. Appeals. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all appeals shall be heard
by the Board of Housing Appeals and Revisions.
B. Codes violations. Nothing in this article shall preclude or prohibit the
Code Enforcement Officer or his designee from identifying any
violations of the codes and taking lawful action in connection therewith.
C. The issuance of a license is not a representation by the City that the unit
and/or the building in which it is located is in compliance with the
codes. The issuance of a license indicates that the unit did not have any
patently dangerous conditions as of the date of inspection. However,
neither the enactment of this article nor the issuance of a license shall
impose any liability upon the City for any errors or omissions which
resulted in the issuance of such license, nor shall the City bear any
liability not otherwise imposed by law.
D. The City Administration is authorized to promulgate rules, regulations,
policies and procedures for the implementation and enforcement of the
provisions of this article, which rules, regulations, policies and
procedures shall be effective 20 days after they are filed with the Clerk
of the City of Lancaster.
E. It is the right of every tenant and resident to report any alleged
violation of City codes to the appropriate City official. An owner,
property manager or property management company shall not evict a
tenant in retaliation for the reporting of alleged code violations as

polluted water into any storm sewer or watercourse within the City or
in any area under the jurisdiction of the City, except as provided by this
regulation or applicable state or federal regulations.
C. No person may construct and maintain any privy, privy vault or
cesspool. Where no public sewer exists, these facilities shall be
abandoned and replaced with a septic tank system or other disposal
system permitted by the Department of Environmental Protection and
approved by the Control Authority within 60 days of notice to do so.
Properties presently served by privies, privy vaults, cesspools and
septic tank systems and other subsurface disposal facilities, and which
are reasonably accessible to existing public sewers, shall abandon such
facilities and connect to the available sanitary sewer system within 60
days after receipt of notice from the Control Authority.
(1) The owner or developer of an improved property may be required
to extend public sewerage facilities to the improved property or
development and connect the property or development to those
facilities. All sewerage extension costs shall be borne by the
property owner or developer.
(2) The Control Authority shall be the sole arbiter of whether public
sewers are reasonably accessible, and that decision shall be
binding and conclusive.
D. Sanitary facilities.
(1) The owner of any improved property is hereby required, at his/her
expense, to install complete sanitary facilities, including a flush
toilet, lavatory and bathtub or shower.
(2) In cases constituting premises accessible to the sewerage system,
such sanitary facilities shall be connected directly with the public
sewerage system in accordance with the provisions of this part
within 90 days after the date of official notice to do so. If any owner,
after notified as provided herein, refuses or neglects to connect
such premises with the sewerage system, the City may cause the
connection to be made at the owner's expense.
§ 249-5 (RESERVED) § 249-5
243:605
E. No person shall uncover, make any connections with or opening into,
use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenances thereof without
first obtaining a written permit from the Control Authority.
F. A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for each
improved property. Each common wall structure having a solid vertical
partition wall shall be considered an individual property requiring
separate building sewers, except as otherwise approved by the Control
Authority. Where premises consist of multiple buildings under single
ownership, concession to allow combined building sewers may be made
at the discretion of the Control Authority.
G. Where existing building sewers connected to a public sewer or public
storm sewer are to be abandoned by reason of demolition of buildings
and structures or for any other reason, they shall be disconnected and
permanently sealed at the public sewer as directed by the Control
Authority. Existing building sewers may be used in connection with new
buildings only when they are found after examination and testing by the
Building Inspector to meet all requirements of this part.
H. The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe,
joining, testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the
requirements of the Building Code and other applicable rules and
regulations of the City.
I. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building
at a depth below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any drain
line is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sewage carried
by such drain line shall be lifted by an approved means conforming to
the Building Code and discharged to the building sewer. Exceptions to
this requirement shall be requested, in writing, and approved by the
Plumbing Inspector.
J. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior
foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or
groundwater to a building sewer which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
K. The connections between the building sewer and public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building Code and other applicable
rules and regulations of the City. All such connections shall be made
gastight and watertight and shall not be made except in the presence of
and under the supervision of the Plumbing Inspector. Any deviation
from the prescribed procedures and materials shall be approved, in
writing, by the Control Authority before installation.
(1) The owner of any improved property shall maintain and repair the
lateral at his/her own expense and shall remove all trees, tree roots
and other obstructions to the lateral. Where such maintenance or
repairs are neglected by the owner, the City may, 10 days after
mailing written notice pursuant to § 249-13, herein, to the owner,
§ 249-5 LANCASTER CODE § 249-5
243:606
§ 249-6. Prohibitive standards and pollutant limitations.
take or cause to be made such maintenance or repairs as may be
necessary and charge the owner of such improved property for the
cost thereof.
L. Inspection of building sewers and sewerage. The City, by its agents and
employees, shall have the right at all reasonable times to enter any
premises connected with or about to be connected with the City's sewer
system to inspect building sewers, sources and nature of sewerage and
all fixtures and facilities from which sanitary sewerage may be
discharged into the City sewer system in order to enforce compliance
with the rules and regulations. In connection with any such inspections,
the City, by its agents and employees, shall have the right at all
reasonable times, to utilize video photography and dye testing in and
about the sewer connections, including the sewer laterals, for purposes
of inspecting any and all such building sewers, sources and nature of
sewerage and fixtures and facilities from which sanitary sewerage or
stormwater may be discharged into the City sewer system.
A. All sewage and authorized industrial waste may be discharged to the
sewerage system, except those which are deemed harmful to the
system by the Control Authority or are specifically prohibited by this
part.
B. If any proposed or present discharge of waste to the sewerage system
containing the substances or possessing the characteristics
enumerated in this section which, in the judgment of the Control
Authority, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewerage system,
receiving waters or sludge management practices or which otherwise
creates a hazard to life or constitutes a public nuisance, the Control
Authority may, upon giving notice to the discharger as established in
§ 249-18:
(1) Reject the waste.
(2) Require pretreatment to reduce characteristics to maximum limits
permitted by these regulations.
(3) Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge.
(4) Require immediate discontinuance of the waste discharge until
such time as it meets the requirements of these regulations.
C. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater,
surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface
drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted industrial
process waters, swimming pool drainage, condensate, deionized water,
noncontact cooling water, and unpolluted wastewater to any sanitary
sewer, unless specifically authorized by the Director. Where existing
surface water or roof drains are connected to the sanitary sewers, they
shall be removed within six months of receipt of notice from the City to
§ 249-5 (RESERVED) § 249-6
243:607
remove such connection. In the event that such connection is not
removed, the City shall cause it to be removed at the owner's expense.
Groundwater from site contamination cleanup may be authorized by the
Control Authority subject to the sewer system regulations as industrial
waste.
D. General prohibitions. Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall
introduce or cause or permit to be introduced into the sewerage system
(including any sanitary sewer, storm sewer or combined sewer) any
pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference.
These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or
not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other
national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
E. Specific prohibitions. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited
by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that
they could be discharged to the POTW. No user shall introduce or cause
to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or
wastewater:

Maximum Daily Limit
(mg/l)
Oil and grease
(petroleum or unknown
origin)
100
Selenium 0.4
Silver 2.1
Zinc 4.7
The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater

substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise.
The Director may impose mass limitations in addition to the
concentration-based limitations above.
(c) The Director may develop best management practices (BMPs),
by ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, to
implement local limits and the requirements of § 249-6.
(21) Contains any substance that will cause the sewage treatment
plant's effluent to violate the NPDES permit under which it
operates or the water quality standards established for the
Conestoga River.
F. Categorical pretreatment standards. Users must comply with the
categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405 to 471. Industrial waste may be subject to
categorical pretreatment standards specifying quantities or
concentrations of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be
discharged to the sewerage system by existing or new industrial users
in specific industrial subcategories. These categorical standards,
established in separate regulations under 40 CFR Chapter I,
Subchapter N, Parts 405 to 471, are hereby incorporated into these
regulations and shall be in addition to any pretreatment standards and
requirements stated explicitly in this regulation. The Control Authority
may apply the following provisions where appropriate to modify the
manner in which the categorical pretreatment standards are applied.
(1) Categorical pretreatment standards expressed only in terms of
either mass or concentration of a pollutant in waste may be
converted to equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance
with the provisions in Subsection F(5) of this section [40 CFR Part
403.6(c)].
(a) Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only
in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant
in wastewater, the Director may impose equivalent
concentration or mass limits in accordance with this section.
§ 249-6 (RESERVED) § 249-6
243:611
(b) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of
production, the Director may convert the limits to equivalent
limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged
per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating
effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
(2) When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
Director shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR
Part 403.6(e).
(3) Variance from categorical pretreatment standards may be obtained
in cases of fundamentally different factors regarding limits
developed by EPA, if proven by the user in accordance with 40 CFR
Part 403.13. Such variance may only be granted by the EPA and the
user must submit its request to EPA.
(4) An industrial user may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a
categorical pretreatment standard in accordance with the
following:
(a) Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect
the presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water
in accordance with this section. Any industrial user wishing to
obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the
City. Upon request of the industrial user, the applicable
standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to
reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of Subsection F(4)(b) of this section are met.
(b) Criteria.
[1] Either the applicable categorical pretreatment standards
contained in 40 CFR Subchapter N specifically provide
that they shall be applied on a net basis; or the industrial
user demonstrates that the control system it proposes or
uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment
standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet
the standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake
waters.
[2] Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen
demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and
grease should not be granted unless the industrial user
demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure
in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the
constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or
unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process
water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
§ 249-6 LANCASTER CODE § 249-6
243:612
[3] Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to
meet the applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s),
up to a maximum value equal to the influent value.
Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s)
adjusted under this section.
[4] Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that
the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as
that into which the POTW discharges. The City may waive
this requirement if it finds that no environmental
degradation will result.
(5) When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an industrial
user may request that the Control Authority convert the limits to
equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration
limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Control
Authority. The Control Authority may establish equivalent mass
limits only if the industrial user meets all the following conditions
in Subsection F(5)(a)[1] through [5] of this section.
(a) To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
[1] Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water
conservation methods and technologies that substantially
reduce water use during the term of its control
mechanism;
[2] Currently use control and treatment technologies
adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable
categorical pretreatment standard, and not have used
dilution as a substitute for treatment;
[3] Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all waste streams, based
on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device,
as well as the facility's long-term average production rate.
Both the actual average daily flow rate and long-term
average production rate must be representative of current
operating conditions;
[4] Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits
are not appropriate to control the discharge; and
[5] Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the
industrial user's request for equivalent mass limits.
(b) An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
§ 249-6 (RESERVED) § 249-6
243:613
[1] Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the
equivalent mass limits;
[2] Continue to record the facility's flow rates using a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
[3] Continue to record the facility's production rates and
notify the Control Authority whenever production rates
are expected to vary by more than 20% from its baseline
production rates determined in Subsection F(5)(a)[3] of
this section. Upon notification of a revised production rate,
the Control Authority must reassess the equivalent mass
limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed
conditions at the facility; and
[4] Continue to employ the same or comparable water
conservation methods and technologies as those
implemented pursuant to Subsection F(5)(a)[1] of this
section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass
limit.
(c) A Control Authority which chooses to establish equivalent
mass limits:
[1] Must calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying
the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated
process(es) of the industrial user by the concentrationbased
daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the
appropriate unit conversion factor;
[2] Upon notification of a revised production rate, must
reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the
limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the
facility; and
[3] May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
control mechanism terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of
the implementation of water conservation methods and
technologies, and the actual average daily flow rates used
in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit
were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for
treatment pursuant to § 249-7E of this chapter.
(d) The Control Authority may not express limits in terms of mass
for pollutants such as pH, temperature, radiation, or other
pollutants which cannot appropriately be expressed as mass.
(6) The Control Authority may convert the mass limits of the
categorical pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and
§ 249-6 LANCASTER CODE § 249-6
243:614

ARTICLE III
Pretreatment of Wastewater
§ 249-7. General pretreatment requirements.
A. Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance
with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the
prohibitions set out in § 249-6 within the time limitations specified by
EPA, the state, or Control Authority, whichever is more stringent. Any
facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Control
Authority for review, and shall be acceptable to the Control Authority
before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and
operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter.
B. Additional pretreatment measures. Whenever deemed necessary, the
Control Authority may require users to restrict their discharge during
peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged
only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of
discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of
this chapter.
C. If the Control Authority determines that a waste from any significant
industrial user poses a potential for pass-through or interference due to
the quality or quantity of the discharge, the Control Authority may
place special requirements or limits, in addition to or more stringent
than those contained in this part, in any industrial waste discharge
permit to prevent such pass-through or interference. Such individual
control limits may include but are not limited to solvent/organic
management plans (STOMPs), toxic reduction evaluation plans (TREs),
hazardous waste disposal plans, slug discharge control plans or more
stringent specific numerical limitations on substances.
D. Where preliminary treatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided
for any water or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner, at his/her expense,
and shall be accessible for inspection and testing by the Control
Authority. The Director may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on his/her property and at his/her
expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure
equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be
issued solely for flow equalization.
E. No person shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for
§ 249-7 (RESERVED) § 249-7
243:617
adequate pretreatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The Director may impose mass limitations on
users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards
or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
F. Except as otherwise provided, discharge of grease trap wastes in
quantities that could, in the opinion of the City, cause interference or
pass-through at the sewage treatment plant or could otherwise cause
operational problems at the sewage treatment plant (including its
collection system) is prohibited. In addition, petroleum oil,
nonbiodegradable cutting oil or products of mineral oil origin in
amounts causing interference or pass-through at the sewage treatment
plant is prohibited.
G. Grease, oil and sand interceptors or traps shall be provided where, in
the opinion of the Control Authority and/or the Codes Office, they are
necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing grease in
excessive amounts or any flammable wastes, sand or other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
acceptable to the Control Authority, and shall be located as to be readily
and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors
shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired by the user at his/her
expense. The handling of fats, oil and grease (FOG) wastes shall be
conducted in a manner consistent with all City of Lancaster fats, oil and
grease policies and procedures, as may be promulgated from time to
time.
H. The use of mechanical garbage grinders producing a finely divided
mass, properly flushed with an ample amount of water, shall be
permitted upon the condition that no such mechanical garbage grinder
to serve premises used for commercial purposes shall be installed until
permission for such installation shall have been obtained from the
Control Authority upon written application therefor.
I. Holding tank waste containing more than 2,000 mg/l solids may be
classified as septage or industrial sludge and shall meet the current
Pennsylvania guidelines for agricultural use of sewage sludge in order
to be accepted. Acceptance of this material may be contingent on the
status of any special equipment or operations required for treatment,
and the decision of acceptance shall be made by the Control Authority.
J. Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this part in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were
derived.
K. Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
§ 249-7 LANCASTER CODE § 249-7
243:618
§ 249-8. Slug discharge control and notification.
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average,
limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same
production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average
and the maximum equivalent limitation.
L. Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based
standard shall notify the Director within two business days after the
user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any user not
notifying the Director of such anticipated change will be required to
meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based on
the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.
M. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
A. All significant industrial users shall provide and maintain, at their own
expense, facilities adequate, in the judgment of the Control Authority, to
prevent accidental discharge of prohibited and/or regulated substances
and/or slug discharges and to protect the sewerage system from
damages caused by such substances. No industrial user which
commences discharge to the sewerage system after the effective date of
this section shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the sewerage
system until the Control Authority has reviewed and approved that
user's accidental discharge prevention or slug prevention procedures
(if those procedures are required by the Control Authority). If the
Control Authority decides that a slug control plan is needed, the plan
shall contain, at a minimum, the elements required in 40 CFR Part
403.8(f)(2)(vii).
B. Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans. The Control
Authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges. The Control Authority may require any user to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges. Alternatively,
the Director may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
(1) Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
(2) Description of stored chemicals;
(3) Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental
or slug discharge, as required by this chapter; and
§ 249-7 (RESERVED) § 249-8
243:619
§ 249-9. Admission of authorized waste into storm sewers;
prohibited connections.
(4) Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer
of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants,
including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
C. In the case of an accidental discharge to the sewerage system of any
prohibited or regulated substance in such a quantity or concentration
that may result in a violation of this regulation, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the Control Authority of the accident.
The notification shall include information regarding the location of the
discharge, the type of pollutants involved, the concentration and
volume of the discharge and corrective actions taken and/or
contemplated.
D. Within five working days following an accidental discharge, the user
shall submit to the Control Authority a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability
which may be incurred as a result of damage to the sewerage system,
fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability
which may be imposed by this part or other applicable law.
A. Residential, commercial or industrial property may be connected to the
separate storm sewer system or may continue discharging into the
separate storm sewer system, provided that the discharge conforms to
the following:
(1) No person in the City of Lancaster shall allow, or cause to allow,
stormwater discharges into the City's separate storm sewer system
which are not composed entirely of stormwater, except as provided
in Subsection A(2) below and discharges allowed under a state or
federal permit. All discharges into separate storm sewers shall be
in compliance with the laws or regulations of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, the federal government or any agency thereof having
jurisdiction over streams, rivers, waterways or water resources,
and this part.
(2) Discharges which may be allowed, based on a finding by the City
that the discharge(s) do not significantly contribute to pollution to
surface waters of the commonwealth, are:
(a) Air-conditioning condensate.
§ 249-8 LANCASTER CODE § 249-9
243:620
(b) Lawn watering.
(c) Discharges from fire-fighting activities (unless discharges are
suspected of containing toxic or hazardous materials).
(d) Irrigation drainage.
(e) Potable water sources, including dechlorinated waterline and
fire hydrant flushings.
(f) Pavement wash waters where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spill
material has been removed) where detergents are not used.
(g) Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
(h) Routine external building washdown (which does not use
detergents or other compounds).
(i) Sump pump discharges of groundwater.
(j) Water from individual residential car washing.
(k) Uncontaminated groundwater.
(l) Uncontaminated water from foundation or from footing drains.
(m) Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.
(n) Water from crawl space pumps.
(o) Springs.
(3) In the event that the City determines that any of the discharges
identified in Subsection A(2) significantly contribute to pollution of
waters of the commonwealth, or is so notified by DEP, the City will
notify the responsible person to cease the discharge.
(4) Upon notice provided by the City under Subsection A(3), the
discharger will have a reasonable time, as determined by the City,
to cease the discharge consistent with the degree of pollution
caused by the discharge.
B. Prohibited connections. The following connections are prohibited,
except as provided in Subsection A(2) above:
(1) Any drain or conveyance, whether on the surface or subsurface,
which allows any nonstormwater discharge, including sewage,
process wastewater and wash water, to enter the separate storm
sewer system and any connections to the storm drain system from
indoor drains and sinks; and
(2) Any drain or conveyance connected from a commercial or
industrial land use to the separate storm sewer system which has
§ 249-9 (RESERVED) § 249-9
243:621
not been documented in plans, maps or equivalent records and
approved by the City.

§ 249-10. Connection permits.
§ 249-11. Individual wastewater discharge permit requirement.
A. Prior to making a residential or commercial connection to the sewerage
system or prior to making a new connection to the sewerage system or
to a storm sewer for industrial waste discharge, the owner of the
improved property where such installation or connection is proposed to
be made shall apply to the City, in writing, for the necessary permit.
Proposed alteration of an existing sewer lateral shall also constitute
need for a permit application unless deemed unnecessary by the
Control Authority.
B. Applications for all installations or connections to the public sewer shall
be made on connection permit application forms furnished by the City.
Applications shall be subject to approval by the Control Authority.
C. There shall be two classes of building sewer connection permits: for

producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his/her agent
shall make application on a special form furnished by the City. The
connection permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications or other information considered pertinent in the
judgment of the Control Authority. A connection permit and inspection
fee in the amount established by resolution of City Council for each
class of building sewer connection permit shall be paid to the City at the
time the application is filed. This requirement for a connection permit
and inspection fee is in general conformance with the requirements of
the Building Code of the City. Fees for sidewalks and street cuts will
remain in force and shall be paid in addition to the building sewer
permit.
D. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of the
building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify
the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly result in
whole or in part due to the installation of the building sewer.
E. The applicant for the building sewer connection permit shall notify the
Plumbing Inspector when the building sewer is ready for inspection and

enforce § 249-6. Commercial/industrial discharge permits may contain
any of the provisions of Subsections F and G hereof as deemed
appropriate by the Control Authority.
§ 249-12 LANCASTER CODE § 249-13
243:628
§ 249-13. Reporting requirements.
A. All significant industrial users and other users requested by the Control
Authority shall file with the City a quarterly self-monitoring report on
the quality and quantity of their discharge upon forms to be supplied by
the City. The quarterly report shall cover the calendar quarters of
January to March, April to June, July to September and October to
December. The reports shall be filed with the City within 10 days of the
end of the quarter. A laboratory report from a qualified testing
laboratory acceptable to the Control Authority shall be submitted with
each report to verify the values reported. All reports submitted shall be
complete to include any sewage flow or test values as may be required
by the Control Authority. In cases where the pretreatment standard
requires compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or
pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation
required by the Control Authority or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. The failure of
a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
(1) Irrespective of the quarterly reporting requirements above, the
City may require monthly reporting based on the quantity and
quality of the discharge.
B. All users subject to these reporting requirements that monitor any
pollutant more frequently than required by the Control Authority, using
procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, shall include the results of
this monitoring in the immediately following quarterly self-monitoring
report. Any user employing pretreatment may be required by the
Control Authority to report operating data which demonstrates the
effectiveness of the pretreatment facility.
C. All permitted industrial users, and commercial/industrial users issued
commercial/industrial discharge permits, shall designate a person as
the authorized representative as defined in § 249-4. Any temporary or
permanent replacement of this authorized representative shall be
reported to the Control Authority.
D. All reports submitted pursuant to requirements outlined in this
regulation, including but not limited to the baseline monitoring report,
the self-monitoring report and the Compliance with Categorical
Pretreatment Standards Report, shall be signed by the user's
authorized representative.
E. All reports referenced in this section, as well as industrial waste
discharge permit applications, submitted pursuant to § 249-12 shall
include the following statement:
§ 249-13 (RESERVED) § 249-13
243:629
"I certify, under penalty of law, that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather
and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the
person or persons who manage the system or those persons directly
responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted
is to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate and complete.
I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations."
F. Confidential information. Information and data on a user obtained from
reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, individual
wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the
Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, that the release
of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission
of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets
or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the
public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to
governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall
not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to
the public without restriction.
G. Baseline monitoring report. All industrial users subject to pretreatment
standards shall submit to the City a report which indicates the
compliance status of the user with the applicable categorical
pretreatment standard as defined in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b). This report
shall identify the facility, indicate permits held, describe operations,
contain flow and pollutant measurements and be reviewed and certified
by a qualified engineer representing the industrial user. Existing
sources shall submit the report within 180 days after the effective date
of a categorical pretreatment standard. New sources and sources that
become industrial users after the effective date of an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard shall submit the report at least 90
days prior to commencing discharge of waste regulated by such
standard. If additional pretreatment is needed to meet the
pretreatment standards, a compliance schedule as described in
Subsection I below shall be required. For existing sources, the schedule
shall provide a goal for compliance no later than the compliance date
established in the applicable categorical pretreatment standard.
§ 249-13 LANCASTER CODE § 249-13
243:630
H. Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards report. Within 90
days following the date for final compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of industrial waste into the
sewerage system, any industrial user subject to pretreatment standards
and requirements shall submit to the City a report containing the
information listed in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)(4) to (6) indicating the
nature and concentration for all pollutants in the discharge from the
regulated process which are limited by the categorical pretreatment
standards and the average and maximum daily flow for these process
units in the user facility which are limited by such pretreatment
standards. The report shall be based on data obtained through
appropriate sampling in accordance with § 249-15 performed during
the period covered by the report, and the data relied upon must be
representative of the conditions occurring during any specified time
period. Industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established in accordance with 40 CFR Part 403.6(c) must
include in the report a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. The report shall state whether the applicable
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not,
what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is
necessary to bring the user into compliance with all applicable
pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by the user's
authorized representative. The report shall be reviewed and certified by
a qualified engineer representing the industrial user.
I. Compliance schedule progress reports. Compliance schedules shall
contain progress time increments for milestone events leading to the
construction and operation of a pretreatment system for the user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standard. None of the
aforementioned time increments shall exceed nine months. Progress
reports shall be submitted to the Control Authority within 14 days after
each milestone event and the final date of compliance. Reports shall
include the attainment status of the milestone events, explanation of
any delays and, if appropriate, countermeasures to avoid future delays.
The duration between progress reports shall be limited to nine months.
J. All users shall provide notification to the Control Authority of any
changes affecting the potential for a slug discharge.
K. All industrial users shall promptly notify the City prior to any changes in
the volume or character of their waste discharge or in the operation of
their pretreatment processes due to the potential for interference or
pass through at the sewerage treatment plant.
L. Industrial users shall notify the Control Authority immediately of all
discharges that could cause problems to the sewerage system,
including but not limited to discharges referenced in § 249-6 and any
slug discharge of a nonroutine, episodic nature, including accidental
spills or noncustomary batch discharge.
§ 249-13 (RESERVED) § 249-13
243:631
M. The Control Authority may impose mass limitations on industrial users
which, in the opinion of the Control Authority, are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases
where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by Subsection A above shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards or requirements in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling
and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the City, of
pollutants contained herein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards or requirements. The frequency of monitoring
shall be prescribed in accordance with procedures established by EPA
pursuant to Section 304(g) of the CWA and contained in 40 CFR Part
136.
N. The industrial user shall notify the City, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director and the state hazardous waste
authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the sewerage system of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other)
and quantity of waste discharged, pursuant to the requirements of 40
CFR Part 403.12(p).
(1) If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per
calendar month to the City, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged
during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later
than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
conditions must be submitted under § 249-13K. The notification
requirement in this subsection does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
under the self-monitoring requirements of this section.
O. Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have been
submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed,
postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal
Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
P. Penalty for failure to file report. The City may assess a penalty fee to
any user for each day that a report required by this section is late,
beginning five days after the date the report is due. Actions taken by
the City to collect late reporting fees shall not limit the City's authority
§ 249-13 LANCASTER CODE § 249-13
243:632
§ 249-14. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established
under § 249-6. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and
time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the
dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records
shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall
be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user or the City, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Director.
§ 249-15. Sampling, flow measurements, testing and inspection;
fees.
to initiate other enforcement actions that may include additional
penalties for late reporting violations. Penalty fees shall be established
by resolution of the Council of the City of Lancaster.
(1) The City may decline to issue or reissue an individual wastewater
discharge permit to any user who has failed to pay any outstanding
fees, fines or penalties incurred as a result of any provision of this
section, a previous individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder.
A. When required by the Control Authority, the owner of any improved
property serviced by a public sewer carrying industrial waste shall
install, at his/her expense, a suitable control manhole, together with
any such necessary meters or appurtenances to facilitate observation,
sampling and measurement of the waste. The control manhole shall be
accessible at all times to the Control Authority or designated
representatives. In cases where the City has made no special
requirement for a control manhole, the control manhole shall be
considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer
to the point at which the building sewer is connected. The control
manhole shall allow the sampling of the discharge from an individual
user, separate from any combined flow from any upstream users.
B. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part
136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does
not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
§ 249-13 (RESERVED) § 249-15
243:633
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical
methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties
approved by EPA. The particular analysis involved will determine
whether a composite of all outfalls on a premises is appropriate or
whether a grab sample or samples be taken. Sampling shall be done
as to provide data representative of conditions occurring during any
particular time within the period covered by the self-monitoring report.
All sampling performed shall be done on different days of the week than
was done during the previous calendar quarter for the self-monitoring
report.
(1) Except as indicated in Subsection B(2) and (3) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flowproportional
composite sampling techniques, unless timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the Control Authority, the
samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols
(including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136
and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by
the Control Authority, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
(3) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports required in 40 CFR Part 403.12(b)
and (d), a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not
exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available,
the Control Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by 40 CFR Part 403.12(e) and (h), the user is
required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess
and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and
requirements.
C. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the City within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
§ 249-15 LANCASTER CODE § 249-15
243:634
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation.
D. The owner of any improved property connected to the sewerage system
shall provide the Control Authority or designated representatives and
agents the opportunity of access at any time to any part of any improved
property served by the sewerage system as shall be required for
purposes of inspection, measurement, sampling and testing and for
performance of other functions relating to service rendered by the City
in regard to the sewerage system.
E. The foregoing provisions and requirements for sampling, flow
measurements, testing and inspection shall apply to discharges to
sanitary sewers, storm sewers and combined sewers. Reasonable fees
for inspection, sampling, testing and other related purposes shall be as
established by the City.
F. Right of entry for inspection and sampling. The Control Authority shall
have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether
the user is complying with all requirements of this chapter and any
individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder.
Users shall allow the Control Authority ready access to all parts of the
premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination
and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
(1) Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Control
Authority shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes
of performing specific responsibilities.
(2) The Control Authority shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
(3) The Control Authority may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used
to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated to
ensure their accuracy.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Control
Authority and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such
access shall be borne by the user.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Control Authority access to
the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
§ 249-15 (RESERVED) § 249-15
243:635
§ 249-16. Drainage of swimming pools.
Drain lines from all swimming pools in the City may be connected to
storm sewers, and filter backwash lines shall be discharged to the sanitary
sewerage system as follows:
§ 249-17. Removal, transportation and disposal of holding tank
wastes.
G. Search warrants. If the Director has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter,
or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify
compliance with this chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder,
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, the Director may seek issuance of a search warrant from
any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Sand filter backwash shall be discharged to the sanitary sewer.
B. Diatomaceous earth filter backwash shall be connected to the sanitary
sewer through settling tanks with three months' storage capacity of
spent diatomaceous earth, which tanks shall be readily accessible for
removing solid waste for disposal.
A. This section is intended for any owner using a tank truck or any
equipment in the transportation and disposal of holding tank wastes.
The equipment and tank truck shall conform to the following
requirements:
(1) The container shall be watertight.
(2) Tanks, containers or other equipment shall be so constructed that
every portion of the interior and exterior can be easily cleaned and
shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition.
(3) Piping, valves and permanent or flexible connections shall be
accessible and easily disconnected for cleaning purposes.
(4) The inlet opening, or opening to every container, shall be so
constructed that the material will not spill outside during filling,
transfer or transport.
(5) The outlet connections shall be so constructed that no material will
leak out or run out to other than the point of discharge and shall be
of a design and type suitable for the material handled and capable
of controlling the flow or discharge without spillage, undue spray
or flooding immediate surroundings while in use.
(6) No connection shall be made at any time between a tap or outlet
furnishing potable water on any premises and any container or
§ 249-15 LANCASTER CODE § 249-17
243:636
equipment holding material by any means other than an open
connection.
B. The holding tank wastes discharged by the tank trucks into the
sewerage system shall not contain industrial waste, chemicals or other
matter that does not conform to the requirements and the maximum
daily limit of acceptable substances, except if authorized in accordance
with § 249-6.
C. Any holding tank waste to be discharged from tank trucks within the
City shall be disposed at the location designated by the Control
Authority at the sewage treatment plant at the time or times and at a
rate or rates of discharge fixed by the Control Authority.
D. Any hauler, operator, person or persons cleaning holding tanks or any
other container governed by this section shall obtain a license from the
Control Authority before cleaning such containers and hauling the
material to the designated place of disposal within the City. The fee for
such license shall be as established by the City.
E. All material brought into the City for disposal from outside the limits of
the City shall be governed by this section, and the hauler, operator,
person or persons hauling shall take out a license, as stated herein.
F. All licensed haulers transporting and discharging holding tank waste
shall supply complete information about the source(s) of the wastes
contained in each load on a manifest form provided by or satisfactory to
the Control Authority. The hauler shall collect a grab sample of waste
from each load of waste that is representative of the entire load. This
sample shall be submitted to the Control Authority in accordance with
procedures outlined in each waste license.
(1) Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for
every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and
address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of waste, and
volume and characteristics of waste. The form shall identify the
type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and
whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
G. An application form shall be filled out by the hauler, operator, owner,
person or persons prior to the conducting of such a business within the
City as governed in this regulation. The application form shall contain
the following information:

ARTICLE V
Enforcement; Violations and Penalties; Appeals
§ 249-18. Enforcement; violations and penalties.
A. Notification of violation. When the Control Authority finds that a person
has violated or is violating this regulation or any permit issued
hereunder, the Control Authority may serve upon said person written
notice stating the nature of the violation. Service of notice of violation
shall not affect the rights and powers to immediately suspend service
under Subsection D hereof.
B. Compliance agreements. The Control Authority may enter into
agreements to assure voluntary compliance by a person responsible for
any noncompliance. Such agreements will include specific action to be
taken by the person to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the agreement and may contain penalties or provisions to
compel compliance.
C. Notice of required action. When the Control Authority finds that a
person has violated or is violating this regulation or any permit issued
hereunder, the Control Authority may issue a notice to the person
directing that action be taken within a specified time period in response
to the violation. Such required action shall include, without limitation,
an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction
and prevention thereof, installation of pretreatment technology,
additional self-monitoring, performance of adequate management
practices or such other action as may be necessary or appropriate in
order to correct the violation or prevent further violation. Performance
of the required action shall not relieve the person of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of required
action. Service of notice of required action shall not affect the rights
and powers to immediately suspend service under Subsection D hereof.
D. Emergency suspension.
(1) The Control Authority may suspend the services of the sewerage
system and/or the permit of a person whenever such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the Control Authority, in order to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or causes an
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons or to the environment or which causes interference to the
sewerage system or which causes the City to violate any condition
of its NPDES permit.
(2) Any person notified of a suspension of the service of the sewerage
system and/or its permit shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a failure to immediately comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority shall
take such steps as it may deem necessary, which may include
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
§ 249-18 (RESERVED) § 249-18
243:639
minimize damage to the sewerage system, its receiving stream
or endangerment to the health and welfare of persons or the
environment.
(3) A person which is responsible, in whole or in part, for imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing
the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence to the Control Authority within such
time period as shall be set by the Control Authority.
E. Revocation of permit.
(1) The Control Authority may revoke an individual wastewater
discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
(a) Failure to notify Control Authority of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
(b) Failure to provide prior notification to Control Authority of
changed conditions;
(c) Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application;
(d) Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements;
(e) Tampering with monitoring equipment;
(f) Refusing to allow the Director timely access to the facility
premises and records;
(g) Failure to meet effluent limitations;
(h) Failure to pay fines;
(i) Failure to pay sewer charges;
(j) Failure to meet compliance schedules;
(k) Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
(l) Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility;
(m) Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this chapter; or
(n) Failure to file reports required by this chapter.
(2) Individual wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon
cessation of operations or transfer of business ownership. All
individual wastewater discharge permits issued to a user are void
§ 249-18 LANCASTER CODE § 249-18
243:640
upon the issuance of a new individual wastewater discharge permit
to that user.
(3) The permit holder and the person in violation shall be notified of
the proposed revocation of the permit and be offered an
opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be
taken. The opportunity to show cause shall be at a meeting with the
Control Authority or designee. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least five days prior to the meeting. Such notice may
be served on any principal executive, general partner or corporate
officer of the permit holder or the person. Service of notice to show
cause shall not affect the rights and powers to immediately suspend
service under Subsection D hereof.
F. Injunctive relief. The Control Authority, in the name of the City, may,
through the City's Attorney, apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
for the issuance of temporary or permanent injunctive relief to enforce
compliance with or restrain any violations of this part or any
pretreatment standard or any pretreatment requirement, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement
imposed by this part on activities of the user. The Control Authority may
also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable
relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or
a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user. Injunctive
relief shall be granted as is provided in the Publicly Owned Treatment
Works Penalty Law (Act of March 26, 1992, P.L. 1992, No. 9).164
G. Civil penalties.
(1) Whenever, on the basis of any information available, the Control
Authority finds that any user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this part or has violated any permit condition or
limitation, the Control Authority may assess a civil penalty under
this subsection and shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil
penalty of not less than $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of
a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation. This
subsection shall constitute the formal, written civil penalty
assessment policy of the City.
(2) A civil penalty may be assessed whether or not the violation was
willful or negligent. Each violation for each separate day may, at
the discretion of the Control Authority, constitute a separate and
distinct offense under this subsection.
164. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 249-18 (RESERVED) § 249-18
243:641
(3) The amount of a civil penalty under this subsection shall not exceed
$25,000 per violation. In addition to the civil penalty, the Control
Authority, in the name of the City, may recover its costs for
reestablishing the operation of the sewerage system, including
reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses
associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the City.
(4) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty under this
subsection, the Control Authority shall give to the person to be
assessed such penalty written notice of the Control Authority's
proposal to issue such order and the opportunity to request, within
30 days of the date the notice is received by such person, a hearing
on the proposed order before the Hearing Board as described in
§ 249-19.
(5) In determining the amount of any penalty assessed under this
subsection, the Control Authority shall take into account the
nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation or
violations, the extent of actual or potential damage to air, water,
land or other natural resources and their uses; and, with respect to
the violator, ability to pay, any prior history of such violations, the
degree of culpability, the economic benefit or savings (if any)
resulting from the violation, deterrence of future violations, failure
of the violator to comply with prior enforcement attempts; and such
other matters as justice may require. Furthermore, the Control
Authority shall take into account any economic benefit gained
through the user's violation, and corrective actions by the user.
(6) For purposes of this subsection, a single operational upset, as
defined herein, which leads to simultaneous violations of more than
one pollutant parameter or consecutive violations of one or more
pollutant parameters shall be treated as a single violation.
(7) If the person to be assessed such penalty fails to request a hearing
on the proposed order within 30 days of the date the notice is
received by such person, the Control Authority may issue an order
assessing the civil penalty. Such order shall become final 30 days
after its issuance unless the person assessed such penalty seeks
judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction.
(8) Action taken by the Control Authority under this subsection shall
not affect or limit the Control Authority's authority to enforce any
provision of this part or affect any person's obligation to comply
with any section of this part or with the terms and conditions of any
permit issued to such person. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against a user.
§ 249-18 LANCASTER CODE § 249-18
243:642
(9) Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under this
subsection may obtain review of such assessment in a court of
competent jurisdiction by filing a notice of appeal in such court
within the thirty-day period beginning on the date the civil penalty
order is issued and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice
by certified mail to the Control Authority.
(10) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after the
order making the assessment has become final or after a court has
entered a final judgment in favor of the Control Authority, the
Control Authority may request the City Solicitor to bring a civil
action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the amount
assessed (plus interest at currently prevailing rates from the date
of the final order or the date of the final judgment, as the case may
be). In such an action, the validity, amount and appropriateness of
such penalty shall not be subject to review. Any person who fails to
pay on a timely basis the amount of an assessment of a civil penalty
shall be required to pay, in addition to such amount and interest,
attorneys' fees and costs for collection proceedings.
H. Criminal penalty.
(1) Violations: generally. Whoever violates any provision of this
regulation or any permit issued hereunder shall, or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be
punished by a fine and pay costs of prosecution to be collected as
other fines and costs are by law collectible or be imprisoned. Each
day during which a violation exists shall constitute a separate
offense.
(2) Falsifying information. Any person who knowingly makes any false
statements, representations or certifications in any application,

Sewer Rentals And Charges
§ 249-26. Sewer rentals and charges imposed.
§ 249-27. Computation of rentals and charges.
§ 249-28. Measuring volume of sewage and industrial wastes from
commercial or industrial establishments.
A. Sewer rentals and charges provided by this part are imposed upon and
shall be collected from the owner of each improved property, located
within the corporate limits of the City, which shall be connected either
directly or indirectly to the sewer system. Such sewer rentals and
charges shall be effective as of January 1, 2016, or the date of the latest
revision, as adopted by resolution of the Council of the City of Lancaster
to be applied to water meter readings made on or after that date, and
shall be payable as provided in this part.
B. Sewer rentals and charges shall also be imposed upon and shall be
collected from the owner of each improved property located within the
corporate limits of the City which shall have been notified to connect to
the sewer system and have failed to do so within 90 days after the
mailing date of official notice to connect and any extension of time
therefor authorized by official authority. In such event, sewer rentals
and charges shall be computed as provided in this part just as if the
property were connected to and discharging into the sewer system.
A. Domestic establishments located within City. Sewer rentals and
charges for any improved property constituting a domestic
establishment shall be computed in accordance with the rate schedule
set forth in § 249-29 upon the volume of sewage discharged into the
sewer system during the preceding quarter annum. In the case of a
domestic establishment, the volume of sewage discharged shall be
deemed equal to the volume of water metered as delivered from the
City's water system during the preceding quarter annum.
B. Commercial and industrial establishments located within City. Sewer
rentals and charges for sewage discharged into the sewer system from
any improved property constituting a commercial establishment or an
industrial establishment shall be computed, in accordance with the rate
schedule set forth in § 249-29 upon the volume of sewage and/or
industrial wastes discharged into the sewer system during the
preceding quarter annum.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property
constituting a commercial establishment or an industrial
establishment which shall discharge sewage and/or industrial
wastes into the sewer system shall be supplied exclusively by the
§ 249-26 (RESERVED) § 249-28
243:649
City's water system, the volume of water furnished, as determined
from meter readings of the Water Bureau, shall be used as the
measure of discharge of sewage and/or industrial wastes in
computing sewer rentals and charges, subject to adjustment as
permitted in Subsection A(3) hereof.
(2) Whenever an improved property constituting a commercial
establishment or an industrial establishment which shall discharge
sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer system shall have a
source of water supply in addition to or other than the City's water
system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter
on such additional or other source of water supply. The total volume
of water furnished, as determined from the meter readings of the
Water Bureau and the meter readings of the meters on such
additional or other sources of water supply, or the meter readings
of the meters on such other sources of water supply, as
appropriate, shall be used as the measure of discharge of sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing the sewer rentals and
charges, subject to adjustments as permitted in Subsection A(3)
hereof.
(3) Whenever an improved property constituting a commercial
establishment or an industrial establishment shall use water from
the City's water system, or water from the City's water system and/
or water from a source of supply in addition to or other than the
City's water system, and all or part of the water so used shall not be
discharged into the sewer system, the volume used as the measure
of discharge of sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing
sewer rentals and charges may be adjusted by one of the following
methods:
(a) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
of sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals
and charges.
(b) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume not being discharged into the sewer system. The
readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder shall be used as the measure of discharge of sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and
charges.
(c) If it is not practical, in the opinion of the City, to install a meter
or other measuring device to determine continuously the
volume not discharged into the sewer system, the City shall
determine, in such manner and by such method as it may
prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is being
discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used
§ 249-28 LANCASTER CODE § 249-28
243:650
§ 249-29. Schedule of rates.
All monthly and/or quarter-annual sewer rentals and charges shall be
computed in accordance with the schedules established by resolution of the
Council of the City of Lancaster at the following rates.
as the measure of discharge of sewage and/or industrial wastes
in computing sewer rentals and charges shall be the
percentage so determined of the quantity measured by the
water meters. Any dispute as to such estimated percentage
shall be submitted to the City, after notice of such estimate.
The decision of the City with respect to the matter shall be final
for the then-current calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall be
required or permitted under this section, other than meters of the City's
water system, shall be furnished and installed by the owner of the
improved property, at his expense, shall be under the control of the City
and may be tested, inspected or repaired by the City whenever
necessary. The owner of the improved property shall be responsible for
the maintenance and safekeeping of such meter or other measuring
device. All repairs thereto shall be made at the expense of the owner,
whether such repairs shall be made necessary by ordinary wear and
tear or other cause. Bills for such repairs, if made by the City, shall be
due and payable immediately upon completion of such repairs and shall
be collected in the same manner as quarter annum bills for sewer
rentals and charges.
C. Meter readings. The City shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or other measuring devices required or permitted under this
section, other than those owned and read by the Water Bureau, and the
same shall be available to the City for such purpose at all reasonable
times.
A. Consumption charges shall be computed by metered volume (gallons
per quarter) at a rate per 1,000 gallons.
B. Minimum charges.
(1) Minimum charges shall be computed on the size of meter in inches,
with a minimum charge per quarter.
(2) The minimum charge shall be applicable only when the total
resulting from applying the consumption charges to the metered
volume is less than the minimum charge.
C. Industrial waste surcharges.
(1) In the event that the City agrees to accept the discharge of an
industrial waste into the sewer system which has a biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD) concentration greater than 250 milligrams
per liter and/or a total suspended solids (SS) concentration greater

Sewer rentals and charges imposed by this part shall be payable on the
dates and shall cover the periods as follows:
than 250 milligrams per liter and/or a total nitrogen (TN)
concentration greater than 30 milligrams per liter and/or a total
phosphorous (TP) concentration greater than 10 milligrams per
liter, a surcharge as established by a resolution of the Lancaster
City Council shall be applicable for the BOD in excess of 250
milligrams per liter, SS in excess of 250 milligrams per liter, TN in
excess of 30 milligrams per liter and TP in excess of 10 milligrams
per liter.
(2) The surcharge shall be computed in accordance with the following
formula:
(a) BOD surcharge: Volume of discharge (gallons) x 0.00000834 x
rate1 x (quarterly average concentration - 250 mg/L)
(b) SS surcharge: Volume of discharge (gallons) x 0.00000834 x
rate1 x (quarterly average concentration - 250 mg/L)
(c) TN surcharge: Volume of discharge (gallons) x 0.00000834 x
rate1 x (quarterly average concentration - 30 mg/L)
(d) TP surcharge: Volume of discharge (gallons) x 0.00000834 x
rate1 x (quarterly average concentration - 10 mg/L)
1 Note: Rate is the charge established by resolution of the
Council of the City of Lancaster.
A. In the case of the owner of an improved property whose bill, under
provisions of this part, shall be computed, in whole or in part, upon the
basis of volume of water usage metered by the City's water system and
who shall be billed by the Water Bureau on a quarter annum basis, the
billing date shall be the same date and shall cover the same period as
shall be applicable to the billing of the Water Bureau.
B. Sewer rentals and charges shall be payable upon the date when the bill
is computed. That amount, computed in accordance with this part, shall
constitute the net bill. If sewer rentals and charges shall not be paid
within 30 calendar days after the date upon which such shall be
payable, interest at the rate of 6% per annum shall be charged until
payment shall be made. Payment made or mailed and postmarked on or
before the last day of such thirty-calendar-day period shall constitute
payment within such period. If the end of such thirty-calendar-day
period falls on a legal holiday or a Sunday, payment which shall be
made on, or mailed and postmarked on, the next succeeding weekday
which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment within such period.

for the delinquent bills and all other amounts due pursuant to the terms of
Chapter 36 and shall from time to time proceed to collect the bills or the
part thereof remaining unpaid according to law and all other amounts due
the City, including but not limited to accrued interest and penalties imposed
by law.
§ 249-32. Penalty for delinquency.
If any bill for sewer service or for water service or for both sewer and water
service is not paid within the due date on the bill, a finance charge shall
accrue monthly at the highest rate authorized by the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission regulations.
C. In the event that sewer rentals and charges imposed under provisions
of this part shall become applicable to any improved property
constituting a domestic establishment, commercial establishment or
industrial establishment during a billing period as set forth in
Subsection A hereof, or in the event that service to any improved
property constituting a domestic establishment, commercial
establishment or industrial establishment shall begin after the first day
or shall terminate before the last day of any billing period as set forth in
Subsection A hereof, sewer rentals and charges for such billing period
shall be applicable for the portion of the billing period.
D. Failure of any person to receive appropriate bills for sewer rentals and
charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment. Such failure
shall not result in an extension of the period of time during which the
net bill shall be payable.

B. Such extender shall cause such sewer main extension to be laid in
accordance with City specifications and at all times subject to City
inspection and approval and shall pay for the entire cost of such
extension, provided that if the City so elects, it may require the
extender to make the extension of pipe having a larger diameter than
the extender requires for his own use. If the City requires the extender
to lay a larger pipe than the extender requires, it shall pay the extender
the difference in the cost of the size pipe needed by the extender and
the size pipe prescribed by the City for such extension.
A. The term of the lease shall be for a period of no more than 10 years from
the time the line is placed in service.
B. The City shall maintain and operate the line, bearing all expense with
relation thereto, and collect sewage therein from its customers and
other parties connecting to the same.
C. The extender shall receive sewer services from the City by means of
such line and pay the City for the same at the published rates of the City
for such service which may be in effect from time to time during such
service. The customer shall be bound by all rules and regulations of the
City relating to sewer service.
D. Connection fee.
(1) During the term of such lease, while ownership of the line remains
in the extender, no other person shall be allowed to connect to such
§ 249-40 (RESERVED) § 249-42
243:661
§ 249-43. City extensions.
The City shall have the right at all times to make connections to the lines
of the extender and lay additional sewer mains at its own cost, without
the payment of any connection fee to the extender, provided that such
extensions and additions so made by the City are solely for the improvement
of its sewer service and no customers are connected thereto. If any
customer connections are made to any such additions made by the City, then
such lines shall be subject to the terms of the lease as if made by a private
extender.
§ 249-44. City contribution to cost.
In the event that the City makes a contribution towards the cost of laying
the sewer line, representing the difference in cost of the size of pipe
as contemplated in § 249-41, then such contribution shall be deemed to
represent as many linear feet of sewer line as the linear foot cost of the
entire line, and the City shall own the initial number of linear feet thus
represented, so that the line owned by the extender and leased to the City
line unless such person pays the extender a connection fee in
accordance with the Tariff.
(2) In all cases only sanitary sewage is to be put into such sewer line.
Any industrial discharges shall receive prior approval of the City.
All storm drainage of any kind is to be excluded.
E. In the case of another extender who wishes to connect to such sewer
main for the purposes of laying his own main to serve a number of
prospective customers therefrom, such other extender shall pay the
owner-lessor an amount which represents no more than 50% of the cost
of such sewer main up to the point of such connection after deducting
from such cost any connection fees already paid for connections to the
sewer line up to the point of connection. Such other extender shall not
be entitled to receive any connection fees for connections made to the
original line, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the line which he
himself pays for in accordance with a lease similar to that provided for
herein.
F. At no time shall the extender be entitled to recover more than the total
cost of the sewer line, calculated without interest. If such total cost has
been recovered prior to 10 years from the date when the line was
placed in service, the lease shall terminate at the time of the recovery of
such cost. If the total cost has not been recovered within 10 years from
the date when the line was placed in service, it shall terminate in all
events at the end of the ten-year period, and the right of the extender to
recover any more costs shall cease.
G. Upon termination of the lease, the extender shall dedicate the sewer
line to the City Sewer Authority and it shall thereupon become a part of
the sewer system owned by such Authority.
§ 249-42 LANCASTER CODE § 249-44
243:662
shall be deemed to start at the point where the initial number of linear feet
ends. (Example: A twelve-inch sewer line for 5,000 linear feet costs $50,000
or $10 per linear foot. The City contributes $15,000 for the difference in
cost between six-inch pipe and twelve-inch pipe. The City Sewer Authority
would own the initial 1,500 feet of twelve-inch sewer line and the remaining
3,500 feet would be owned by the extender and leased to the City as herein
provided.)
§ 249-45. Extension decisions.
The final decision on whether or not an extension to the sewer lines shall
be permitted on the conditions outlined herein or otherwise shall be and
remain with the City. The City Sewer Authority, which shall become the
ultimate owner of sewer lines extended as herein provided, shall be notified
of each lease agreement relating thereto and receive a copy thereof.

In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be minimum requirements. Wherever the requirements of this chapter are
at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations, ordinances, deed restrictions or covenants, the most
restrictive, or that imposing the highest standards, shall govern.

Article IX, Signs, of Chapter 300, Zoning, of the City Code is hereby
specifically repealed, as well as all ordinances or parts of ordinances
inconsistent herewith; provided that sign applications currently filed with
the Zoning Officer or for which permits have been issued prior to adoption
of this Chapter 255 shall be processed and reviewed under the Zoning
Ordinance sign regulations in place at the time of sign application.
However, the repeal shall in no manner be construed as a waiver, release
or relinquishment of the right to initiate, pursue or prosecute, as the case
may be, any proceeding at law or in equity, including criminal or civil
proceedings, pertaining to any act done which would have constituted
a violation of the ordinances or parts of ordinances repealed hereby, or
their applicable predecessor ordinances, and all provisions of said repealed
ordinances shall remain in full effect and force, and not repealed hereby, as

§ 255-10. Computation of sign size.
The maximum size permitted for individual signs is set forth in Article IV,
District Regulations. The area of an individual sign shall be the area of the
smallest rectangle, triangle, or circle that will encompass all elements of
the sign, such as letters, figures, symbols, designs, distinguishing colors,
or other display, exclusive of supporting structures, unless such supporting
structure is illuminated or is in the form of a symbol or contains advertising
copy, in which case the supporting structure shall be included in the size
computation. In the case of signs that have no definable edges, such as
raised letters attached to a building facade or letters and/or symbols
painted on a display window, the sign size shall be that area within a
single continuous rectangular, triangular, or circular perimeter enclosing
the extreme limits of the actual message or copy area and any artwork or
color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the
sign from the surface upon which it is placed or painted. For double-faced
signs with the identical message on both sides, only one display face shall
be measured in computing sign area, provided the sign faces are within one
foot of each other, except that sidewalk signs with back-to-back sign faces
connected at the apex shall have sign faces within 30 inches of each other
at the sign base. Double-faced signs with different messages on either side

A lot or lot with structures may have a combination of sign structures and
sign types, as defined herein in Article II, Definitions. However, in no case
shall the total area of all signs exceed the total permitted signage for the
lot in accordance with Article IV, District Regulations. For the purpose of
total permitted sign area on a lot, temporary signs, noncommercial signs,
and billboards shall not be counted in computing total square footage of
signage.
§ 255-12. Dimensions and locations.
The following regulations and prohibitions shall apply to the various sign

the side of the right-of-way and regardless of whether or not located on
the same property or in the same district or municipality, and shall be
no less than 100 feet from a residential district, except that in districts
where permitted, a billboard oriented toward U.S. Route 30 or U.S.
Route 283 may have two back-to-back sign faces at an angle not

other building elements project into the sidewalk, a sidewalk sign may
be placed in that area adjacent to the building, provided that the sign

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 260-101. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "The City of Lancaster
Stormwater Management (SWM) Ordinance."
§ 260-102. Statement of findings.
The Lancaster City Council finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood reduction efforts in
upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the City of Lancaster and all the
people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain cities to implement a
program of stormwater controls. These cities are required to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their municipal separate storm
sewer systems (MS4) under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
E. Riparian forest buffers enhance water quality by filtering pollutants in
runoff, providing light control and temperature moderation, processing
pollutants, increasing infiltration and providing channel and shoreline
stability thus decreasing erosion (DEP Riparian Forest Buffer Guidance,
November 27, 2010).
F. Much of the City is served by a combined sewer system that collects
and transports both domestic sewage and rainwater that flows from
impervious surfaces such as roofs, streets, and parking lots. The City's
Advanced Wastewater Treatment Facility is normally able to manage
and clean the volume of wastewater flowing through the combined
sewer system; however, during intense rainstorms and other wet
weather events, the system becomes overwhelmed, causing untreated
wastewater to overflow into the Conestoga River. These events are
referred to as "combined sewer overflows."
§ 260-101 SKATEBOARDS § 260-103
256:721
§ 260-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the City of Lancaster by minimizing the damages described in § 260-102 of
this chapter through provisions designed to:
§ 260-104. Statutory authority.
A. Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at
their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.
C. Encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent
degradation of groundwater quality.
D. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams, watercourses and water
conveyance facilities in the City of Lancaster and the commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management best management practices (SWM BMPs) that are
Implemented within the City.
G. Provide performance standards and design criteria for watershed-wide
stormwater management and planning.

been installed as provided in the approved SWM site plan, the Planning
Commission of the City of Lancaster is hereby granted the power to
enforce any corporate bond or other security by appropriate legal and
equitable remedies. If proceeds of such bond or other security are
insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or corrections
to all the SWM facilities covered by said security, the Planning
Commission of the City of Lancaster may, at its option, install part of
such SWM facilities and may institute appropriate legal or equitable
action to recover the monies necessary to complete the remainder of
the SWM facilities. All of the proceeds, whether resulting from the
security or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
applicant, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the SWM
facilities covered by such security, and not for any other City purpose.

A higher ratio may be approved by the City of Lancaster if
justification is provided. Hydraulic depth may be used as an
alternative to an area-based loading ratio if the design
hydraulic depth is shown to be less than the depth that could
result from the maximum area loading ratio.
(d) Irrespective of Subsection A(2)(c) above, when existing karst
conditions, as determined by the City Engineer, do not allow
for the installation of infiltration BMPs, the design volume of
stormwater runoff shall be kept out of the combined sewer
system and detained on site until the overflow event subsides.
B. Volume control for small projects.
(1) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces or
an equivalent volume shall be permanently removed from the
runoff flow, that is, it shall not be released into the surface waters
of the commonwealth or combined sewer system. Removal options
include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
§ 260-303 SKATEBOARDS § 260-303
256:747
§ 260-304. Rate controls.
Rate control for large storms, up to the one-hundred-year event, is essential
to protect against immediate downstream erosion and flooding. (See
Appendix D for the Release Rate Map.)200
C. If required by the Director, a detailed geologic evaluation of the
development site shall be performed in areas of carbonate geology to
determine the design parameters of recharge facilities. A report shall
be prepared in accordance with § 260-405A of this chapter.
D. Storage facilities, including normally dry, open-top facilities, shall
completely drain the volume control storage over a period of time not
less than 24 hours and not more than 72 hours from the end of the
design storm. Any designed infiltration at such facilities is exempt from
the minimum twenty-four-hour standard, that is, may infiltrate in a
shorter period of time, provided that none of this water will be
discharged into waters of the commonwealth or combined sewer
system.
E. Any portion of the volume control storage that meets the following
criteria may also be used as rate control storage:
(1) Volume control storage that depends on infiltration is designed
according to the infiltration standards in § 260-301.
(2) The volume control storage which will be used for rate control is
that storage which is available within 24 hours from the end of the
design storm based on the stabilized infiltration rate and/or the
evapotranspiration rate.
F. Volume control storage facilities designed to infiltrate shall avoid the
least permeable hydrologic soil group(s) at the development site.
A. Match predevelopment hydrograph. Applicants shall provide
infiltration facilities or utilize other techniques which will allow the
postdevelopment one-hundred-year hydrograph to match the
predevelopment one-hundred-year hydrograph, along all parts of the
hydrograph, for the development site. To match the predevelopment
hydrograph, the postdevelopment peak rate must be less than or equal
to the predevelopment peak rate, and the postdevelopment runoff
volume must be less than or equal to the predevelopment volume for
the same storm event. A shift in hydrograph peak time of up to five
minutes and a rate variation of up to 5% at a given time may be
allowable to account for the timing effect of BMPs used to manage the
peak rate and runoff volume. "Volume control" volumes as given in
§ 260-303 above may be used as part of this option.
B. Where the predevelopment hydrograph cannot be matched, one of the
following shall apply:

(1) For areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act
167 plan: Postdevelopment discharge rates shall not exceed the
predevelopment discharge rates for the two-, ten-, twenty-five-,
fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storm events.* If it is
shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the
postdevelopment analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the predevelopment analysis for two-, ten-,
twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storms,* then the requirements of this section have been met.

Method storm. See Table III-1.
C. Normally dry, open-top storage facilities shall completely drain the rate
control storage over a period of time less than or equal to 24 hours from
the peak one-hundred-year water surface design elevation.
D. A variety of BMPs should be employed and tailored to suit the
development site. Nonstructural BMPs and green infrastructure are
preferred. The following is a partial listing of BMPs which can be
utilized in SWM systems for rate control where appropriate:

G. For the purpose of calculating predevelopment peak discharges, all
runoff coefficients, both on site and off site, shall be based on actual
land use assuming summer or good land conditions. Postdevelopment
runoff coefficients for off-site discharges used to design conveyance
facilities shall be based on actual land use assuming winter or poor land
conditions.
H. Criteria and assumptions to be used in the determination of stormwater
runoff and design of management facilities are as follows:
(1) Runoff coefficients shall be based on the information contained in
Appendixes B-1 and B-2 if the actual land use is listed in those
appendixes. If the actual land use is not listed in these appendixes,
runoff coefficients shall be chosen from other published
documentation, and a copy of said documentation shall be
submitted with the SWM site plan.203
(2) A sample worksheet for calculating Tc is provided in Appendix B-4.
Times of concentration (Tc) shall be based on the following design
parameters:
(a) Sheet flow. The maximum length for each reach of sheet or
overland flow before shallow concentrated or open channel
flow develops is 150 feet. Flow lengths greater than 100 feet
shall be justified based on the actual conditions at each
development site. Sheet flow may be determined using the
nomograph in Appendix B-3 or the Manning's kinematic
solution shown in the sheet flow section of Worksheet No. 1 in
Appendix B-4.
(b) Shallow concentrated flow. Travel time for shallow
concentrated flow shall be determined using Figure 3-1 from
TR-55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, as shown in
Appendix B-5.
(c) Open channel flows. At points where sheet and shallow
concentrated flows concentrate in field depressions, swales,
gutters, curbs, or pipe collection systems, the travel times to
downstream end of the development site between these design
points shall be based upon Manning's Equation and/or
acceptable engineering design standards as determined by the
Municipal Engineer.
(3) The applicant may use stormwater credits for nonstructural BMPs
in accordance with the BMP Manual. The allowable reduction will
be determined by the City of Lancaster.
(4) Peak rate control is not required for off-site runoff. Off-site runoff
may be bypassed around the site provided all other discharge
requirements are met. If off-site runoff is routed through rate

plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of
the site.
D. The riparian corridor easement shall be enforceable by the City of
Lancaster and shall be recorded in the Lancaster County Recorder of
Deeds Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of
the property located therein. The easement shall allow for the
continued private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot
area as required by zoning, unless otherwise specified in the City
Zoning Ordinance.
E. Any permitted use within the riparian corridor easement shall be
conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing onehundred-
year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and
preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain and shall
be in accordance with the provisions of all applicable City codes and
ordinances, including but not limited to Chapter 109, Building
Construction and Floodplain Management, and Chapter 300, Zoning.
F. The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private
recreation trails are permitted within riparian corridors:
(1) Trails shall be for nonmotorized use only.
(2) Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant
species and other sensitive environmental features.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FEE
GENERAL REFERENCES
Stormwater management  See Ch. 260.
§ 261-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "City of Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, Stormwater Management Fee Ordinance."
§ 261-2. Statement of findings.
A. The City of Lancaster owns, operates, and maintains stormwater
management facilities;
B. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff throughout
a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams
and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to
convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management
and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities,
reduces groundwater recharge and threatens public health and safety;
C. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff throughout
a watershed can harm surface water resources by changing the natural
hydrologic patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour
and erosion of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating
sedimentation), destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge; stormwater is an important water resource
which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow
of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality;
D. A comprehensive program of stormwater management is fundamental
to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the
residents of the City of Lancaster, their resources and the environment
in order to control items such as flooding, erosion and pollution;
E. The collection and conveyance system for stormwater includes
underground pipes, but also includes conduits, inlets, culverts, catch
basins, gutters, ditches, channels, detention ponds, streets, curbs and
drains;
F. The nature of stormwater is that any system to control stormwater must
be designed for and funds must be expended to control peak flow, total
runoff volume and pollution in the stormwater;
§ 260-1001 LANCASTER CODE § 261-2
256:778
G. These three factors all relate to and are driven by impervious surface;
once property is developed, peak flow, runoff volume and pollution all
increase greatly;
H. Peak flow occurs most often during periods of intense rainfall and/or
when the ground is saturated (can accept no more water) or is arid
(concrete-like surface resulting from overly dry conditions);
I. Because of the effect of weather on stormwater (e.g., extended dry or
wet periods), no developed property can always accept all stormwater,
and all developed properties therefore generate stormwater runoff;
J. In a developed, urban environment such as the City of Lancaster, each
developed property generates runoff and therefore uses or is in some
fashion connected with, serviced by or benefited by the stormwater
sewerage system, which normally functions by collecting stormwater
from a property and/or by preventing stormwater from entering
another property;
K. Stormwater is heavily polluted when there has not been rain for a
period of time, and sediment, yard waste, animal waste, pesticides,
herbicides, oil and grease can be found in stormwater;
L. Impervious surface is a primary indicator of the generation of
stormwater and usage of the stormwater sewerage system;
M. The effects of stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream base flow and aquatic
ecosystems;
N. Federal and state regulations require the City of Lancaster to
implement a program of stormwater controls;
O. On October 23, 2012, the Green Infrastructure Advisory Committee
presented a report to the City of Lancaster on "Impervious Area Fee
Policy Options and Recommendations," which summarized the City's
stormwater program needs and policy options for funding those
program needs.
P. The City is facing numerous drivers requiring changes to the way it
manages urban stormwater runoff, all of which are addressed in the
City's Green Infrastructure (GI) Plan. These drivers include increased
regulatory requirements for managing the quantity and quality of
stormwater runoff, as well as maintenance requirements to ensure
facilities are kept in working order with appropriate repair and
replacement;
Q. The report concluded that the City of Lancaster formed a Green
Infrastructure Advisory Committee to advise the City on options to
manage stormwater and options to fund those stormwater management
obligations;
§ 261-2 SKATEBOARDS § 261-2
256:779
§ 261-3. Definitions.
R. The Green Infrastructure Advisory Committee worked with City staff to
define those program needs, level of service and costs and evaluated
alternative funding options that support the need for a dedicated
funding source and recommended creation of an impervious-area-based
fee, referred to as the "stormwater management fee," that would be
paid by all City properties in direct proportion to the amount of
impervious area that is on their property using a system of tiers as
presented in this chapter. In addition, the Committee recommended
that the City establish a system of credits to incentivize property
owners to build and maintain stormwater management systems on their
property;
S. The Committee's recommendations to charge a fee are based on a
lengthy review and analysis of the real costs associated with the
management and maintenance of the stormwater management system;
T. The fee recommended by the Committee is intended to recoup such
costs and is based upon the determination that the City of Lancaster
has no other means by which those costs can be recouped;
U. City Council accepts and concurs with the recommendations and
findings of the Committee; and
V. City Council is aware that it has been granted by the Pennsylvania
General Assembly by and through the Third Class City Code and the
Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, and other legislation and
through decisions of the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
the power, the duty and the obligation to regulate and manage
stormwater within the City and to recoup costs associated with such
regulation and management from the owners of properties impacting
the City of Lancaster's stormwater system.

§ 261-4. Imposition of stormwater management fee.209
For the purposes set forth above, a stormwater management fee ("fee")
as described, defined, and calculated herein is hereby imposed upon each
property within the City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the properties
described in "Exhibit A" hereto which are properties that are owned by the
City of Lancaster and which are not related to the City's use of enterprise

sell any such exempt properties, the properties would no longer be exempt,
and the new property owner would be responsible for compliance with all
terms of this chapter related to such properties.
§ 261-5. Tiers of properties.
For purposes of determining the appropriate assessment rate for the
stormwater management fee, all properties that are subject to the

petition for appeal, as set by resolution of the City Council, are on file in the City offices.
210. Editors Note: The most current list of exempt properties is on file in the City offices.
§ 261-3 SKATEBOARDS § 261-6
256:783
§ 261-7. Establishment and calculation of fee.
B. In the first year of the assessment of the stormwater management fee,
all properties will be issued an assessment notice by the City of
Lancaster with the property's estimated fee and the basis of that fee.
(This initial assessment notice may be issued by the City prior to the
effective date of this chapter.) In subsequent years, only newly
developed properties or properties where the impervious surface has
been modified will be issued assessment notices.
C. The City of Lancaster will include the fee as a separate line item on the
water and/or sewer utility bill for each property subject to the fee. For
those properties, without a water and/or sewer account with the City of
Lancaster, the fee will be charged and invoiced on a separate
stormwater management fee bill/invoice. In both cases, the fee must be
paid in the same manner and within the time frame required for
payment of water and/or sewer bills.
D. A property owner whose property is subject to the fee may delegate
responsibility for the payment of the fee to customers and/or property
management companies in the same manner as payment responsibility
for water and/or sewer bills is so delegated and as further set forth in
the policies and procedures to be adopted from time to time by the
Director.
E. Should the fee not be paid when due, a finance charge shall accrue
thereon monthly at the same rate as finance charges accrue on unpaid
City of Lancaster water and/or sewer bills.
F. The City of Lancaster shall deposit all payments collected under this
section into the City Stormwater Management Fund.
A. The stormwater management fee shall be based on a percentage of the
base rate, as follows:
(1) Tier 0: The fee for each Tier 0 property is zero.
(2) Tier 1: The fee for each Tier 1 property is 50% of the applicable
base rate.
(3) Tier 2: The fee for each Tier 2 property is 150% of the applicable
base rate.
(4) Tier 3: The fee for each Tier 3 property is 250% of the applicable
base rate.
(5) Tier 4: The fee for each Tier 4 property is calculated as the number
of base units assigned to the property in accordance with the
following procedure: The Director determines the number of base
units for a Tier 4 property by dividing the property's actual
impervious surface area by the base unit.

256:784
§ 261-8. Establishment and administration of Stormwater
Management Fund.
§ 261-9. Stormwater water credits.
B. The Director computes the stormwater management fee by multiplying
the number of base units assigned to the property by the base rate.
C. The base rate utilized by the Director shall be the base rate as
established from time to time by resolution of City Council in
accordance with the provisions of § 261-3A, definition of "base rate," of
this chapter.
D. If the property is a condominium property, the Director may calculate
the stormwater management fee to be billed in equal shares to the
condominium unit owners by dividing the total number of base units by
the number of individual condominium units and then multiplying that
by the base rate to determine the amount billable to each condominium
unit owner or in such other manners as may be promulgated by the
Director in policies and procedures based on square footage, types of
condominium units or other similar classification and calculations.
A. All sums collected from the payment of stormwater management fees
shall be deposited into the City of Lancaster's Stormwater Management
Fund.
B. The Stormwater Management Fund shall be used by the City solely for
i) the implementation and management of stormwater program; ii)
constructing, operating, and maintenance of stormwater facilities; and
iii) payment for other project costs and performance of other functions
or duties authorized by law in conjunction with the maintenance,
operation, repair, construction, design, planning and management of
stormwater facilities, programs and operations. All stormwater
facilities shall be operated in accordance with all applicable laws. The
Director shall have all reasonable and lawful authority to construct,
operate, repair, relocate and maintain the stormwater facilities and
shall have the authority to enforce the provisions of this chapter.
A. The City may provide a system of credits against stormwater
management fees for properties on which stormwater facility
construction or maintenance substantially mitigates the peak discharge
or runoff pollution flowing from such properties or substantially
decreases the City's cost of maintaining the public stormwater system.
The Director will develop written policies to implement the credit
system. The amount of credit for maintenance may be limited to
properties that have a specified minimum impervious surface area.
Such system of credits may be set forth from time to time by the
Director in the policies and procedures promulgated hereunder.
B. The above credits are provided in recognition of the use and utility of
the above properties as corridors with independently, regularly

improved and maintained stormwater management systems that pass
through numerous private and public properties and that collect and
control the drainage through those properties.
C. The Director may issue a maximum credit to a property owner as
specified in the application provided by the Department if the property
contains a City stormwater management system and the system is
maintained in accordance with the maintenance requirements of the
Department.
D. Credit application schedule.
(1) To receive a credit, the property owner must apply to the Director
in a form prescribed by the Director not later than October 31 of
the year before payment of the fee is due.
(2) Once approved, the credit is valid for two years. To renew the
credit, the property owner must reapply to the Director in a form
prescribed by the Director not later than October 31 of the year
before payment of the fee is due.
(3) The credit shall become effective on the first day of the property's
monthly or quarterly billing cycle following the approval of the
credit.
E. Appeals. The property owner may appeal the Director's decision
regarding the issuance or nonissuance of a credit within 30 days after
that decision to the Board of Appeals. All such appeals shall be in
accordance with § 261-11 of this chapter.
A. Within 30 days of the date of any assessment, a property owner may file
a petition for review and/or adjustment to the Director in writing if the
property owner believes that the property which is the subject of the
assessment has been improperly tiered or that the fee has been
calculated incorrectly.
B. When submitting a petition for review and/or adjustment of the fee as
set forth above, the property owner must include a detailed statement
of the basis for the appeal and documents supporting the owner's
assertion that the property should be assigned to a different tier or that
the impervious area measurements used to calculate the number of
base units for the property are incorrect.
C. When submitting a petition for appeal of a denial of calculation of a
credit, the property owner must include a detailed statement of the
basis for appeal along with any documents necessary to support the
appeal and pay any fees established by resolution of City Council for the
handling of such appeals.

not later than 30 days after receipt of the Director's denial of the
property owner's petition for adjustments/reconsideration.
B. When submitting a petition for appeal of the assessment of the fee as
set forth above, the property owner must include a detailed statement
of the basis for the appeal and documents supporting the owner's
assertion that the property should be assigned to a different Tier, or
that the impervious area measurements used to calculate the number of
base units for the property are incorrect, and pay any fee established by
resolution of City Council for the handling of appeals.
C. If the Appeals Board concludes that the appeal should be granted, the
City of Lancaster must submit an adjustment to the property owner's
bill and refund any overpayment for the current levy year to the
property owner or apply a credit on the subsequent bill equal to the
adjustment amount.

damage was caused by the permit holder's construction,
installation, operation, maintenance or removal of permittee's
system or facilities in the rights-of-way. The obligation to indemnify,

time not to exceed 60 days after receiving a complete application
hereunder, the City shall make a determination approving or
denying the application. Determinations to grant or deny an
application shall be made on a nondiscriminatory and competitively
neutral basis. If the application is denied, the determination shall
include the reasons for denial. The application fee, which shall be
paid at the time of the filing of the application, shall be as fixed

for the benefit of its citizens, it is the responsibility of the City to
ensure that such rights-of-way meet the highest possible public
safety standards. As such, the City needs to be informed regarding
the placement of all facilities within the rights-of-way, including
those positioned aerially and underground. Each person applying
for a ROW use permit shall submit to the Department two paper
copies and one electronic copy of as-built map or maps and
engineering specifications as set forth in the Policies and
Procedures depicting and certifying the location of all its existing
facilities within the right-of-way. Such electronic and paper maps
and engineering specifications shall be submitted in a format and

maps are not provided electronically in the required format, then
the person shall reimburse the City for the cost of converting paper
maps into electronic form or the cost of converting electronic maps
in another format into the required format. Such maps are, and
shall remain, confidential documents and are exempt from public
disclosure under Pennsylvania's Right to Know Law, 65 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 708. After submission of the as-built maps required under this
section, each permittee having facilities in the City rights-of-way
shall update such maps as required under this chapter.

such facilities, other facilities, the rights-of-way and any other
public or private property and to determine compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable laws and regulations.
Permittees are required to cooperate with all such inspections and
to provide information requested by the City as part of the
inspection.
(9) Use authorized. No ROW use permit shall confer any exclusive
right or privilege to occupy or use the right-of-way for any purpose;
or explicitly or impliedly preclude or affect the City's right to
authorize use of the right-of-way by other persons to own,
construct, operate, maintain, and/or provide the same or different
facilities or services, or for any other purposes as the City
determines appropriate; or affect the City's right to construct,
operate or maintain any type of facilities itself or offer any type of
services in the right-of-way; or authorize or excuse any person from
securing such further easements, leases, permits or other
approvals as may be required by applicable law or regulation to
occupy and use the right-of-way; or convey any right, title or
interest in any right-of-way greater or other than an agreement
only to use and occupy the right-of-way for the limited purposes
and terms provided in the ROW use permit; or be construed as any
warranty of title.
(10) Owner's consent. No ROW use permit expressly or impliedly
authorizes a permittee to provide any services to, or install any
facilities on, any private property without the owner's consent or to
use publicly or privately owned poles, ducts or conduits without a
separate agreement with the owners thereof for such use.
(11) Substantially similar terms. ROW use permits and renewals
entered into after the effective date of this chapter shall contain
substantially similar terms which, taken as a whole upon
consideration of all of its material terms and upon consideration of
the nature of the services to be authorized and other relevant
characteristics of applicants, do not provide substantially more or
less favorable terms and conditions than those required of other
permittees.

effective date of this chapter to file one or more applications for a
ROW use authorization. Any entity timely filing such an application
shall not be subject to penalties for failure to hold such a ROW use
authorization, provided that said application remains pending.
Nothing herein shall relieve any person of any liability for its failure
to obtain any permit or other authorization required under other

City Code. No person shall perform curb and sidewalk construction
replacement or repair without first obtaining a curb and sidewalk

provide information requested by the City as part of the inspection.
(5) Recently constructed streets. No street opening permit shall be
issued to cut any City street that was constructed, reconstructed or
resurfaced fewer than three years prior to application for a street
opening permit, unless the applicant agrees in writing to overlay or
pave the surface of the street, from curb to curb and intersection to

of all inspection, permitting, enforcement, and other ROW
management activities.
(2) Annual right-of-way maintenance fee. Each permittee that is not a
franchisee, including City ROW permittees, shall pay an annual fee
to the City to compensate the City for its costs incurred in
connection with the ongoing use and occupancy of the right-of-way.

Common Pleas for an injunction or other appropriate relief at law
or in equity to enforce compliance with or restrain violation of any
provision of this chapter.
B. Determination of violation. In the event a determination is made that a
person has violated any provision of this chapter or right-of-way use
permit, such person shall be provided written notice of the
determination and the reasons therefor. Except in the case of an
emergency, the person shall have 30 days to cure the violation. If the
nature of the violation is such that it cannot be fully cured within such
time period, the City may, in its reasonable judgment, extend the time
period to cure, provided that the person has commenced to cure and is
diligently pursuing its efforts to cure. If the violation has not been cured
within the time allowed, the City may take any and all actions
authorized by this chapter and/or Pennsylvania law and regulations.
A. Proprietary information. If a person considers information it is
obligated to provide to the City under this chapter to be a business or
trade secret or otherwise proprietary or confidential in nature and
desires to protect the information from disclosure, then the person shall
mark such information as proprietary and confidential. Subject to the
requirements of the Right to Know Act of 2009, 65 P.S. § 67.101 et seq.,
as amended, and other applicable law, the City shall exercise
reasonable good faith efforts to protect such proprietary and
confidential information that is so marked from disclosure. The City
shall provide notice to the person in the following circumstances: i) if
the City receives a request for disclosure of such proprietary and
confidential information and the City Solicitor determines that the
information is or may be subject to disclosure under applicable law; or
ii) if the City Solicitor determines that the information should be
disclosed in relation to its enforcement of this chapter or the exercise of
its police or regulatory powers. In the event the person does not obtain
a protective order barring disclosure of the information from a court of
§ 263-4 SKATEBOARDS § 263-5
256:847
competent jurisdiction within 30 days following receipt of the City's
notice, then the City may disclose the information without further
notice to the person.
B. Leased facilities. Subject to the provisions of this chapter and with prior
written approval of the City, a non-PUC-regulated entity shall have the
right to furnish any facilities for which it has the applicable
authorization to own, construct, operate and/or maintain in the right-ofway
to another person for the latter's use in constructing or operating
its own facilities in the right-of-way, provided that:
(1) The entity furnishing its facilities to another shall first deliver to the
City notice that there is a fully signed and executed lease, rental
agreement, or other agreement with such other person pursuant to
which the facilities are to be furnished; and
(2) The person to which the facilities are furnished shall comply with
all of the requirements of this chapter and other applicable policies
and procedures.

the City, each permittee shall furnish the City with information
sufficient to demonstrate the following: that the permittee has complied
with all requirements of this chapter; that all fees and taxes due the
City in connection with the services and facilities provided by the
permittee have been properly paid by the permittee; and any other
information reasonably related to the permittee's obligations pursuant
to this chapter.
D. Right to inspect records. The City shall have the right, upon 30 days'
written notice and during normal business hours, to inspect all
documents, records, maps and other pertinent information maintained
by the permittee that relate directly to the terms and conditions of this
chapter.
E. No substitute for other required permissions. No ROW use
authorization or ROW use permit includes, means, or is in whole or part
a substitute for any other permit or authorization required by the laws
and regulations of the City for the privilege of transacting and carrying
on a business within the City or any permit or agreement for occupying
any other property of the City.
F. No waiver. The failure of the City to insist on timely performance or
compliance by any permittee holding a right-of-way use authorization
shall not constitute a waiver of the City's right to later insist on timely
performance or compliance by that permittee or any other permittee
holding such a right-of-way use authorization. The failure of the City to
enforce any provision of this chapter on any occasion shall not operate
as a waiver or estoppel of its right to enforce any provision of this
chapter on any other occasion, nor shall the failure to enforce any prior
ordinance or City Charter provision affecting the right-of-way, any
facilities, or any user or occupant of the right-of-way act as a waiver or

the power to modify any provisions of this chapter as may be necessary
in the public interest as follows:
(1) Where the developer can show that the strict application of any
provision of this chapter is unreasonable or will cause undue

Pre-Application Sketch Plan
§ 265-16. Purpose.
The pre-application sketch plan process is intended to provide informal
opportunities to discuss issues related to design, function, conformity with
codes, compatibility with the Comprehensive Plan and plan processing
procedures, public meeting dates and other requirements prior to formal
submission of the plan. Where pre-application sketch plan review by the
Commission occurs, interested citizens will have the opportunity to
comment at the Commission's public meeting, and the Commission may
provide input to other boards and commissions of the City that will be
involved in the review process. An applicant who elects to take advantage of
the optional pre-application sketch plan process, may, subject to City staff
or Commission review as per § 265-17 or § 265-18, be permitted to proceed
to a final plan submission and skip the preliminary plan phase/processing
requirements.
§ 265-17. Pre-application conference.
A. At the request of the applicant, a pre-application conference shall be
scheduled to allow the applicant to meet with appropriate
representatives of the City. Representatives may include, among others,
Planning staff, Public Works staff, Zoning Officer, Fire Marshal, Building
Official and Bureau of Police representative.
B. Applicants seeking a pre-application conference are encouraged to
submit the information stipulated in § 265-19 at least 10 days prior to
the conference meeting in order to allow time for staff to review the
application and identify issues that will be discussed with the applicant.
C. The applicant and City shall not be bound by the results of any preapplication
plan review.
D. Subdivision and/or land development plans exceeding the thresholds of
§ 265-22 may skip the preliminary plan submission requirements for
nonphased projects provided that a pre-application sketch plan is
submitted to the Planning Bureau for review and comment where
scheduling, process and other issues may be discussed. In addition, the
Planning Bureau may schedule the sketch plan for review by other City
staff. Following the review of the sketch plan, the applicant shall
address any concerns to the satisfaction of the City. Once the City is
satisfied that issues have been addressed, the applicant will be
permitted to file a final plan application without the need to ask the
Commission for a waiver of the preliminary plan process. Should the
applicant fail or choose not to address issues raised by staff, the
applicant shall forfeit the right to proceed to final plan and the
application shall be filed with the Planning Commission as a preliminary
plan or the applicant may file a waiver request with the Commission
seeking relief of the preliminary plan filing requirements.

ARTICLE V
No-Impact, Minor and Preliminary Plan Procedures and
Requirements
§ 265-20. No-impact subdivision and land development.
A subdivision or land development plan shall not be required where it
can be demonstrated to the Planning Bureau that the initial or cumulative
impact of the activity or improvement will not result in the need for plan
approvals typically associated with a subdivision or land development plan
approval process. Although a plan submission as per this chapter is not
required, approvals under the Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 300, Stormwater
Management Ordinance, Chapter 260, or other City ordinances may be
applicable. In addition, a subdivision plan shall not be required for the
joining of two or more contiguous lots of record into one lot where no site
improvements are planned that would otherwise be cause for preparing a
plan. Applicants undertaking projects not exceeding the thresholds below
may request a waiver of preliminary and final plan filing requirements as
per MPC Section 503(8) and in accordance with § 265-12.
A. No-impact subdivision shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Corrections to bearings and distances as a result of new survey
data or a boundary line agreement that corrects previous errors.
B. No-impact land development shall include, but not be limited to, the
construction of accessory buildings and building additions with
footprints of not more than 400 square feet, whether initially or
cumulatively, and the division of land or space between or among two or
more existing or prospective occupants, provided that the construction
or division of land or space does not result in the following:
(1) Installation of new access drives providing vehicular access to or
from a public right-of-way;
(2) Activities that would require the submission of a stormwater
management site plan, excluding small projects and very small
projects, as defined in the Stormwater Management Ordinance,
Chapter 260;
(3) Development within flood-prone areas;
(4) An increase in water consumption or sewage discharge exceeding
350 gallons per day;
(5) Changes to utility services including new service laterals to
increase capacity or provide fire protection.
(6) Vertical expansions of more than two stories above existing
structures;
(7) A requirement of additional parking;
§ 265-20 SKATEBOARDS § 265-20
256:871
§ 265-21. Minor plan submission and recording requirements.
(8) Impacts of development meeting any of the thresholds set forth in
§ 265-26D(4).
A. A minor plan shall be submitted for a proposed land development or
subdivision following a pre-application conference with City staff, as
per § 265-21B, and in accordance with the following requirements.
(1) A minor plan shall have all of the required plan information of a
combined preliminary/final plan. In addition, the plan will contain
the appropriate recording certificates, including plan preparer
certificates of accuracy, property ownership certificate, Lancaster
County Planning Commission review certificate, and Planning
Bureau approval certificate.
(2) Minor plans shall be submitted to the Planning Bureau, which will
obtain review comments of other City staff as needed during a
forty-five-day review and comment period following plan
submission.
(3) Applicants submitting minor plans shall provide evidence of zoning
approval, or shall have filed an appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board
for any necessary approvals. Unconditional approval of a minor
plan shall not be granted prior to the issuance of zoning approvals.
(4) At the discretion of the Lancaster County Planning Commission
(hereinafter "LCPC") minor plans will be reviewed administratively,
as authorized by Lancaster City Council with the adoption of
Administration Resolution No. 24 - 2008 and in accordance with
procedures established by LCPC.
(5) All accepted applications shall be reviewed and receive
administrative approval, conditional approval or denial within 45
calendar days of plan submission. An exception to the forty-five-day
stipulation for the City may occur only when the applicant has
agreed in writing to an extension of time. Acceptance of conditions
by applicants shall be in accordance with § 265-23B(4)(a) and (b).
Plans receiving unconditional approval shall be recorded upon
signing of the Planning Bureau certificate. No site improvements
shall be installed prior to unconditional approval and recording of
the plan.
(6) The applicant shall have one year to meet any conditions of plan
approval. Failure to submit a revised plan which complies with all
conditions within the aforesaid time period shall serve as a
rejection of the conditions by the applicant and serve to
automatically rescind the plan approval.
(7) Upon determination that all conditions of administrative
conditional approval have been met, the Chief Planner shall advise
§ 265-20 LANCASTER CODE § 265-21
256:872
the applicant that the minor plan conditions have been satisfied
and that the plan may be recorded.
B. Minor plans will be processed by City staff and not the Commission. In
order for the City to accept an application as a minor plan, the applicant

Ordinance,222 or where Zoning Hearing Board approval has been
granted involving changes to a lot line and where no additional lot
is being created.
(4) Minor adjustments to easements and street rights-of-way.
(5) A minor amendment to a previously recorded plan prior to
completion of the project and/or release of any financial guarantee,
where site improvements have been or will be made, provided the
amendment does not cause the following:
(a) An increase in building coverage, as defined by City Code
Chapter 300, Zoning, greater than 400 square feet.
(b) An increase in impervious surface, as defined by City Code
Chapter 260, Stormwater Management, equal to or greater
than 1,000 square feet.

submitting a minor plan:
(1) The City submittal shall consist of three paper copies of the plan,
one copy of which shall be signed by the landowner as per
§ 265-26D(3)(g), two copies of any reports or supplemental
information, a completed City plan application and plan application
fee.
(2) The County submittal shall be in accordance with LCPC
requirements.
(3) Prior to submitting the plan to the LCPC, the applicant shall
schedule a meeting with the Planning Bureau, at which time the
plan will receive an initial technical review. City technical review
comments will be included in the applicant's submission to LCPC.
(4) Upon satisfying any comments provided by the City, the applicant
shall provide signed and sealed drawings consisting of one mylar
and three paper sets of plans along with two copies of any
documents which are to be recorded. A digital copy of the plan shall
be submitted in a format acceptable to the LCPC. Two digital copies
of the plan and documents to be recorded shall also be provided to
the City.
D. The minor plan process shall not obligate the City to mail written
comments or notices as would be the case for plans reviewed by the
Planning Commission. The signing of the Planning Bureau certificate on
the approved plan will serve as notification of plan approval and
satisfaction of all conditions.
A. Upon submission of a written request and/or sketch plan application,
the Chief Planner shall have the authority to waive the requirement of a
preliminary plan submission for subdivision or land development plans
meeting criteria set forth below. The applicant shall provide written
justification for the modification request and applicable fee in
accordance with § 265-12 of this chapter. Upon determination that the
purpose of the preliminary plan submission is not being circumvented,
§ 265-21 LANCASTER CODE § 265-22
256:874
§ 265-23. Preliminary plan submission procedures.
the Chief Planner, with the concurrence of the City Engineer, shall

(1) Subdivisions containing 10 or fewer lots.
(2) Land developments containing 10 or fewer nonresidential units of
occupancy.
(3) Conversion of an existing nonresidential building into not more
than 40 residential units. However, the preliminary plan
submission requirement shall not be waived by the Chief Planner if

added vehicle trips (inbound plus outbound) during the site's peak
traffic hour.
(4) A plan where no change in the location of existing access drives or
the installation of new access drives is proposed unless the access
drive has first received approval of the Traffic Commission.
(5) Projects that will not generate additional sewage flow requiring
approval of a planning module by the DEP.
(6) Projects that will not cause a change to the City's Official Map or
require an action of the City Council concerning air rights, lease or
other agreements.
(7) Projects that meet the requirements of the Stormwater
Management Ordinance.223
(8) The project is not a flexible residential development, as defined and
as regulated by the City of Lancaster Zoning Ordinance.224

(10) The project has received zoning approval.
(11) The applicant has received a certificate of appropriateness
pursuant to the Historic District Ordinance or the Heritage

B. The final plan submission shall include all of the data and information
as required by this chapter.
A. At the time of submission of a preliminary plan to the Commission, the
applicant shall submit the plan to LCPC with the required LCPC
application form and fee. The applicant shall also submit the plan to
other relevant regulatory agencies for review and comment. No action
on the preliminary plan shall be taken by the Commission until the
223. Editor's Note: See Ch. 260, Stormwater Management.
224. Editor's Note: See Ch. 300, Zoning.
§ 265-22 SKATEBOARDS § 265-23
256:875
LCPC report has been received or until the expiration of 30 days from
the date the application was forwarded to the LCPC. All accepted
applications shall be reviewed and final action taken by the Commission
within 90 calendar days of the Commission's next regularly scheduled
public meeting following the date the application was filed and
accepted or the final order of court remanding an application. An
exception to the ninety-day requirement for the Commission to take
final action occurs only when the applicant has agreed in writing to an
extension of time.
B. The steps below shall be followed during the preliminary plan process:
(1) Only applications consisting of the following shall be accepted:
(a) City review: Three or more paper copies of the plan, one copy
of which shall be signed by the landowner as per
§ 265-26D(3)(g), two copies of all reports, and 12 copies of any
executive summaries of reports shall be submitted to the Chief
Planner. A completed application form, a fee in accordance
with the fee schedule adopted by resolution of City Council and
a completed LCPC request for review form shall be submitted.
If the subdivision or land development involves the
construction, modification or vacation of a street, one
additional copy of the plan shall be submitted.
(b) LCPC review: Copies of the plan, reports and filing fee shall be
in accordance with LCPC requirements.
(2) The final action of the Commission shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant and other known interested parties
personally or mailed to same at their last known address not later
than 15 days following the Commission's action. Failure to notify
the applicant within the prescribed time limit shall be deemed an
approval of the application in terms as presented, unless the
applicant has agreed, in writing, to an extension of time or change
in the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the
decision. The written communication shall note one of the following
actions:
(a) Unconditional approval;
(b) Conditional approval, including but not limited to required
changes pertaining to the plan and/or submission of additional
technical reports on impacts caused by the development, as
required by the Commission, the reason for the conditional
approval, and the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied
upon; or
(c) Disapproval, including the defects found in the application, the
requirements that have not been met, proposed mitigation
measures for negative impacts identified in impact studies or
reports that have been determined to be inadequate and
§ 265-23 LANCASTER CODE § 265-23
256:876
changes in plans and specifications that would cause the
Commission to determine that mitigation measures are
adequate, and the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied
upon.
(3) Unconditional approval authorizes the applicant to proceed with
the preparation of the final plan.
(4) When the Commission grants conditional approval of a plan, the
following procedure shall be applicable:
(a) When a preliminary plan has been approved subject to
conditions, and when the applicant rejects one or more of the
conditions, the applicant shall so notify the Planning
Commission in writing within 30 days of the Commission's
action. Such notification of rejection of one or more of the
conditions of approval shall serve to automatically rescind the
conditional approval of the plan. Failure of the applicant to
notify the Planning Commission of rejection of one or more of
the conditions of approval within the time so specified shall
serve as notice of acceptance of the conditions of approval and
that the applicant intends to fully comply with the conditions
unless such conditions are invalidated by final order of court
upon appeal thereto by the applicant.
(b) If the applicant and the Commission agree to additional
conditions of preliminary plan approval, all such conditions
shall be embodied in a developer's agreement entitled
"Preliminary Plan Developer's Agreement," which lists the
agreed upon conditions (see Appendix B).225 Acceptance or
rejection of the preliminary plan agreement shall be done in
accordance with the procedures set forth in § 265-23B(4)(a).
(c) Upon receiving a conditional approval, the applicant shall have
one year from the date of the Commission's conditional
approval to submit two copies of a revised plan which complies
with all conditions, including compliance with all conditions
agreed to by the applicant in any agreement(s). The
Commission may grant a modification to extend the time
period for plan approval upon written request by the applicant.
Failure to submit a revised plan which complies with all
conditions within the aforesaid time period shall serve as a
rejection of the conditions by the applicant and serve to
automatically rescind the plan approval.
(5) Upon determination that all conditions of the Commission's
conditional approval have been met, the Chief Planner shall
transmit a written notification to the applicant indicating that the
225. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 265-23 SKATEBOARDS § 265-23
256:877
preliminary plan conditions have been satisfied and that the
applicant may proceed with the final plan application.
(6) Disapproval of the plan requires that the applicant resubmit the
plan. A resubmitted plan shall be considered and reviewed as a new
plan in accordance with this § 265-23.
(7) A preliminary plan which has been tabled prior to final action shall
be reviewed in one of the following manners:
(a) Any preliminary plan which, in the opinion of the Commission,
cannot be adequately reviewed due to, but not limited to, a lack
of information or nonconformity with existing federal, state or
local regulations, may be tabled. Any plan tabled during the
Commission's ninety-day review and approval period shall be
rescheduled for final action within the same aforementioned
ninety-day period. If the applicant must provide supplemental
information for a tabled plan, this information shall be
provided to the Chief Planner no later than 10 days prior to the
Commission meeting when the plan will be reconsidered.
(b) An applicant may request in writing to the Commission that the
plan be tabled. Plans which are tabled by the Commission shall
be rescheduled for final action within the Commission's ninetyday
review and approval period unless the applicant has
agreed, in writing, to an extension of time.
(8) An applicant may withdraw a plan from the Commission's
consideration by means of written communication to the
Commission; however, fees for plans which are withdrawn shall not
be returnable nor credited toward any resubmitted plans. An
applicant desiring to resubmit a plan shall do so in accordance with
this § 265-23B.
(9) From the time an application for approval of a plan, whether
preliminary or final, is duly filed as provided in this chapter, and
while such application is pending approval or disapproval, no
change or amendment of the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plan shall affect the decision on such
application adversely to the applicant, and the applicant shall be
entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of the
governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time the
application was duly filed. In addition, when a preliminary
application has been duly approved, the applicant shall be entitled
to final approval in accordance with the terms of the approved
preliminary application as hereinafter provided. However, if an
application is denied, any subsequent application shall be subject
to the intervening change in governing regulations.
(10) When an application for approval of a plan, whether preliminary,
tentative, minor or final, has been approved without conditions, or
approved by the applicant's acceptance of conditions, no
§ 265-23 LANCASTER CODE § 265-23
256:878
subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or
other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied to affect
adversely the right of the applicant to commence and to complete
any aspect of the approved development in accordance with the
terms of such approval within five years from such approval. The
five-year period shall be extended for the duration of any litigation,
including appeals, which prevent the commencement or
completion of the development, and for the duration of any sewer
or utility moratorium or prohibition which was imposed subsequent
to the filing of an application for preliminary approval of a plan.
In the event of an appeal filed by any party from the approval or
disapproval of a plan, the five-year period shall be extended by the
total time from the date the appeal was filed until a final order in
such matter has been entered and all appeals have been concluded
and any period for filing appeals or requests for reconsideration
have expired; provided, however, no extension shall be based upon
any water or sewer moratorium which was in effect as of the date
of the filing of a preliminary application. Where final approval is
preceded by preliminary approval, the aforesaid five-year period
shall be counted from the date of the preliminary approval. In
the case of any doubt as to the terms of a preliminary approval,
the terms shall be construed in the light of the provisions of the
governing ordinances or plans as they stood at the time when the
application for such approval was duly filed.
(11) Where the applicant has substantially completed the required
improvements as depicted upon the final plan within the aforesaid
five-year limit, or any extension thereof as may be granted by the
Commission, no change of municipal ordinance or plan enacted
subsequent to the date of filing of the preliminary plan shall modify
or revoke any aspect of the approved final plan pertaining to zoning
classification or density, lot, building, street or utility location.
(12) In the case of a preliminary plan calling for the installation of
improvements beyond the five-year period, a schedule shall be filed
by the applicant with the preliminary plan delineating all proposed
sections as well as deadlines within which applications for final
plan approval of each section are intended to be filed. Such
schedule shall be updated annually by the applicant on or before
the anniversary of the preliminary plan approval, until final plan
approval of the final section has been granted, and any modification
in the aforesaid schedule shall be subject to approval of the
Commission in its discretion.
(13) Each phase in any residential subdivision or land development,
except for the last phase, shall contain a minimum of 25% of the
total number of dwelling units as depicted on the preliminary plan,
unless a lesser percentage is approved by the Commission.
Provided that the applicant has not defaulted with regard to or
violated any of the conditions of the preliminary plan approval,
§ 265-23 SKATEBOARDS § 265-23
256:879
§ 265-24. Sketch plan option preceding the filing of a final plan.
In an effort to streamline the plan approval process while recognizing
the complexities and unique aspects of urban land development projects,
the Commission has established optional plan filing requirements that will
encourage better planning at the early stages of design while saving time
during the plan review period. For projects exceeding the thresholds of
§ 265-22 for waiving preliminary plan filing requirements, a preliminary/
final plan may be filed in lieu of a separate preliminary plan, provided
that a sketch plan has first been submitted and reviewed by the City
staff in accordance with § 265-17 or by the Commission in accordance
with § 265-18. Nothing herein shall prevent applicants from submitting a
preliminary plan followed by a final plan should they so choose. For minor
plans, no sketch plan submission is required; however, the applicant shall
consult with the Planning Bureau prior to a minor plan submission to
determine the plan's eligibility for filing under the minor plan provisions.
§ 265-25. Plan validity.
The applicant shall have two years from the date of the Commission's
conditional or unconditional approval of a preliminary plan in which to
submit a final plan, unless the applicant requests in writing and the
Commission approves an extension of time. In the case of phased projects,
all plan submissions must occur within the five-year time period noted in
§ 265-23B(10) through (14). Failure by the applicant or developer to comply
with all conditions that have been accepted by the applicant within one year
of conditional approval of a final plan shall serve to rescind the approval of
the plan, as set forth in § 265-29B(3)(c).
§ 265-26. Minor and preliminary plan specifications and data.
including compliance with applicant's aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plans for the various phases, then the aforesaid
protection afforded by substantially completing the improvements
depicted upon the final plan within five years shall apply and
for any phase or phases, beyond the initial phase, in which the
required improvements have not been substantially completed
within the said five-year period, the aforesaid protection shall apply
for an additional term or terms of three years from the date of final
plan approval for each phase.
(14) Failure of applicant to adhere to the aforesaid schedule of
submission of final plans for the various sections shall subject any
such section to any and all changes in zoning, subdivision and other
governing ordinance enacted by the municipality subsequent to the
date of the initial preliminary plan submission.
A. The preliminary plan shall be drawn to a scale of one inch equals 10, 20,

potential negative environmental impacts, as reasonably
determined by the City, in regard to wildlife habitats,
riparian vegetation, hazardous material storage, noise or
other environmental qualities.
(c) Preparation of studies or reports. Impact studies or reports
shall be performed by individuals with education and
experience in the field of study. The study shall identify current
conditions, effects of the proposed development, and
recommended mitigation measures and their effects. Traffic/
transportation impact studies shall be undertaken in
accordance with Article VIII.
(d) Mitigation measures. Impact studies or reports shall identify
improvements, facilities, activities or alternative measures to
reduce any identified detrimental impacts of the development
and to satisfy any requirements set forth in this chapter or in
federal, state or other local statutes, ordinances or regulations.

ARTICLE VI
Final Plan Procedure and Requirements
§ 265-28. Unconditional plan approval preceding City permits.
No building/demolition permit or building certificate of occupancy shall be
issued prior to the unconditional approval of a final land development or
subdivision plan or a minor plan processed in accordance with § 265-21
and the satisfaction of all conditions of plan approval in accordance with
this chapter. In addition, copies of the plan and related documents to be
recorded by the applicant shall first be signed by the appropriate City
staff or approval body prior to receiving any permits to commence work as
proposed on the plan.
§ 265-29. Final plan submission procedures.
A. At the time of submission of a final plan, the applicant shall submit the
plan to the Lancaster County Planning Commission (LCPC) with the
required LCPC application form and fee. The applicant shall also submit
the plan to other relevant agencies for review and comment. No action
on the final plan shall be taken by the Commission until the LCPC report
has been received or until the expiration of 30 days from the date the
application was forwarded to the LCPC. All accepted applications shall
be reviewed and final action taken by the Commission within 90 days of
the Commission's next regularly scheduled public meeting following
the date the application was filed and accepted or after a final order of
court remanding an application. An exception to the ninety-day
stipulation for the Commission to take final action occurs only when the
applicant has agreed, in writing, to an extension of time.
B. The following steps shall be followed during the final plan process:
(1) Applications shall consist of the following:
(a) City review: A minimum of three paper copies of the plan, two
copies of all reports, and 12 copies of any executive summaries
other than those accompanying the preliminary plan
submission shall be submitted to the Chief Planner. A
completed application form, a fee in accordance with the fee
schedule adopted by resolution of City Council, and a
completed LCPC plan processing application shall be
submitted. If the subdivision or land development involves the
construction, modification or vacation of a street, one
additional copy of the plan shall be submitted.
(b) LCPC review: Copies of the plan, reports and filing fee shall be
in accordance with LCPC filing requirements.
(2) The final action of the Commission shall be in writing and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to same at
their last known address not later than 15 calendar days following
§ 265-28 SKATEBOARDS § 265-29
256:889
the Commission's action. The written communication shall note one
of the following actions:
(a) Unconditional approval;
(b) Conditional approval requiring changes pertaining to the plan,
submission of revised technical reports, the reason for the
conditional approval, the provisions of the statute or ordinance
relied upon, or conditions agreed to by the applicant; or
(c) Disapproval, including the defects found in the application, the
requirements that have not been met, proposed mitigation
measures for negative impacts identified in impact studies or
reports that have been determined to be inadequate and
changes in plans and specifications that would cause the
Commission to determine that mitigation measures are
adequate, and the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied
upon.
(3) When the Commission grants conditional approval of a plan, the
following procedure shall be applicable:
(a) When a final plan has been approved subject to conditions, and
when the applicant rejects one or more of the conditions, the
applicant shall so notify the Planning Commission in writing
within 30 days of the Commission's action. Such notification of
rejection of one or more of the conditions of approval shall
serve to automatically rescind the conditional approval of the
plan. Failure of the applicant to notify the Commission of
rejection of one or more of the conditions of approval within
the time so specified shall serve as notice of acceptance of the
conditions of approval and that the applicant intends to fully
comply with the conditions unless such conditions are
invalidated by final order of court upon appeal thereto by the
applicant.
(b) If the applicant and the Commission agree to additional
conditions of final plan approval that are not otherwise
enforceable under statute or ordinance, all such conditions
shall be embodied in a developer's agreement entitled "Final
Plan Developer's Agreement," which lists the agreed upon
conditions (see Appendix C).232 Acceptance or rejection of the
final plan agreement shall be done in accordance with the
procedures set forth in § 265-29B(3)(a).
(c) Upon receiving a conditional approval, the applicant shall have
one year from the date of the Commission's conditional
approval to submit two copies of a revised final plan which
complies with all conditions, including compliance with all
conditions agreed to by the applicant in any final plan
232. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 265-29 LANCASTER CODE § 265-29
256:890
developer's agreement. The Commission may grant an
extension of the time period for final plan approval upon
written request by the applicant. Failure to submit a revised
final plan which complies with all conditions within the
aforesaid time period shall serve as a rejection of the
conditions by the applicant and serve to automatically rescind
the plan approval.
(4) Upon determination that all conditions of the Commission's
conditional approval have been met, the Chief Planner shall
transmit a written notification to the applicant indicating that the
final plan conditions have been satisfied. The applicant shall submit
one mylar and three paper sets of plans along with a digital file in a
format acceptable to the Chief Planner.
(5) Disapproval of the plan requires that the applicant resubmit the
plan. A resubmitted plan shall be considered and reviewed as a new
plan in accordance with this § 265-29.
(6) After the Commission grants unconditional approval, or the
conditions of approval have been satisfied, and the plan is signed
by the City Engineer and the Commission Chairperson or Vice
Chairperson, the applicant shall present the plan to the LCPC for
approval signatures. Upon securing all approvals, the applicant
shall, within 90 days of such final approval or 90 days after the date
of delivery of an approved plan signed by the Commission following
completion of conditions imposed for such approval, whichever is
later, record such plan in the office of the Lancaster County
Recorder of Deeds. Failure to record the plan within this time
period shall cause the Commission's approval to become null and
void, unless an extension of time has been requested by the
applicant in writing and granted by the Commission.
(7) Plans which are tabled prior to final action shall be reviewed in one
of the following manners:
(a) Any plan which, in the opinion of the Commission, cannot be
adequately reviewed due to, but not limited to, a lack of
information or nonconformity with existing federal, state or
local regulations, may be tabled. Written notice of the tabling
action shall be mailed to the applicant no later than 15 days
following the tabling action. Any plan tabled during the
Commission's ninety-day review and approval period shall be
rescheduled for final action within the same aforementioned
ninety-day period. If the applicant must provide supplemental
information for a tabled plan, this information shall be
provided to the Chief Planner at least 21 days prior to the
Commission meeting when the plan will be reconsidered.
(b) An applicant may request in writing to the Commission that the
plan be tabled. Plans which are tabled by the Commission shall

be rescheduled for final action within the Commission's ninetyday
review period unless the applicant has agreed, in writing,
to an extension of time.
(8) An applicant may withdraw a plan from the Commission's
consideration by means of written communication to the
Commission or Chief Planner; however, fees for plans which are
withdrawn shall not be returnable nor credited toward any
resubmitted plans. A resubmitted plan shall be considered and
reviewed as a new final plan in accordance with procedures and
requirements set forth in this article.
(9) From the time an application is duly filed until the completion of
required improvements, the application shall have those
protections from change or amendment of zoning, subdivision,
stormwater or other governing ordinance or plan set forth in
§ 265-23B(9) through (14).
A. Recording of the final plan, after approval by the City Engineer and
Commission, shall have the effect of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all
streets and other areas designated in the final plan for public use,
unless reserved by the applicant as provided for in § 265-30B of this
chapter. However, the approval of the Commission shall not impose any
duty upon the City, county or Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
concerning acceptance, maintenance or improvement of any such
dedicated areas or portions of same until the proper authorities of the
City, county or commonwealth actually accept same by ordinance or
resolution.
B. The applicant may place a notation on the final plan to the effect that
there is no offer of dedication to the public of certain designated areas,
in which event the title to such areas shall remain with the applicant or
shall be transferred to adjacent owner/owners or approved
homeowners association; and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
County of Lancaster or City shall assume no right to accept ownership,
maintenance or improvement thereof.
A. The final plan shall meet all of the requirements of Article V, § 265-26,
Minor and preliminary plan specifications and data, and shall be
accompanied by the following certificates, which shall be signed after
all conditions have been satisfied:
(1) Certificate for approval by the Commission (see Appendix A).233

(b) Right-of-way widths, determined by the combination of the
components shown above, may be modified by the Commission
in consideration of the following: anticipated average daily
vehicle trips generated by and through the project area, truck
traffic, municipal maintenance and public safety needs, onstreet
parking demand, pedestrian safety, accessibility for
persons with disabilities, mass transit needs, bicycle lanes,
landscape areas, snow removal impacts, required utility
easements or continuation of adjacent development patterns.
(c) Sidewalks on collector and minor arterial streets may be
widened to a maximum of eight feet to accommodate high
pedestrian traffic in the vicinity of shopping and service
facilities, schools, recreation areas, community facilities, and
other high-volume generators of pedestrian traffic. In the event
sidewalks are widened to accommodate increased pedestrian
traffic, the total ROW width shall be increased accordingly.
(2) Streets shall be logically related to the topography so as to produce
reasonable grades, satisfactory drainage and suitable building sites
and shall have horizontal and vertical alignments in accordance
with § 265-33C and D below.
(3) The arrangement of streets shall provide for the continuation of
existing or planned streets and street patterns and proper access to
adjoining undeveloped tracts suitable for future subdivision.
(4) Cul-de-sac streets shall be avoided in order to maintain street
connectivity and shall be permitted only when topography or the
presence of natural and historic resources prevent a connecting
street pattern.
(5) All required improvements, including but not limited to existing
and new streets, sanitary sewer and water line interceptor systems,
stormwater management and green infrastructure systems, and all
other improvements shall be installed in the rights-of-way of
existing and/or new streets, and shall be extended to the boundary
line of the development, as required, to provide access to adjacent
lands. All such existing and/or new streets and all required
§ 265-33 LANCASTER CODE § 265-33
256:896
improvements to be located within the rights-of-way of such
existing and/or new streets shall be so designed as to accommodate
the future needs of the City with respect to street circulation
patterns and utility alignment.
(6) Whenever design standards for required street improvements are
not specified by the City of Lancaster, the applicable standard
requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, in
accordance with Publication 408, latest revision, shall govern.
(7) To the maximum extent possible, all new and reconstructed streets
shall be designed to accommodate bicycles and green
infrastructure.
(8) Parking lanes shall incorporate green infrastructure where
underground utilities do not create insurmountable conflicts.
(9) Bicycle lanes, cycle tracks or visible lane markings and signage
shall be incorporated into all reconstructed streets in accordance
with the City of Lancaster Specifications and Guidelines Manual
then in effect or any other stricter regulations promulgated by
ordinance or resolution of City Council.
(10) All new and reconstructed streets, sidewalks, curbs and planting
strips shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
City's Specifications and Guidelines Manual and shall be consistent
with any proposed City street improvement project. Where the
subdivision or land development is located within the Streetscape
District, as defined and regulated by Chapter 262, Article VII,
Streetscape District, the design standards of the Streetscape
District shall be applicable.
B. Cul-de-sac and dead-end streets.
(1) The centerline distance of cul-de-sac streets shall be greater than
250 feet in length and shall not exceed 600 feet in length. The
length of the cul-de-sac street shall be measured from the
centerline intersection of the intersecting street that is itself not a
cul-de-sac to the center of the cul-de-sac turnaround. Cul-de-sac
streets must be provided with a paved turnaround area with a
minimum diameter of 80 feet to the face of the curb and of 100 feet
to the street right-of-way line. The Commission may modify the
above design standards provided that an alternative design has
been approved by the City Engineer and City Fire Marshal. The
Commission may require that cul-de-sacs be connected via
pedestrian and bicycle paths to nearby streets, recreational
facilities, neighborhoods or commercial areas.
(2) Temporary turnaround streets shall be prohibited except when
designed for the future street extension into adjoining tracts or
approved for staged development. Evidence of the feasibility of
extending the street shall be noted on the plan. Any street

temporarily dead ended in order to provide for future continuation
of the street into adjoining property or for authorized staged
development shall be fully constructed and all utilities installed.
When possible, improvements should be extended beyond the
phase line. A barrier to prevent vehicular access to adjoining
property, such as bollards or guide rails, shall be constructed at
the termination point of the street, and a temporary turn-around,
50 feet in diameter, as approved by the City Engineer, shall be
provided. When extension of the street occurs, the temporary
turnaround shall be removed and the street reconstructed
according to City specifications.
(3) Where any adjacent stub street is not proposed for extension as a
through street, a cul-de-sac shall be constructed within the limits of
the development in compliance with City standards.
(4) Cul-de-sacs shall have a fully paved cartway; however, a center
landscape or parking island may be permitted if stormwater

C. Horizontal alignment.
(1) Horizontal curves, with a minimum radius of 150 feet, shall be used
at all horizontal alignment deflections in excess of 2°.
(2) There shall be a tangent of at least 100 feet between reverse curves
for all residential and collector streets.
(3) Right-of-way lines shall be equidistant from the street centerline at
all points.
D. Vertical alignment.
(1) A vertical curve is used to provide a smooth transition between
vertical tangents of different slope rates and is usually centered on
the intersection point of the vertical tangents. One of the basic
principles of vertical curves is that the rate of change of grade at
successive points on the curve is a constant amount for equal
increments of horizontal distance. The total length (L) of a vertical
curve divided by the algebraic difference in its tangent grades (A)
reflects the distance along the curve at any point to effect a onepercent
change in gradient and is, therefore, a measure of
curvature. The rate L/A, termed "K," is useful in determining
minimum lengths of vertical curves for the various required sight
distances. "K" values for vertical curve design should be consistent
with design speed. Maximum centerline grades should also be
consistent with design standards. The minimum design speed shall
be 30 mph with a vertical curve minimum "K" value of 19.
(2) The minimum centerline grade shall be 1% with designed low
points to collect and discharge stormwater.
§ 265-33 LANCASTER CODE § 265-33
256:898

intersections and shall be in accordance with City specifications.
Continuations of existing streets shall be known by the same name.
Names for new streets shall not duplicate or closely resemble
names of existing streets. At least two street name signs shall be
placed at each four-way street intersection and one at each "T"
intersection. All signs shall identify both intersecting streets. Signs
shall be installed in a manner to be free of visual obstruction,
including trees, utility poles, and other signs. Street name signs for
private streets shall be installed by the applicant in accordance
with this section.
(6) Traffic control signs and any accompanying pavement markings
shall be installed by the applicant and their installation shall meet
the requirements of the City Engineer and the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT), where applicable.
F. Street widths.
(1) Street widths for all streets shall be in accordance with § 265-33A.

surfaced and improved to the grades and dimensions shown on the
plans, profiles and cross-sections submitted by the developer, and
approved by the City Engineer.
(3) Maximum slopes of banks measured perpendicular to the
centerline of the street shall be three-to-one in fill areas and two-toone
in cut areas beyond the right-of-way line to the existing ground
line elevation.
(4) The Commission may require that guide rails be installed as part of
the project improvements where one or more of the following
conditions exist:
(a) Steep slopes;
(b) Curves;
(c) Endangered structures.
(5) Rails and posts, location and installation methods shall be
approved by the City Engineer. Materials shall include PennDOT
approved steel guide rail or post, eight-inch-by-eight-inch post and
three-inch-by-twelve-inch rail of exterior-grade, treated lumber, or
other methods/materials which serve to protect the safety of the

sufficient cartway width is proposed to accommodate both the
travel lanes and parking stalls. Angle and perpendicular parking
which would require vehicles to back into the travel lanes of an
access drive shall not be permitted.
(3) The Commission reserves the authority to disapprove the location
of any access drive intersection with an existing or proposed street
upon finding that the proposed design raises serious traffic and/or
pedestrian safety issues and that alternative site and access
designs are available which would minimize the identified safety
concerns.
(4) The Commission may require installation of a depressed curb with
a driveway apron and sidewalk or a marked crosswalk across a
high-volume access drive.
A. When easements are required for utilities, the minimum width shall be
20 feet for a single utility and 30 feet or more for two or more utilities;

stormwater runoff is adequately handled. The minimum width of the
easement or right-of-way shall correspond to the one-hundred-year
storm event boundary or established floodplain.
C. Easements may be required by the Commission in cases where the
Commission deems it essential for the proper circulation of pedestrian
or vehicular traffic flow within a subdivision or land development. Such
easements shall not be less than six feet in width for pedestrian use and
12 feet in width for bicycle or vehicular use, unless the Commission
requires narrower easements because of anticipated pedestrian use or
vehicular volume.

E. Private park and recreation alternatives. In lieu of dedication of land,
the developer may propose the private reservation of land and
recreational improvements, or a combination of public and private
holdings. Recreational facilities proposed under this subsection shall
require that the Commission find that the alternative offered by the
developer is equal or superior to the public dedication of land, as
required by this article. At the time of final plan submission, and if
applicable, the applicant shall submit a homeowner's association
agreement or other document, subject to review and approval by the
City, describing how the park and/or recreational facilities will be used
or maintained.
(1) Privately held land and recreational improvements shall meet one
or more of the following criteria:
(a) Park land suitable for the passive or active recreational needs
of the residents shall be calculated at 43.56 square feet per
person based on projected occupancy load.
(b) If the residences are more than 1/2 mile (2,640 feet) walking
distance from a public park containing facilities suitable for the
intended occupants of the project, the developer shall prepare
an analysis of facilities that are proposed to be constructed
that will meet the needs of the residents. Examples of private
facilities may include common gathering areas and activity
rooms where social events may be held, multipurpose rooms,
gym and exercise rooms, pools, patios and outdoor seating
areas, rooftop open space improved for seating, walking or
gathering, common balconies, play areas, game courts, or
outdoor private walkways, four feet or wider, that offer
connectivity between buildings or adjacent walkways and trails
and which provide a means of pedestrian circulation for
exercise purposes.
A. Fee in lieu of dedication. The Commission may consent to the payment
of a fee by the developer to the City of Lancaster in lieu of the
dedication of land when the Commission determines that the payment
of a fee would more adequately provide park or recreational facilities
accessible to the proposed development. A payment of a fee in lieu of
dedication of such land shall be required in accordance with the
following:
(1) The amount of the fee shall be based upon the fair market value of
the land, based on the unimproved land value, otherwise required
for dedication.
(2) The fee shall be paid to the City prior to the unconditional approval
and recording of the final plan.
§ 265-48 SKATEBOARDS § 265-49
256:921
(3) All fee payments in lieu of dedication received pursuant to this
section shall be used solely and exclusively for providing park or
recreational facilities included in the City's current park,
recreation and open space plan, and reasonably accessible to the
development. Use of the payment may include acquisition of land
for parks, construction of playgrounds, game courts, or other
recreational facilities; the construction of improvements on new or
existing sites; or operating or maintenance expenses for existing
parks. The fees are to be used only for the purposes of providing,
acquiring, operating or maintaining park or recreational facilities
reasonably accessible to the development.
B. Park fund. Moneys paid by the developer in lieu of park dedication shall
be deposited with the City and placed in a separate interest-bearing
account, clearly identified as reserved for the purposes noted above.
Interest earned on the account shall become funds of that account.
Funds from such account shall be expended only in properly allocable
portions of the cost incurred to provide, acquire, operate or maintain
facilities reasonably accessible to the development site.
C. Refund of fee. Upon request of any person who paid any fee under this
subsection, the City shall refund such fee, plus interest accumulated
thereon from the date of payment, if the City used the fee paid for a
purpose other than the purposes set forth in § 265-49A(3).

may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the
applicant or developer and the City are unable to agree upon an
estimate, then the estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by
another professional engineer licensed as such in this
commonwealth and chosen mutually by the municipality and the
applicant or developer. The estimate certified by the third engineer
shall be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final
estimate. In the event that a third engineer is so chosen, fees for
the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by the applicant
or developer and the City.
(3) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete
the required improvements, the amount of financial security may
be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond
the first anniversary date from each posting of financial security or
to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the
required improvements, as reestablished on or about the expiration
of the preceding one-year period by using the above estimating
procedure.
C. Protection of final phases. In the case where development is projected
over a period of years, the Commission may authorize submission of
final plans by section or stages of development, subject to such
requirements or guaranties as to improvements in future sections or
§ 265-54 LANCASTER CODE § 265-54
256:926
stages of development as it finds essential for the protection of any
finally approved section of the development.
D. Record drawings. After final plan approval and upon completion of all
required improvements, the developer shall submit record drawings
showing the location, dimension and elevation of all improvements.
Such plans shall indicate that the required grading, drainage structures
and/or drainage systems and erosion and sediment control practices
have been installed in substantial conformance with the previously
approved final plan. The record drawings shall specify all deviations
from the previously approved drawings. One paper set of plans shall be
submitted to the City for review and approval. After approval is
granted, one copy of all plans shall be submitted to the City in mylar
form along with any deed of dedication for public property or easement.
If required by the Planning Bureau, revised mylars shall be recorded by
the developer so as to supersede the previously recorded final plan in
order to provide an accurate public record of the location of required
improvements; and evidence of such recording shall be provided to the
City.
E. Partial release of funds. As the work of installing the required
improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may
request the City to release or authorize the release of, from time to
time, such portions of the financial security necessary for payment to
the contractor or contractors performing the work. Any such requests
shall be in writing addressed to the Planning Bureau. The City shall
have 45 days from receipt of such request to certify, in writing, that
such portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the
approved plan. Upon such certification, the City shall authorize release
by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount fairly
representing the value of the improvements completed. If the City fails
to act within said forty-five-day period, the request for release of funds
shall be deemed to have been approved. Prior to final release at the
time of completion and certification by the City Engineer, the City may
require retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid
improvements.
F. Release from improvement bond guaranty.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Planning
Bureau, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the
completion of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy
thereof to the City Engineer. The Planning Bureau shall, within 10
days after receipt of such notice, direct and authorize the City
Engineer and designated inspection staff to inspect the
improvements. Within 30 days of authorizing the City Engineer to
inspect the improvements, the Planning Bureau shall mail a report
to the developer by certified or registered mail. The report shall
either indicate acceptance of the work or shall identify
improvements which are not approved and shall describe what
§ 265-54 SKATEBOARDS § 265-54
256:927
§ 265-55. Inspection during construction.
corrective actions the developer must undertake. If all required
improvements are accepted, the full amount of the financial
guarantee including any retainage shall be returned to the
developer.
(2) Should there be any question on the performance of an
improvement, the full amount of the guarantee posted in the form
or a bond or letter of credit may be released and replaced by a cash
guarantee in an amount determined by the Planning Bureau to be
sufficient to cover replacement costs of any questionable
improvements. The developer and City may agree to retain a fixed
amount as a guarantee for 12 months to assure that improvements
perform as expected. In the case of improvements dedicated to the
City, § 265-57, Maintenance guaranty, shall apply.
(3) If the Planning Bureau fails to comply with the time limitation
provisions contained herein, all improvements will be deemed to
have been approved and the applicant or developer shall be
released from all liability, pursuant to the performance guaranty
bond or other security agreement.
(4) If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected, the developer shall proceed to complete the same
and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification, as
outlined herein, shall be followed.
(5) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
applicant's or developer's right to contest or question, by legal
proceedings or otherwise, any determination.
(6) Improvements accepted by the City Engineer shall not become
public until dedication occurs, as specified under § 265-56.
A. Inspections required.
(1) The Planning Bureau and the City Engineer shall require
inspections of the plans for correctness, and inspections of the
construction of the improvements. The City may elect to perform
inspections of the construction for any improvement that is
identified on the Engineer's cost estimate for items outlined in
§ 265-50, in which case the financial guaranty will be deposited in
the City's name, by notifying the Planning Bureau for each project
that inspection responsibility will be assumed. The applicant shall
agree to pay the cost of inspections, as referenced in § 265-5D.
(2) The developer shall provide at least a forty-eight-hour written
notice to the City Engineer prior to the start of construction of any
required improvements that are subject to inspection.
§ 265-54 LANCASTER CODE § 265-55
256:928
§ 265-56. Dedication of improvements.
All improvements shall be deemed to be private improvements and only
for the benefit of the specific project until such time as the same have
been offered for dedication and formally accepted by City Council or an
authority by ordinance, resolution, deed or other formal document. No
responsibility of any kind with respect to improvements shown on the final
plan shall be assumed or transferred until the improvements have been
formally accepted. No improvement shall be accepted for dedication except
upon submission of record drawings by the developer and acceptance based
on inspection of the final construction.
§ 265-57. Maintenance guaranty.
When the City Council and/or an authority accepts dedication of all or some
of the required improvements following completion, the governing body
may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity
of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final
plan for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this article with regard to installation of such improvements,
and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed 15% of the actual
cost of installation of said improvements.
§ 265-58. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
In the event that any improvements which may be required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or in accord with the approved final
plan, the City is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond or
other security by appropriate legal and/or equitable remedies. If proceeds
of such bond or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of installing
or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered by said
security, the City may, at its option, install part of such improvements
in all or part of the subdivision or land development, and may institute
appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary to
complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds, whether
resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable action brought
against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of
the improvements covered by such security, and not for any other municipal
purpose.
B. Reimbursement for City inspections disputes. An applicant or developer
who disputes the amount of inspection costs charged to the project by
the City may seek relief by following the procedure prescribed under
Section 510 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247,
as amended.

an autoclave which is operated in strict accordance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. As the operation time of the
autoclave may vary with the type of instrument, the packaging of
that item and the arrangement of items in the autoclave, it is
critical that the manufacturer's operation manual be followed. This
will assure that each item placed in the autoclave achieves the
proper temperature for sterilization. Temperature sensitive
autoclave tape, autoclave bags with a chemical color indicator on
the bag or any other temperature sensitive medium approved for

suspensions which are processed by a laboratory. The operator
must maintain records documenting such testing for three years. A
copy of the manufacturer's recommended procedures for the
operation of the autoclave is to be available for inspection by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. An autoclave, which has
received a positive spore test, must be immediately removed from
§ 269-8 LANCASTER CODE § 269-8
267:948
service and all instruments allegedly sterilized by that autoclave
shall not be utilized on any client. Prior to using, the operator
must ensure that there is evidence of one negative spore test. If
the autoclave requires repair work, it cannot be utilized until it
has received two negative spore tests. Autoclaves must be cleaned
and serviced at the frequency recommended by the manufacturer.
A copy of the manufacturer's cleaning and servicing instructions
must be maintained in the body art establishment. [Amended

the collection of earned income tax within the TCD under the Local Tax
Enabling Act.
TCD  Any tax collection district to which the taxing authority or any part

§ 270-3. Imposition of tax.
A. General purpose resident tax. The taxing authority hereby imposes a
tax for general revenue purposes at the rate of 0.6% on earned income
and net profits of individual residents of the taxing authority.
B. General purpose municipal nonresident tax. The taxing authority also
imposes a tax for general revenue purposes at the rate of 1.0% on
earned income and net profits derived by an individual who is not a

resident of the taxing authority from any work, business, profession,
or activity of any kind engaged in within the boundaries of the taxing
authority.
C. Ongoing tax. The tax shall continue at the above rates during the
current tax year and each tax year thereafter, without annual
reenactment, until this enactment is repealed or the rate is changed.
D. Local Tax Enabling Act applicable. The tax is imposed under authority
of the Local Tax Enabling Act, and all provisions thereof that relate to a
tax on earned income or net profits are incorporated into this
enactment. Any future amendments to the Local Tax Enabling Act that
are required to be applied to a tax on earned income or net profits will
automatically become part of this enactment upon the effective date of
such amendment, without the need for formal amendment of this
enactment, to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
E. Applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures.
(1) The tax shall be collected and administered in accordance with:
(a) All applicable laws and regulations; and
(b) Regulations, policies and procedures adopted by the TCC or by
the collector.
(2) This includes any regulations, policies, and procedures adopted in
the future to the maximum extent allowed by 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1937.
A. This governing body finds that:
(1) Minors of various age groups have traditionally, and with judicial
sanction, been considered as comprising separate classes for many
legislative purposes; and
(2) Minors under the age of 16 are generally unemancipated and
subject to compulsory school attendance and child labor laws and
therefore have limited earned income and net profits and control of
money such that enforcement of reporting and collection of the tax
hereunder against them would yield inconsequential amounts and
be unduly difficult, expensive, and not in the public interest.
B. For these reasons, individuals under the age of 16 years are exempt
from liability for the tax.
A. Individuals who are residents of a state other than Pennsylvania are
exempt from liability for the tax, but only if all local governments of the
locality where the individual resides either:

§ 270-6. Individual tax returns and payments.

Enabling Act.
§ 270-7. Employer withholding, remittance, and tax returns.
Every employer shall register, withhold, and remit tax and file tax returns in
accordance with the Local Tax Enabling Act.
§ 270-7.1. Tax collector.
The tax will be collected from individuals and employers by the collector.
(1) Impose no tax on the income of a Pennsylvania resident derived
from activities within the locality; or
(2) Exempt that income from tax.
B. In addition to this exemption from municipal nonresident tax, certain
credits and deductions against the tax are permitted under certain
circumstances as provided in applicable law and regulations.

§ 270-8 SWIMMING POOLS § 270-9

§ 270-10. Exemption and refunds.
A. For specific revenue purposes, an annual tax is hereby levied and
assessed, commencing January 1, 2008, upon the privilege of engaging
in an occupation with a primary place of employment within the City of
Lancaster during the tax year. Each natural person who exercises such

levied by the political subdivision.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar

person may be employed.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which
the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or
released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total, one-hundred-percent disability.

armed forces and is called to active duty at any time during the
taxable year. For the purposes of this subsection, "reserve

component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States
Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine
Corps Reserve, United States Coast Guard Reserve, United States
Air Force Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the
Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for a given
calendar year becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year
under Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
§ 270-10 SWIMMING POOLS § 270-10
267:961
§ 270-11. Duty of employers to collect.
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently
severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any
outstanding balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may
pursue collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Director of Administrative Services, in consultation with
the Collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing
of refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Director of Administrative
Services or the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and
provide refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the political subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro-rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
§ 270-10 LANCASTER CODE § 270-11
267:962
§ 270-12. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 270-13. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B
of § 270-10 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 270-11 SWIMMING POOLS § 270-14
267:963
§ 270-14. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession with a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
this article and pay the pro-rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 270-15. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 270-16. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person and, in the event his tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall
have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 270-17. Duty of Collector; administration and enforcement of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person
work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the
priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following
order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar
year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes
prima facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount

this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject
to this tax who are in his employment, or whoever fails or refuses to file
any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600
and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights243 under Act 50 of
1998.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.

acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.

§ 273-1. Purpose.
The City of Lancaster tree ordinance acknowledges the urban forest as
a necessary part of the City's infrastructure. This green infrastructure
provides numerous crucial ecosystem services to the City, including
environmental (stormwater management, carbon sequestration and urban
wildlife habitat), social (human health, healing, and quality of life), and
economic (increased property values, increased business activity and
decreased energy use). However, the increased creation of urban land over
time, coupled with the challenges in adequately maintaining the urban
forest and tree canopy, has created the need to further protect and conserve
this valuable City resource. Thus the purposes of this chapter are to:
A. Maximize the ecosystem services derived from trees by establishing
policies for the planting, removal, maintenance and protection of trees
along City streets and sidewalks, within parks and public open spaces,
and protected trees on private property.
B. Protect and strengthen neighborhoods and to make all neighborhoods
more desirable, safer and attractive places to live.

a tree appraisal in accordance with the latest edition of the Council of
Tree and Landscape Appraisers' Guide for Plant Appraisal, for all trees
within the construction limits of the development site.
C. Tree protection guidelines.
(1) To the maximum extent possible, all trees shall be preserved and
the loss or damage to trees existing on-site which are to remain
shall be minimized. A tree shall be considered preserved if there is
no disturbance within the tree protection zone (TPZ). Disturbance
includes earth disturbance, earth compaction, vehicular and foot
traffic, material stockpiling, and/or the construction of all proposed
improvements and utilities.
(2) A permanent TPZ surrounding both preserved and planted trees
shall be established to protect the critical root zone and tree
§ 273-8 TELEPHONE COMPANIES § 273-10
271:1005
canopy. This tree protection zone shall apply during the
construction phase, as well. The TPZ shall be protected by
appropriate barriers as determined by the Arborist and in
accordance with the standards set forth in A Guide to Preserving
Trees in Development Projects, published by the Penn State
College of Agricultural Sciences and Cooperative Extension.
(a) Tree protection zones will vary according to the species, size,
location, and health of a tree and shall be designed for
maximum flexibility of shape and minimum effectiveness of
size. However, where compelling information to the contrary
regarding a particular tree in its particular setting is not
available the minimum tree protection zones shall be
established as follows:
[1] For existing trees: a circle with a radius extending from
the tree trunk a distance equal to 12 times the trunk
diameter at breast height, or to the tree's dripline plus five
feet, whichever distance is greater.
[2] For newly planted trees: a circle with a radius of no less
than 2 1/2 feet.
(b) Prior to the start of any clearing, grading, or other earth
disturbance, all shade trees and other vegetation to be
preserved shall be protected by a conspicuous four-foot-high
tree protection barrier to prevent encroachment into the tree
protection zone by people, material, and vehicles. The tree
protection barrier installation must be approved by the
Arborist and monitored periodically.
(c) Barriers may be erected around individual trees or groupings
of trees, where feasible.
(d) Use of orange polyethylene safety fencing or a similar highly
visible material is recommended. Snow fencing or other
effective barriers may be used upon approval by the Arborist.
(e) Fencing or barriers around trees shall be placed outside the
TPZ, unless otherwise approved by the Arborist.
(f) The tree protection barrier shall be maintained by the
applicant while in place. It shall be removed only after all
earthmoving and construction activities that may impact tree
roots or canopy are completed and approved by the Arborist.
(g) A sign shall be placed on the tree protection barrier to explain
the purpose of the TPZ.
(3) There shall be no disturbance within the TPZ, including but not
limited to intrusion into the soil such as digging, trenching and
grading, no activities that will compact the soil, and no stockpiling
§ 273-10 LANCASTER CODE § 273-10
271:1006
of construction materials, without prior approval by the City
Arborist.
(a) No grading shall be permitted within the TPZ that would
impact roots. No grade change shall be permitted in excess of a
two-inch cut or two-inch fill of topsoil, sod or mulch.
(b) The routing of underground utility lines shall be around and
away from all TPZs. In the event underground utilities cannot
be rerouted, installation shall be through tunneling rather than
cutting open trenches.
(c) No building materials, dirt, debris, oils, paints, or any other
materials, equipment, or vehicles shall be placed or deposited
within the protection area nor shall any trenching or paving be
done within the protection area. A separate off-site staging and
parking area for the stockpiling of materials, equipment and
vehicles shall be provided for construction sites constrained by
limited size.
(d) In order to protect tree roots from excessive compaction
during construction where vehicles and/or equipment must
pass within a TPZ, special cushioning measures shall be
provided in accordance with Section 4.00 of the Tree Manual.
(4) The entire tree canopy shall be protected from all construction
related activities. The Arborist may approve the removal of a small
part of the crown to facilitate construction activities. Such work
shall be done under the direct supervision of the Arborist, using
methods approved by the Arborist.
(5) The specifications in A Guide to Preserving Trees in Development
Projects, published by the Penn State College of Agricultural
Sciences and Cooperative Extension, shall be regarded as best
practices and contractors/owners shall demonstrate their
understanding of and adherence to these criteria, including but not
limited to the protection zone required for particular species.
(6) In order to avoid damage to newly planted trees, trees shall be
planted only after all major construction activities have been
completed. Planting may occur only when approved by the
Arborist, and only in planting seasons otherwise permitted and as
appropriate to the species.
(7) All proposed tree protection practices, including delineated tree
protection zones, shall be provided on all development plans, as
applicable, including but limited to land development plans,
erosion and sedimentation control plans, stormwater management
plans, parking lot construction or reconstruction plans, as
applicable, and in accordance with the all City codes and
ordinances.

(8) Should any mature viable trees on the site not scheduled to be
removed be irreparably damaged during site preparation activities
and, as a consequence thereof, die or decline as determined by the
Arborist, within 18 months from the date of the conclusion of
construction activities, such trees shall be replaced in accordance
with § 273-8 of this chapter. All replacement trees shall be
acceptable specimens, in accordance with the tree replanting
schedule in the Tree Manual.
D. During the reconstruction of sidewalks, all openings for new or existing
trees shall be in accordance with § 273-6B.
(1) Prior to the issuance of permit for construction, reconstruction or
repair of sidewalks or curbs, the Arborist shall be consulted for the
application of best management practices in order to protect
existing street trees.
E. Amendments. The tree protection standards herein referenced may be
amended and revised by the Director in accordance with § 273-15.

§ 273-10 LANCASTER CODE § 273-11
271:1008
support and pruning of all trees or shrubs concerned and contain a
definite expiration date.
(1) All applications for a tree work permit shall be reviewed and
approved by the City Arborist.
(2) The application for a shade tree permit may be waived by the
Director when the work is done at the direction of, and carried out
by, a City agency.
C. Conditions attached to permits.
(1) All shade trees removed by permit shall be replaced within a period
of one year from the date of removal.
(a) The property owner may, in lieu of replacing a tree, pay a fee,
equal to the replacement value of a tree as set by the Bureau
from the average retail cost of trees of the current-year street
tree contract, to be used by the Bureau for the planting of trees
as deemed necessary.
(b) The option of paying a fee in lieu of replacing a tree may only
be exercised when unmitigated circumstances prohibit
planting a tree in the location from which it was removed. Such
a determination will be made by the City Arborist.
(2) In the event of a tree removal where the tree will not be replaced,
the property owner is required to contract for the removal of the
stump immediately following the removal of the tree and to make
the necessary repairs to the sidewalk at the homeowner's own
expense.
(3) The Bureau shall have the authority to designate a suitable type of
tree and may refuse a permit to plant any type of tree which, in its
opinion, is not suitable to the location. The permit may be revoked
at any time upon proof satisfactory to the Bureau that any of the
terms or conditions upon which such permit was issued are or have
been violated.
(4) The Bureau, in its discretion, may, as a condition precedent to
issuance of a permit, require a contractor, authorized by the
property owner to plant a tree, to guarantee such tree for a period
of 18 months against defects in materials or workmanship. If death
of the tree results within this time period and for the
aforementioned reasons, the contractor shall incur the cost of
removal, including cost of sidewalk repairs, new tree cost and
replanting for each tree planted. However, if the tree should die
after the period of warranty has expired, the property owner shall
replace said tree in accordance with all provisions herein.

permits, zoning permits, or other permits for work that may impact
trees, including but not limited to demolition, construction or
expansion, and not a land development, shall be referred to the
Arborist, or his or her designee, for review as provided for hereunder.
Within five business days of the receipt of the applicable permit
application from the City Engineer, Zoning Officer, Codes Official or
other entity, the Arborist shall determine the need for and location of
the TPZ fencing around all shade trees located on or adjacent to the
site. Where determined necessary by the Arborist, or his/her designee,
the property owner shall install a staked construction fence at least four
feet high, or alternative as approved by the Arborist, around all portions
of the TPZ, excluding any portions occupied by sidewalks, street
cartway, curbs/gutters or a driveway. No activity is permitted within the
TPZ without a permit issued in accordance with this section. Any

property abutting the tree pit, the full cost of such work shall be
assessed said owner. Owners shall have an opportunity to make written
objections to proposed assessments, which objections shall be
considered by the Director prior to approval. All costs incurred in
planting, transplanting, pruning and removing trees, as provided in this
chapter, shall be assessed. The amount each property owner is to pay
shall be determined and certified by the Director. Thereafter, the City
shall cause 30 days' written notice to be given to each person against
whose property an assessment has been made. The notice shall state
the nature and amount of the assessment and the time and place for
payment thereof.

property. Subsequent semiannual registrations of vacant properties and
fees in the amount of $200 are due within 10 days of the expiration of
the previous registration. Said fees shall be used to offset the costs of:
1) registration and registration enforcement, 2) code enforcement and
mitigation related to vacant properties, and 3) for any related purposes
as may be adopted in the policy set forth in this chapter. Said fees shall
be deposited to a special account in the City's department dedicated to
the cost of implementation and enforcement of this chapter, and
fulfilling the purpose and intent of this chapter.
D. Each individual property on the registry that has been registered for 12
months or more prior to the effective date shall have 30 days to renew
the registration and pay the $200 semiannual registration fee.
Properties registered less than 12 months prior to the effective date
shall renew the registration every six months from the expiration of the
original registration renewal date and shall pay the $200.
E. If the property is sold or transferred, the new owner is subject to all the
terms of this chapter. Within 10 days of the transfer, the new owner
shall register the vacant property or update the existing registration.
The previous owner(s) will not be released from the responsibility of
paying all previous unpaid fees, fines, and penalties accrued during that
owner's involvement with the vacant property.
F. If the vacant property is not registered, or either the registration fee or
the semiannual registration fee is not paid within 30 days of when the
registration or semiannual registration is required pursuant to this
section, a late fee equivalent to 10% of the semiannual registration fee
shall be charged for every thirty-day period, or portion thereof, the

address in Lancaster County, the registration statement also shall provide
the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address of a person who
resides within the County of Lancaster and who shall be designated by the
owner as the responsible local agent who is authorized to accept service of
process, notices, statements, invoices and other communications resulting
from and/or relating to this chapter on behalf of the owners. The local
agent shall be responsible for, including, but not limited to, providing City
of Lancaster code officials with access to the building or structure for
the purposes of making inspections, receiving notification in the event
of an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare and for
purposes of service of any and all notices or registration statements as
herein authorized and in connection herewith. The owner and local agent
shall be jointly and severally legally responsible for compliance with the
City of Lancaster codes and Codified Ordinances and the laws of the

any calendar year, it is the responsibility of the mortgagee, owner and/
or local agent to contact the Code Compliance and Inspections Office or
designee within 10 calendar days of the occurrence of such change and
advise the office in writing of those changes. Failure of the mortgagee,
owner and/or local agent to modify the registration from time to time to
property is not registered and shall be due and payable with the
registration. This section shall apply to the initial registration and
registrations required by subsequent owners of the vacant property.
G. Properties subject to this section shall remain subject to the semiannual
registration requirement, and the inspection, security, and maintenance
standards of this section, as long as the property is vacant.
H. Failure of the owner to properly register or to modify the registration to
reflect a change of circumstances as required by this section is a
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to enforcement by any of
the enforcement means available to the City.
I. If any property is in violation of this chapter, the City may take the
necessary action to ensure compliance and place a lien on the property
for the cost of the outstanding obligation and any additional cost
incurred to bring the property into compliance.

by filing an application in writing and submitting the required fee no later

§ 282-10. Delinquent registration fees as lien.

§ 282-11. One-time waiver of registration fee. [Amended
12-18-2018 by Ord. No. 17-2018]

§ 282-12. Decision on application for waiver.
Within 30 days after the waiver application is received by the Bureau of
Code Compliance and Inspections, and upon review by said bureau and
upon the advice of the Solicitor's Office, the Bureau of Code Compliance
and Inspections shall grant or deny the waiver in writing and dispatch
the written decision by mail to the mortgagee or owner. If the mortgagee
or owner properly submitted an application for a one-time waiver to the
Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections and that application were
denied, the mortgagee or owner may seek an appeal by filing an appeal
request to the Housing Board of Appeals, in writing, within 10 business days
of receipt of the denial.
§ 282-13. Semiannual inspections. [Amended 12-18-2018 by Ord.
No. 17-2018]

and Inspections or Bureau of Fire that he/she has submitted a valid
architectural and renovation plan, based on the City's permits and
planning application procedures and otherwise has shown good faith
efforts to efficiently rehabilitate, demolish or otherwise substantially
repair or improve said vacant building or structure; or
B. Properly secures the property from entry, removes all exterior hazards
as determined by the Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections or
Fire Bureau (broken glass, loose building materials, etc.), maintains
grass and weeds, and removes all trash on the exterior of the property.
Failure to do any of the above will result in the full semiannual
registration fee being due and payable immediately upon written notice
from the City.
A. Semiannual inspections. An inspection of the registered abandoned real
estate or vacant building may be performed by the Bureau of Code
Compliance and Inspections semiannually or as necessary. If violations
are identified, the Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections shall
issue a notice of violation as per the requirements of the City of
Lancaster's Property Maintenance Code or Fire Code and give notice to
the mortgagee or owner to comply with the codes with a reasonable
time to cure. If the violations are not corrected within the time given,
§ 282-10 LANCASTER CODE § 282-13
271:1028
the property shall be declared a public nuisance in accordance with this
chapter.
B. Complaint semiannual inspections. Nothing in this section shall
preclude a City code official from performing a semiannual inspection
upon receipt of a complaint of violation of any City ordinances.
C. Right of entry. Code officials are authorized to make semiannual
inspections at any reasonable hour to determine compliance with the
aforementioned codes. Every mortgagee, owner, local agent, or
operator shall allow inspectors, officers or representatives of the
Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections or Fire Bureau
unrestricted access.
D. Search warrant. If any mortgagee, owner, local agent or other person in
charge of a building or structure subject to the provisions of this
chapter refuses, impedes, inhibits, interferes with, restricts or
obstructs entry and access to every part of the structure or premises
where semiannual inspection authorized by this chapter is sought, the
appropriate City code official may apply for an administrative search or
semiannual inspection warrant to a court of competent jurisdiction and
shall supply all necessary affidavits and testimony to indicate that there
is a reasonable or probable cause to conduct such a semiannual
inspection.
E. Notice. All notices scheduling a semiannual inspection shall be mailed
via regular mail to the owner of record, with a copy mailed via regular
mail to the local agent.
F. Failure to appear for a semiannual inspection. If the mortgagee, owner
or his/her local agent cannot be available at the proposed time, said
mortgagee, owner or local agent shall provide no less than 24 hours'
written notice to the Deputy Director, Bureau of Code Compliance and
Inspections. Upon failure to give such written notice or upon failure to
gain entry, an administrative fee of $75 will be assessed against the
owner. For each rescheduling beyond the second rescheduling, an
administrative fee of $100 shall be assessed. Failure to pay the
administrative fee shall, at the discretion of the City code official,
constitute a violation of this chapter and/or the applicable City code.
Failure of a mortgagee, owner or his/her local agent to appear for a
scheduled inspection shall be considered probable cause for obtaining a
search warrant to inspect the premises.
G. Special requested inspections. Whenever an owner, mortgagee,
purchaser or other interested party requests a special inspection of a
property regulated by this chapter, or a certification that a property is
in compliance with this chapter or other applicable City ordinances
pertaining to structural condition, if such request is made in connection
with the sale, conveyance, transfer, financing or refinancing of such
property, the requestor shall pay a fee of $200 to the City of Lancaster
to defray the expenses of making such inspection, which fee may be
§ 282-13 TELEPHONE COMPANIES § 282-13
271:1029
§ 282-14. Appeal rights.
changed from time to time by resolution of City Council. If an inspection
or certification is requested under or pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 32
of 2018257 or other Pennsylvania or federal law, the requestor shall pay
the City all of the City's inspection costs and fees, including fees for
attending depositions and hearings and other court proceedings, and
any other fees authorized by such actual law, which fees and costs shall
be established from time to time by resolution of City Council. Any such
inspection required under this section is not and shall not take the place
of nor be the substitute for a prepurchase property inspection, and the
City of Lancaster shall not be liable for any undiscovered problems
with the real estate being inspected. Inspections held hereunder will
determine compliance with the City's Property Maintenance Code and
not the ICC Building Code. Moreover, no such inspection will include
an analysis of the age of the property's systems and their useful life.
Should, however, any Property Maintenance Code violations be
discovered during such inspection, the party requesting the inspection,
along with the owners of the property, shall be held responsible for
rectifying them and will be issued notices of violation in accordance
with applicable City ordinances.
A. Registration fees. The owner shall have the right to appeal the
imposition of registration fees by reason of the property being vacant,
but not in default, to the Housing Code Board of Appeals upon filing an
appeal in writing to the Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections no
later than 10 business days after the date of the billing statement. On
appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of providing satisfactory
objective proof of occupancy. [Amended 12-18-2018 by Ord. No.
17-2018]
B. Public nuisance and exterior non-code compliance. The mortgagee or
owner shall have the right to appeal the determination that a building
or structure is a public nuisance or the exterior is non-code compliant
to the Housing Code Board of Appeals upon filing an appeal in writing
to the Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections no later than 10
business days after notification of said determination. On appeal, the
mortgagee or owner shall bear the burden that the property is not a
public nuisance and the exterior is code compliant.
C. Fees. The fee for filing of an appeal to Housing Code Board of Appeals
shall be $100, which fee may be changed from time to time by
resolution of City Council. Failure to submit the appropriate fee with
the request for an appeal shall result in automatic denial of the appeal.
In addition to said fee, the appellant shall be responsible for all costs
incurred to conduct a hearing beyond that covered by the fee, including
advertising and legal fees.
257. Editor's Note: See 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 2301 et seq.
§ 282-13 LANCASTER CODE § 282-15

§ 282-15. Administration and enforcement.
Administration and enforcement of this chapter shall remain under the
control of the Bureau of Code Compliance and Inspections and the
Lancaster City Bureau of Fire. The City of Lancaster retains the right to
engage the services of a third party to administer any or all of the provisions
of this chapter.
§ 282-16. Violations and penalties.
A. Violations. The failure or refusal for any reason of any mortgagee,
owner, or local agent of an owner acting on behalf of the owner to file a
registration statement, to pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter, or to appear for an inspection shall
constitute a violation. The violations shall be deemed a strict liability
offense.
B. Prosecution of violations. The Chief Building Official and/or Bureau
Chief of Code Compliance and Inspections or the Fire Marshal or their
designee(s) shall have the authority to institute the appropriate
proceedings at law or in equity, to correct or abate such violation of the
provisions of this chapter or of the order or direction made pursuant
thereto. Such authority shall include but not be limited to the institution
of summary criminal proceedings via the issuance of a nontraffic
citation in accord with the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedures
in the court of appropriate jurisdiction.
C. Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter
shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not less
than $500 nor more than $1,000 for the first two continual and
uncorrected failure or refusal to register, or for each failure or refusal
to pay, and not exceeding $5,000 for the third and any subsequent
continual and uncorrected failure or refusal to register or for each
subsequent failure or refusal to pay, or imprisonment for any term not
exceeding 90 days. Each day that a violation of this chapter continues,
or each section of this chapter which shall be found to have been
violated, shall constitute a separate offense.
D. Remediation of public nuisance. In addition to the fines as set forth
above, the owner of the property can be required to immediately
address and eliminate the public nuisance. Failure to do so within 15
business days of notification, weather permitting, will allow the City to
proceed to hire a qualified contractor of its sole choosing to eliminate
the public nuisance. The City shall bill the owner for said work, and
payment will be due within 15 business days of the date of the invoice,
or do the work itself. Failure of the owner to pay the City will constitute
a debt due and owing to the City, and the City may either enter a lien on
the property for the full amount invoiced, plus costs, or turn it over to a
collection agency for receipt as provided by law.
§ 282-15 TELEPHONE COMPANIES § 282-17
271:1031
§ 282-17. Compliance with other codes.
In no instance shall the registration of abandoned real estate or a vacant
building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate
the owner, local agent or other responsible party from responsibility for
compliance with any other City of Lancaster code or ordinance.
§ 282-18. Nonexclusive remedies.
The penalty, collection and lien provisions of this chapter shall be
independent, non-mutually exclusive separate remedies, all of which shall
be available to the City of Lancaster as may be deemed appropriate for
carrying out the proposes of this chapter. The remedies and procedures
provided in this chapter for violation hereof are not intended to supplant
or replace to any degree the remedies and procedures available to the City
of Lancaster in the case of a violation of any other City of Lancaster Code
or Ordinance, whether or not such other code or ordinance is referenced in
this chapter, and whether or not an ongoing violation of such other code or
ordinance is cited as the underlying ground for a finding of a violation of
this chapter.
§ 282-19. Blighted property review.
Nothing in this chapter shall be meant or utilized to override or circumvent
a property under consideration, review and in the process of rehabilitation
by the City of Lancaster Property Reinvestment Board program. A property
under agreement with the Lancaster Property Reinvestment Board or
Redevelopment Authority of the City of Lancaster to be rehabilitated shall
continue to be required to register as abandoned real estate or a vacant
building or structure pursuant to this chapter.

HP space shall be made available to any City resident or parent or
guardian of a City resident without a fee.
B. Application. The application will be designed and developed by the
Administrator, but shall include, at a minimum, the identity of the
applicant, the address of the applicant, the make, model and
registration plate number of the applicant's vehicle (if any), the type of
disability, whether the disability is permanent or temporary, whether
off-street parking is available immediately adjacent to or on the
applicant's property, the location of the current HP spaces on the same
block where the applicant resides, an appropriate waiver of applicable
privacy laws prepared by the City Solicitor, and a signature section. The
application shall also contain a clause informing the applicant that the
§ 285-127 TELEPHONE COMPANIES § 285-128
271:1081
§ 285-129. Eligibility and determination.
applicant is required to notify the Administrator immediately if and
when the applicant moves from the address set forth on the application
or no longer has a disability or no longer possesses a valid handicapped
registration plate or placard. Upon receipt of any application from
such handicapped or disabled individual or such person's parent or
guardian, the Administrator may collect other relevant information
as the Administrator deems necessary, including medical records
evidencing the applicant's ongoing disability. [Amended 11-15-2005
by Ord. No. 19-2005; 2-22-2011 by Ord. No. 4-2011]
A. In general. After acquiring a handicapped or disabled veteran's
registration plate or placard from the Department, any City resident
may file an application for the creation of a HP space upon the block
which the resident resides. The possession of a handicapped or disabled
veteran's registration plate or placard does not guarantee that the
resident's application for a HP space will be granted.
B. Statement of disability. All applications for an HP space must be
supported by proof of the applicant's asserted disability from a medical
doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or doctor of podiatry medicine
(collectively, "physician"). The physician's statement must be
typewritten upon the physicians letterhead, signed by the applicant's
physician, must not be issued more than six months prior to the date of
the application and must specifically set forth the nature of the
impairment, how the impairment limits the applicant's mobility under
Subsection C below, and the estimated duration of the applicant's
impairment. Notwithstanding the applicant's provision of a physician's
statement of disability, the Administrator may require the applicant to
provide additional medical records evidencing the applicant's ongoing
disability. [Amended 11-15-2005 by Ord. No. 19-2005]
C. Criteria. In order to provide an adequate number of HP spaces in a
particular block and to preserve adequate parking spaces for all City
residents, before the City creates a HP space, the Administrator must
determine that the limitations upon the number and placement of HP
spaces on a particular block set forth in § 285-130 will not be exceeded
if the requested HP space is created, that the applicant has proven that
there is no handicapped accessible off-street parking available to the
applicant, and that the applicant meets one or more of the following:
(1) The applicant is medically required to use portable oxygen;
(2) The applicant has limited or no use of one or both legs;
(3) The applicant suffers from severe limitation in the ability to walk
due to any arthritic, neurological or orthopedic condition or any
physical ailment that prevents the applicant from walking 200 feet
without stopping to rest;
§ 285-128 LANCASTER CODE § 285-129
271:1082
§ 285-130. Limitation on number of handicapped parking spaces.
Neither the Administrator nor the Traffic Commission may authorize HP
space(s) in excess of the limitations set forth below:
(4) The applicant suffers from a serious cardiac condition to the extent
that the person's functional limitations are classified in severity as
Class III or Class IV according to the standards set by the American
Heart Association; or
(5) The applicant suffers from any other physical or mental impairment
not heretofore mentioned which constitutes a substantial degree of
disability and imposes great difficulty on the applicant to walk more
than 200 feet without stopping.
D. Final determination. After collecting all pertinent information, the
Administrator will review and investigate all information related to the
application. The Administrator may obtain an independent medical
review of the applicant's medical records and asserted disability. The
Administrator shall deny the application if the medical review does not
support the claimant's asserted ongoing disability. The Administrator
may approve and authorize the creation of the HP space and installation
signage in accordance with applicable state laws and regulations, as
well as defining the duration of its validity, if the Administrator
determines the applicant has met the requirements of this Article. In
the event the Administrator determines the applicant has not met the
requirements of this Article, the Administrator shall deny the
application and inform the applicant in writing as to the denial and the
reason(s) for the denial. The applicant has the right to appeal the
decision of the Administrator to the Traffic Commission. The applicant
shall file an appeal of the Administrator's decision within 20 days of the
date thereof with the Traffic Commission or its designee. The Traffic
Commission shall hear the appeal at its next regularly scheduled
meeting occurring more than seven days after the filing of the appeal.
The applicant and the City, including the Administrator, shall be entitled
to present evidence in support of their position before the Traffic
Commission. If the application is denied on the basis of a medical
review, the applicant must present the testimony of a physician in
support of the application to the Traffic Commission. The Traffic
Commission's decision on the appeal shall be final.
E. Nonexclusive right. If a HP space is created under this Article, the HP
space so created may be used by any person parking a vehicle lawfully
bearing registration plates or placards issued to handicapped persons
or disabled veterans. This Article shall not be construed as granting the
applicant the exclusive right to park his/her vehicle in the HP space
created hereunder.
F. Other parking regulations. Nothing in this Article shall exempt
individuals utilizing HP spaces from other parking restrictions or
regulations applicable to the space/block.
§ 285-129 TELEPHONE COMPANIES § 285-130
271:1083
§ 285-131. Placement of signs.
A. Central Business District. No additional HP spaces may be granted by
the Administrator or the Traffic Commission within the Central
Business District, (CB and CB1), as defined by the Zoning Ordinance272
of the City of Lancaster. The Director of Public Works may direct the
installation of a HP space within the Central Business District as he/she
deems appropriate. [Amended 11-15-2005 by Ord. No. 19-2005]
B. One-way roadways. When the roadway is a one-way roadway, no more
than two HP spaces may be granted on each side of the block on which
parking is permitted.
C. Two-way roadways. When the roadway is a two-way street, no more
than three HP spaces may be granted on each side of the block on
which parking is permitted.
D. Other parking restrictions. The Administrator and Traffic Commission
may consider other parking restrictions applicable to a particular block
and other information regarding the block including but not limited to
the size of the block, and may further restrict the number of HP spaces
to maintain an adequate number of unregulated parking spaces, as they
deem appropriate.
E. Council action. City Council may authorize more than the maximum
number of HP spaces on a particular block by ordinance setting forth
the block which is excluded from this limitation and the maximum
number of HP spaces permitted on that particular block. Any such
ordinance shall expire and be of no further force and effect after the
expiration of two years from the effective date of the amending
ordinance, unless reenacted by Council. The Administrator shall notify
City Council, the Traffic Commission and each applicant on the subject
block no more than 90 days and no less than 60 days prior to the
expiration of such ordinance.
F. Existing HP spaces. HP spaces in excess of the limitations set forth in
this section and existing on the effective date of this ordinance shall be
permitted to remain in place, subject to the removal after complaint
(§ 285-131) and the annual reporting requirement set forth in
§ 285-132.
A. Generally. For a single application for a HP space, sign placements will
be positioned as close as possible to the place of residence of the
applicant as the street design permits. In the event more than the
permissible number of HP spaces are requested on a one- or two-way
roadway, the HP spaces may be located or relocated in the center of the
block or otherwise adequately positioned to collectively reflect, as a
whole, the needs of all applicants, as determined by the Administrator.

B. Authority to post. The City of Lancaster Department of Public Works
Director will direct all postings, sign removals and replacements of HP
spaces in accordance with Department rules and regulations. The
Administrator will report the posting or removal of handicapped
parking signs and all actions taken upon applications for handicapped
parking spaces to the Traffic Commission at the next scheduled
meeting.
C. Disputes regarding sign placement. The Administrator shall be
responsible for investigating City and citizen complaints regarding the
placement of handicapped parking signs. The Administrator shall
require all complaints be in writing and shall conduct an investigation
of the complaint within 90 calendar days. Upon conducting an
investigation, the Administrator shall report the complaint, its
investigation, and the Administrator's recommendation to the Traffic
Commission. The Traffic Commission shall resolve all complaints in a
manner it deems just and appropriate, including but not limited to the
removal of the HP space. The complainant, block residents, applicant
and City, including the Administrator, shall be entitled to present
evidence to the Traffic Commission. Strict rules of evidence shall not
apply, but the Traffic Commission may limit or prohibit irrelevant,
repetitive or hearsay testimony. The Administrator shall inform the
complainant, applicant, and interested parties of the Traffic
Commission's action upon the complaint.
A. Annual reporting. After approval of the application, the applicant shall
submit an annual renewal application. The renewal application shall be
designed by the Administrator and require the applicant to verify the
continuance of his/her disability. The Administrator shall require an
applicant to submit an updated physician's statement of the applicant's
disability, based on the criteria set forth under § 285-129. The
Administrator may require the applicant to submit medical records,
other than a physician's statement, which evidences the applicant's
ongoing disability. In January of each year, the Administrator shall mail

the request of the City shall be stored at the towing company's
storage facility or at property owned, controlled or designated by

towing company to respond. Generally, if the towing company fails to
respond within 20 minutes after being requested, the next available
towing company on the towing rotation may be requested. Nothing in

available to tow vehicles for the City, the towing company shall notify

Police within two business days of any modifications to information
provided in the towing company's license application.

within seven days of the change.

facility. All fees for such public towing services and storage shall be

City that the vehicle was towed in error, in which case no charges will
be assessed against the owner. If the error is that of the towing
company, no charges will be assessed. If the error is that of the City,

success the continued vitality of the City depends, would significantly and
substantially contribute to the City's revitalization and be, therefore, in the
public interest.

alleys or highways within the limits of the City, a front foot assessment
shall be levied by the Bureau of Water upon all properties fronting upon the
streets, alleys or highways at the rate of $3 per foot on each side of the
street, alley or highway in which the main is laid or extended. However, on
any street, alley or highway in which it is impossible or impracticable to lay
the main in the center of the street, the Director of the Department of Public
Works may direct mains to be laid on both sides of the street at the curbs,
in which case, the assessment per front foot shall be $4 instead of $3 as
hereinbefore provided.
§ 295-79. Nonpayment of assessment; surcharge. [Amended
7-26-2005 by Ord. No. 15-2005]
The Director of the Department of Public Works shall levy or cause to be
levied the water frontage assessment for the installation of such main or
mains and certify the same to the City Treasurer. The assessment shall
be due and payable upon notice of such assessment being given the City
Treasurer to each owner assessed. If not paid within 30 days thereafter, a
penalty in accordance with Chapter 36, Municipal Claims, shall be added
thereto and an accurate description of their several properties shall be
certified by the City Treasurer to the City Solicitor, who shall enter the
same, plus all other amounts due under Chapter 36, Municipal Claims, and

collect the same according to law.
§ 295-80. Assessment on corner lots.
In the case of corner lots, the assessment shall be levied in full for the
length on which the improvements erected on such lots, or intended to be
erected, front. When mains are laid in the street adjoining the side of such
corner lot, an allowance of 100 feet shall be made. However, when a corner
lot has erected upon it two or more separate tenements, there shall only be
an allowance equal to the depth of the corner tenement.
§ 295-81. Prospective extension.
In all cases where an extension of City water mains has been requested by
a prospective extendor and the anticipated income to be derived from such
extension does not warrant that the capital investment required therefor be
made by the City, then, if the proposed extendor still desires to have such
water main extension made and is willing to pay the cost thereof and the
City is willing to have such extension made to its water supply system, the
same shall be done on the terms and conditions outlined herein.
§ 295-78 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 295-82
287:1161
§ 295-82. Pipe dimension.
§ 295-83. Leasing.
Upon completion of such waterline and its approval and acceptance by
the City, the line shall be and remain the property of the extendor, who
shall thereupon lease the same to the City upon the following terms and
conditions:
A. No extension of waterlines shall be permitted for a pipe having a
diameter of less than six inches.
B. The extendor shall cause such water main extension to be laid in
accordance with City specifications and at all times subject to City
inspection and approval and shall pay for the entire cost of such
extension, provided that if the City so elects, it may require the
extendor to make the extension of pipe having a larger diameter than
the extendor requires for his own use. If the City requires the extendor
to lay a larger pipe than the extendor requires, it shall pay the extendor
the difference in the cost of the size pipe needed by the consumer and
the size pipe prescribed by the City for such extension.
C. Any extendor shall satisfy the Director of Public Works that he is
financially able to pay for the cost of the proposed extension. Actual
construction work for the same shall commence within 60 days of the
date of the extension agreement between the City and the extendor and
shall be completed within a reasonable time, or at the option of the City,
the extension agreement shall be canceled at no cost to the City. The
Director may, for good and sufficient cause, grant the extendor
additional time to start construction, but such construction shall be
started unless the entire project is assured of completion according to
plan.
A. The term of the lease shall be for a period of no more than 10 years from
the time the line is placed in service.
B. The City shall maintain and operate the line, bearing all expense with
relation thereto, and serve water therefrom to the consumers and other
parties connecting to the same.
C. The extendor shall receive water from the City through such line and
pay the City for the same at the published rates of the City for such
service which may be in effect from time to time during such service.
The consumer shall be bound by all rules and regulations of the City
relating to water service.
D. During the term of such lease, while ownership of the line remains in
the extendor, no other person shall be allowed to connect to such line
unless such person pays the extendor a connection fee in accordance
with the following schedules which shall apply for single service
connection to a single property.
§ 295-82 LANCASTER CODE § 295-83
287:1162
(1) The following connection fee rates shall apply when the extension
was performed by municipalities, commercial enterprises and
developers:
Service Connection
Size
(inches) Fee
3/4 $100
1 $150
1 1/4 $200
1 1/2 $300
2 $500
4 $2,000
(2) This connection fee shall be applicable where a three-fourths-inch
or one-inch connection is made to an extension that was performed
as a noncommercial, nondevelopmental extension by owners or
occupants of residential properties acting either individually or in
combination for the purpose of extending waterlines to their
properties for their personal use. In such cases the connection fee
for each new connection shall be a sum computed by multiplying
the total cost of the water main, less any extension fees paid from
time to time pursuant to Subsection E hereof, by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be one and the denominator of which
shall be the sum of the number of properties single service
connected to the water main as of the date of the new connection
plus one representing the new property to be connected.
(3) Example.
(a) Assume six property owners combined to extend a water main
at a cost of $1,000. Further assume that a total of 10 properties
are located along the line but that four of them did not elect to
participate in construction of the line. The connection fee that
would be charged in the event that any of the four properties
would later elect to connect to the water main would be
computed as follows:
§ 295-83 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 295-83
287:1163
Connection fee =
Total cost
of
Water Main x
1
Number
of
properties
single
service
connected
+
1 for the
new
property
$142.85 = $1,000.00
x
1
6 + 1
(b) Based upon the above example, the seventh property to
connect would pay an extension fee of $142.85 which would be
paid to the original six extenders, $23.80 each, and would
reduce their original cost from $166.66 each or 1/6 of $1,000
to $142.85 or the same as the seventh connector. When the
eighth property connected, its cost would be $125 or 1/8 of
$1,000 with the connection fee being returned to the original
six extenders and so on through the ninth and tenth
connectors.
E. In the case of another extendor who wishes to connect to such water
main for the purpose of laying his own main to serve a number of
prospective consumers therefrom, such extendor shall pay the owner/
lessor an amount which represents no more than 50% of the cost of
such water main up to the point of such connection after deducting
from such cost any connection fees already paid for connections to the
waterline up to the point of connection. Such other extendor shall not
be entitled to receive any connection fees for connections made to the
original line, but shall be entitled to be reimbursed for the line which he
himself pays for in accordance with a lease similar to that provided for
herein.
F. At no time shall the extendor be entitled to recover more than the total
cost of the waterline, calculated without interest. If such total cost has
been recovered prior to 10 years from the date when the line was
placed in service, the lease shall terminate at the time of the recovery of
such cost. If the total cost has not been recovered within 10 years from
the date when the line was placed in service, it shall terminate, in all
events, at the end of the ten-year period and the right of the extendor to
recover any more costs shall cease.
G. The City shall charge an extendor or single service connector a service
fee of 5% of the extension or connection fee, but not more than $100,
which shall be paid by the extendor or connector, in addition to the fee
§ 295-83 LANCASTER CODE § 295-83
287:1164
§ 295-84. City extensions.
The City shall have the right at all times to make connections to the lines
of the extendor and lay additional water mains at its own cost, without
the payment of any connection fee to the extendor, provided that such
extensions and additions so made by the City are solely for the improvement
of its water service and no consumers are connected thereto. If any
consumer connections are made to any such additions made by the City,
then such lines shall be subject to the terms of the lease as if made by a
private extendor.
§ 295-85. City contribution to cost.
In the event that the City makes a contribution towards the cost of laying
the waterline, representing the difference in cost of the size of pipe as
contemplated in § 295-82B, then such contribution shall be deemed to
represent as many linear feet of waterline as the linear foot cost of the
entire line, and the City Authority shall own the initial number of linear
feet thus represented, so that the line owned by the extendor and leased
to the City shall be deemed to start at the point where the initial number
of linear feet ends. (Example: A twelve-inch waterline for 5,000 linear feet
costs $50,000 or $10 per linear foot. The City contributes $15,000 for the
difference in cost between six-inch pipe and twelve-inch pipe. The City
Authority would own the initial 1,500 feet of twelve-inch waterline and the
remaining 3,500 feet would be owned by the extendor and leased to the City
as herein provided.)
§ 295-86. Extension decisions.
The final decision on whether or not an extension to the waterlines shall
be permitted on the conditions outlined herein or otherwise, shall be and
remain with the City. The City Authority, which shall become the ultimate
owner of waterlines extended as herein provided, shall be notified of each
lease agreement relating thereto and receive a copy thereof.
due, to compensate the City for services performed related to the
connection or extension.
H. Upon termination of the lease, the extendor shall dedicate the waterline
to the City Authority and it shall thereupon become a part of the water
distribution system.

§ 300-1 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-1
287:1173
§ 300-2. Districts established.
In order to implement the purposes of this chapter, the City of Lancaster
is hereby divided into the following zoning districts, with the designations
and general purposes listed below. Wherever the term "residential districts"
appears in this chapter, those districts described in Subsections A through
and including F shall be included.
(17) Appropriate and enforceable regional ordinances, regulations, and
techniques will be adopted to address issues such as mixed-use
development, traditional neighborhoods, compact residential
areas, and agricultural preservation.
A. R1 District (Residential Detached Dwellings). The R1 District is the only
area of the City offering a "suburban" environment for City residents,
with relatively large residential lots permitting only single-family
detached dwellings and nonresidential uses limited to home
occupations, park and recreation facilities, and day care centers.
B. R2 District (Residential Semidetached Dwellings). The R2 District is a
restrictive single-family residential area with intermediate lot sizes
permitting only single-family detached and semidetached dwellings and
a limited variety of cultural, institutional and recreational uses.
C. R3 District (Residential Medium Density Dwellings). The R3 District is
characterized by the predominance of attached, or row, houses, and
smaller lot sizes. A variety of small, neighborhood-oriented or lowimpact
commercial retail and service uses are permitted by special
exception, as well as a limited number of institutional and cultural/
recreational uses.
D. R4 District (Residential High-Density Dwellings and Commercial
Services). The R4 District is characterized by the past conversion of
many single-family dwellings to two-family and multifamily dwellings
and to small professional offices and other commercial services. While
this is a residential district, a variety of commercial, institutional, and
cultural/recreational uses are permitted by special exception.
E. RO District (High-Density Residential, Office and Institutional Uses).
The RO District is characterized by the conversion of many structures
to professional offices, or to combination office and multifamily
structures, and by a variety of office and institutional uses.
F. MU District (Mixed Use). The MU District includes areas of the City
characterized by residential uses in close proximity to nonresidential
uses, including historic warehouses and manufacturing facilities, many
of which have been vacated by the original industries. In addition, the
MU District includes undeveloped land where new mixed-use
residential and nonresidential development with traditional
neighborhood character is recommended. A variety of residential,
commercial, cultural, light industrial and other miscellaneous uses are
§ 300-1 LANCASTER CODE § 300-2
287:1174
permitted in order to encourage the reuse of former manufacturing
structures and undeveloped land. This is the only zoning district which
permits both dwellings and a variety of manufacturing uses to coexist.
However, since the MU District is considered primarily as a highdensity
residential district, all manufacturing uses must meet certain
conditions and receive special exception approval.
G. CB District (Central Business). The CB District is the commercial hub of
the City and serves the metropolitan area as a regional center for
government, law, finance, culture, entertainment, and support
businesses. A wide range of commercial, retail, cultural, high-density
residential, and institutional uses are permitted by right and by special
exception. In order to promote high-density development, this zoning
district permits 100% building and lot coverage and waives all off-street
parking requirements.
H. CB1 District (Central Business Core). The CB1 District is the
commercial and cultural core of the Central Business District. In order
to encourage intense, positive pedestrian activity and consumer
transactions, certain uses that are not consumer- or visitor-oriented are
prohibited on the ground, or street-level, floors of buildings. A wide
range of commercial, retail, cultural, entertainment, and professional
uses are permitted by right and by special exception. In order to
promote high-density development, this zoning district permits 100%
building and lot coverage and waives all off-street parking
requirements.
I. C1 District (Neighborhood Commercial). The C1 District is a
neighborhood-oriented commercial area with uses serving residents of
the immediate area and is characterized by storefront businesses in
combination with upper-level dwelling units. A variety of low-impact
retail/commercial uses oriented to pedestrian traffic are permitted by
right and by special exception.
J. C2 District (Urban Commercial). The C2 District is a retail/commercial
area located adjacent to residential districts but serving a wider
geographic area, with retail/service uses oriented more to vehicle
traffic. A variety of higher impact retail/commercial uses, e.g., twentyfour-
hour convenience stores, are permitted by right and by special
exception.
K. C3 District (Regional Commercial). The C3 District is a highwayoriented
retail/commercial district located away from residential
districts and serving geographic areas well beyond the corporate limits
of Lancaster City. A wide range of retail, commercial, institutional, and
cultural/entertainment/recreational uses are permitted by right.
L. CM District (Central Manufacturing). The CM District includes
historical manufacturing/industrial areas of the City, many of which are
located in close proximity to residential districts as well as industrial
sites annexed to the City between 1947 and 1952. A variety of
§ 300-2 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-2
287:1175
§ 300-3. Official Zoning Map.
manufacturing uses are permitted, with special exception approval
required for those uses with potential negative impacts on nearby
residential districts. In addition, certain commercial uses considered
to be compatible with manufacturing/industrial uses are permitted. In
order to encourage reuse of vacant or underutilized manufacturing/
warehousing facilities, other nonresidential uses are also permitted,
subject to certain conditions.
M. SM District (Suburban Manufacturing). The SM District is intended to
accommodate the most intense industrial uses, which have greater land
area requirements and need for close proximity to regional
transportation networks, including railways and limited-access
highways. In addition, to encourage reuse of vacant or underutilized
manufacturing/warehousing sites located away from the City's urban
core and close to regional transportation networks, a limited number of
retail and other commercial uses are permitted by right and by special
exception, with conditional use approval required for larger retail uses.
N. HC District (Hospital Complex). The HC District is designed to provide
locations for facilities that are licensed in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as hospitals and accessory uses. Accessory uses located
within the HC District may be located on a lot that is independent of the
hospital. Parking garages as accessory uses shall be permitted in the
HC District.
O. DF District (Criminal Detention Facilities). The DF District is designed
to provide a location for criminal and juvenile detention facilities. Uses
which support the detention/incarceration facilities shall be permitted
as accessory uses.
P. PO District (Park and Open Space). The PO District is designed to
protect and preserve public parklands, greenways, riparian areas, and
natural environments which consist primarily of grass, landscaping
and/or natural conservation areas and habitats for vegetation and
wildlife, and which may or may not include recreational facilities and
accessory uses/facilities. Privately owned land with public greenway or
conservation easements or with environmentally significant qualities
may be included in this district.
A. Maintaining Official Zoning Map. The City is hereby divided into zoning
districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map, incorporated herein and
made an official part hereof by reference.289 The Official Zoning Map
shall be maintained by the Lancaster City Bureau of Planning and shall
be updated promptly following formal amendments.
B. Amendment of Official Zoning Map. Any amendment of the Official
Zoning Map shall be done in strict conformity with the requirements of
289. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 300-2 LANCASTER CODE § 300-3
287:1176
the PMPC290 or other applicable act of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. If an amendment of the Official Zoning Map is approved
by City Council, such amendment shall be made to the Official Zoning
Map promptly after official approval. In addition to the actual changes
to district boundaries or district classifications, the Bureau of Planning
shall maintain a record of all changes to the Official Zoning Map.
C. Zoning district map. A City of Lancaster zoning district map, which is an
unofficial document, shall be prepared to illustrate the boundaries of all
zoning districts shown on the Official Zoning Map and shall be
maintained in a current status for the purpose of distribution/sale to
interested parties. The zoning district map shall include the following
words: "See the Official Zoning Map for exact up-to-date zoning district
boundaries."
D. Overlay districts.
(1) CO District (Campus Overlay). The CO District provides an optional
set of provisions within the core campuses of colleges. The CO
District is intended to streamline the process for new buildings,
additions and facilities within the core campus of a college, while
maintaining more restrictive regulations in place for college uses
that may occur in surrounding residential areas. The intent is to
allow flexibility within the interior of a campus, while still carefully
controlling uses that are outside of the core campus, including
along the perimeter of a college. See § 300-19 for allowed uses and
§ 300-20 for dimensional requirements.
(2) Floodplain Districts. Floodplain districts, as defined and regulated
in Article VII, § 300-39, of this chapter shall be overlays to the
existing underlying districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map,
and as such, the provisions for the floodplain districts shall serve as
a supplement to the underlying district provisions.
(3) Historic Resource District.
(a) The Historic Resource District is that area officially recognized
by the U.S. Department of the Interior's National Park Service
and Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission as the
Lancaster City Historic District, also known as the "National
Register Historic District." The boundaries of the Historic
Resource District are identified on the map entitled, "National
Register Historic District," and displayed in the office of the
City Zoning Officer. The historic district regulations shall apply
in addition to the zoning requirements. Those provisions for
certain uses or improvements and regulations pertaining
thereto within the historic resource district shall apply only to
properties within the area as noted on the above-mentioned
map.

287:1177
(b) See the regulations of Chapter 155 of the City's Codified
Ordinances, including for the Historic Districts and the
Heritage Conservation District.
E. Replacement of Official Zoning Map or part thereof.
(1) In the event that digital data used to create the Zoning Map is lost,
corrupted or destroyed, the Bureau of Planning shall digitally
prepare a new Official Zoning Map, which shall supersede the prior
Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct
drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior Official Zoning
Map, or to update base map information, but no such corrections
shall have the effect of amending the adopted zoning district
boundaries, unless the procedures are followed for a lawful
amendment.
(2) A list of the dates of future amendments, including a brief
description of Zoning Map changes, should be maintained as an
appendix to this chapter.

ARTICLE III
Application of District Regulations
§ 300-5. Overall requirements.
The regulations set by this chapter within each district shall be minimum
regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure
or land except as hereinafter provided or as provided for in the City of
Lancaster Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.291
§ 300-6. Relationship to other laws and regulations.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion of the
public health, safety, morals or general welfare. Wherever the requirements
of this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully
A. No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and
no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, unless in
conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the district in
which it is located.
B. No part of a yard, or other open space, or off-street parking or loading
space required in connection with any structure or use for the purpose
of complying with this chapter shall be included as part of a yard, open
space, or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any
other structure or use, unless specifically provided for otherwise

proposed use is a continuation of the single-family dwelling, and
municipal property taxes are paid to the adjoining municipality, the
zoning regulations of the adjoining municipality shall apply to the entire
lot. In the event the adjoining municipality declines to accept
jurisdiction, then the zoning regulations of the City shall apply to that
portion of the property within the City.

ARTICLE IV
Nonconforming Lots, Uses and Structures
§ 300-7. Intent.
Within the districts established by this chapter, or amendments hereto,
there exist lots, uses, and structures which were lawful before this chapter
was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this chapter or future amendments. It is
the intent of this chapter to permit lawful nonconforming lots, uses and
structures to continue to exist, subject to the following controls and
restrictions.
§ 300-8. Nonconforming lots.
A. Undeveloped lots of record.
(1) In any district, any permitted use and accessory structure may be
erected on any single, undeveloped lot of record with
nonconforming area, depth and/or width dimensions in existence at
the effective date of this chapter or amendment thereto, provided
that all yard, height, lot coverage and other applicable
requirements are met. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not have continuous frontage with other lots in the same
ownership.
(2) When two or more nonconforming undeveloped lots of record have
continuous frontage and are in single ownership at the effective
date of this chapter or amendment thereto, the land involved shall
be considered to be one undivided parcel under the terms of this
chapter. No portion of said parcel shall be used, sold or subdivided
in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot dimension and
area requirements established by this chapter.
B. Subdivision of lots with existing structures. When one or more
structures exist on a lot proposed for subdivision and there exists a
nonconformity with regard to the dimensional requirements of Article
VI, except as to lot area, the lot may be subdivided without necessity for
meeting those dimensional requirements with which the lot is
nonconforming, provided all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The proposed lot lines do not create further nonconformities;
(2) The proposed lots meet the minimum lot area requirements of
Article VI;
(3) The proposed lot lines do not adversely affect the provisions of any
existing or potential off-street parking as required under Article
VIII;
(4) The existing rear access to the lot or lots, as required under Article
VII, § 300-32, is not eliminated; and
§ 300-7 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-8
287:1183
§ 300-9. Nonconforming uses.
From and after the effective date of this chapter, any lawful use of
structures and/or land existing at the time of enactment of this chapter or
amendment thereto but not permitted by the provisions of Article V may be
continued, subject to the following limitations:
(5) Any lot created, which does not contain an existing structure,
meets the minimum lot area and width requirements of Article VI.
A. Expansion or relocation on lot. A nonconforming use may be expanded
or relocated within a building or on its existing lot, provided that the
expansion or relocation is in conformity with the area, height and bulk
regulations of Article VI, the parking requirements of Article VIII, and
all other applicable provisions of this chapter, and that the Zoning
Hearing Board grants special exception approval of the expansion or
relocation. The applicant shall present evidence to the Board that the
following impact factors have been satisfactorily addressed so that the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood will be protected:
(1) Hours of operation;
(2) Outdoor storage of refuse, equipment or materials;
(3) Noise, odors, light glare, and vibrations;
(4) Off-street parking and loading areas;
(5) Traffic generation;
(6) Proposed structural alterations, including impact on historically
significant structures; and
(7) Compatibility with the immediate neighborhood and the district.
B. Expansion of nonconforming single-family dwelling. Where an existing
nonconforming single-family dwelling exists in a district that does not
permit such a dwelling, expansion of a single-family detached,
semidetached, or attached dwelling may occur, provided the minimum
yards, maximum building height, and maximum percentage of lot
coverage is in accordance with the respective requirements of the R3
District.
C. Substitution of nonconforming uses. The Zoning Hearing Board may by
special exception permit the change from one nonconforming use to
another nonconforming use, provided that all conditions required in
Article V for the use where it is permitted are met and the Zoning
Hearing Board determines that the proposed nonconforming use is not
more detrimental to the immediate neighborhood and the district than
the existing nonconforming use. The applicant shall present evidence to
the Zoning Hearing Board that the impact factors as defined in Article
XVII of this chapter have been satisfactorily addressed.
§ 300-8 LANCASTER CODE § 300-9
287:1184
§ 300-10. Nonconforming structures.
D. Replacement of a nonconforming use by a permitted use. If a
nonconforming use is replaced by a permitted use, a nonconforming
use may not thereafter be resumed.
E. Discontinuance of a nonconforming use. When a nonconforming use is
discontinued for 12 consecutive months, except when government
action impedes access to the premises, only uses permitted in
conformity with the regulations of the district will be permitted, unless
the Zoning Hearing Board, by special exception, approves an extension
of the twelve-month period.
A. Continuation of nonconforming structures. Where a nonconforming
structure exists at the effective date of this chapter or amendment
thereto that could not be built or erected under the terms of this
chapter by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot coverage, height,
yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the
structure, such structure may continue to exist as long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) No such nonconforming structure may be physically enlarged or
altered in a way which increases its volume or nonconformity, but
any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its
nonconformity.
(2) A nonconforming structure that has been destroyed by fire,
windstorm, or other causes deemed to be no fault of the owner may
be reconstructed in accordance with the current zoning provisions
by right, or, by special exception, may be rebuilt to the size of the
destroyed structure and in the same location, provided the
reconstructed structure does not exceed the height, area or volume
of the destroyed structure. In the case of flood, structures
destroyed or damaged in excess of 50% of their replacement value
may be reconstructed as stipulated above, provided that said
structures are elevated or floodproofed in accordance with
applicable codes and ordinances of the City. A City building permit
for the replacement structure must be obtained within one year
from the date of destruction or the nonconforming structure shall
not be restored except in conformity with this chapter. [Amended
7-11-2017 by Ord. No. 10-2017]
(3) Should such structure or part thereof be moved for any reason for
any distance other than to increase its conformity with current
zoning provisions, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for
the district in which it is located after it is moved. [Amended
7-11-2017 by Ord. No. 10-2017]

§ 300-11. Historically significant structures.
safety or comply with municipal, state and/or federal code
requirements shall be permitted, provided no increase in volume of the
structure or change of location occurs.
A. Residential structures. In zoning districts that do not permit singlefamily
dwellings, any historically significant structure, as defined in
Article XVII of this chapter, originally constructed as a single-family
residence may, upon application to the Zoning Officer for a certificate of
zoning compliance by the owner or equitable owner of said structure,
revert to a single-family residential usage. Further, the owner of the
historically significant structure may restore said structure to its
original dimensions/specifications, regardless of the zoning restrictions
which prevail in the district in which said structure is located.
B. Mixed-use facility. In order to permit the adaptive reuse of existing
buildings originally constructed for industrial-related uses, an existing
building in a CM District may contain, in addition to uses permitted by
right or by special exception in the CM District, certain uses not
otherwise permitted in the CM District, as identified by footnotes crossreferencing
this § 300-11B in § 300-15, Table of Permitted Uses,
provided that the applicant is granted special exception approval by the
Zoning Hearing Board and presents evidence that the proposed use will
not adversely impact any existing uses in the immediate area.
Alterations to the facade of the building shall not have an adverse effect
on the historic character of the structure, as determined by the City of
Lancaster Historic Preservation Specialist. All other provisions of this
chapter shall apply.
C. Commercial storefronts. A corner structure within a R3 or R4 District or
any structure within a C1 or C2 District which possesses a commercial
storefront that has been converted to a residential unit and lacks the
off-street parking necessary to satisfy the parking requirement for a
commercial use may be granted a reduction or waiver of the parking
requirement, with special exception approval of the Zoning Hearing
Board, in order to convert the storefront to a commercial-retail or
commercial-service use as permitted in the district where the structure
is located, provided that the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Hearing Board that the requested reduction or waiver of
the parking requirement will not have an adverse impact on an area
within 300 feet of the property; all exterior alterations, repairs and
signage are carried out so as to retain existing historic components of
the structure and to return the storefront to a commercial appearance;
and if the structure is located in the Historic Resource Overlay District
and exterior alterations visible from a public street are proposed, the
applicant provides a letter from the City of Lancaster Historic
Preservation Specialist prior to the zoning hearing stating that the
alteration is appropriate and consistent with the Secretary of the
§ 300-10 LANCASTER CODE § 300-11
287:1186
§ 300-12. Nonconforming parking/loading-unloading facilities.
When the parking/loading-unloading facilities for a use are nonconforming,
the provisions of Article VIII, § 300-47, Exemptions, shall apply when such
use is expanded or changed.
§ 300-13. Nonconforming signs.
Nonconforming signs shall not be expanded or relocated and shall
otherwise comply with applicable provisions of Article IX.
§ 300-14. Nonconforming square footage of uses.
Interior's standards and will have no adverse impact on the historic
resource nor on the streetscape and immediate neighborhood.
A. When a nonconformity exists as to maximum square footage of a
current use otherwise permitted by right or by special exception in a
district, a replacement use with a square footage limitation less than
the actual size of the previous use may, by special exception, be
increased to the size of the previous use, provided that the applicant
presents evidence to the Zoning Hearing Board that impact factors, as
defined in Article XVII of this chapter, have been satisfactorily
addressed.
B. For example, an existing retail store may have existed with a floor area
of 3,000 square feet, which was larger than would be allowed under this
chapter for a new use. That same retail store square footage could be
approved to be converted into an office, even though an office would
otherwise not be allowed to be that large in size in that district.

(1) A sketch plan submission to the City Planning Commission is very
strongly encouraged to allow the Commission to review the overall
site layout and to discuss general concerns before the applicant
expends significant costs for detailed engineering.
(2) The application shall be considered a "planned residential
development" (PRD) and shall comply with all requirements and
procedures for such development under the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. The Lancaster City
Planning Commission shall be the official review and approval
agency for a PRD and shall have final authority to approve,
conditionally approve or deny a PRD.
(3) The applicant shall file an application for tentative approval of a
development plan for a flexible residential development which
satisfies the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance, Stormwater Management
Ordinance, Heritage Conservation District and Historic District
Ordinances and other applicable City codes and ordinances, unless
provisions of these ordinances are specifically modified in this
section. The Bureau of Planning staff, the City Engineer and other
City staff responsible for code enforcement shall review the
application and provide any recommendations to the applicant and
to the Planning Commission.
(4) The Lancaster County Planning Commission shall be provided with
a copy of the application and be provided with 30 days to offer any
review before the City Planning Commission schedules the
application for review.
(5) As part of a final approval, the City Planning Commission shall have
the authority to review and modify any proposed phasing of the
flexible residential development to carry out the provisions of this
section and to ensure proper, timely completion of improvements.
(6) Public hearing, timing and decision. See the procedures
established by Sections 708, 709, 710 and 711 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code,303 which generally provide for the
following:
(a) Tentative approval. An application for tentative approval of a
flexible residential development plan shall be filed by or on the
behalf of the landowner. If the plan is to be developed in
phases, the plan submitted for tentative approval shall identify
each phase, which shall, with the exception of the last phase,
contain a minimum of 25% of the units as depicted on the
flexible residential development plan filed by the applicant.
Within 60 days after plan filing, the City Planning Commission
shall hold a public hearing pursuant to public notice. The
303. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10708, 10709, 10710 and 10711, respectively.
§ 300-23 LANCASTER CODE § 300-23
287:1196
Planning Commission may continue the hearing from one
meeting to the next; provided, however, that the public hearing
or hearings shall be concluded within 60 days after the date
of the first public hearing. Within 60 days following the
conclusion of the public hearing or within 180 days after the
date of filing of the application, whichever occurs first, the
Planning Commission shall either grant tentative approval of
the development plan as submitted, grant tentative approval,
subject to specified conditions, or deny tentative plan approval,
citing specific reasons for denial.
(b) Final approval. Upon meeting all conditions of tentative
approval, the landowner may file an application for final plan
approval. A public hearing on an application for final approval
of the development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required
if the final plan is complete, meets all other applicable City
ordinances, and is in compliance with the tentatively approved
development plan, including any specified conditions. The
Planning Commission shall either grant final approval or refuse
to grant final approval within 45 days from the date of the
regular meeting of the Planning Commission next following the
date the application is filed.
(c) Refusal of final plan approval. If the final plan submission
contains variations from the development plan given tentative
approval, the Planning Commission may refuse to grant final
plan approval and shall, within 45 days from the date of the
regular meeting of the Planning Commission next following the
date the application is filed, so advise the landowner, in
writing, of said refusal, setting forth in said notice the reasons
why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest
and/or citing specific deficiencies found in the plan, in which
case the landowner may either refile his/her application for
final approval without the objectionable variations or file a
written request with the Planning Commission that it hold a
public hearing on the application for final approval.
(d) Action following refusal of final approval. If the landowner
wishes to take either such alternate action, as noted in
Subsection C(6)(c) above, he/she may do so within the time
limit for filing an application for final approval specified by the
official written communication granting tentative approval, or
within 30 additional days if the deadline for applying for final
approval has passed at the time when the landowner is advised
of the Planning Commission's refusal to grant approval. If the
landowner fails to take either alternate action within said time,
he/she shall be deemed to have abandoned the development
plan. Any requested public hearing shall be held pursuant to
public notice within 30 days after the request for the hearing is
made by the landowner. Within 30 days after the conclusion of
§ 300-23 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-23
287:1197
the hearing, the Planning Commission shall, by official written
communication, either grant final approval to the development
plan or deny final approval.
(7) If the Planning Commission, based upon staff review, determines
that the application for tentative approval meets all requirements
that would apply to a final application, then the Planning
Commission may grant final approval, subject to any minor
conditions not requiring Planning Commission review, at the same
time as granting tentative approval. A separate application for final
approval need not be filed by the landowner in this instance.
(8) The time limits for plan review and approval in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code shall not apply if the applicant, in
writing, grants time extensions to the City.
D. Submission requirements.
(1) The applicant shall submit with the application for tentative
approval all plans and documentation that the City's Zoning,
Subdivision and Land Development, and Stormwater Management
Ordinances require for development plans, including the
requirement of this section, except that sign(s) and soil erosion and
sediment control plans, if required, may be submitted with the
application for final plan approval. Plans and documentation shall
include, at a minimum, the following: major natural features,
existing and proposed man-made features, demolitions, proposed
grading, stormwater management, streets and alleys, utility
layouts, and landscaping plans. If phasing is proposed, the
application for tentative approval shall include a schedule
delineating all proposed phases as well as deadlines within which
applications for final plan approval of each phase are intended to
be filed.
(2) For a flexible residential development, the preliminary plan
requirements and procedures in the City Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, as amended, shall apply to and serve the
same purposes as the tentative plan for a planned residential
development provided for under the PA Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended. To comply with the procedures and time limits
established in Sections 707 through 711 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code,304 an application for tentative
approval shall not be waived.
(3) Only adjustments in standards outlined within § 300-23E shall be
allowed. All other requirements in the City's Zoning, Subdivision
and Land Development, and Stormwater Management Ordinances
shall be met.
304. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. §§ 10707 through 10711, respectively.

287:1198
(4) The application for tentative approval shall also include a listing of
any special modifications or waivers requested and the appropriate
supporting documentation and justification for the request.
(5) The applicant shall submit with the application for final approval
conceptual architectural elevations at a scale of 1/8 inch through 1/
2 inch equals one foot zero inch, depicting design and exterior
materials for all proposed exterior building walls facing and/or
visible from a public street or alley. All such elevations shall be
prepared by a qualified professional having experience and abilities
in this field. If similar architectural styles are proposed among
different buildings, then only typical elevations are required. If the
proposed flexible residential development is located within the
Historic Resource Overlay District as provided for in § 300-3D of
this chapter, the applicant shall obtain a certificate of
appropriateness, pursuant to either the City of Lancaster Historic
District Ordinance or Heritage Conservation District Ordinance,
whichever is applicable, for proposed new construction prior to the
issuance of building permits.
(6) To comply with Section 707(5) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,305 the applicant shall provide a written statement
setting forth the reasons why, in his/her opinion, a flexible
residential development would be in the public interest and would
be consistent with the City's community development objectives
and Comprehensive Plan.
E. Standards.
(1) Tract size. The tract shall include a minimum total lot area of 6,000
square feet in all permitted districts. Such a tract may include more
than one existing lot, provided that such lots are contiguous and in
common ownership. A lot or lots where one or more historically
significant principal building(s) are proposed for demolition shall
not be included in a flexible residential development.
(2) Housing types.
(a) Residential. All dwelling types and residential uses that are
permitted in the underlying zoning district shall be permitted
within a flexible residential development, except that in the R2
District, single-family attached dwellings are permitted in
accordance with Table I of this subsection. Further, the
combined total of two-family and multifamily residential
dwelling units shall not exceed 40% of the total dwelling units
within the flexible residential development. If nonresidential
uses are proposed in the development plan, at least 75% of the
total units in the entire tract shall be residential. All residential
uses shall be subject to the same conditions as set forth in
305. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10707(5).
§ 300-23 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-23
287:1199
§ 300-15, Table of Permitted Uses, of this chapter. For purposes
of this section, semidetached and attached buildings may be
attached to each other by vertical party walls on the side and/
or rear of the dwelling.
(b) Nonresidential. All nonresidential uses that are permitted in
the underlying zoning district shall be permitted within a
flexible residential development. All nonresidential uses shall
be subject to the same floor area limitations and conditions
contained in § 300-15, Table of Permitted Uses, and to the
requirements contained in Article VIII, Off-Street Parking and
Loading Requirements.
(3) Density.
(a) The maximum average densities stated in Table I, Maximum
Density Table, shall apply within each district to single-family,
two-family, and multifamily dwellings. The maximum average
density from the table shall be multiplied by the buildable tract
area (stated in acres) to determine the maximum number of
single-family, two-family and multifamily dwelling units
permitted on a tract. With the exception of the R2 District, the
Planning Commission may increase the density by 15% if the
applicant proves, to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, that such adjustment would result in an overall
site design that would provide equal or better results or would
be more in the public interest than if the tract would be
developed using the average maximum densities as per this
subsection.
(b) For calculating density, the "buildable tract area" shall mean
the entire lot area of all lots that are part of the application
minus the following: any existing street rights-of-way of
preexisting streets and areas more than 35 feet inside of the
edge of the one-hundred-year floodplain boundary (to allow for
rear yards and pervious parking to intrude into the floodplain).
Areas within the rights-of-way of proposed streets may count
toward the buildable tract area. If the calculation of total units
allowed on a buildable tract area equals 0.5 unit or greater, the
allowed units may be rounded up to the next full number (e.g.,
8.64 units would equal 9.0 maximum allowed units).

(c) The minimum lot area, minimum lot width and minimum lot
depth listed in the applicable zoning district regulations shall
not apply under this section.
(d) The lot area of each single-family dwelling shall include the
building footprint plus the private area required under
Subsection E(9) and may include a private parking area as per
Subsection E(13) and any yard area adjacent to the dwelling,
provided that the maximum average density listed in Table I is
complied with for the entire tract.
(e) The lot area for a building or buildings containing multifamily
units and for buildings containing nonresidential uses shall
include the building footprint(s) and adequate outdoor service
area for storing trash and recyclables and may include a
designated parking area as per Subsection E(13) and any yard
area adjacent to the building(s), provided that the maximum
average density for the entire tract shall comply with
Subsection E(3)(a).
(f) All areas within a tract that are set aside for open space and
recreation facilities shall be deed restricted to prohibit the
future construction of any residential or nonresidential uses.
(g) If a buildable tract area includes more than one building type,
the maximum density shall be determined by calculating the
total land area devoted to each building type and its related
individual private or outdoor service areas, streets, parking
and required landscaping.
(4) Perimeter yards. The following provisions shall apply around the
perimeter boundaries of a tract used for a flexible residential
development:
(a) The front, rear, and side yards listed in the applicable district
regulations for the applicable building type in § 300-20 shall be
provided around the perimeter boundary of the tract, except
that these setbacks may be reduced under one of the following
standards:
[1] The Planning Commission may waive yard requirements
by using the provisions in § 300-26, Waiver of side yard
requirements.
[2] The Planning Commission may reduce the minimum front,
rear and side setbacks around the perimeter of the tract as
part of this flexible residential development to the
setbacks that exist on a minimum of at least 50% of the
developed lots that are visible from the tract and are
within 200 feet of the subject lot or tract. The applicant
shall provide such information in the application.
§ 300-23 LANCASTER CODE § 300-23
287:1202
[3] Where a tract is proposed for flexible residential
development and is not on a block with existing residential
frontage, the Planning Commission may reduce the
minimum front yard setback along the perimeter of the
tract to five feet and the rear yard setback to 12 feet if the
applicant proves, to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, that such adjustment would be in the public
interest due to the nature of occupancy or would result in
an overall design that would be substantially superior and
more in the public interest than if the tract were developed
using the minimum setbacks listed in § 300-20.
(b) If dwelling types are mixed within the same tract, the width or
depth of the yards around the perimeter of the tract shall be
determined by the depth/width of the yards for the dwelling on
the tract that requires the greatest yard depth/width.
(c) All portions of the tract abutting an existing or proposed public
street shall be considered a front yard and shall meet the front
yard requirements, unless reduced by other provisions of this
chapter. This requirement shall not apply adjacent to a public,
private or common alley.
(5) Required setbacks.
(a) Other than around the perimeter of a tract, the Planning
Commission may reduce by 50% the front, side and rear yards
required by § 300-20, or the spacing between buildings as
noted in Subsection E(5)(c), provided that a minimum distance
of 10 feet is maintained between buildings and that the
applicant proves, to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, that such adjustment would:
[1] Result in an overall site design that would be substantially
superior and more in the public interest than if the tract
would be developed using conventional yard
requirements;
[2] Be compatible with any adjacent or nearby homes or
historic buildings; and
[3] Comply with the standards of § 300-26A through E,
concerning side yard reduction.
(b) Wherever the Planning Commission allows a reduction of a
yard area along an exterior building wall, a minimum five-footwide
area must be provided adjacent to the entire length of
such wall for maintenance and fire protection. If this five-footwide
area is neither entirely located on the same lot as the
building nor within a public right-of-way, a permanent
maintenance easement shall be provided on the adjacent lot to
§ 300-23 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-23
287:1203
ensure that a five-foot minimum width is available. This
provision is intended to allow for "zero lot line housing."
(c) The spacing between buildings, inside the required tract
perimeter yards, shall be equal to the combination of minimum
yard requirements of the applicable district. For example,
spacing between the fronts of two buildings shall be equal to
two combined front yards, the rears of buildings the
combination of two rear yards, and the side of a building
against a front of another building shall be equal to the
combining of a side yard and front yard. The yard requirements
shall only apply as spacing between actual buildings rather
than applying to each individual deeded lot line of each
dwelling within the tract.
(d) Fences and walls are permitted in accordance with § 300-25 of
this chapter.
(6) Height. The maximum height and maximum number of stories for
each dwelling type shall be the same as required in the applicable
district regulations.
(7) Building and total lot coverage.
(a) Maximum permitted building and total coverage. The
maximum permitted building and total coverage, as defined in
Article XVII, shall be based on the following maximum allowed
building and total coverage percentages. The average building
and total coverage percentages shall be applied to the entire
buildable tract area, as defined above in Subsection E(3)(b),
excluding the area of public and private streets and alleys, and
shall not apply to each individual lot.

(b) Future expansions. Any future increase in building or total
coverage after full build-out of the plan shall be regulated on a
lot-by-lot basis in accordance with Article VI, § 300-20.
(8) Flexible residential development review criteria. The Planning
Commission shall review a flexible residential development
application and either approve or deny it based upon the following
major criteria and any conditions that the Planning Commission
may establish in order to carry out these criteria:
§ 300-23 LANCASTER CODE § 300-23
287:1204
(a) Compliance with the provisions of this section;

compatibility of the major exterior features visible from a
public street or alley compared to a majority of adjacent
existing buildings visible and within 200 feet of the tract,
including the following:
[1] Continuation of major rooflines;
[2] Compatibility of window proportions and spacing;
[3] Compatibility of adjacent building/heights;
[4] Continuation of porches where present on adjacent
buildings;
[5] Avoidance of demolishing buildings that add to the
character and scale of the neighborhood; and
[6] Continuation of materials compatible with the character of

dedicating the land and/or recreation uses to the City for it to
maintain or providing for common maintenance of the open
space and recreation uses in accordance with Subsection
E(11).
(m) Each phase of any phasing plan that is submitted as part of a
flexible residential development shall be developed in
accordance with all the provisions of this section.
(9) Private area. Each dwelling unit approved under this section shall
include a one-hundred-seventy-five-square-foot minimum outdoor
private area(s) for the exclusive use of residents of that dwelling.
This area shall be adjacent to and be accessible from the dwelling.
This shall include a grassed and/or landscaped area, patio, porch,
deck, atrium and/or balcony. A roofed area that is enclosed by
screening, glass and/or mostly transparent sides which form a
"patio," "solar room" or "sunroom" may count toward 1/2 of the
required private area, but shall not be counted as part of the
required habitable area. A storage shed shall not be included in the
calculation of any required private area.
(10) Outdoor service area. Any outdoor service area used for the
purpose of storing trash and recyclable materials shall be located
to the side or rear of the building and shall be screened from view
from adjacent buildings or properties.
(11) Provision of parks, open space, and recreation facilities.
(a) The Planning Commission shall require that the flexible
residential development provide a minimum of one acre per
1,000 people (43.56 square feet per person) as recreation area
if the Planning Commission determines that a flexible
residential development will have the capacity to house 100 or
more persons, will not be within a one-thousand-foot walking
distance of an existing public park or greenway, will generate a
need for additional recreation areas, and will include land that
would be suitable for recreation.
(b) If such area is not offered to and accepted by the City for
dedication for public recreation space, then it shall be
maintained by a homeowners' association. Such proposed
recreation land shall be contiguous and suitable for the
intended active and/or passive recreation purpose, as
determined by the Planning Commission. Such recreation area
may include land within the one-hundred-year floodplain.
(12) Common maintenance.
§ 300-23 LANCASTER CODE § 300-23
287:1206

responsible for any commonly owned and/or maintained
improvements or lands, such as common open space, parking
areas, recreation facilities, sidewalks, streets, alleys, utilities,
stormwater control facilities and other similar improvements.
This homeowners' association shall be established and subject
to the provisions of: Section 705(f) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code306 and Title 68, Real and
Personal Property Act, Part II, Real Property, Subpart B,
Condominiums, as amended by Senate Bill 65, 1979, or later
amendment.
(b) Any such condominium or homeowners' association agreement
shall be provided to the Planning Commission for review a
minimum of 30 days before the final plan is recorded. If, within
those 30 days, the Commission determines, in writing, that
such document is not in legally acceptable form with regard to
concerns of the City, the plan shall not be recorded until
acceptable revisions are made.

(a) Off-street parking may be provided through private or
commonly owned and maintained areas and shall not
thereafter be sold, rented or leased so as to remove any
parking as required by this chapter.
(b) Garages which are privately or commonly owned shall be used
for vehicle storage solely by the occupants of the flexible
residential development.
(c) The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required per
dwelling unit shall be in accordance with Table II, except that
where the occupancy of the dwellings is limited to a special
group, such as the elderly or handicapped, not normally
requiring off-street parking to the extent of other single-family
dwellings, the Planning Commission may reduce the number of
required parking spaces to no less than one parking space for
each two dwelling units.
(d) The minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for
multifamily units and nonresidential uses shall be in
accordance with Article VIII, § 300-41, except that the
Planning Commission may permit a reduction in the number of
spaces in accordance with § 300-48, Flexibility in parking
requirements.
(e) Restriction on parking in front yard. See § 300-44 of this
chapter.
306. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10705(f).
§ 300-23 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-23
287:1207
(f) Appropriate curb stops or other structures acceptable to the
City Planning Commission shall be used within common
parking areas to prevent vehicles from bumping into trees,
shrubbery or into a building wall.
(g) The City Planning Commission may allow the required number
of parking spaces to be provided on a separate lot or lots within
a three-hundred-foot walking distance from the lot(s) that
include the residential or nonresidential units. Such lot
containing the parking shall be permanently committed
through deed restrictions to use for the residential or
nonresidential units.
(h) In calculating the number of off-street parking spaces, the
applicant may count any existing available on-street parking if
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission, by providing a neighborhood parking analysis in
accordance with § 300-44E of this chapter, that sufficient onstreet
parking is available.
(i) The Planning Commission may require that additional parking
be provided in one or more off-street lots or through the
addition of on-street parking spaces to provide for guest and
overflow parking.
(14) Access.
(a) Each building or lot within a flexible residential development is
not required to abut or have its own direct access onto a public
street, if the City Planning Commission determines that:
[1] Each building and lot will have guaranteed permanent
acceptable vehicular or pedestrian access to a public
street via a commonly owned and commonly maintained
parking court, accessway, alley and/or street; and
[2] The width, layout and circulation pattern of such access
are acceptable in the determination of the City Planning
Commission, based upon review by the City staff.
(b) If no other alternative exists, the City Planning Commission
may permit a development on a single preexisting lot of record
within a flexible residential development to have vehicle access
onto a public or common alley, provided that the alley has a
minimum paved cartway width of 10 feet; the alley has an
unobstructed and totally visible right-of-way of 12 feet for its
length; and a maximum length of 300 feet shall be traveled
along the alley from the development to reach an existing
public street and to allow for police and fire access.
(15) Street width, curb and street construction standards.
§ 300-23 LANCASTER CODE § 300-23
287:1208
(a) Under the provisions of the planned residential development
sections of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code,
based upon advice of the City staff, the City Planning
Commission shall have the authority, when considering a
flexible residential development for approval, to reduce the
street width and curb provisions of the City's Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance within or immediately abutting a
flexible residential development as follows:
[1] To permit rolled or slant curbs instead of straight curbs
along blocks where a straight curb does not already exist.
Such rolled or slant curbs shall meet specifications of the
City Engineer.
[2] To reduce the minimum widths for streets and alleys, as
the City Planning Commission deems appropriate, with the
widths shown on Table II serving as minimums. The
Planning Commission shall consider whether it would be
practical to prohibit parking on one or both sides of a
street. The Planning Commission shall also consider what
type of development with what amounts of off-street
parking is possible or likely on any abutting undeveloped
tract(s).
(b) For developments proposing private streets, the Commission,
with the advice of the City Engineer, may modify the street
construction standards in consideration of expected traffic
volumes and vehicle users.
(c) Where an existing street is being continued or extended less
than 500 feet, the existing cartway width shall be continued,
regardless of the standards in the following table, unless the
City Planning Commission determines that such width is
inadequate or excessive based upon parking needs, traffic
volumes and need for right-of-way for sidewalk and utilities.
(16) Sidewalks. Private and/or public sidewalks, which shall be at least
four feet wide and be constructed to City standards, shall be
provided for reasonable pedestrian movement throughout the site,
for pedestrian access to a public street(s) and for pedestrian access
between dwelling units and common play areas.

***** Right-of-way and cartway width by may be reduced by "one
travel lane width" where the Planning Commission, based
on Traffic Commission approval, determines that a one-way
street may be appropriate and adequate off-street and onstreet
parking is provided.
(17) Landscaping.
(a) A flexible residential development shall include the planting of
deciduous shade trees along all abutting existing or proposed
streets. The City Planning Commission may waive or reduce
this street tree requirement along existing abutting streets if
the Planning Commission determines, based upon staff review,
that there would not be any appropriate locations within or
outside the right-of-way of abutting streets. The species of
street trees, the specifications for planting, location and use of
tree grates shall be approved by the City. Where street trees do
not already exist, one tree shall be planted for every 40 linear
feet, or major fraction thereof, of street and alley frontage
abutting and within the development, with spacing between
trees not less than 30 feet nor more than 50 feet.
(b) Landscape plantings and/or grass areas shall make up a
minimum of 15% of the total area of a flexible residential
development tract in all permitted districts. Where
appropriate, this landscaped area should include highly visible
areas. The required "private areas" may not count towards this
requirement. In cases where common or public recreation
areas are approved, those recreation areas may count towards
the minimum grass and landscaped areas.
(c) Any common or private parking areas shall be dimensioned
and landscaped in accordance with § 300-42, Dimensional and
landscaping requirements of parking facilities, of this chapter,
except that the Planning Commission may approve
modifications to the dimensional and landscaping
requirements if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Planning Commission that the proposed dimensions and
landscaping will be superior to the landscaping that would be
installed in accordance with the requirements.
(18) Sewage and water service. Appropriate sections of the City
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance shall specifically
apply. Each lot intended to be in separate ownership shall be
connected to an individual water lateral and an individual sewage
lateral. If the lots have common private access, as opposed to
frontage on a public street, such laterals may be connected to a
common line within an appropriate permanent easement. All
common lines shall meet City construction standards, regardless of
§ 300-23 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-23
287:1211
whether they are intended to be dedicated. These common lines
shall also be maintained under the provisions of Subsection E(12),
Common maintenance.

Supplementary District Regulations
§ 300-24. Visibility at intersections.
On a corner lot in all districts, except the CB and CB1 Districts, nothing
shall be erected, placed, planted, or allowed to grow in such a manner as
to block vision between a height of three feet and 10 feet from grade within
the triangular area established by the placement of two intersecting lines
25 feet in length along each cartway edge or curbline, excluding bulbouts,
which are then connected by a third line forming the triangle. Where a
building already exists in this twenty-five-foot sight triangle area, nothing
obstructing vision shall be placed within that sight triangle created by
existing walls and porches.
§ 300-25. Fences, walls and hedges. [Amended 7-11-2017 by Ord.
No. 10-2017]
Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, fences, walls, and hedges
may be permitted in any required yard or permitted building area, subject
to the following maximum height restrictions, provided that no conflict with
§ 300-24, Visibility at intersections, shall occur; no obstruction of visibility
at driveway openings shall occur within the sight triangle created by the
intersecting lines of the driveway and property line and a line joining points
along each line five feet from the point of intersection; the finished side
of the fence shall face the adjoining property or a public right-of-way; and
fences and walls shall not be constructed from scrap metal, sheet metal,
junk or sheets of plywood and shall be uniform in construction materials and
design. See also § 300-42I, which may require a larger sight triangle for a
parking lot.

fence or hedge up to two feet above maximum. A wall over maximum
height and a fence or hedge over this special exception maximum
height shall require a variance. Retaining walls that are necessary for
structural engineering reasons are not subject to height limitations.
*** A fence on a residential lot in a minimum front yard shall be mostly
open in construction, such as a split rail, picket or chain link fence, as
opposed to a mostly solid fence.
§ 300-26. Waiver of side yard requirements.
Upon application to the Zoning Hearing Board for special exception and
subject to the following standards and criteria, the side yard setback
requirements for residential buildings in all districts except the R1 and R2
§ 300-25 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-26
287:1215

Hearing Board's satisfaction that the granting of the special exception will
not result in structural, safety or health hazards to abutting properties and
must present evidence to the Board of full compliance with the following
conditions:
§ 300-27. Accessory structures.
A. That a five-foot open distance will be maintained from any existing wall
or building to allow for necessary maintenance or that the junction
between the new structure and adjoining structure(s) will be
permanently sealed from infiltration by air, water or other eroding
elements;
B. That the proposed construction will meet all applicable Lancaster City
building, fire and other relevant safety codes;
C. That the applicant will present to the Zoning Hearing Board legally
binding easement documents from adjoining property owner(s)
providing for access for maintenance of the building or permission to
abut the wall of the adjoining structure(s);
D. That access to the rear yard of all properties will be provided other than
through the principal structure(s); and
E. That no building or portion of a building will be within five feet of a door
or window of an adjacent building.
A. No accessory structure of any kind shall be erected or placed in any
required front, secondary front, or side yard, except that in the case of a
corner lot, which has no rear yard, an accessory structure may be
erected or placed in the side yard, subject to the setback or easement
provided herein for structures in the rear yard.
B. When an accessory structure is proposed, the setback of the accessory

required rear yard; provided, however, that the structure is located at
least three feet from the edge of a common, private, or public alley and
from any side lot line, or, if less than three feet from the side lot line, the
applicant provides a recorded easement, acceptable to the City, from
the adjoining property owner providing access for maintenance of the
building, or permission to abut the wall of any existing structure on the
neighboring property.
D. All other accessory structures may be permitted in the required rear
yard; provided, however, that a three-foot setback from any side lot line
or rear lot line not abutting an alley is maintained, or, if less than three
feet, the applicant provides a recorded easement, acceptable to the

NOTES:
* "Existing buildings," as used in this section, shall mean buildings
which exceeded the above height requirements on December 12,
1989, the date of the original adoption of the Hospital Complex
District. Such existing buildings may be expanded at their current
elevation, provided the following are met:
1. The additional height is necessary to provide expansion of the
upper floors of the existing building;
2. The height of the new construction is limited to a horizontal
extension of the existing roofline along the same or a lower
elevation. In no case shall the height of any new construction
exceed the height of the existing structure; and
3. The height of the new construction shall only exceed the above
requirements along one street line and shall not encroach upon
the height limitation imposed upon any other street.
** Overhead structures located over public streets that serve as
connections between buildings or pedestrian walkways are not
subject to the front yard minimum setback requirements.
Abutments or supporting structures for the overhead structures
are not subject to the front yard minimum setback requirements
set forth in the table, but shall have a front yard minimum setback
requirement of five feet.
B. Minimum side and rear yard setbacks. Side and rear yard setbacks shall
be five feet. Side and rear yard setbacks shall be reduced or eliminated
when the adjoining property owner grants a maintenance easement
acceptable to the City, and the applicant records said easement
agreement in the office of the Recorder of Deeds for Lancaster County.
C. Landscaped area.
§ 300-38 LANCASTER CODE § 300-38
287:1222
§ 300-39. Floodplain District.
(1) All undeveloped portions of each lot shall be landscaped. When
possible, existing mature trees shall be retained. A minimum of
10% of the lot must be provided as permanent ground level
landscape area. This landscape area calculation is exclusive of the
areas used for buildings, paving and sidewalk. The landscape area
shall provide natural ground cover, trees, and shrubs under the
design of a Pennsylvania registered landscape architect. A
minimum of 30% of the landscape area shall be planted in a
combination of trees and shrubs.
(2) Appropriate landscaping shall be provided to restore the
streetscape. Trees shall be used to reduce the visual plane of
buildings. Foundation plantings, composed of mixed shrubs and
ground covers shall be provided across all facades located in
normal public view. All buildings shall provide at least one tree,
with a minimum trunk diameter of two inches measured four foot
above ground level, for every 40 feet of building frontage,
excluding building frontages on streets having a right-of-way width
of 20 feet or less.
D. Parking garages. Parking garages shall be permitted as uses by right as
accessory uses in the HC District and may be located on a separate lot
from HC District uses. Parking facilities shall comply with the
requirement of § 300-44B if the property is located in the Historic
Resource Overlay District. Screening or other improvements shall be
provided to shield parked cars from view. Driveway openings and
access lanes shall be minimized. Safe and convenient pedestrian
connections between the parking facilities and the principal use shall

restrictions including, but not limited to, hours that the space is open to
the public. Fully accessible pedestrian connections between adjoining
public right(s)-of-way and the temporary open space shall be provided,
and both active and passive recreational amenities may be installed. All
temporary open space improvements are subject to requirements of the
Stormwater Management Ordinance.308 [Added 7-11-2017 by Ord.
No. 10-2017]
A. General provisions.
307. Editor's Note: See § 300-46.
308. Editor's Note: See Ch. 260, Stormwater Management.
§ 300-38 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-39
287:1223
(1) Purposes. The purposes of these provisions are to prevent the loss
of property and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the
disruption of commerce and governmental services, the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for
flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
(a) Regulating uses, activities, and development which, acting
alone or in combination with other existing or future uses,
activities, and development, will cause unacceptable increases
in flood heights, velocities and frequencies,
(b) Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities, and
development from locating within areas subject to flooding,
(c) Requiring all those uses, activities, and developments that do
occur in flood-prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed
against flooding and flood damage,
(d) Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which
are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
(2) Applicability. These provisions shall apply to all lands within the
jurisdiction of the City of Lancaster shown as being located within
the boundaries of the designated floodplain districts or adjacent to
streams or other bodies of water as identified on the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Flood Insurance Rate
Map, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, or latest revision thereof,
and the City of Lancaster Floodplain and Flood-Prone Areas Map.
(a) Where a waterway exists in the form of a drainage swale or
spring that has been mapped by the City but which does not
have a delineated one-hundred-year floodplain on the Official
Federal Floodplain Maps, a minimum building setback of 30
feet landward from the top of the bank of any watercourse shall
be required, unless the applicant provides a floodplain
delineation acceptable to the City Engineer that shows a more
narrow one-hundred-year floodplain along that waterway.
(3) Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no
structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the
terms and provisions of this chapter and any other applicable
ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within the
jurisdiction of this chapter.
(4) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provisions of this chapter is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering
methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter
does not imply that areas outside the floodplain districts or that
§ 300-39 LANCASTER CODE § 300-39
287:1224
land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the City of Lancaster or any officer or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(5) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes any
other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified
floodplain areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions
are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
B. Establishment of floodplain districts.
(1) Basis of districts.
(a) Floodplain districts shall include areas subject to inundation by
the one-percent annual flood, also known as of the "onehundred-
year flood." The basis for the delineation of the onehundred-
year floodplain districts shall be one of the following,
whichever is more restrictive:
[1] The Flood Insurance Study (FIS), dated April 19, 2005, for
the City of Lancaster, Lancaster County, and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) panels
as prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof;
[2] The City of Lancaster Floodplain and Flood-Prone Areas
Map, dated July 2012;
[3] A hydrologic report prepared by an individual registered in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to perform such
duties, provided that such report shall be approved by an
agency of the City, county, state or U.S. government; or
[4] A hydrologic report prepared by an agency of the City,
county, state, or U.S. government.
(b) In case of any dispute concerning when, where and how the
floodplain is to be established, the City of Lancaster will
determine the ultimate design criteria and/or flood boundary
limits.
(2) Specific floodplain areas and special requirements. The identified
floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas, with all
specific areas subject to inundation by the one-hundred-year flood
collectively identified as the "one-hundred-year floodplain district":
(a) Floodway area. The areas identified as "floodway" on the FIRM
panels that represent the channels of watercourses and
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
§ 300-39 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-39
287:1225
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation by more than one foot an any point.
The term shall also include floodway areas that have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
[1] Special requirement. No construction or encroachment is
permitted in the floodway that would cause any increase in
flood heights. Additionally, no construction or other
activity shall be undertaken without first obtaining a
permit from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) regional office.
[2] Where no floodway has been identified on a tributary with
constant flow, a minimum fifty-foot setback shall be
maintained for all structures.
(b) Special floodplain area. The areas identified as Zone AE on the
FIRM panels that are subject to inundation by the one-percent
annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods and
having identified base flood elevations (BFEs).
[1] Special requirement. No construction or encroachment is
permitted in the floodway that would cause any increase in
flood heights.
[2] Special requirement in Zone AE without an identified
floodway. No permit shall be granted for any construction,
development, use, or activity within any AE area not
having an identified floodway unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development would not, together with all other existing
development and anticipated development, increase the
BFE.
(c) Approximate flood area: the areas identified as Zone A on the
FIRM panels that are subject to the inundation by the onepercent
annual chance flood event determined using
approximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic
analyses have not been performed, no BFEs or flood depths are
shown.
[1] Special requirements.
[a] No construction or encroachment, including fill, shall
be permitted that would cause any increase in flood
heights. In the absence of a detailed flood analysis,
new construction or development shall be located 50
feet landward from the top of the bank of any
watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the DEP
regional office.
§ 300-39 LANCASTER CODE § 300-39
287:1226
[b] Where available, information from federal, state, or
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine
the BFE, as well as a floodway area if possible. When
no other information is available, the BFE shall be
determined by using a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest to the
construction site in question.
[c] In lieu of the above, the City of Lancaster may require
the applicant to determine the flood elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. The
analysis shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications
who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City.
(d) Other flood areas. The areas identified as Zone X on the FIRM
panels include certain areas subject to the one-percent and
two-tenths-percent annual chance flood. The areas include
floodplains adjacent to studied waterways commonly referred
to as the "one-hundred-year and five-hundred-year
floodplains," small streams, drainage swales and ditches and
other unstudied water channels that are used to convey
surface waters to areas within Zone A and AE.
[1] Special requirement. In lieu of a flood study or evidence of
historical flood heights, all development shall be set back
30 feet from the top of the bank of any watercourse and
from other low-lying areas subject to flooding. The City
shall consider existing topography, watershed
development, history of flooding, a flood analysis study
provided by the applicant, and other factors in deciding if
a setback of less than 30 feet is appropriate.
(3) Overlay concept.
(a) The floodplain districts described above shall be overlays to
the existing underlying districts as shown on the Official
Zoning Map, and as such, the provisions for the floodplain
districts shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district
provisions.
(b) Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions
or requirements of any of the floodplain districts and those of
any underlying district, the more restrictive provisions and/or
those pertaining to the floodplain district shall apply.
(c) In the event any provisions concerning a floodplain district are
declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or
§ 300-39 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-39
287:1227
administrative actions or judicial discretion, the basic
underlying district provisions shall remain applicable.
(4) Zoning Map. The boundaries of the floodplain districts, while not
shown on the Zoning Map, are established as part of the Official
Zoning Map of the City of Lancaster, and are declared to be a part
of this chapter. The Bureau of Planning shall maintain a record of
all studies and maps that depict areas known to be susceptible to
flooding.
(5) District boundary changes. The delineation of any of the floodplain
districts may be revised by the governing body where natural or
man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the
Susquehanna River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to
any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(6) Interpretation of district boundaries. Initial interpretations of the
boundaries of the floodplain districts shall be made by the Zoning
Officer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of any of
the districts, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary
determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of
the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
present his/her case to the Board and to submit his/her technical
evidence if he/she so desires.
C. District provisions. All uses, activities, and development occurring
within any floodplain district shall be undertaken only in strict
compliance with the provisions of this chapter, with all other applicable
codes and ordinances of the City of Lancaster, and with all applicable
federal and state laws and regulations. Under no circumstances shall
any use, activity and/or development adversely affect the capacity of
the channels or floodplains of any watercourse, drainage ditch, or any
other drainage facility or system. Prior to any proposed alteration or
relocation of any stream, watercourse, etc., within the City, a permit
shall be obtained from the DEP regional office. Further notification of
the proposal shall be given by the City of Lancaster to all affected
adjacent municipalities as well as the Lancaster County Planning
Commission. Copies of such notifications shall be forwarded to both
FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development.
(1) One-hundred-year floodplain overlay in residential districts. Where
the one-hundred-year floodplain district, shown as Zone AE on the
FIRM panels, is an overlay to an underlying residential district, as
stipulated in § 300-2, Districts, no development shall be permitted
that causes a rise in the one-hundred-year flood. Uses permitted by
right and by special exception in the one-hundred-year floodplain
§ 300-39 LANCASTER CODE § 300-39
287:1228
district within residential zoning districts are limited to the
following:
(a) Permitted uses. In the one-hundred-year floodplain district, the
following uses and activities are permitted, provided that they
are in compliance with the provisions of the underlying district
and are not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided
that they do not require structures, fill, or storage of materials
and equipment:
[1] Public recreational uses and activities conducted on
pervious surfaces, such as parks, day camps, picnic
grounds, golf courses, boat launching and swimming
areas, hiking and horseback riding trails, wildlife and
nature preserves, and game farms.
[2] Yard areas, gardens and play areas accessory to
residential uses.
[3] Yard areas accessory to industrial and commercial uses.
[4] Stormwater outfall structures and rip-rap with DEP
permit.
(b) Uses permitted by special exception. The following uses and
activities may be permitted by special exception, provided that
they are in compliance with the provisions of the underlying
district, are not prohibited by any other ordinance and will
cause no increase of the water surface elevation, at any point,
during the base flood discharge (one-hundred-year flood):
[1] Public facilities and improvements such as railroads,
streets, bridges, piers, abutments, pipelines, water and
sewage treatment plants, pervious parking and loading
areas, and other similar or related uses.
[2] Private, restricted or commercial recreational uses and
activities conducted on pervious surfaces, such as parks,
day camps, picnic grounds, golf courses, boat-launching
docks, piers, swimming areas, hiking and horseback riding
trails, wildlife and nature preserves, and game farms.
(2) Five-hundred-year floodplain overlay district. In the two-tenthspercent
annual chance flood area (five-hundred-year floodplain
district), shown as Zone X on the FIRM panels, the development
and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance with the
regulations of the underlying district, except that the following
uses shall be prohibited:

§ 300-39 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-39
287:1229
(c) Jails; and
(d) New manufactured home subdivisions, and substantial
improvements to such existing parks and subdivisions.
(3) One-hundred-year floodplain overlay in nonresidential districts.
Where the one-hundred-year floodplain district, shown as Zone AE
and Zone A on the FIRM panels, is an overlay to an underlying
nonresidential district, as stipulated in § 300-2, Districts, the
development and/or use of land shall be permitted in accordance
with the regulations of the underlying district, provided that:
(a) No building shall be erected or constructed within a floodway
area;
(b) Any proposed installation of fill material shall require the
submission of a floodplain impact report from a
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania registered engineer
demonstrating that the fill will cause no increase in the water
surface elevation of the one-hundred-year flood and that the fill
material will be resistant to erosion by flooding;
(c) Any development or land development proposing the
construction or erection of a structure or expansion of an
existing structure shall be in conformity with the City of
Lancaster Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance,309
including the stipulation that no development or encroachment
shall occur which would result in any increase in flood levels
during the one-hundred-year flood; and
(d) All uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in
strict compliance with the elevation and floodproofing and
related provisions contained in all applicable federal,
specifically 44 CFR 60.3d of the National Flood Insurance
Program, state and local laws and regulations, except that the
following uses shall be prohibited:
[1] Hospitals, public or private;
[2] Nursing homes, public or private;
[3] Jails; and
[4] New manufactured home parks and manufactured home
subdivisions, and substantial improvements to such

district and shall be set back 30 feet from the top of the bank of
any watercourse and from other low-lying areas subject to flooding,
provided that the City shall consider existing topography,
watershed development, history of flooding, a flood analysis study
provided by the applicant, and other factors in deciding if a setback
of less than 30 feet is appropriate.
(5) Riparian buffer. To the maximum extent possible, riparian buffer
shall be preserved along all watercourses to protect private
property, promote public safety, maintain and improve surface
water quality, attenuate flooding, reduce soil loss, preserve wildlife
habitat, provide recreational value to waterways, and to be
consistent with goals set forth in the City's Green Infrastructure
Plan. Where riparian buffer currently exists within the 100-year
floodplain district, shown as the 1% annual chance flood on the
FIRM panels, and the 500-year floodplain district, shown as the
0.2% annual chance flood on the FIRM panels, the following
activities shall be prohibited: [Added 6-25-2019 by Ord. No.
10-2019]
(a) Removal of any tree larger than two inches diameter at breast
height from any floodplain district or riparian buffer without a
permit from the City's Floodplain Administrator.
(b) Removal of riparian buffer from the floodway or 100-year
floodplain, in a manner that is not strictly consistent with
PADEP's or the USDA's most recently published guidance
document for riparian buffers, as determined by the City's
Floodplain Administrator, and § 300-39C(5)(d).
(c) Removal of more than 20% of the riparian buffer on a lot from
the 500-year floodplain, in a manner that is not strictly
consistent with PADEP's or the USDA's most recently
published guidance document for riparian buffers, as
determined by the City's Floodplain Administrator.
(d) Use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and/or other
chemicals within the 100-year floodplain, unless approved by
the City's Floodplain Administrator.
D. Special exceptions and variances; additional factors to be considered.
(1) In passing upon applications for special exceptions and variances
the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider all relevant factors and
procedures specified in other sections of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, this chapter and the
following:
(a) The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights
or velocities caused by encroachments. No special exception or
variance shall be granted for any proposed use, development,
§ 300-39 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-39
287:1231
or activity that will cause any increase in flood levels in the
one-hundred-year floodplain district;
(b) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or
downstream to the injury of others;
(c) The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the
ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination, and
unsanitary conditions;
(d) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owners;
(e) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(f) The requirements of the facility for a waterfront location;
(g) The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding
for the proposed use;
(h) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing
development and development anticipated in the foreseeable
future;
(i) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program for the area;
(j) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles; and
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site.
(2) The Zoning Hearing Board may refer any application and
accompanying documentation pertaining to any request for a
special exception or variance to any engineer or other qualified
person or agency for technical assistance in evaluating the
proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities, and the
adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters.
Costs incurred by the City for this technical review shall be paid by
the applicant. No zoning certificate of zoning compliance or
building certificate of occupancy shall be issued, nor shall any land
development or subdivision plan be unconditionally approved, prior
to payment of these costs.
(3) Special exceptions and/or variances shall only be issued after the
Zoning Hearing Board has determined that the granting of such
will not result in an increase in flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, nuisances, fraud or
victimization of the public, or conflict with local laws or ordinances.
§ 300-39 LANCASTER CODE § 300-39
287:1232
E. Administration. A floodplain zoning permit shall be required for all
construction and development in all floodplain districts, which includes
but is not limited to paving, filling, grading, excavation, mining,
dredging or drilling operations, in all instances where a certificate of
zoning compliance has not been issued or Zoning Hearing Board
approval has not been granted. It shall be a violation of this chapter to
commence construction or development of the aforesaid without first
obtaining the permit/approval herein required.
F. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
BASE FLOOD  A flood which has a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one-hundredyear
flood").
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The elevation shown on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Zone AE that indicates the water
surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or
greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
COMPLETELY DRY SPACE  A space which will remain totally dry
during flooding; the structure is designed and constructed to prevent
the passage of water and water vapor.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to the construction,
reconstruction, renovation, repair, expansion, or alteration of buildings
or other structures; the placement of manufactured homes; streets
and other paving; utilities; filling, grading and excavation; mining;
dredging; drilling operations; storage of equipment or materials; and
the subdivision of land.
ESSENTIALLY DRY SPACE  A space which will remain dry during
flooding, except for the passage of some water vapor or minor seepage;
the structure is substantially impermeable to the passage of water.
500-YEAR FLOOD  A flood that, on average, is likely to occur once
every 500 years (i.e., that has a 0.2% chance of occurring each year,
although the flood may occur in any year).[Added 6-25-2019 by Ord.
No. 10-2019]
FLOOD  A temporary inundation of normally dry land areas.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS)  The official report provided by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency that includes flood profiles,
the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map,
and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
FLOODPLAIN 
A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation
from an adjoining or nearby stream, river or watercourse; and/or

287:1233
§ 300-40. Green incentives and standards; solar facilities.
FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS  Those areas inundated primarily by the
one-hundred-year flood and the five-hundred-year flood. Included are
areas identified as the one-hundred-year floodplain district, the fivehundred-
year floodplain district, and other flood-prone areas identified
on the City of Lancaster Floodplain and Flood-Prone Areas Map.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water
and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
more than one foot.
LAND DEVELOPMENT  Any of the following activities:
ONE-HUNDRED-YEAR FLOOD  A flood that, on the average, is likely
to occur once every 100 years (i.e., that has a one-percent chance of
occurring each year, although the flood may occur in any year).
RIPARIAN BUFFER  Trees, shrubs, or herbaceous vegetation
currently existing within any 100-year or 500-year floodplain.[Added
6-25-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
An area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of
surface waters from any source.
(2)
The improvement of one lot or two or more contiguous lots, tracts,
or parcels of land for any purpose involving:
A group of two or more residential or nonresidential buildings,
whether proposed initially or cumulatively, or a single
nonresidential building on a lot or lots, regardless of the
number of occupants or tenure; or
(a)
The division or allocation of land or space, whether initially
or cumulatively, between or among two or more existing or

(2) A subdivision of land.
A. Solar screens and awnings over windows may project into a setback
area by up to five feet.
B. Solar collection panels shall be allowed to be placed over off-street
vehicle parking lots and within rear yards, provided they meet required
accessory structure setbacks; do not exceed the maximum height for
the district; and do not intrude into or obstruct sunlight from reaching
§ 300-39 LANCASTER CODE § 300-40
287:1234
required buffer and landscaped areas. See § 300-29, which allows solar
collectors to extend above the maximum building height.
C. If a building or parking structure includes an approved green roof, the
area covered by the green roof may exceed the maximum building
coverage, up to a maximum total building coverage of 5% higher than
would otherwise be allowed.
(1) In order to be considered a green roof, such area shall be exposed
to direct sunlight at noontime and shall be covered with vegetation
that is designed to absorb stormwater runoff. Vegetation shall be
planted in a minimum of four inches of depth of soil or other
growing material. Up to 10% of an area of a green roof may include
walkways. If such vegetation dies, it shall be required to be
replaced within 150 days.
D. A LEED-certified building may exceed the maximum building coverage,
provided the total building coverage is not increased by a total of more
than 5%. This subsection applies if the applicant proves that a new
building will be certified or meets a higher standard under the
published standards of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) certified building, following the latest published
standards of the U.S. Green Building Council or its successor entity for
new construction. This incentive may not be added on top of the
incentive in Subsection C above.
(1) The applicant is required to have a registered architect who is a
LEED-certified professional provide a statement, in writing, to the
Zoning Officer at each of the following times: the land development
application; at the time of the building permit application; and at a
point halfway through construction. Such statement shall provide a
professional opinion that the project will be able to meet the LEED
certification, and specifying the point system that will be used.
(2) If a building fails to have LEED certification after occupancy, the
City shall have the authority to require that the current building
owner make sufficient changes to the building and submittals to
obtain the intended certification.
E. If a new building or building expansion in excess of 10,000 square feet
of floor area is proposed and off-street parking is required to
accommodate the new building or expansion project, bicycle parking
shall be provided as per § 300-41B.

ARTICLE VIII
Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements
§ 300-41. Parking requirements.
A. Minimum parking requirements. In all districts except the CB and CB1
Districts, off-street parking spaces with adequate access to a public
street or alley shall be required in accordance with the following table
for any building or use which is hereafter erected, extended, changed in
use, enlarged or increased in capacity. The numbers of required spaces
listed below are the minimum number of spaces. Surface parking lots
exceeding the minimum number shall be permitted, provided that
parking lots meeting the threshold for required interior landscaping
shall contain interior landscaped areas and trees as provided for in
§ 300-42F. The required minimum number of spaces shall be provided
at no separate charge or fee specifically related to access and use of the
parking to occupants, tenants, employees, patrons, customers or other
users of the required parking spaces. When computing parking spaces
based on floor area, areas within buildings used for parking are not
counted as part of gross floor area. When the computation of any
required off-street parking spaces results in a fractional space, any
fraction up to 49.9% shall be disregarded, and fractions 50% and over
shall be rounded up; provided, however, that in no case shall the
computation result in less than one parking space. [Amended

parking cannot be provided in accordance with Subsections C and D for
single-family lots or for lots with an existing single-family dwelling
where a second residential unit is proposed in a separate building as
per § 300-28A, the applicant may file for a special exception to reduce
or waive the number of required off-street parking spaces and shall
provide a parking study in order to prove that the granting of the
special exception will not adversely affect parking availability in the
immediate neighborhood. The person who conducted the parking study
shall be present at the special exception hearing to testify that the
study is accurate. The Zoning Hearing Board, in making its
determination, shall consider, in addition to the parking study provided
by the applicant, any projects, developments or other factors which may
have an impact on future availability of on-street parking in the
immediate neighborhood. The study shall include the following
information: [Amended 6-25-2019 by Ord. No. 10-2019]
(1) A statement of why parking cannot be provided in accordance with
Subsections C and D;

within the study area during at least three different times of
the day and week, including the peak time(s) of the proposed
use and excluding days when streets are posted for street
cleaning or special events (NOTE: For computing the number
of available on-street parking spaces, a stall length of 21 feet
shall be used and setbacks of five feet from driveways/alleys
and 25 feet from intersections shall be utilized. Areas
restricted due to bus stops, fire hydrants, load zones, etc. shall
not be counted as available on-street parking).
§ 300-44 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-44
287:1255
§ 300-45. Wrongful use of parking facilities.
No parking space or facility shall be used in such a way as to interfere with
its providing the required number of off-street parking spaces specified in
this article.
(b) Number of existing residential units within the study area;
(c) Anticipated parking impacts due to the proposed use.
F. Off-site nonresidential parking. Required parking spaces shall be
provided on the lot where the principal use is located, except that by
special exception of the Zoning Hearing Board, all or part of the
required number of spaces for nonresidential uses may be provided on
a separate lot or lots within 600 feet, walking distance, from the
pedestrian entrance to the structure containing the use, subject to the
condition that the applicant produces evidence of ownership of the offpremises
parking location or a minimum one-year lease with the tenant
having the unconditional option to renew (with the exception of a
condition for rent adjustment) for a minimum five years. Should this offsite
parking no longer be available for the principal use, the owner of
the principal use shall lease the required number of off-street parking
elsewhere, subject to the distance and conditions stated above and shall
provide evidence of the new leased parking to the Zoning Officer prior
to the expiration of the current parking lease. If this replacement
parking is not provided, the owner of the principal building shall apply
to the Zoning Hearing Board for a variance. In all cases, the area of the
separate lot shall not be considered as a portion of the lot area on which
the maximum permitted lot coverage, as specified in Article VI, is
calculated.
G. Off-site multifamily parking. Required parking spaces shall be provided
on the lot where the principal use is located, except that all or part of
the required number of spaces for new multifamily dwelling buildings
may be provided by right on a separate lot or lots within 600 feet,
walking distance, from the pedestrian entrance to the structure
containing the use, subject to the condition that the applicant produces
evidence of common ownership of the off-premises parking location and
certifies, in writing, to the Zoning Officer that the required parking
shall be provided at no separate charge or fee specifically related to
access and use of the parking to the occupants of the dwellings for the
life of the multifamily dwellings. If the owner of the principal use ceases
to own the off-site parking or if the off-site parking will be located on a
lot not owned by the owner of the principal use, the required parking
spaces, subject to special exception approval of the Zoning Hearing
Board, may be provided in accordance with the lease stipulations in
Subsection F above. In all cases, the area of the separate lot shall not be
considered as a portion of the lot area on which the maximum permitted
lot coverage, as specified in Article VI, is calculated.
§ 300-44 LANCASTER CODE § 300-46
287:1256
§ 300-46. Discontinuation of required parking facilities.
The off-street parking and off-street loading requirements set forth in this
chapter, as well as any parking requirements placed upon a property by
the Zoning Hearing Board, shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of
the property upon which the use requiring off-street parking or loading is
located.
§ 300-47. Exemptions.
§ 300-48. Flexibility in parking requirements.
A. It shall be unlawful for an owner of any property affected by this
chapter to discontinue, change or dispense with, or to cause or allow
the discontinuance, change or dispensation, of required vehicle parking
or loading spaces without establishing alternative parking or loading
facilities which meet the requirements of and are in compliance with
this chapter.
B. Whenever a Zoning Hearing Board approval or a certificate of zoning
compliance has been granted and the plans so approved contain offstreet
parking and loading provisions, the subsequent use of such
property shall be deemed to be conditional upon the availability of the
parking and loading space provisions contained in such plans.
C. Should any use of a property be expanded so as to increase the number
of off-street parking or loading spaces required under this article or by
Zoning Hearing Board decision, it shall be unlawful and a violation of
this article to begin or maintain such expanded use until such increased
off-street parking and/or loading spaces are provided in a manner in
compliance with this chapter and an amended certificate of zoning
compliance is obtained from the Zoning Officer.
A. Where the occupancy of a multifamily building is limited to a special
group, such as persons age 62 or older or disabled persons, not
normally requiring off-street parking to the extent of other uses, such
building shall be exempted from the regular number of required
parking spaces in this article; provided, however, that in no instance
shall less than one off-street space be provided for each four units in
such building.
B. When a use is expanded in size or when a change of use occurs
requiring a greater number of off-street parking and/or loading/
unloading facilities than the existing use, the owner and/or occupant
shall be required to provide only that number of additional off-street
parking and/or loading or unloading facilities required by the new use
or the expanded portion of the existing use; provided, however, no
existing off-street parking and/or loading/unloading facilities shall be
eliminated unless all applicable off-street parking and loading
requirements are met.
§ 300-46 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-48
287:1257
A. Purposes. In order to facilitate appropriate nonresidential
development, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve by special
exception adjustments in the required number of parking spaces or
modifications in the parking lot dimension and landscaping standards if
an applicant provides specific proof that such reductions or
modifications are justified. This section is intended to allow for
reasonable reuse of underutilized lots, existing building space and
existing small infill lots in a manner that ensures that new shortages of
parking in neighborhoods will not be created.
B. Reduction in the number of parking spaces. As a special exception, the
Zoning Hearing Board may approve a reduction in the number of
required off-street parking spaces for nonresidential uses only if the
applicant submits written documentation in the form of a parking study
pursuant to § 300-44E or other acceptable form of written
documentation, including, but not limited to, where applicable, total
number of spaces to be provided, maximum number of employees on
duty at any given time, number of employees for which bus transit or
car/van pooling will be provided, estimated number of customers/
clients/participants/etc., driving to the site daily, and other pertinent
data, and proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that
one or more of the following conditions will exist:
(1) The parking will be shared by different uses that clearly have
different peak hours of use. Such uses may be upon the same lot or
on another lot with provisions for pedestrian access. The sharing of
required parking spaces shall be limited to nonresidential uses. For
example, a reduction may be allowed for parking that is shared
between a bank or office open during weekday daytime hours and a
church with peak evening and Sunday parking demand. Where
parking spaces are shared, parking spaces shall not be assigned to
employees/customers/patrons for a specific individual use and shall
be available during all hours of operation of all uses.
(2) The parking will be shared by the employees and customers/clients/
participants/etc., of multiple tenants on a single lot, without
assignment of any of the spaces to any person; and periodic mass
transit service from the CB and CB1 Districts will be available to
the main entrance of a minimum of one of the principal tenants
during all business days and from opening to closing times of the
majority of tenants on the lot.
(3) There is more than sufficient on-street parking for current demand
and demand from the proposed use during all hours of the day and
week. Special attention shall be placed upon hours when the
proposed use will have its peak parking demand. In such case, the
applicant shall provide a parking study in accordance with the
provisions of § 300-44E. The person who conducted the parking
study shall be present at the special exception hearing to testify
that the study is accurate.

287:1258
§ 300-49. Off-street loading requirements.
Except in R1, R2, R3, R4, CB and CB1 Districts, one or more loading
berths or other space shall be provided for standing, loading and unloading
operations either inside or outside a building and on the same or adjoining
premises with every building or structure hereafter erected or enlarged, in
accordance with the following table. When the computation of any required
loading berths or spaces results in a fractional berth or space, any fraction
up to 49.9% shall be disregarded, and fractions 50% and over shall be
rounded up; provided, however, that in no case shall the computation result
in less than one loading berth or space. A loading berth shall have a
minimum plan dimension of 12 feet by 45 feet and fourteen-foot overhead
clearing plus necessary access space. A loading space need not necessarily
be a full berth but shall be sufficient to allow normal loading and unloading
operations of a kind and magnitude appropriate to the premises served
(4) The applicant shall subsidize public transit use by employees,
provided that public transit is conveniently available, or shall
provide carpooling or vanpooling; or the applicant proves that
employees work at home during much of the week.
(5) The applicant proves that the vast majority of its work involves
traveling to meet customers off site, or that an unusually high
percentage of the customers or patrons will walk to the use, and
therefore reduced parking is needed for customers/patrons.
(6) There is an existing public parking lot or parking garage that
routinely has adequate numbers of spaces available and is within
600 feet, walking distance, from a pedestrian entrance of the use.
The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the applicant agrees to
substantially subsidize use of such parking lot or garage by
customers/patrons/employees if such costs otherwise may cause
persons to not use the designated parking.
Note: For existing commercial storefronts in R3, R4, C1 or C2
Districts, see also § 300-11C, which may allow reduced parking.
C. Modification of parking lot dimensions and landscaping requirements.
As a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may approve
modifications of the parking lot dimension and landscaping
requirements contained in § 300-42 for residential and nonresidential
uses, provided that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that the proposed design and landscaping will be
superior to the design that would result from the strict adherence to the
standards and that the landscaping design has been reviewed and
found to be acceptable by the City Arborist. If the modification shall
impact required trees, the applicant shall submit the application to the
Shade Tree Commission (STC) for review and recommendation prior to
the Zoning Hearing Board hearing and shall bring the STC
recommendation to the hearing. [Amended 7-11-2017 by Ord. No.

determination of the matter or case. Designation of an alternate
pursuant to this section shall be made on a rotation basis.

vote if the member shall request it in writing.
§ 300-66. Hearings.

the following requirements:
C. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its

called for, the findings, shall be made by the Board; however, the
appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the City of
Lancaster, may, prior to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or
findings by the Board and accept the decision or findings of the hearing
officer as final.
D. The parties to the hearing shall be the City of Lancaster, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of record
before the Board, and any other person, including civic or community
organizations permitted to appear by the Board. The Board shall have

enter appearances, in writing, on forms provided by the Board for that
purpose.

stenographic record of the proceedings. The appearance fee for a

transcript is ordered by the Board or hearing officer or shall be paid by
the person appealing from the decision of the Board if such appeal is

memoranda, or other materials, except advice from their solicitor,
unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the material so
noticed, and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after the
commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless
all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
J. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before
the Board or hearing officer. Where the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon together with the reasons therefor.
Conclusions based on any provisions of this chapter or the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, or of any ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the
reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light of the
facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, and there
has been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board
shall make his report and recommendations available to the parties
within 45 days, and the parties shall be entitled to make written
representation thereon to the Board prior to final decision or entry of
findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later than 30 days
after the report of the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to render
the decision within the period required by this subsection, or fails to
hold the required hearing within 60 days from the date of the
applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing or on the record, to an extension of time. When a decision has
been rendered in favor of the applicant because of the failure of the
Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided, the Board
§ 300-66 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-66
287:1269
shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last
day it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as
provided in Subsection A. If the Board shall fail to provide such notice,
the applicant may do so. Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the
right of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to
Lancaster County Court of Common Pleas.
K. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him
not later than the day following the date of the decision or findings. To
all other persons who have filed their name and address with the Board
not later than the last day of the hearing, the Board shall provide, by
mail or otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a
statement of the place at which the full decision or findings may be

regarding special exceptions shall not be granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board unless and until:
A. A written application for a special exception shall be submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception
is sought and shall be accompanied by such information as required by
the Zoning Officer under § 300-58.
B. Notice of the hearing shall be given in accordance with § 300-66A.
C. A hearing shall be held pursuant to § 300-66. The applicant or his

under the section of this chapter described in the application to grant
the special exception and that the grant of the special exception will not
adversely affect the public interest.
E. The applicant shall present evidence to the Zoning Hearing Board that
the application complies with all the specific requirements contained in
this chapter for the grant of such special exception. The applicant shall
also have the duty and burden to prove that the following items have
been satisfactorily addressed so that the health, safety and welfare of
the neighborhood will be protected.
(1) Ingress and egress to property and proposed structures thereon
with particular reference to automotive and pedestrian safety and
convenience, traffic flow and control, and access in case of fire or
catastrophe;
(2) Off-street parking and loading areas, where required, with
particular attention to the items in Subsection E(1) above;
(3) The noise, glare, odor, vibration and other nuisance or hazard
effects of the special exception on adjoining properties and
properties generally in the district, particularly in consideration of
any late night or early morning hours of operation;
(4) Refuse and service areas, with particular reference to the items in
Subsection E(1), (2) and (3) above;
(5) Utilities, with reference to locations, availability and compatibility;
(6) Screening and buffering with reference to type, dimensions, and

(10) General compatibility with adjacent properties and other property
in the district.
F. The Zoning Hearing Board may prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the special exception is required shall be begun or
completed, or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action
within the time limit set shall void the special exception. If the Board
does not prescribe a time limit, the special exception shall become null
and void if no activity occurs within nine months from the date of
approval by the Zoning Hearing Board. Activity shall include the
submission of development or building plans to the City for additional
approvals.
G. If a special exception is granted by court order and no time limit has
been prescribed, the special exception shall become null and void if no
activity occurs within nine months from the date of the court order.
H. Consideration shall be given to the accommodation of persons with
disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a complete written
application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall have the authority to grant
a special exception allowing modifications to specific requirements of
this chapter if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board that such modifications are required under applicable
federal law to provide a "reasonable accommodation" to serve persons
who the applicant proves have "disabilities" (as defined in and
protected by federal laws). This provision provides a process for local
relief, without necessarily needing to prove that a hardship exists under
the zoning variance standards. This process also recognizes that federal
statutes and case law on this matter may change over time.
(1) Such reasonable accommodation shall be requested, in writing, in
accordance with the U.S. Fair Housing Act amendments315 and/or
the Americans with Disabilities Act,316 as amended, and/or under
closely related laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.
(2) If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation for
persons with disabilities, the applicant shall identify the following:
(a) The disability which is protected by such statutes;
(b) The extent of the modification of the provisions of this chapter
necessary for a reasonable accommodation; and
(c) The manner by which the reasonable accommodation
requested may be removed when such person(s) with a
protected disability no longer will be present on the property.

attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary
to implement the purposes of this chapter, such as, but not limited to,

Board regarding variances shall be made in accordance with the following
standards and criteria:
(3) Any modification approved under this section may be limited to the
time period during which persons with disabilities occupy or utilize
the premises.
(4) For example, this subsection may be utilized in the following
instances:

construction of a wheelchair ramp; or
(b) If an applicant proves that federal law requires the City to
allow a higher number of unrelated persons with disabilities in

(5) The applicant may be a person(s) with disabilities, or his/her
authorized agent, or a property-owner, lessee or other entity who is

following, when relevant:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
§ 300-68 LANCASTER CODE § 300-69
287:1274
conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that the
authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not:
(a) Alter or detract from the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;

that could be reasonably avoided;
(c) Substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property; nor
(d) Be detrimental to the public welfare.

variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
E. The Zoning Hearing Board shall make findings that the requirements of
Article XII,§ 300-69D, have been met by the applicant for a variance.
F. The Zoning Hearing Board shall further make a finding that the reasons
set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and that
the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.

granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood,

action for which the variance is required shall be begun or completed,
or both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the

proposed telecommunications tower cannot be accommodated
on an existing or approved structure or building or on land
owned by the City of Lancaster. The City Zoning Hearing Board
may deny an application to construct a new
telecommunications tower if the applicant has not made a good
faith effort to mount the telecommunications antenna on an
existing structure. The applicant shall demonstrate that it
contacted the owners of tall structures, buildings, and towers
within a one-quarter-of-a-mile radius of the site proposed,
sought permission to install a telecommunications antenna on
§ 300-87 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-87
287:1321
those structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one
of the following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower,
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
[3] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
[4] A commercially reasonable agreement could not be
reached with the owner of such building, structure, or
tower.
(g) Permit required for modifications. To the extent permissible
under applicable state and federal law, any applicant proposing
the modification of an existing telecommunications tower,
which increases the overall height of such wireless support
structure, shall first obtain a building permit from the City.
Nonroutine modifications shall be prohibited without such
permit.
(h) Gap in coverage. An applicant for a telecommunications tower
must demonstrate that a significant gap in wireless coverage
or capacity exists in the applicable area and that the type of
telecommunications tower being proposed is the least intrusive
means by which to fill that gap. The existence or nonexistence
of a gap in wireless coverage or capacity shall be a factor in the
City Zoning Hearing Board's decision on an application for
approval of a telecommunications tower.
(i) Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all
telecommunications towers, the WCF applicant shall provide
the City with a written commitment that it will allow other
service providers to co-locate telecommunications antennas on
telecommunications towers where technically and
economically feasible. The owner of a telecommunications
tower shall not install any additional telecommunications
antennas without obtaining the prior written approval of the
City.
(j) Wind. Any telecommunications tower structures shall be
designed to withstand the effects of wind gusts of at least 100
§ 300-87 LANCASTER CODE § 300-87
287:1322
miles per hour in addition to the standard designed by the
American National Standards Institute as prepared by the
engineering departments of the Electronics Industry
Association and Telecommunications Industry Association
(ANSI/EIA/TIA-222), as amended.
(k) Height. Any telecommunications tower shall be designed at the
minimum functional height. The maximum height of any new
telecommunications tower outside the public rights-of-way
shall be 175 feet. Telecommunications towers in the ROW shall
not exceed a height comparable to the average height of utility
poles or electrical poles within a two-block radius of the
proposed facility.
(l) Related equipment. Either one single-story wireless
communications equipment building not exceeding 250 square
feet in area or up to five metal boxes placed on a concrete pad
not exceeding 10 feet by 20 feet in area housing the receiving
and transmitting equipment may be located on the site for each
unrelated company sharing space on the telecommunications
tower.
(m) Public safety communications and other communications
services. No telecommunications tower shall interfere with
public safety communications or the reception of broadband,
television, radio or other communication services enjoyed by
occupants of nearby properties.
(n) Maintenance. The following maintenance requirements shall
apply:
[1] Any telecommunications tower shall be fully automated
and unattended on a daily basis and shall be visited only
for maintenance or emergency repair.
[2] Such maintenance shall be performed to ensure the
upkeep of the telecommunications tower in order to
promote the safety and security of the City's residents and
utilize the best available technology for preventing failures
and accidents.
(o) Radio frequency emissions. A telecommunications tower shall
not, by itself or in conjunction with other telecommunications
towers or telecommunications antennas, generate radio
frequency emissions in excess of the standards and regulations
of the FCC, including but not limited to the FCC Office of
Engineering Technology Bulletin 65 entitled "Evaluating
Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to Radio
Frequency Electromagnetic Fields," as amended.
(p) Historic buildings or districts. No telecommunications tower
may be located upon any property, or on a building or
§ 300-87 VEHICLES FOR HIRE § 300-87
287:1323
structure, that is listed on either the National or Pennsylvania
Register of Historic Places, that is within the City's Local
Historic District (either inside or outside the public rightsof-
way), or that is deemed by the City to be an historically
significant structure. All applications for proposed
telecommunications towers that are to be located in the
Heritage Conservation District shall be reviewed by the City
of Lancaster Historic Preservation Specialist to ensure that
the stealth technology chosen for the proposed structure is
appropriate and conforms to City requirements.
(q) Signs. All telecommunications towers shall post a sign in a
readily visible location identifying the name and phone number
of a party to contact in the event of an emergency. The only
other signage permitted on the telecommunications tower
shall be those required by the FCC or any other federal or state
agency.
(r) Lighting. No telecommunications tower shall be artificially
lighted, except as required by law. If lighting is required, the
applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting,
demonstrating as unobtrusive and inoffensive an effect as is
permissible under state and federal regulations. Automatic
lighting is prohibited, and all lighting must be controlled
manually by an on-site switch. The applicant shall promptly
report any outage or malfunction of FAA-mandated lighting to
the appropriate governmental authorities and to the City
Manager.
(s) Noise. Telecommunications towers shall be operated and
maintained so as not to produce noise in excess of applicable
noise standards under state law and the City Code, except in
emergency situations requiring the use of a backup generator,
where such noise standards may be exceeded on a temporary
basis only.
(t) Aviation safety. Telecommunications towers shall comply with
all federal and state laws and regulations concerning aviation
safety.
(u) Retention of experts. The City may hire any consultant and/or
expert necessary to assist the City in reviewing and evaluating
the application for approval of the telecommunications tower
and, once approved, in reviewing and evaluating any potential
violations of the terms and conditions of these provisions. The
applicant and/or owner of the telecommunications tower shall
reimburse the City for all costs of the City's consultant(s) in
providing expert evaluation and consultation in connection
with these activities.
