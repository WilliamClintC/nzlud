[Ord. 600, 5/5/1997, § 1]
No insurance company, association or exchange (hereinafter the "insurer") doing business in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a
structure located within the Borough, where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds $7,500, unless the insurer is furnished by the Borough's
Treasurer with a certificate pursuant to § 508(b) of the Insurance Company Law of 1921, as
amended by Act 98 of 1992, and Act 93 of 1994, (collectively the "Act") and unless there is

expenses"), the Treasurer of the Borough shall immediately render a bill for such work, if he has
not already done so.
Upon written request of the named insured specifying the tax description of the property, the name
and address of the insurer and the date of receipt by the insurer of a loss report of the claim, the
Treasurer shall furnish to the insurer, within 14 working days after the request:

A certificate stating that there are no unpaid Borough claims or Borough expenses against the
property as of the date specified in the request; or,
A certificate specifying the nature and amount of such Borough claims or Borough expenses,
accompanied by a bill for such amounts. Taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges
shall be deemed delinquent for this purpose, if a lien could have been filed for such claims
under applicable law. Upon receipt of a certificate and bill pursuant to the preceding sentence,
the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer an amount from the insurance proceeds sufficient to
pay such sums prior to making payment to the named insured, subject to the provisions of
Subsection 4 hereof.
When all Borough claims and Borough expenses have been paid pursuant to Subsection 3 of this
Section, where the Treasurer has issued a certificate described in Subsection 3 indicating that
there are no Borough claims or Borough expenses against the property, the insurer shall pay the
claim of the named insured unless the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer
equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or
structure. In the case of such a loss, the following procedures must be followed:
The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Treasurer, in the aggregate,
$2,000 for each $15,000 of such claim or fraction thereof.

the Borough, a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the
building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under the foregoing
transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to the Treasurer, from the insurance proceeds, the
amount specified in the estimate. If there is more than one insurer, the transfer of proceeds
shall be on a pro rata basis by all insurers insuring the building or other structure.
Upon receipt of the above described portion of the insurance proceeds, the Treasurer shall:
Place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the total
Borough expenses anticipated by the Borough to be required in removing, repairing or
securing the building or structure as required by this Part. Such costs shall include,
without limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the Borough
in connection with such removal, repair or securing or any proceedings related thereto;
and,
Mail to the named insured, at the address received from the insurer, a notice that the
proceeds have been received by the Borough and that the procedures under this
subsection shall be followed.
Following the transfer, the named insured may submit to the Borough a contractor's
signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure, in which event the Treasurer shall, if such estimate is deemed by the Treasurer
to be reasonable, return to the named insured the amount of the funds transferred to the
Borough in excess of that required to pay the Borough expenses; provided, the Borough
has not incurred costs to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
Pay to the Borough Secretary for reimbursement to the Borough General Fund the
amount of the Borough expenses incurred by the Borough.
Pay the remaining balance in the fund (without interest) to the named insured upon
receipt of a certificate issued by the Building Inspector that the repair, removal or
securing of the building or other structure has been completed in accordance with all
applicable codes and regulations of the Borough.

§ 1001. Prohibition of Sexual Harassment.
[Ord. 628, 6/7/1999; as amended by Ord. 633, 10/7/1999]
In General. It is the Borough's policy to provide a positive, discrimination-free work environment,
and therefore, sexual harassment in the workplace is unacceptable conduct that will not be
tolerated. It is to be clearly understood that persons of either sex can be found to have engaged in
sexual harassment. Proper decorum in speech, dress and interpersonal relationships shall be
observed at all times. Sexual harassment is prohibited by law.
Definition. For purposes of this Part, "sexual harassment" is unsolicited, nonreciprocal behavior by
an officer, elected official or employee who is in a position to control or affect another person's job
status with the Borough and who uses the power or authority of that position to cause that person
to submit to sexual activity or to fear that he or she would be punished for refusal to submit.
"Sexual harassment" also includes any conduct by an officer, elected official or employee which
unreasonably interferes with another's work performance for the Borough by creating an
intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. Sexual harassment consists of a variety of
behaviors including, but not limited to:
Subtle pressure for sexual activity.
Inappropriate touching.
Inappropriate language.
Demands or requests for sexual favors.
Physical assault.
Unwelcome sexual advance.
Offensive comments, jokes, innuendo and other sexually oriented statements or conduct.
Reports of Sexual Harassment. The Borough strongly encourages all officers, elected officials and
employees to report all situations which they believe may constitute job-related harassment on the
basis of sex, race or other impermissible factors or other violations of this Part, including both
actions against them personally and actions against others. Where appropriate, reports should
initially be made to the reporting individual's immediate supervisor. However, the Borough
recognizes that a person may not be comfortable making such a report to his/her immediate
supervisor or may not believe that such a report will be effective. Accordingly, in those situations,
reports may be made to the Borough Executive Secretary, the President of Borough Council or the
Borough Solicitor.
Investigation and Remedy. All reports of sexual harassment or other violations of this Part shall be
promptly investigated with due regard for the privacy and confidentiality of all parties and
witnesses involved. The Borough shall take prompt and effective action to remedy any violation of
this Part.
Limited Disclosures. No disclosures shall be made of any reports under Subsection 3 except to
the extent necessary to investigate the report appropriately or remedy the problem, or as required
by law.
Retaliation. No officer, elected official or employee shall take any action against any person for
making a good-faith report under Subsection 3 or for cooperating with any investigation under
Subsection 4.
8/13/2020 Borough of Fountain Hill, PA Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/FO0261?guid=FO0261&children=true 13/417

8.
Disciplinary Action. The Borough will treat sexual harassment, and retaliation for reporting sexual
harassment or cooperating with an investigation of sexual harassment, as forms of misconduct.
Employees who engage in harassing or retaliating behavior shall be disciplined appropriately, up
to and including dismissal. Any discipline against police officers shall be in accordance with the
civil service provisions and any other relevant provisions of the Borough Code and in accordance
with the collective bargaining agreement in effect at that time.
A copy of this policy shall be posted conspicuously throughout the workplace.

Zoning/Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a written notice to the owner or manager to
order eviction of the occupant. If the disruptive conduct was caused by only one of multiple
occupants, then at the discretion of the owner or manager, the eviction may be limited to that
occupant. The owner shall begin eviction proceedings within 15 days after receiving such
notice and shall continue such proceedings to completion, without interruption, unless the
occupant voluntarily vacates the premises.
Upon eviction, the occupant shall not be permitted to occupy any part of the premises for the
remainder of the term of the rental agreement.

maintenance and/or repair, actual legal fees and court costs together with an administrative fee in
the amount of 25% of actual costs incurred or $50, whichever is greater, for each time the
Borough shall cause a violation to be corrected. The owner shall be billed after such work has
been completed, and any such bill that remains unpaid and outstanding after 30 days shall carry
interest at the legal rate and be grounds for the placement of a municipal lien as provided by law.
Inspection by the Borough. The owner shall permit and schedule inspections of the premises by a
Zoning/Code Enforcement Officer during Borough business hours, after a minimum of seven
calendar days' notice. The owner shall provide a minimum of three calendar days' advance notice

requirements shall not apply where the Zoning/Code Enforcement Officer has reason to believe
that there is occurring, or that there is about to occur, a threat to the public health, safety or
welfare.

supply system of the City of Bethlehem, there shall be a sewer rental separate from and in addition to
any sewer rental based on the consumption of water from the water supply system of the City of
Bethlehem. Such separate or additional sewer rental shall be measured by the quantity of water from
the source or sources other than the water supply system of the City of Bethlehem which is discharged
into the sewers of the Borough of Fountain Hill from said property. The owner of each such property
shall install, without cost to the Borough of Fountain Hill, a meter or meters to measure the quantity of
water received from other than the water supply system of the City of Bethlehem and discharged into
the sewers of the Borough of Fountain Hill. No meter shall be installed or be used for such purpose
without the approval of the Borough Engineer; and the Borough Engineer shall certify to the Secretary
of the Borough of Fountain Hill the ferrule size through which each meter so used would customarily be
supplied with water from the water supply system of the City of Bethlehem; and the sewer rental based
upon the water received from other than the water supply system of the City of Bethlehem shall be the
same in amount as is required to be paid by the owner of a metered property receiving the same
quantity of water from the water supply system of the City of Bethlehem and having the certified size of
meter.
If the owner of said property fails to install an approved meter or meters, the Borough Engineer shall
make flow measurements of the waste discharged and furnish to the Secretary of the Borough of
Fountain Hill an estimate of the amount of water from sources other than the water supply system of
the City of Bethlehem which is discharged into the sewers of the Borough of Fountain Hill from the said
property and shall certify the meter size through which the estimated quantity of water equal to the
amount required to be paid for a metered property receiving the estimated quantity of water and having
the certified size of meter. Costs for such flow measurements shall be borne by the user of the
particular property and shall become part of the sewer rental charge.
§ 205. Industrial or Commercial Water Discharge Measurement.
[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 5]
Whenever a property upon which a sewer rental is hereby imposed uses water from the water supply
system of the City of Bethlehem for an industrial or commercial purpose such that the water so used is
not polluted to an extent that its discharge to storm sewers is objectionable, and is not discharged into
the sanitary sewerage system of the Borough, the quantity of water so used and not discharged into
the sanitary sewers of the Borough of Fountain Hill shall be excluded in determining the sewer rental of
said property; provided that the quantity of water so used and not discharged into the Borough's
sewers is measured by a device or devices approved by the Borough Engineer, and installed without
cost to the Borough, and provided that the water supply of said property is metered and the owner
pays for the water at meter rates. The sewer rental based upon the consumption of water to be paid by
the owner of said property shall be computed at the percentage specified in § 203 hereof for a metered
property having the same size meter as said property and using a quantity of water equal to the total
quantity of water furnished said property by the City of Bethlehem, less the quantity not discharged into
the sanitary sewers of the Borough of Fountain Hill; provided, however, that where, in the opinion of
the Borough Engineer, it is not practical to install a measuring device to determine continuously the
quantity of water not discharged into the Borough's sanitary sewers, the Borough Engineer shall
determine periodically, in such manner and by such method as he may prescribe, the percentage of
metered water discharged into the Borough's sewers. The quantity of water used to determine the
sewerage rental shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity measured by the water meter or

[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 6]
All meters or other measuring devices installed or required to be used under the provisions of this Part
2 shall be under the control of the Borough Engineer. The owner of the property upon which any such
measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping; and all repairs
thereto shall be made at the owner's cost, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear
and tear or other causes. Bills for such repairs, if made by the Borough, shall be due and payable
within one month of the completion of such repairs, shall bear a penalty of $5 and shall be collected in
the same manner hereinafter provided for collection of sewer rentals or charges.
§ 207. Allowable Discount.
[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 7]

amended.
§ 209. Determination of Charge for Less Than Full Year of
Service.
[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 9]
Whenever sewer service to any property begins after the first day or terminates before the last day of
any year as set forth in § 208 hereof, the sewer rental for such property for such year shall be for that
portion of the year during which the said property is served; provided, however, that in making such
apportionment, a fraction of a month amounting to 1/2 or more of a month shall be counted a full
month, and a fraction of a month amounting to less than 1/2 of a month shall be disregarded.
§ 210. Collection of Sewer Rents.
The Office of the Executive Administrator/Secretary of the Borough of Fountain Hill is hereby
charged with the duty of collecting all residential and commercial sewer rents and is authorized to

shall be classified as delinquent. The Borough shall notify the property owner of the
delinquency in writing, via first class, postage prepaid United States mail, at the last known
address of the property owner.
In the event that a property owner makes payments on a delinquent account, those
payments shall be first applied to satisfying the delinquent charges until such delinquent
charges are paid in full, at which time any excess monies collected will be applied against
current fees, costs, interest, penalties and principal account balance.
[Amended by Ord. 825, 7/5/2016]
The Executive Administrator is authorized, in appropriate cases, to enter into agreements
permitting the property owner to make payments on his or her delinquent rentals.
The Executive Administrator shall permit property owners to enter into the agreements
mentioned in Subsection (2) above when (i) the gross household income for a property
owner is less than or equal to the annual Poverty Guidelines as set forth by the United
States Department of Health and Human Services, and (ii) the property owner does not
owe more than $1,500 in delinquent rentals. This subsection may be amended from time
to time by resolution of Borough Council as to the eligibility to enter into agreements.
The monthly payment plans shall be completed as follows:
[Amended by Ord. No. 847, 12/3/2018]
If the total amount of delinquent rentals is less than $500, the property owner may
enter into a repayment plan not to exceed 90 days, with a minimum monthly
payment equal to the total amount outstanding divided by three.
If the total amount of delinquent rentals is equal to or greater than $500 but less than
$1,000, the property owner may enter into a repayment plan not to exceed 120 days,
with a minimum monthly payment equal to the total amount outstanding divided by
four.
If the total amount of delinquent rentals is equal to or greater than $1,000, the
property owner may enter into a repayment plan not to exceed 180 days, with a
minimum monthly payment equal to the total amount outstanding divided by six.
If a property owner should fail to pay any current quarterly sewer charge while enrolled in
a monthly repayment plan as set forth in Section 210.2B(4), any and all delinquent
rentals owed pursuant to the repayment plan will become immediately due and payable.
Failure to pay any installment of delinquent rental when due pursuant to any repayment
plan entered into between the Borough and the property owner will result in an
enforcement action, additional interest, late fees, costs of collection and attorney's fees.
Third-Party Collection. The Borough account collection procedure and fees shall be as

The engagement of the agency shall be confirmed by a written agreement, and the
agreement shall be approved by the Borough Solicitor and by a resolution of
Borough Council.
If sewer rentals and residential and commercial solid waste fees are not paid in full
within 60 calendar days after the same become due and payable, said accounts, in
addition to incurring the late charges and interest set forth in the Code of Ordinances
of the Borough, shall be deemed "delinquent."
Schedule of Fees. The Borough approves and adopts the following schedule of
agency fees for services in connection with the collection of accounts, which is
hereby determined to be fair and reasonable compensation for the services of such
Agency:
The agency shall collect the balance due, interest and costs, and in addition
thereto, collect 15% as its fee for the services provided, which 15% shall be
added to the delinquent account and is not payable by the Borough.
The fifteen-percent fee may be modified from time to time by resolution of
Borough Council.
After the account is assigned in accordance with the procedures of this
subsection, the fifteen-percent fee will be due whether payment is made to to
the agency or to the Borough.
Collection Procedures. The following collection procedures are hereby established to
be the policy of the Borough:
Accounts shall be assigned by the Borough Executive Secretary to the agency
at such time as the account has been delinquent for two quarters. The Borough
reserves the right to retain any delinquent account for collection by the Borough.
The agency shall make reasonable efforts at collecting the account, including:
Contacting the delinquent account holder by telephone; and/or
Contacting the delinquent account holder by mail.
The agency shall accept offers by account holders to establish payment plans to
satisfy outstanding balances if the outstanding balance exceeds two quarters;
however, if the nature of the delinquent account involves a municipal "claim" as
defined by the Act, no payment plan shall exceed six months from the date that
the service giving rise to the claim occurred as the Act imposes a six-month
statute of limitations on municipal "claims." In the event that there is a question
as to whether the account is subject to this six-month statute of limitations, the
agency shall consult with the Borough Solicitor to ensure that the statute of
limitations does not expire. If the rental is not paid after 30 days' notice, the
agency may collect it by an action in assumpsit, or by lien filed in the nature of a
municipal lien.
Any agency fees assessed in accordance with the foregoing fee schedule paid
to the Borough shall be forwarded to the agency in accordance with the terms of
the Borough's written agreement with the agency.
All collection procedures shall be reviewed and approved by the Borough
Solicitor prior to implementation.
The agency is authorized to exercise all reasonable and legal remedies
provided by law and including, but not limited to, the Municipal Claim and Tax

Borough or the City of Bethlehem, a written statement, under oath or affirmation,
stating that he/she has a just defense to the claim, or part of it, for such rentals or
charges, then the water supply shall not be shut off until the claim has been judicially
determined. The statement shall also contain a declaration under oath or an
affirmation that it was not executed for the purpose of delay.

Bethlehem to shut off or deny water service to any lessee or a property because a
previous lessee failed to pay the sewer rental charge.
If requested by the City of Bethlehem, the Borough shall pay to the City the mutually
agreed cost of such shutoff service and the estimated loss of water revenues
resulting from such shutoff. Any such costs shall be reimbursed by the owner or
occupant of the premises at which the water is shut off.
The Borough may enter into a long-term agreement with the City of Bethlehem for
the performance of such water shutoff services; which agreement shall be binding
upon the City of Bethlehem, its successors and assigns.

§ 212. Certain Properties Exempt from Rental or Charges.
[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 12]
No sewer rental is hereby imposed on properties outside the Borough of Fountain Hill from which
sewage and other liquid wastes are discharged into the sewers of the Borough under an agreement
between the Borough of Fountain Hill and any other political subdivision of the commonwealth nor
upon properties within the Borough where sewer facilities are not available.
Sewage and other liquid wastes from properties outside the Borough of Fountain Hill which are not
included in the terms of any agreement between the Borough of Fountain Hill and the political
subdivisions in which such property is situated shall not be discharged into the sewers or sewage
system of the Borough of Fountain Hill in the absence of a contract, in writing, between the owner of

§ 214. Charges for Industrial Waste.
[Ord. 188, 7/14/1954, § 14]
Industries, including hospitals, discharging wastes resulting from any manufacturing or industrial
processes or resulting from the operation of a hospital shall be charged a sewer rental based upon
the volume and concentration of each industry's or hospital's sewage waste as determined by
measurement and analysis of the waste of each industry or hospital discharging industrial or
hospital wastes, as above set forth, in the sewer system of the Borough of Fountain Hill. The
amount of sewer rental charged against each industry or hospital discharging industrial or hospital
sewage wastes into the Borough's sewer system shall be determined quarterly, in the manner
hereinafter set forth, and shall be payable to the Borough in quarterly annual installments in
accordance with statements therefor forwarded by the Borough to each industry or hospital
subject to such quarterly sewer rental charge. The concentration of waste is defined as the
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and the chlorine demand (CD). Volume of flow shall be
determined as stated in §§ 203, 204, 205 and 206 of this Part 2.
The concentration of a waste shall be determined by collection and analysis of quarterly samples
of said waste, composited over the period of a working day of the industry or hospital discharging
said waste. Said samples shall be collected and analyzed by the Borough Engineer or his qualified
assistants. Analyses of samples shall be performed in accordance with methods prescribed in the
most recent edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage, American
Public Health Association."
The formula to be used in computing industrial or hospital waste sewer rentals or charges shall be
the same as in use by the City of Bethlehem, which is as follows:
R = (Vs x F1) + (Vl x F2) + (Vl x BOD 165 + Vl x CD 10) F3, in which
Where:
R = Rental or charge, per year.
Vs = Volume of sanitary sewage discharged from the industry in thousands of gallons.
Vl = Volume of industrial or hospital waste discharged from the industry or hospital in
thousands of gallons.
F1 = A factor based upon the cost of treating a thousand gallons of sanitary sewage.
F2 = A factor based upon the fixed cost of treating a thousand gallons of industrial or
hospital waste.
F3 = A factor based upon the variable cost of treating a thousand gallons of industrial or
hospital waste having a BOD and chlorine demand in excess of 165 and 10 parts
per million, respectively, which is the average BOD and chlorine demand of normal
domestic sewage from the Borough of Fountain Hill. The cost of treatment is
determined by fixed charges plus the cost of labor, chemicals, fuel and electrical
energy required for maintenance and operation of the complete sewerage system.
The fixed and variable costs of treatment are based upon the costs established by the City of
Bethlehem and the Bethlehem Authority.

Stormwater, surface water, groundwater, artesian well water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage,
unpolluted industrial process water, unpolluted cooling water (also refer to Article 915), or
swimming pool drainage (also refer to Article 921), unless specifically authorized by the
Superintendent.
Sludges, screenings or other residues from the pretreatment of industrial wastes, unless
specifically authorized by the Superintendent.
Wastes generated in the diagnosis, treatment, immunization or autopsy of human beings or
animals, in research pertaining thereto, or in the preparation of human or animal remains for
burial or cremation, unless specifically authorized by the Superintendent.
Wastewater, alone or in conjunction with other sources, causing the POTW treatment plant's
effluent to fail a toxicity test.
Detergents, surface-active agents or other substances which may cause excessive foaming in
the POTW.
When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator determines that a user is contributing to the
POTW any of the above-enumerated substances in such amounts as to cause pass-through
or interference with the operation of the POTW and/or POTW treatment plant, the Industrial
Pretreatment Coordinator shall: (1) notify the user of the impact of the contribution on the
POTW and/or POTW treatment plant; (2) develop effluent limitation(s), as needed, for the
user to correct the pass-through or interference with the POTW and/or POTW treatment
plant; and (3) proceed with enforcement pursuant to the provisions of § 405 of this Part.
Pollutants, substances or wastewater prohibited by this section shall not be processed or
stored in such a manner that they have a reasonable potential to be discharged to the
POTW.
National Pretreatment Standards and National Categorical Standards. All industrial users are
immediately subject to the National Pretreatment Standards. Upon promulgation of National
Categorical Standards listed in 40 CFR, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, industrial users must
comply with all applicable standards and other requirements promulgated by EPA. Any categorical
standard, if more stringent than any limitations imposed under this Part, shall immediately
supersede the limitations imposed under this Part. The Superintendent shall notify all affected
users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
Where a categorical standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may
impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
When wastewater subject to a categorical standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by
the same standard, the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator shall impose an alternate limit
using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
An industrial user may obtain a variance from a categorical standard from EPA if the industrial
user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by
EPA when developing the categorical standard. If a variance is obtained, the City reserves the
right to modify the industrial user's permit to incorporate the revised standards and
requirements.
An industrial user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.15.
Modification of National Categorical Standards. Where the City's POTW treatment plant achieves
consistent removal of pollutants limited by National Categorical Standards, the City may apply to

the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the National Categorical Standards.
"Consistent removal" is defined by EPA in 40 CFR 403.7(b). The City may then modify pollutant
discharge limits in the National Categorical Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR,
Part 403, Section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
Specific Pollutant Discharge Limitations, Local Limits. Under § 402(6) of this Part and in
accordance with 40 CFR § 403.5(c), the Borough imposes the following specific pollutant
discharge limitations for all industrial users:
Maximum Allowable Concentration
(Twenty-Four-Hour Average)
Pollutant
(Total)
Local Limit
(mg/l)
Arsenic 0.11
Cadmium 0.05
Chromium 0.91
Copper 1.35
Lead 0.39
Mercury 0.007
Molybdenum 0.22
Nickel 1.36
Selenium 0.23
Silver 0.21
Zinc 2.58
Cyanide 0.38
The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above are the highest allowable concentration
in any type of sample, either a grab or composite, collected over any time interval, unless
otherwise specified in an IWDP.
The specific pollutant discharge limitations listed above apply at the point where the wastewater
is discharged to the POTW or at the point designated by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator.
In addition to industrial users, the City reserves the right to apply the specific pollutant discharge
limitations listed above to any user's wastewater discharge which is not composed of strictly
domestic sewage.
The City reserves the right to establish alternate specific pollutant discharge limitations in
individual industrial waste discharge permits, but only in accordance with regulatory
requirements. In no event shall any alternate limit allow the total loading allocated to all industrial
users for any pollutant to exceed the maximum allowable industrial headworks loading as
determined by the City's most recent local limits evaluation approved by the approval authority,
defined in 40 CFR Part 403. The specific pollutant discharge limitations, if more stringent than
the National Categorical Standards, shall immediately supersede the categorical standards.
State Requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case
where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this Part 4.
Borough's Right of Revision. The Borough reserves the right to establish by ordinance morestringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed
necessary.
Excessive Discharge. No user shall increase the use of process water solely for the purpose of
complying with this Part or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete

substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
National Categorical Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the City
or state. The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator may impose mass limitations on users who are
using dilution to meet applicable National Categorical Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitations or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
Slug Load/Accidental Discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection from slug loads
and/or accidental discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this Part.
Facilities to prevent slug loads and/or accidental discharges of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense. In the case of an
accidental discharge/slug loads, it shall be the responsibility of the industrial user, upon discovery,
and after assessing the situation and taking initial corrective action, to immediately telephone and
notify the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident. The notification shall include location
of discharge, type of waste, estimated concentration and volume if known, and initial corrective
actions taken by the industrial user.
Written Notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge/slug loads; the industrial
user shall submit to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator a detailed written report including
the date, time, duration of the discharge as well as describing the cause of the discharge, all
corrective measures implemented or attempted, and measures to be taken by the industrial
user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial
user of any expenses, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fishkills or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be
imposed by this Part or other applicable articles or laws.
Notice to Employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of an accidental
discharge/slug load. Employers shall ensure that all employees are advised of the emergency
notification procedures.
Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. An accidental discharge or slug control plan, as
prescribed under 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(v), shall be required:
For new source industrial users. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide protection from accidental discharges or slugs shall be submitted to the City for
review as part of the IWDP application and shall be approved by the City before construction
of the facility.
For existing industrial users. The Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator shall evaluate whether
each industrial user needs a new or updated accidental discharge/slug control plan.
Should the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator require the industrial user to develop, submit for
approval, and implement a new or updated accidental discharge/slug control plan, the accidental
discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator of any accidental
or slug discharge, as required by Section 923.02(h) of this the City ordinance; and
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures shall include but are not limited to inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for

containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
When an existing industrial user is required by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator to
provide and/or modify an accidental discharge/slug control plan, the industrial user shall
provide the plan within 60 days of notification. Should the plan require construction or
implementation of measures to meet compliance, the plan shall provide a schedule for those
actions. After initial review, should additional information be required to provide a complete
plan, it shall be furnished to the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator within 30 days of the
date of notification. Failure to submit a revised plan and/or failure to provide a complete plan
after the thirty-day submission period may render the industrial waste discharge permit void.
The City's review and approval of accidental discharge/slug control plans shall not relieve
the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the industrial user's facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this Part.
If not specifically required by the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator, the information,
requirements, etc., called for in a plan are not waived by the City and the industrial user shall
provide all necessary items, procedures, etc., to prevent any accidental discharge and/or
slug discharge to the POTW.
An approved state pollution prevention plan may substitute for all or a portion of the contents
of an accidental discharge/slug control plan to the extent that it satisfies the requirements
described herein.
All users are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting
potential for a slug discharge.

[Ord. 380, 5/6/1985; as amended by Ord. 520, 8/9/1993; and by Ord. 669, 5/6/2002]
Suspension. The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or an IWD permit
without prior notice when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health
or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the City to
violate any condition of its NPDES permit. In the event of a failure of the person to comply
voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate termination of water service and/or immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize danger to the POTW system or endangerment of any individuals. The service
and/or IWD Permit shall be restored within five working days when, in the opinion of the City, the
actual or threatened cause for the suspension has been removed. The above actions shall be
taken only as ordered by the Director of Water and Sewer Resources.
Notice of Suspension. In the event that the City decides it is necessary to suspend its wastewater
treatment service for reasons other than as described above, the user shall be given a fifteen-day
notice of such suspension. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment
service and/or IWD permit shall stop or eliminate the contribution as required in the suspension
notice. Between the time of the notice of suspension of services and the date services are
terminated, the user shall have the right to have a show-cause hearing with appropriate City
officials regarding the cause of the suspension. The City shall reinstate the IWD permit and/or
wastewater treatment service within five working days upon proof of the elimination of the
noncomplying discharge or in compliance with instruction of the hearing board. A detailed written
statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contributions and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the City within five days of
the date of occurrence. In the event of a failure of the user to comply with the suspension notice,
the City may take such steps as deemed necessary to terminate the service.

4, the industrial waste discharge permit, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained
herein, the City may serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation.
Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be
submitted to the City by the user.
Hearing Board.
A Hearing Board shall be appointed by the Mayor of the City of Bethlehem as needed, for the
purpose of hearing and deciding appeals between the City and users on matters concerning
interpretation and execution of the provisions of this Part. Cost of appeals shall be borne by
the user requesting an appeal.
The Chairperson of the Board shall be a member of City Council's Public Works Committee;
one member shall be a professional engineer skilled in the practice of sanitary engineering;
one member shall be a representative of an industry or manufacturing enterprise; one
member shall be a representative of a local environmental organization; and one member
shall be selected at large for that member's interest in accomplishing the objectives of this
Part.
Terms on the Board shall be for a period of five years. The Mayor shall appoint
representatives to fill vacancies on the Board to complete unexpired terms. Interim
appointments may be permitted to serve an additional full term on the Board. Hearing Boards
may be appointed as standing panels, or on a case-by-case basis, as determined from time to
time, in the sole discretion of the Mayor.
Show-Cause Hearing.
The City may order any user who causes or allows an unauthorized discharge to enter the
POTW to show cause before the Hearing Board why the proposed enforcement action should
not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing
to be held by the Hearing Board regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be
taken, the proposed enforcement action and directing the user to show cause before the
Hearing Board why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the

public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
After the Hearing Board has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer
service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related
appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, devices or other
related appurtenances are properly operated. Further and/or other orders and directives as
are necessary and appropriate may be issued.
Consent Orders. The City may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or
other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance.
Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document.
Compliance Orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated,
or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the time provided, wastewater service may be discontinued unless
adequate facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the POTW. A compliance schedule contained in any compliance order
shall not be construed as an extension of the deadline for compliance established for any
pretreatment standards or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation.
Cease and Desist Orders. When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Part, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
recur, the City may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations
and directing the user to:
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations, terminating the discharge or
hauling noncompliant discharges off-site for proper disposal.
Administrative Fines.
When the Industrial Pretreatment Coordinator finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Part, an IWDP or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City may fine such user in an amount not to
exceed the amount set forth Section 923.99 of the City's Ordinance for each violation
regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. Such fines shall be assessed in accordance with the
terms set forth in this Part and/or the City's enforcement response plan. In the case of weekly,
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.
A lien against the user's property will be sought and other enforcement collection action may
be taken for unpaid fines.
Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file a written request for the City to reconsider the
fine along with the full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine.
The Hearing Board may convene to deliberate on the matter. In the event the appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the
8/13/2020 Borough of Fountain Hill, PA Ecode360

user. The City may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as
notices and orders, to the fine when the fine and/or a portion of same is substantiated.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
Legal Action. The City shall be able to seek injunctive relief for noncompliance by users with
pretreatment standards or requirements. Injunctive relief is available for violations of any
requirement stated in this Part or industrial waste discharge permits, including but not limited to
wastewater discharge violations, failure to allow access by the City to a user's facility, failure to
submit reports by a specified deadline or any violation of any order of the City. The City Solicitor
may commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the local Court of
Common Pleas.
Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part are not exclusive. The City may
take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of
industrial pretreatment program violations will be in accordance with this Part and/or the City's
enforcement response plan. However, the City may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the City is empowered to take more than one enforcement action
against any noncompliant user. Where the enforcement response plan does not provide guidelines
on enforcement action for a specific instance of noncompliance, the City may impose other
appropriate enforcement action to address the noncompliance.
Appeals. A user may appeal the terms of an IWDP, administrative fine or any administrative action
within 30 days of notice of its issuance. The written appeal request shall provide the name,
address and telephone number of the appellant as well the date that the City took the action which
is the subject matter of the appeal. In its petition, the appealing party shall also indicate the
provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection and the alternative condition, if any.
Failure to submit a timely appeal for review shall be deemed to be a waiver of the
administrative appeal.
The conditions of the current IWDP shall remain in effect pending the appeal of the new
IWDP.
The City shall respond with its position within 60 days of filing of an appeal.
The user must file its appeal with the Hearing Board, described in this section, to conduct a
hearing and decide an appeal on the matter.
Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final administrative decision must do so by
filing a complaint with the local Court of Common Pleas, within 30 days of the decision of the
Hearing Board.
Conference Option. At the time an appeal is requested, the user may also request a conference
with the City prior to the scheduling of a Hearing Board hearing. Said conference will include
appropriate members of the City staff and its agents. Violations and penalties will be explained
and discussed. Electing this option does not foreclose and/or affect the user's right to a hearing,
provided that the written request for the hearing was filed within 30 days of service as noted
above. The purpose of this option is to provide the user with an informal forum within which to
discuss the alleged violations and expedite conclusion and/or resolution of outstanding
enforcement actions. If resolution is not reached within 90 days of the scheduled conference, the
City shall schedule the matter for Hearing Board hearing. In any event either party may request a
Hearing Board hearing at any point during the conference proceedings.

septage.
Approval to Discharge. The City may issue a letter approval for limited frequency discharges or
may require that a permit be obtained for the proposed discharge. Permits will be obtained in
accordance with Section 923.04 of the City's Ordinance and/or the City's Septage Management
Plan.
Enforcement. Users will adhere to and obey all terms and conditions stated in their individual
approval letters or permits and the requirements of this Part. Any violation of the terms and
conditions of individual approval letters or permits or the requirements of this Part shall subject the
user to the sanctions set out in this Part. Obtaining an approval to discharge holding tank waste or
septage from the City does not relieve a user of his or her obligation to comply with any other
requirements of federal, state and local law.
Fees. A fee based on the City's current fee schedule will be levied on all holding tank waste or
septage discharged to the City's POTW. Holding tank waste and septage may also be subject to
surcharge fees as described in Section 923.03 of the City's Ordinance.

The Borough may lay out, ordain and construct sanitary sewers in streets and on public or private
property, and may construct sewage treatment works on lands owned or acquired for such purposes,
and pay the costs and expenses thereof out of Borough funds, or may assess the costs and expenses
of sanitary sewers as herein provided. Sanitary sewers laid and constructed in streets may be located
in the center of the street or on either side of the cartway or of the curblines thereof in any street and
may be for the service and use of properties on both sides of the street or on only one side of the
street in which they are laid, as directed by the Borough Council, and the costs and expenses of such
sanitary sewers may be assessed against properties benefited, accommodated or improved thereby
regardless of the property line location, and regardless of whether any portion of a property so
benefited, accommodated or improved shall physically abut upon such sanitary sewer. The term
"sanitary sewer," as used in this Part, shall mean and include a sewer used for receiving and collecting
sewage matter and liquid waste from the inside of the buildings and structures.
§ 602. Assessment According to Benefits.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 602]
Where the Borough constructs sanitary sewers and desires to assess the costs and expenses upon
property benefited, whether or not such property abuts upon such sewer, then on petition, viewers shall
be appointed in accordance with eminent domain code, who shall assess the damages, costs and
expenses of the sanitary sewer upon the property benefited, accommodated or improved according to
benefits, if sufficient can be found, but if not, then the deficiency when finally ascertained shall be paid
by the Borough.
§ 603. Assessment by Foot-Front Rule.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 603]
The expenses shall be assessed against the property benefited, improved or accommodated by any
sanitary sewer, whether or not such property abuts upon such sewer, by the foot-front rule and may
provide for equitable assessments and/or adjustments when special conditions exist where an
assessment for the full frontage would be unjust. The Secretary of the Borough shall cause 30 days'
notice of the assessment to be given to each party assessed, either by service on the owner or his
agent, or left on the assessed premises.
§ 604. Places and Manner of Construction.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 604]
The Borough shall fix the places along where such sanitary sewer and branches thereof shall be laid
down and shall prescribe the manner in which they shall be constructed.
§ 605. Permit from Department of Environmental Protection.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 605]

A.
B.
Whenever any borough shall construct any sanitary sewer and assess the cost thereof by the foot-front
rule, the assessment, duly certified under the seal of the Borough, attested by the President of Council
and Secretary, shall be collectible from the owner of the property benefited, improved or
accommodated thereby.
Such certificate of assessment shall be prima facie evidence, in any suit for the recovery of the
same, of the correctness and validity of such assessment.
The assessment herein referred to shall be computed under the terms of the Part, but the
individual assessments need not be expressed therein.
§ 607. Collections of Assessments.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 607]
If the owners of property against which a foot-front assessment has been made shall refuse to pay
such assessment within 30 days after notice of the same, it shall be the duty of the Borough Solicitor to
collect the same, with interest from the date of completion of the improvement, by action of assumpsit,
or by lien to be filed and collected in the same manner as municipal claims. When an owner has two or
more lots against which there is an assessment for the same improvement, all of such lots may be
embraced in one claim.
§ 608. Regulations of Borough.
[Ord. 671, 6/3/2002, § 608]
The Borough may enforce by penalties such regulations as it may ordain with reference to the use and
maintenance of such sanitary sewerage system and treatment works.

after the date due shall be classified as delinquent. The Borough shall notify the property
owner of the delinquency in writing, via first class, postage prepaid United States mail, at the
last known address of the property owner.
In the event that a property owner makes payments on a delinquent account, those

collection and disposal until such delinquent charges are paid in full, at which time any
excess monies collected will be applied against current fees, costs, interest, penalties
and principal account balance.
[Amended by Ord. 826, 7/5/2016]
The Executive Administrator is authorized, in appropriate cases, to enter into agreements
permitting the property owner to make payments on his or her delinquent rentals.
The Executive Administrator shall permit property owners to enter into the agreements
mentioned in Subsection B(2) above when (i) the gross household income for a property
owner is less than or equal to the annual Poverty Guidelines as set forth by the United
States Department of Health and Human Services, and (ii) the property owner does not
owe more than $1,500 in delinquent rentals. This subsection may be amended from time
to time by resolution of Borough Council as to the eligibility to enter into agreements.
The monthly payment plans shall be completed as follows:
If the total amount of delinquent solid waste collection and disposal charges is less
than $500, the property owner may enter into a repayment plan not to exceed 90
days, with a minimum monthly payment equal to the total amount outstanding
divided by three.
If the total amount of delinquent solid waste collection and disposal charges is equal
to or greater than $500 but less than $1,000, the property owner may enter into a
repayment plan not to exceed 120 days, with a minimum monthly payment equal to
the total amount outstanding divided by four.
If the total amount of delinquent solid waste collection and disposal charges is equal
to or greater than $1,000 but less than $1,500, the property owner may enter into a
repayment plan not to exceed 180 days, with a minimum monthly payment equal to
the total amount outstanding divided by six.
If the total amount of delinquent solid waste collection and disposal charges is equal
to or exceeds $1,500, the property owner's account will be referred to the Borough
Solicitor for collection.
If a property owner should fail to pay any current quarterly solid waste collection and
disposal charge while enrolled in a monthly repayment plan as set forth in § 210,
Subsection 2B(4), any and all delinquent charges owed pursuant to the repayment plan
will become immediately due and payable.
Failure to pay any installment of delinquent solid waste collection and disposal charges
when due pursuant to any repayment plan entered into between the Borough and the
property owner will result in an enforcement action, additional interest, late fees, costs of
collection and attorney's fees.
Enforcement Actions.

is less than $12,000 per annum.
Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the United States was engaged

Reserve, the Pennsylvania Army National Guard or the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.
A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax may annually file an
exemption certificate on a form developed by the Department of Community and Economic
Development with Borough, with copy to the Tax Collector, and with the person's employer
affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all
sources within Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate is filed. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of the
employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the Borough for the year prior to
the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the local services tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the Borough or Tax
Collector, except as required by Subsection 3 below, the employer shall not withhold the tax from
the person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption
certificate applies. Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily
available to employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the time of
hiring.
With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the local
services tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the Borough that the person has
received earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough equal to or in excess
of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for
that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within the
Borough in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under Subsection 4 below.

the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from the person, for
the that payroll period after receipt of the notification under Subsection 3, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of

§ 303.3. Employer Collection Through Payroll.
[Ord. 732, 12/19/2007]
If a local services tax is levied at a combined rate exceeding $10 in a calendar year, a person
subject to the local services tax shall be assessed a pro-rata share of the tax for each payroll
period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro-rata share of the tax assessed
on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate of the local
services tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the
employer for the calendar year. For purposes of determining the pro-rata share, an employer shall
round down the amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest one-hundredth
dollar. Collection of the local services tax levied under this subsection shall be made on a payrollperiod
basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation, except as
provided below in Subsection 3. No person shall be subject to the payment of the tax by more
than one political subdivision during each payroll period, as established by Subsection 2. The
Borough and/or Tax Collector shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment of the tax upon
request by the taxpayer.
With respect to a person subject to the local services tax at a combined rate exceeding $10, the
situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject to
the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation,
that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more than
one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax
shall be in the following order: first, the political subdivision in which a person maintains the
person's principal office or is principally employed; second, the political subdivision in which the
person resides and works, if the tax is levied by the political subdivision; and third, the political
subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposed the tax nearest in miles to the
person's home.
In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the local
services tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that
includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the local
services tax withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify the other employers of a change in
principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence.

such other information as the Tax Collector may require.
As to each taxpayer who is employed for any length of time after the effective date of this Part 3

during which this tax is in effect shall, within 15 days after discontinuing business or ceasing
operations, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax to the Tax Collector.
The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty to file a
return and pay the tax. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as required by this section, or
who fails to pay such tax to the Tax Collector, shall be liable for such tax in full, without deduction
of the commission hereinafter provided, as though the tax had originally been levied against such
employer.

time for the delinquent tax. The employer shall be entitled to deduct from the monies collected from
each employee the cost incurred from the extra bookkeeping necessary to record such transaction, but
not exceeding 2% of the amount of monies so collected and paid over to the Tax Collector. Upon the
failure of the employer to deduct the amount of taxes or to pay the same over to the Tax Collector, less
the cost of the bookkeeping involved in such transaction, the employer shall forfeit and pay the amount
of such tax for each taxpayer whose taxes are not withheld and paid over, or that are withheld and not
paid over, together the penalty of 10% added thereto, to be recovered by an action of assumpsit and a
suit to be instituted by the Tax Collector, or by the proper authorities of the taxing district, as debts of

Part 1. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
A.. General Provisions.
§ 101. Statement of Findings.
[Ord. 610, 1/5/1998, § 101; as amended by Ord. 729, 4/18/2007]
The Borough Council of the Borough of Fountain Hill (the "Borough") has concluded that
inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development
throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys aquatic habitats, elevates
aquatic pollutant concentrations and loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater,
undermines floodplain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of
development and activities causing accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is
fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the people of the
Borough and all of the people of the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater recharge for water supplies
and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater.
Federal and state regulations require the Borough to implement a program of stormwater controls.
The Borough is required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from its separate storm
sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
Nonstormwater discharges to Borough separate storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution
of waters of the commonwealth by the Borough.
§ 102. Purpose.
[Ord. 610, 1/5/1998, § 102; as amended by Ord. 729, 4/18/2007]
The purpose of this Part 1 is to promote the public health, safety, and welfare within the Borough by
minimizing the damages and maximizing the benefits described in § 101 of this Part by provisions

designed to:
Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating activities which cause such
problems.
Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage systems.
Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to maintain groundwater recharge, to
prevent degradation of surface water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the Borough and the
commonwealth.
Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management BMPs that are
implemented in the Borough.
Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning, design, and
management.
Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which require a minimum of structures and
rely on natural processes.
Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 93.4a, to protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to
support those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special-protection
streams.
Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.
§ 103. Statutory Authority.

from the drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part 1. All of the impervious cover added
incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall be subject to the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this Part. If a site has previously received an exemption and is proposing
additional development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds 10,000 square
feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed since the original ordinance date must meet
the provisions of this Part 1.

January 26, 1998, shall be the starting point from which to consider tracts as "parent tracts" in
which future subdivisions and respective impervious area computations shall be cumulatively
considered.
For development taking place in stages, the entire development plan must be used in
determining conformance with these criteria.
Additional impervious cover shall include but not be limited to additional indoor living spaces,
decks, patios, garages, driveways, storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or
driveway areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or for the proposed
regulated activity.
Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed stone, porous pavement, etc.,
shall be assumed to be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria.
Any existing gravel, crushed stone, or hard-packed soil areas on a site shall be considered as
pervious cover for the purpose of exemption evaluation.
Prior Drainage Plan Approval. Any regulated activity for which a drainage plan was previously
prepared as part of a subdivision or land development proposal that received preliminary plan
approval from the Borough prior to the effective date of this Part is exempt from the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this Part, except as cited in § 106, Subsection 3, provided that the
approved drainage plan included design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site
currently proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions in effect at the time
of approval and the approval has not lapsed under the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant
revisions are made to the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval and the effective
date of this Part, preparation of a new drainage plan, subject to the provisions of this Part, shall be
required. Significant revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques, relocation

or redesign of control measures, or changes necessary because soil or other conditions are not as
stated on the original drainage plan.
These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing such measures as are
necessary to protect health, safety, property, and state water quality requirements. These
measures include adequate and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the
site. These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to secure required
permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance.
No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in § 104, Subsection 2E, F and
G.

Water quality involves the chemical, biological, and physical characteristics of surface water
bodies. After regulated earth-disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment and changes in habitat through increased
flow volumes and/or rates as a result of changes in land surface area from those activities.
Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to protect the stream
bank, streambed, and structural integrity of the waterway to prevent these impacts.

All regulated activities in the Borough shall be subject to the stormwater management
requirements of this Part 1.
Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unobstructed flow in natural watercourses,
except as modified by stormwater detention facilities, recharge facilities, water quality facilities,
pipe systems, or open channels consistent with this Part 1.
The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto adjacent property shall not be
altered without written approval of the affected property owner(s).
Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property shall be managed such that,
at minimum, the peak diffused flow does not increase in the general direction of discharge, except
as otherwise provided in this Part 1. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that there are adequate
downstream conveyance facilities to safely transport the concentrated discharge to the point of
predevelopment flow concentration, to the stream reach or otherwise prove that no harm will result
from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to

Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a one-hundred-year
floodplain is defined by the Borough, there shall be provided drainage easements conforming
substantially with the line of such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unobstructed flow of storm runoff based on calculations made in conformance with
§ 124 for the one-hundred-year return period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5
foot above the design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation,
the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which may adversely affect the flow of
stormwater within any portion of the easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to
ensure proper runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the one-hundred-year
floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable Borough floodplain regulations.
When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainage swales on the site
cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming
substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.
Postconstruction BMPs shall be designed, installed, operated, and maintained to meet the
requirements of the Clean Streams Law and implementing regulations, including the established
practices in 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102 and the specifications of this Part 1 as to prevent
accelerated erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of discharge.
No earth-disturbance activities associated with any regulated activities shall commence until
approval by the Borough of a plan which demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this
Part 1.
Techniques described in Appendix F (Low-Impact Development)[1] of this Part are encouraged
because they reduce the costs of complying with the requirements of this Part and the state water
quality requirements.
Editor's Note: Appendix F is on file in the Borough offices.
Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and geology permit, consistent
with the provisions of this Part 1 and, where appropriate, the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration

Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts. To implement the provisions of the Catasauqua
Creek Watershed and Lehigh River Subbasin 4 Stormwater Management Plan, the Borough is
hereby divided into stormwater management districts consistent with the Catasauqua Creek
Release Rate Map presented in the plan. The boundaries of the stormwater management districts
are shown on an official map which is available for inspection at the Borough office. A copy of the
official map, at a reduced scale, is included in Appendix A[1] w for general reference.
Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Borough offices.
Description of Stormwater Management Districts. Three types of stormwater management districts
may be applicable to the Borough, namely Conditional No Detention I Districts, Conditional No
Detention II Districts, and Dual Release Rate Districts, as described below:
Conditional No Detention I Districts. Within these districts, the capacity of the "local seven"
runoff conveyance facilities (as defined in Part 1B) must be calculated to determine if
adequate capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must calculate peak flows
assuming that the site is developed as proposed and that the remainder of the local
watershed is in the existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows

development would use the runoff controls specified by this Part 1. The larger of the two peak
flows calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate capacity
exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main channel (as defined in Part 1B),
these watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack
adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide
increased capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with
§ 123, Subsection 13. Any capacity improvements must be designed to convey runoff from
development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria
specified in § 123, Subsection 3. By definition, a storm drainage problem area associated with
the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate capacity does not exist. Sites in
these districts are still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in § 127.
Conditional No Detention II Districts. Within these districts, the capacity of the local runoff
conveyance facilities must be calculated in the same manner as the Conditional No Detention
I Districts. In this case, however, adequate capacity must be demonstrated from the site to the
Lehigh River. After determining if adequate capacity exists, the developer shall use either no
detention, 100% release rate or provide capacity improvements as detailed in Subsection 2A,
Conditional No Detention I Districts.
Dual Release Rate Districts. Within this district, the two-year postdevelopment runoff must be
controlled to 30% of the redevelopment two-year runoff peek. Further, the ten-year, twentyfive-
year and one-hundred-year postdevelopment runoff must be controlled to 100% of the
predevelopment peak.
§ 123. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions.
[Ord. 610, 1/5/1998, § 303; as amended by Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, §§ III-V; and by Ord. 729, 4/18/2007]
Any stormwater management controls required by this Part 1 and subject to a dual release rate
criteria shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for each of the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology specified in § 124.
Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and postconstruction stormwater management
hydrograph analysis for each direction of discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate
compliance with the provisions of this Part 1.
The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a given
development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic
contours provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as originally drawn
coincide with topographic divides or, in certain instances, are drawn from the intersection of the
watercourse and a physical feature, such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g., road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical feature is the downstream
limit of the subarea, and the subarea boundary is drawn from that point upslope to each
topographic divide along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this Part 1 shall use the
following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates:
Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff
associated with a two-year return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with
protection of the channels from erosion. Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria
included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual (April, 1990).
Permissible velocities from the DEP Manual for selected channels are presented in Appendix
C of this Part.[1]

Editor's Note: Appendix C is on file in the Borough offices.
Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased twenty-fiveyear
return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property.
Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from
the tributary area must be designed in accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if
applicable) and, at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff.
For a proposed development site located within one release rate category subarea, the total runoff
from the site shall meet the applicable release rate criteria for development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge; individual drainage directions may be designed for up to a 100%
release rate so long as the total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
For a proposed development site located within two or more release category subareas, the peak
discharge rate from any subarea shall be the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea
multiplied by the applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of
whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea. An exception to the above may
be granted if discharges from multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case,
peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate, provided that the overall site
discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate category subarea and
partially within a conditional/provisional no detention subarea, the size of the predevelopment
drainage area on a site may not be changed postdevelopment to create potentially adverse
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a no-harm or hardship waiver procedure.
No portion of a site may be regraded between areas within the Catasauqua Creek Watershed
Study Area and any adjacent watershed except as part of a no-harm or hardship waiver
procedure.
Within a release rate category area for a proposed development site which has areas which drain
to a closed depression(s), the design release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable
release rate flow assuming no closed depression(s), or (b) the existing peak flow actually leaving
the site. In cases where (b) would result in an unreasonably small design release, the design
discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be determined by the available downstream
conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using Subsection 3 and the minimum orifice
criteria.
Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not subject to release rate
criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates. However, onsite drainage facilities shall be
designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.
Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from
the total site area, only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria.
Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other means, do not increase the
rate or volume of runoff discharged from the site are not subject to the release rate provisions of
the Part 1.
No-Harm Water Quantity Option.
For any proposed development site not located in a conditional/provisional no detention
district, the developer has the option of using a less-restrictive runoff control (including no
detention) if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the proposed
development site and that no harm would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate
than that specified by the plan. "Special circumstances" are defined as any hydrologic or
hydraulic aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the development of
the plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm would have to be shown from the
8/13/2020 Borough of Fountain Hill, PA Ecode360

development site through the remainder of the downstream drainage network to the
confluence of the creek with the Lehigh River. Proof of no harm must be shown using the
capacity criteria specified in § 123, Subsection 3, if downstream capacity analysis is a part of
the no-harm justification.
Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall
be governed by the following provisions:
The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the design return period
storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundred-year) shall be the values from the
calibrated PSRM Model for the Catasauqua Creek Watershed or as calculated by an
applicant using an alternate method acceptable to the Borough. The flow values from the
PSRM Model would be supplied to the developer by the Borough upon request.
Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a
developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site
acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity
(i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, he may use up to 10% of
the documented downstream available capacity).
Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate increased peak flow rates at
storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be precluded from successful
attempts to prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with § 123, Subsection 13. Any no-harm justifications
shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per Subpart
D. Developers submitting no-harm justifications must still meet all of the water quality
requirements in § 127.
Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study area, it may be more cost
effective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an
individual control facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any regional
runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers. The design of any
regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream
watershed. The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by case-basis
using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream
watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the calibrated version of the Penn State Runoff
Model as developed for the stormwater management plan.
Capacity Improvements. In certain instances, primarily within the conditional no detention areas,
local drainage conditions may dictate more-stringent levels of runoff control than those based
upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove that it
would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local
drainage network, then the capacity improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of
runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow calculations are to be done assuming that the
local watershed is in the existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is
developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls. Any capacity improvements
would be designed using the larger of the peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in
Subsection 3. All new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed
development site is located shall be assumed to implement the developer's proposed discharge
control, if any. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to implement any
regional detention alternatives or to implement a modified no-harm option which proposes specific
capacity improvements to provide that a less-stringent discharge control would not create any
harm downstream.
(Reserved)
Compatibility with NPDES Requirements. Any proposed regulated activity for which a permanent
stormwater quality control detention basin is required under the NPDES regulations shall use the

For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention ponds shall be designed to
meet the applicable release rate(s) applied to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond
discharge direction. All site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of whether
all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that time. An exception shall be sites with
multiple detention ponds in series where only the downstream pond must be designed to the
stated release rate.
§ 124. Calculation Methodology.
[Ord. 610, 1/5/1998, § 304; as amended by Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, §§ VI-VIII; and by Ord. 729, 4/18/2007]
Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using either the Rational Method
or the Soil Cover Complex Methodology.
Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater
Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D[1] shall be calculated as follows:
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as follows:
All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%.
All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%.
All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%.
All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%.
Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Borough offices.
Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed infiltration system.
The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater
Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D[2] is the measured soil thickness
multiplied by the thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25
Pa. Code § 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G),[3] as follows:

Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Borough offices.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 inches per hour or less than 0.5 inch per hour,
as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G, are not
recommended for infiltration.
The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of this Part 1 shall be
verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through the proposed basin using the storage
indication method or other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph for routing shall be either
the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the Modified Rational Method Trapezoidal Hydrograph
which maximizes detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational Hydrograph shall be consistent
with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the Users' Manual for the Penn State
Urban Hydrology Model (1987).
BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface runoff or pipe flow shall be
routed using the storage indication method.
BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface runoff or pipe flow shall
provide storage volume for the full WQv below the lowest outlet invert.
Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv shall assume that the
permanent pool volume below the primary outlet is full at the beginning of design event routing for
the purposes of evaluating peak outflows.
All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one-foot freeboard above the maximum
pool elevation associated with the two- through twenty-five-year runoff events. A five-tenths-foot
freeboard shall be provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year runoff
event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool elevation to the invert of the
emergency spillway. The two- through one-hundred-year storm events shall be controlled by the
primary outlet structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to pass the onehundred-
year return frequency storm peak basin inflow rate with a minimum five-tenths-foot
freeboard measured to the top of basin. The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any offsite
areas tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention facility is considered
to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of the facility must be consistent with the
Chapter 105 regulations and may be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year
event.
The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates from detention facilities shall
be three inches. Designs where a lesser size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates
shall be acceptable with a three-inch orifice, provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities. The minimum three-inch diameter does not apply to the control
of the WQv.
Runoff calculations using the Soil Cover Complex Method shall use the Natural Resources
Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall
depths for the various return periods to be used consistent with this Part 1 may be taken from
NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 2.1, 2004, or the PennDOT Intensity-Duration-Frequency Field

appropriate times of concentration and return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 2.1,
2004, or the Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix A.
Runoff Curve Numbers (CNs) to be used in the Soil Cover Complex Method shall be based upon
the matrix presented in Appendix B.[5]

Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon the table presented in
Appendix B.
All time-of-concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach which may include one or all
of the flow types below:
Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS Average Velocity Chart
(Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or the Modified Kinematic Wave Travel Time
Equation (Equation 3-3, NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the Modified Kinematic Wave
Travel Time Equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50 feet for designs using the
Rational Method and limited to 150 feet for designs using the Soil Cover Complex Method.
Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from the watercourse slope, type
of surface and the velocity from Figure 3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities calculated by the Manning
Equation. Bank-full flows shall be used for determining velocities. Manning "n" values shall be
based on the table presented in Appendix C.[6]
Editor's Note: Appendix C is on file in the Borough offices.
Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities calculated using the Manning
Equation assuming full flow and the Manning "n" values from Appendix C.
If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a given discharge direction shall
be based on a common time of concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage
areas. If using the Rational Method, all postdevelopment calculations for a given discharge
direction shall be based on a common time of concentration considering both on-site and any offsite
drainage areas.
The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of watercourses. Manning "n"

The Pennsylvania DEP Chapter 105 Rules and Regulations apply to the construction,
modification, operation or maintenance of both existing and proposed dams, water obstructions
and encroachments throughout the watershed. Criteria for design and construction of stormwater
management facilities according to this Part 1 may differ from the criteria that are used in the
permitting of dams under the Dam Safety Program.
§ 125. Permit Requirements by Other Government Entities.
[Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, § IX]
The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth-disturbance activities and
must be met prior to commencement of regulated and earth-disturbance activities, as applicable:
All regulated and earth-disturbance activities subject to permit requirements by DEP under
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or adjacent to surface waters of
the commonwealth, including wetlands, subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state highway right-of-way or
require access from a state highway shall be subject to approval by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation (PennDOT).
Culverts, bridges, storm sewers, or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from
the tributary area and any facility which may constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
§ 126. Erosion and Sediment Control During Regulated Earth-
Disturbance Activities.
[Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, § X]
No regulated earth-disturbance activities within the municipality shall commence until approval by
the municipality of an erosion and sediment control plan for construction activities. Written
approval by DEP or a delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this requirement.
An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for any earth-disturbance
activity of 5,000 square feet or more under Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
A DEP NPDES stormwater discharges associated with construction activities permit is required for
regulated earth-disturbance activities under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth-disturbance activities from the appropriate
DEP regional office or County Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before
the commencement of an earth-disturbance activity.

§ 127. Postconstruction Water Quality Criteria.
[Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, § XI; as amended by Ord. 729, 4/18/2007]
No regulated earth-disturbance activities within the Borough shall commence until approval by the
Borough of a drainage plan which demonstrates compliance with this Part 1. This Part provides
standards to meet NPDES permit requirements associated with construction activities and MS4
permit requirements.
The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The WQv shall be calculated two
ways.
First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
Where:
WQv = water quality volume in acre-feet.
c = Rational Method postdevelopment runoff coefficient for the twoyear
storm.
P = 1.25 inches.
A = area in acres of proposed regulated activity.
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume from predevelopment
to postdevelopment for the two-year return period storm. The effect of closed depressions on
the site shall be considered in this calculation. The larger of these two calculated volumes
shall be used as the WQv to be captured and treated, except that in no case shall the WQv
be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of runoff over the site area. This standard does not limit
the volume of infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes of water quantity/peak rate
control.
The WQv shall be calculated for each postdevelopment drainage direction on a site for sizing
BMPs. Site areas having no impervious cover and no proposed disturbance during development
may be excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet pond, constructed wetland
or other BMP that ponds water on the land surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge
from that BMP must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip, bioretention, vegetated
swale or other BMP that provides a thermal benefit to protect the high-quality waters of the
commonwealth from thermal impacts.
The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be treated with infiltration or
two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in § 127, Subsection 15, except for minor areas on the
periphery of the site that cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant demonstrates that the fill is
stable and otherwise meets the infiltration BMP standards of this Part 1.
The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site from published sources. Any
apparent boundaries between carbonate and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through
more-detailed site evaluations by a qualified geotechnical professional.

For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an applicant intends to use infiltration
BMPs, the applicant shall conduct a preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from
published sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of two
percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.[1] This investigation will determine depth to bedrock,
depth to the seasonal high-water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic features,
if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified sewage enforcement officer (SEO),
except that the location(s) of special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional.
Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Borough offices.
Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the following criteria:
Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal to two feet.
Depth to seasonal high-water table below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal to three
feet; except for infiltration of residential roof runoff, where the seasonal high-water table must
be below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between two and three feet and the
evidence of the seasonal high-water table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate
the depth to seasonal high-water table is required).
Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code § 73.15 percolation test in
Appendix G) greater than or equal to 0.5 inch per hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per
hour.
Setback distances or buffers as follows:
One hundred feet from water supply wells.
Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building foundations; except for
residential development, where the required set back is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet
upgradient from building foundations.
Fifty feet from septic system drainfields; except for residential development, where the
required setback is 25 feet from septic system drainfields.
Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock unless a preliminary site
investigation is done in the carbonate bedrock to show the absence of special geologic
features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
One hundred feet from the property line, unless documentation is provided to show that
all setbacks from existing or potential future wells, foundations and drainfields on
neighboring properties will be met; except for one- and two-family residential dwellings,
where the required setback is 40 feet unless documentation is provided to show that all
setbacks from existing or potential future wells, foundations and drainfields on
neighboring properties will be met.
For entirely noncarbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be infiltrated unless the applicant
demonstrates that it is infeasible to infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high-water table,
permeability rate, soil depth or setback distances, or except as provided in § 127, Subsection 21.
The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25) * (I) / 12
Where:
REv = Recharge volume in acre-feet.
I = impervious area in acres.

The preliminary site investigation described in § 127, Subsection 8, is required and shall
continue on different areas of the site until a potentially suitable infiltration location is found or
the entire site is determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas that appear to
be feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the additional site investigation and
testing as outlined in Appendix G shall be completed.
If an applicant proposes infiltration, the Borough may determine infiltration to be infeasible if
there are known existing conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
The site must meet the conditions listed in § 127, Subsection 9.
If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall infiltrate that portion of the REv
that is feasible based on the site characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv
shall be considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as described in
§ 127, Subsection 15.
If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to be captured and treated.
In entirely carbonate areas where the applicant intends to use infiltration BMPs, the preliminary
site investigation described in § 127, Subsection 8, shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that
appear feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall conduct the
additional site investigation and testing as outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate
and proposed loading rate, each weighted as described in § 124, along with the buffer from
special geologic features, shall be compared to the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D[2] to determine if the site is
recommended for infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the conditions
listed in § 127, Subsection 9, are required for infiltration in carbonate areas. Applicants are
encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in § 127, Subsection 10, but are not required to use
infiltration BMPs on a carbonate site even if the site falls in the "recommended" range on the chart
in Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be subtracted from the WQv to be treated by
noninfiltration BMPs. If infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two acceptable
BMPs, as specified in § 127, Subsection 15.
Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Borough offices.
If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall investigate the ability of
the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully meet this Part 1 to meet the requirements for REv for
the whole site through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the carbonate area as
described in § 127, Subsection 11, or two other noninfiltration BMPs as described in § 127,
Subsection 15, must be used. No infiltration structure in the noncarbonate area shall be located
within 50 feet of a boundary with carbonate, bedrock, except when a preliminary site investigation
has been done showing the absence of special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed
infiltration area.
If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment two-year runoff volume
leaving the site shall be 80% or more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate
portion of the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the predevelopment infiltration
volume.
Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance and compaction except as
necessary for construction of infiltration BMPs.
If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the WQv shall be treated by two
acceptable BMPs in series for each discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area
can be considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and concentrated flow shall
flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an impervious area is to be drained across a pervious
area as one BMP, the length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length of

A modification to a submitted drainage plan for a proposed development site which involves a change
in control methods or techniques, or which involves the relocation or redesign of control measures, or
which is necessary because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the drainage plan (as
determined by the Borough Engineer) shall require a resubmission of the modified drainage plan
consistent with § 134, subject to review per § 135 of this Part 1.
§ 137. Hardship Waiver Procedure.
[Ord. 610, 1/5/1998, § 407; as amended by Ord. 709, 3/7/2005, §§ XIV, XV; and by Ord. 729,
4/18/2007]
The Borough Council may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged that the provisions of this (Act
167) Part 1 inflicts unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing and
accompanied by the requisite fee, based upon a fee schedule adopted by the Borough. A copy of the
waiver request shall be provided to each of the following: the Borough, Borough Engineer, Borough
Solicitor and Joint Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the nature of the alleged
hardship.
The Borough may grant a waiver provided that all of the following findings are made in a given
case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular
property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of this Part 1 in the
stormwater management district in which the property is located.
That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of this Part 1, including the
no-harm provision, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
That the waiver, if authorized, will represent the minimum waiver that will afford relief and will
represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.
That financial hardship is not the criteria for granting of a hardship waiver.
In granting any waiver, the Borough may attach such conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this Part 1. If a hardship waiver is granted, the applicant
must still manage the quantity, velocity, direction, and quality of resulting storm runoff as is
necessary to prevent injury to health, safety, and other property.
For all regulated activities described in § 104, Subsection 2, the Borough Council shall hear
requests for and decide upon hardship waiver requests.
The Borough shall not waive the water quality provisions of this Part 1.

In addition, the Borough, through its Solicitor, may institute injunctive, mandamus or any other

the Zoning Officer that the activity or occupancy can occur safely without
endangering public health or safety.
The temporary certificate shall establish in writing a maximum time period under
which it is valid. A six-month maximum time period shall apply if not otherwise
specified.
Failure to receive a permanent certificate of use and occupancy within such time
period shall be a violation of this Chapter.

Compliance with Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.[1] If an application
under this Chapter would also be regulated by the Borough Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance ("SALDO"), then any permit or approval under this Chapter shall automatically be
conditioned upon compliance with the SALDO. See the definitions of "land development" and
"subdivision" in the SALDO.
For example, if an applicant applies for a single-family detached dwelling on a proposed new
lot, the construction permit for such dwelling shall not be valid until after the lot is granted final
subdivision approval and the lot is officially recorded by the County Recorder of Deeds.
The SALDO requires Borough Planning Commission review and approval.
Editor's Note: See Ch. 22, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 104. General Procedure for Permits.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
After receiving a proper application, the Zoning Officer shall either:
Issue the applicable permit(s); or
Deny the application(s) as submitted, indicating one or more reasons.
After the permit under this Chapter has been issued, the applicant may undertake the action
specified by the permit, in compliance with other Borough ordinances. However, it is
recommended that applicants wait 30 days to begin construction if there is a possibility of an
appeal by another party to have the permit revoked. Any commencement of construction or a use
within this thirty-day appeal period shall be at the risk of the applicant.
§ 105. Interpretation; Uses Not Regulated.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Minimum Requirements. Where more than one provision of this Chapter controls a particular
matter, the provision that is more restrictive upon uses and structures shall apply. The provisions
of this Chapter are in addition to any other applicable Borough ordinance.
Uses Not Specifically Regulated. If a use clearly is not permitted by right or as a special exception
use by this Chapter within any zoning district, the use is prohibited; except that the Zoning Hearing
Board may permit such use as a special exception use if the applicant specifically proves to the
clear satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that all of the following conditions would be met:
The proposed use would be less intensive in external impacts and nuisances than uses that
are permitted in the district;
The proposed use would be closely similar in impacts and character to uses permitted in that
district, considering the standards in § 805F;

Interpretation of Chapter Text and Boundaries.
The Zoning Officer shall literally apply the wording of this Chapter and the location of all
district boundaries to particular applications. In any case, the Zoning Officer may also request
an advisory opinion from the Borough Solicitor or the Zoning Hearing Board Solicitor to aid in
the Zoning Officer's determination.
If an applicant disagrees with the Zoning Officer's determination and believes that this
Chapter should be interpreted in the applicant's favor, the applicant may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board. See § 111.

sending an official enforcement notice, the Zoning Officer may, at his/her option, informally
request compliance.
Enforcement Notice. The enforcement notice shall be sent to the owner of record of the parcel
on which the violation has occurred, to any person who has filed a written request to receive
enforcement notices regarding that parcel, and to any other person requested in writing by the
owner of record. An enforcement notice shall state the following, at a minimum:

The name of the owner of record and any other person against whom the municipality
intends to take action.
The location of the property in violation.
The specific violation, with a description of the requirements which have not been met,
citing in each instance the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
The date before which the steps for compliance must be commenced and the date before
which the steps must be completed.
That the recipient of the notice has the right to appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board within
a prescribed period of time in accordance with procedures set forth in this Chapter.
That failure to comply with the notice within the time specified, unless extended by
appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board, constitutes a violation, with possible sanctions
clearly described.
Evidence; Fees. In any appeal of an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board, the
Borough shall have the responsibility of presenting its evidence first. Any filing fees paid by a
party to appeal an enforcement notice to the Zoning Hearing Board shall be returned to the
appealing party by the Borough if the Zoning Hearing Board, or any court in a subsequent
appeal, rules in the appealing party's favor.
Causes of Action. If the enforcement notice is not complied with within the specified time
period, the Zoning Officer shall notify Borough Council. With the consent of Borough Council,
the Zoning Officer, Borough Solicitor or other officers of the Borough may institute any
appropriate action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct or abate such building, structure,
landscaping or land, or to prevent, in or about such premises, any act, conduct, business or
use constituting a violation. (NOTE: Section 617 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code also addresses actions by other parties.)
Violations and Penalties. Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated or
permitted the violation of the provisions of this Chapter shall, upon being found liable therefor
in a civil enforcement proceeding commenced by the Borough, pay a judgment of not more
than $500 plus all court costs, including the reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the
Borough as a result thereof. No judgment shall commence or be imposed, levied or be
payable until the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the Borough may enforce the
judgment pursuant to the applicable rules of civil procedure. Each day that a violation
continues shall constitute a separate violation, unless a District Justice, determining that there
has been a violation, further determines that there was a good-faith basis for the person,
partnership or corporation violating this Chapter to have believed that there was no such
violation; in which event there shall be deemed to have been only one such violation until the
fifth day following the date of the determination of a violation by the District Justice; and
thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. All
judgments, costs and reasonable attorney's fees collected for the violation of this Chapter
shall be paid over to the Borough. Imprisonment shall not be authorized by this Chapter.
§ 107. Fees.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]

resolution of the Borough Council. No application or appeal shall be considered filed until all fees are
paid.

Sections 906(a), (b) and (c) of such act.]
Zoning Hearing Board Jurisdiction and Functions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall be responsible
for the following:
Appeal of a Decision by the Zoning Officer.
The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by an affected person, entity
or the Borough Council that the Zoning Officer has improperly acted under the
requirements and procedures of this Chapter.
See time limitations for appeals in § 111E.
Challenge to the Validity of the Ordinance or Map. The applicable provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (NOTE: As of the
adoption date of this Chapter, these provisions were primarily in Sections 909.1 and 916 of
such act.)
Variances.
The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with the Zoning Officer in writing.
Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the limitations of state law.
NOTE: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code provided that all of the following findings must be made, where relevant:
There are unique physical circumstances or conditions (including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or
other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property) and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, and a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property;
Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant;
The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare; and
The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief
and will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue.)
In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter.
Special Exceptions.

The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special exceptions filed with the Zoning
Officer in writing. The Board shall only permit a special exception that is authorized by
this Chapter. See § 116.
Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as
it may deem necessary to implement the purposes and intent of this Chapter.
Persons With Disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a complete written application, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special exception allowing modifications to specific
requirements of this Chapter if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing
Board that such modifications are necessary to provide a "reasonable accommodation" under
applicable federal law to serve persons who the applicant proves have disabilities as defined
in and protected by such laws.
Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in accordance with the United
States Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. § 3601 et seq., or the
Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and the federal regulations
adopted pursuant to such statutes, as amended, and/or the accompanying regulations of
the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission.
If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation under such laws and
regulations for persons with disabilities, the applicant shall identify the disability which is
protected by such statutes, the extent of the modification of the provisions of this Chapter
necessary for a reasonable accommodation, and the manner by which the reasonable
accommodation requested may be removed when such person with a protected disability
no longer will be present on the property.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall also hear any other matters as set forth in the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended. (NOTE: As of the adoption date of this Chapter,
such provisions were primarily within Section 909.1 of such law.)
Time Limits for Appeals. The applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code, as amended, shall apply. (NOTE: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, these provisions
were in Section 914.1 of such act.)
No person shall be allowed to file any proceedings with the Board later than 30 days after any
application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate
Borough officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit
the approval in any manner, unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice,
knowledge or reason to believe such approval had been given. If such person has succeeded
to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest.
Stay of Proceedings. The stay-of-proceedings provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended, shall apply. (NOTE: As of the adoption date of this Chapter, such
provisions were in Section 915.1 of such act.)
Upon filing of any proceeding referred to in § 111E and during its pendency before the Board,
all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning
Officer or of any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed; unless the
Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body indicates that a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property, in which case the development or official action shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by the
court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or
other appropriate agency or body.
Time Limits on Permits and Approvals.

Unless otherwise provided by the Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council in a decision
granting approval, after a variance is approved or other zoning approval is officially
authorized, then any applicable zoning and building permits shall be secured by the applicant
within 12 months after the date of such approval or authorization. The work authorized by
such permits shall then be completed within 12 months after the issuance of the permits.
Extension. Unless otherwise provided by the Zoning Hearing Board or Borough Council in a
decision granting approval, in response to an applicant stating good cause in writing, the
Zoning Officer may extend in writing the time limit for completion of work to a maximum total
of 36 months after permits are issued.
If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits or begin construction within the above
time periods, or allows interruptions in substantial construction of longer than 12 months, the
Zoning Officer may conclusively presume that the applicant has waived, withdrawn or
abandoned approvals and permits under this Chapter and may consider all such approvals
and permits to have become null and void.
§ 112. Board Hearings and Decisions.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
The following requirements shall apply to procedures, hearings and decisions of the Zoning Hearing
Board.
Upon receiving an application for a special exception, variance, appeal from alleged error of the
Zoning Officer, challenge to the validity of this Chapter or other appeal, the Board shall conduct a
public hearing thereon within 60 days of the applicant's request, unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing or on the record, to an extension of time. Hearings shall be held pursuant to public notice
and further notice as follows:
The Board shall publish a public notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the Borough
for two successive weeks. The publications, the first of which shall be not more than 30 days
nor less than seven days from the date of the hearing, shall state the time and place of the
hearing and the particular nature of the matter to be considered. Notice of the hearing shall
also be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land at least one week prior to the
hearing.
The Board shall give notice, in writing, to the applicant, the Zoning Officer and property
owners within 150 feet of the subject premises at least one week prior to the hearing. The
applicant shall submit a list of property owners within the designated 150 feet. The Board
shall have the power to require that all of the above persons or groups enter appearances in
writing.
In any matter which relates to a property which lies within 100 feet of the boundary of another
incorporated political subdivision, the Borough Secretary shall forward a copy of the official
notice of the public hearing on such matters to the other incorporated political subdivision not
later than one week prior to the hearing. The other incorporated political subdivision shall
have the right to appear and to be heard at the public hearing.
The hearings shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such other times as the Board shall
specify in its rules of procedure. The Chairman, or in his absence the Acting Chairman, or the
hearing officer presiding, shall have power to administer oaths and to issue subpoenas to compel
the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant documents and papers, including
witnesses and documents requested by the parties. For the conduct of any hearing and the taking
of any action, a quorum shall be not less than a majority of all the members of the Board; but the
Board may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership to conduct any hearing on its
behalf. The decision or, where no decision is called for, the findings shall be made by the Board;
however, the appellant or the applicant, as the case may be, in addition to the Borough, may, prior

to the decision of the hearing, waive decision or findings by the Board and accept the decision or
findings of the hearing officer as final.
The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person affected by the application who has
made timely appearance of record before the Zoning Hearing Board, and any other person,
including civic or community organizations, permitted to appear by the Zoning Hearing Board. The
Zoning Hearing Board shall have power to require that all persons who wish to be considered
parties enter their appearances in writing on forms provided by the Zoning Hearing Board for that
purpose.
The parties shall have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be afforded the opportunity
to respond and present evidence and argument and cross-examine adverse witnesses on all
relevant issues.
Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence
may be excluded.
The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be shall keep a stenographic
record of the proceedings. The cost of the stenographic appearance fee shall be shared equally
by the applicant and the Zoning Hearing Board. The cost of the original transcript shall be paid by
the Board if ordered by the Board or the hearing officer, or shall be paid by the person appealing
from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board if such appeal is made; and in either event, the cost
of additional copies shall be paid by the person requesting such copy or copies. In other cases,
the party requesting the original transcript shall bear the cost thereof.
The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or indirectly, with
any party or his representatives in connection with any issue involved except upon notice and
opportunity for all parties to participate, and shall not take notice of any communications, reports,
staff memoranda or other materials, except advice from its/their Solicitor, unless the parties are
afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed, and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party or his representative unless all
parties are given an opportunity to be present.
The Zoning Hearing Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a written
decision or, when no decision is called for, make written findings on the application within 45 days
after the last hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board or hearing officer. Where the application is
contested or denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions
based thereon, together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any provisions of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, this Chapter, or of any other ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion
is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing
officer, and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall make his report and recommendations available to the parties within 45 days, and the
parties shall be entitled to make written representations thereon to the Zoning Hearing Board prior
to final decision or entry of findings, and the Zoning Hearing Board's decision shall be entered no
later than 30 days after the report of the hearing officer. Where the Board fails to render the
decision within the period required by this subsection or fails to hold the required hearing within 60
days from the date of the applicant's request for a hearing, the decision shall be deemed to have
been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the applicant has agreed, in writing or on the
record, to an extension of time. When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of a failure of the Hearing Board to meet or render a decision as hereinabove provided,
the Zoning Hearing Board shall give public notice of said decision within 10 days from the last day
it could have met to render a decision in the same manner as provided in § 112A. If the Zoning
Hearing Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do so. Nothing in this subsection
shall prejudice the right of any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

Compliance with this Chapter. The applicant shall establish, by credible evidence, compliance
with all requirements upon the use that are established by this Chapter. The applicant shall
provide the Zoning Hearing Board with sufficient plans, studies or other data to demonstrate
compliance with all applicable regulations.
Compliance with Other Requirements. The application will not clearly be in conflict with other
Borough ordinances or state or federal laws or regulations known to the Zoning Hearing

another ordinance, law or regulation.
Transportation. The traffic generated by the subject of the application shall be accommodated
in a safe and efficient manner, after considering any improvements that the applicant commits
to complete or fund. The applicant shall show that the use will not result in or substantially
add to a significant traffic hazard, significant traffic congestion or a significant pedestrian
safety hazard.
Neighborhood. The proposed use shall not significantly negatively impact upon the desirable
character of an adjacent established residential neighborhood, such as causing substantial
amounts of heavy truck traffic to travel through a residential neighborhood, or a significant
odor or noise nuisance or very late night/early morning hours of operation, without proper
safeguards.
Site Planning. The applicant shall establish by credible evidence that the proposed use will be
properly designed with regard to internal circulation, driveway access, site layout, parking
layout, buffering, and all other elements of proper site design.

create a significant hazard to the public health and safety, such as fire, toxic or explosive
hazards.
Historic Impact. The application shall not have a negative impact upon historically significant
buildings on the same lot, as viewed from a street.
Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Board may require such reasonable conditions
and safeguards (in addition to those expressed in this Chapter) as it determines are necessary to
implement the purposes of this Chapter. Conditions imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board shall
automatically become conditions of the building permit issued pursuant thereto, and any failure to
comply with said conditions shall be a violation of this Chapter.

Purposes of Each District. In addition to the overall purposes and objectives of this Chapter and
the Comprehensive Plan, the purposes of each zoning district are summarized below:
LD-R Low-Density Residential District: to provide the least-dense residential living
environment where careful site planning will preserve natural features; to provide areas for
single-family detached dwellings on larger lots; to protect these areas from incompatible uses;
and to encourage owner-occupancy and neighborhood stability.
MD-R Medium-Density Residential District: to provide for medium-density residential areas for
single-family detached and twin dwelling units; to protect these areas from incompatible uses;
and to encourage owner-occupancy and neighborhood stability.
MHD-R Medium-High-Density Residential District: to provide for a variety of housing types
from single-family homes to apartments at medium-high densities; and to protect these areas
from incompatible uses.
HD-R High-Density Residential District: to provide opportunities for high-density residential
uses, including mid-rise and high-rise apartments.
RO Residential/Office District: to provide for a variety of residential uses at medium-high
densities, and to provide for professional, medical and similar offices, south of St. Luke's
Hospital; and to allow compatible types and patterns of land use.
RC Residential/Commercial District: to provide for a variety of residential uses at mediumhigh
densities, and compatible commercial uses.
TC Town Center District: to provide for mixed uses, including residential and public uses, and
select commercial uses and businesses; to promote pedestrian-friendly commercial activities;
and to avoid heavy auto-related commercial uses that are most likely to conflict with nearby
homes and the pedestrian orientation.
GC General Commercial District: to provide for a wider range of commercial uses, including
heavier commercial uses than are allowed in the Town Center and Residential/Commercial
Districts.
I Industrial District: to provide for industrial uses and select commercial uses/businesses; and
to carefully control the types of industrial operations to avoid nuisances (such as excessive
noise) and hazards.

§ 303. Zoning Map.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
A map entitled "Fountain Hill Borough Zoning Map" accompanies this Chapter and is declared a
part of this Chapter.[1] The Official Zoning Map, which should bear the adoption date of this
Chapter and the words "Official Zoning Map," shall be retained in the Borough Building.
Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is included at the end of this Chapter.
Map Changes. Changes to the boundaries and districts of the Official Zoning Map shall only be
made in conformity with the amendment procedures specified in the Municipalities Planning Code.
All changes should be noted by date, with a brief description of the nature of the change, either on
the map or within an appendix to this Chapter.
Replacement Map. If the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to
interpret because of changes and additions, or needs to have drafting errors or omissions
corrected, the Borough Council may, by resolution, adopt a new copy of the Official Zoning Map,
which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been

§ 304. District Boundaries.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]

the Zoning Map:
District boundary lines are intended to follow or be parallel to the center line of street rights-of-way,
creeks, railroads and lot lines (according to official county records) as they existed at the time of
the adoption of this Chapter, unless such district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions as shown
on the Official Zoning Map.
Where a district boundary is not fixed by dimensions and where it approximately follows lot lines,
such boundary shall be construed to follow such lot lines, unless specifically shown otherwise.
The location of a district boundary that divides a lot shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on the Zoning Map, unless indicated otherwise by dimensions.
Where a municipal boundary divides a lot, the minimum lot area shall be regulated by the
municipality in which the principal use(s) is(are) located, unless otherwise provided by applicable
case law. The land area within each municipality shall be regulated by the use regulations and
other applicable regulations of each municipality.

principal use that is not specifically listed as "P" or "SE" in the applicable district in this table is
prohibited in that district.
For temporary uses, see § 103.

front yard setbacks. However, if a deck or porch is covered by a roof or is raised an average
of more than five feet above the ground level, then the deck or porch shall meet the minimum
side yard and shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from a rear lot line. A setback is not
required where two buildings are attached to each other along a lot line. Space under an
unenclosed porch may be used for household storage.

Applicability.
This § 308 shall apply to any principal building and structure within the H Historic Overlay
Districts A, B and C, as shown on the Zoning Map, as revised. This § 308 shall not apply to a
building or a building addition within the H Historic Overlay Districts built after 1936, as
determined by the Zoning Officer. The applicant may provide documentation to the Zoning
Officer that a building was built after 1936. All other structures and buildings in the H Historic
Overlay Districts built before 1936 shall comply with the provisions of this § 308.
For a building regulated by this § 308, all of the provisions of the applicable underlying zoning
districts shall also continue to apply, in addition to the provisions of § 308. In the event there is
a direct conflict between the provisions of this § 308 and the underlying zoning districts, the
provision that is most restrictive upon development, demolition, and uses shall apply.
General Provisions.
Any demolition of a building regulated by this § 308 shall only occur in compliance with this
§ 308.
The H Historic Overlay Districts A, B and C may be revised by the Borough Council as a
Zoning Ordinance amendment.
Definitions. In addition to the definitions provided in other sections of this Chapter, the
following terms shall have the following meanings for the purposes of this § 308:
DEMOLITION
The complete dismantling, tearing down, removal or razing of the exterior of a building.
This term shall not include renovations, repairs or improvements to the building, unless
such changes alter the structural integrity of the building.
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
Work that does not alter the appearance or harm the stability of exterior features of a
building.
STREETSCAPE
The overall appearance of a block along a public street, including yards visible from a
public street, the relationship of building setbacks and the consistency of architectural
styles or features.
Demolition of Buildings Regulated by § 308.
The Zoning Hearing Board shall approve by special exception use all demolitions of buildings
regulated by this § 308. A building regulated by this § 308 shall not be demolished unless the
applicant is able to show by credible evidence to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board
that one or more of the following conditions exist:
The existing building cannot feasibly and reasonably be reused, and that such situation is
not the result of intentional neglect or demolition by neglect by the owner;
The denial of the demolition would result in unreasonable economic hardship to the
owner, and the hardship was not self-created;

The demolition is necessary to allow a project to occur that will have substantial, special
and unusual public benefit that would greatly outweigh the loss of the building regulated
by this § 308, and the project needs to occur at this location. For example, a demolition
may be needed for a necessary expansion of an existing municipal building or to allow a
street improvement that is necessary to alleviate a public safety hazard; or
The existing building has no historical or architectural significance and the demolition will
not adversely impact upon the streetscape. To meet this condition, the applicant may
present information concerning the proposed design of any replacement building or use
to show that the proposed building or use will result in a net improvement to the
streetscape.
For approval of a demolition, the standards of this § 308 shall apply in place of the special
exception use standards of Part 6. In reviewing the application, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall consider the following:
The effect of the demolition on the historical significance, streetscape and architectural
integrity of neighboring historic buildings and on the historic character of the surrounding
neighborhood.
The feasibility of other alternatives to demolition.
An application for demolition of a building regulated by this § 308 shall not be approved
unless all of the requirements of this § 308 have been met.
A complete application for the demolition shall be submitted by the applicant, in writing, to the
Zoning Officer. The application shall include the following:
The name, address and daytime telephone number of the owner of record and the
applicant for the demolition.
Recent exterior photographs of the building proposed for demolition. If the applicant is
alleging that the building cannot be reused or rehabilitated, then interior photos and floor
plans shall be provided as needed to support the applicant's claim.
A site plan, drawn to scale, showing existing buildings and the proposed demolition.
A written statement of the reasons for the demolition.
The proposed use of the site and a proposed timeline for development of that proposed

All external lighting serving an academic clinical research center must be shielded in
such a manner to not allow light to be emitted skyward or onto adjoining properties.
A buffer planting is required where an academic clinical research center adjoins a
residential use or district.
Adult Use. (This is limited to the following: adult bookstore, adult movie theater, massage
parlor or adult live entertainment use.)
Purposes. The regulations on adult uses are intended to serve the following purposes, in
addition to the overall objectives of this Chapter:
To recognize the adverse secondary impacts of adult uses that affect health, safety
and general welfare concerns of the municipality. These secondary impacts have
been documented in research conducted across the nation. These secondary
impacts typically include but are not limited to: increases in criminal activity,
increases in activities that increase the risk of transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases, increases in activities that increase the risk of transmission of other
communicable diseases, increases in blight, decreases in the stability of residential
neighborhoods, decreases in property values for surrounding homes, and decreases
in the marketability of nearby commercial business space. The research conducted
across the nation concludes that adult uses typically involve insufficient selfregulation
to control these secondary effects.
To limit adult uses to locations where these secondary impacts can be minimized,
particularly as they affect residential neighborhoods and downtown revitalization.
To not attempt to suppress any activities protected by the free-speech protections of
the United States Constitution but instead to control secondary effects.
No portion of a building occupied by an adult use shall be located within any of the
following distances:
Four hundred linear feet from any residential zoning district boundary or lot line of
any existing dwelling; and
One thousand linear feet from the lot line of any existing primary or secondary
school, place of worship, public park, day-care center or child nursery.
No such use shall be located within 1,000 linear feet of any existing adult use.
A fifty-foot buffer yard shall be provided, regardless of zoning district, along the side and
rear lot lines in accordance with § 803, but with plantings of an initial minimum height of
six feet.
No pornographic material, displays or words shall be placed in view of persons who are
not inside of the establishment. Definite precautions shall be made to prohibit minors
from entering the premises.
No such use shall be used for any purpose that violates any federal, state or municipal
law.
See § 709, Prohibited Signs.
The use shall not include the sale or display of obscene materials, as defined by state
law, as may be amended by applicable court decisions.
Adult uses shall be prohibited in all districts except where specifically permitted by Part 3.

Purposes.
The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and life, the creation of
health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmental services, the
extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief, and
the impairment of the tax base by:
Regulating uses, activities and land development which, acting alone or in combination
with other existing or future uses, activities and land development, will cause
unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and frequencies;
Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and land development from locating
within areas subject to flooding;
Requiring all uses, activities and land development that do occur in flood-prone areas to
be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and flood damage;

Minimizing the financial burden imposed on the community, its governmental bodies and
individuals by floods;
Maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, the floodplain in its natural state and
minimizing the removal of vegetation and compaction of soil to maximize its floodcarrying
capacity and water-filtering capabilities; and
Complying with the provisions of the National Flood Insurance Program and the
Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act (Act 1978-166).[1]
Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
General Provisions.
These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of Fountain Hill Borough and
shown as being located within the boundaries of any identified Flood Hazard District which is
considered as a part of the Official Zoning Map.
The Flood Hazard District shall be an overlay to the existing zoning districts as shown on the
Fountain Hill Borough Zoning Map; and, as such, the provisions of the Flood Hazard District
shall be imposed in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning districts. In the
event that a conflict exists between the overlay and the underlying districts, the morerestrictive
provisions shall apply. No development shall be undertaken; no structure or land
shall hereafter be used; no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged or structurally altered; and no area shall be developed, graded, filled or excavated in
any Flood Hazard District except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this
Chapter and any other applicable ordinances and regulations.
Failure to comply with the provisions of this Chapter is a violation of the Fountain Hill Borough
Zoning Ordinance, and Fountain Hill Borough may proceed with court action and/or issue a
declaration of violation under Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to deny flood insurance on the property in violation.
The effects of having a Section 1316 violation are nonavailability of flood insurance for any
buildings, possible reduction of market value, risk of damage without compensation, possible
mortgage foreclosure, and denial of disaster assistance for repair of structural damage.
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this Chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of
study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.
This Chapter does not imply that areas outside the identified Flood Hazard District or that
land uses permitted within such a district will be free from flooding or flood damages.
This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of Fountain Hill Borough or any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
Identification and Establishment of Flood Hazard Districts.
The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of Fountain Hill Borough which are subject
to the one-hundred-year flood as identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) prepared for Fountain Hill Borough by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or other sources and studies found
acceptable by Fountain Hill Borough. The referenced Flood Insurance Study is declared to be
part of this Chapter and shall be kept at the Fountain Hill Borough offices.
The Flood Hazard District shall consist of the following specific areas:

Insurance Study prepared by FEMA. The term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
Such studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by Fountain Hill Borough.
The Flood-Fringe Area (FF): the portion of the AE Zone not included in the floodway. The
basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the base flood elevations shown in
the flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
The General Floodplain Area (FA): the areas identified as A Zone in the Flood Insurance
Study for which no base flood elevations have been provided or areas subject to flooding
defined by one of the following methods:
Soils identified with potential for flooding, as described and mapped by the United
States Department of Agriculture; or
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
reflect accepted technical concepts. Such studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
Fountain Hill Borough.
An initial determination shall be made by the Zoning Officer should a dispute concerning
any district boundary arise. Any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board under the provisions of this Chapter. The burden of proof is on the
appellant.
The delineation of the Flood Hazard District may be revised by Fountain Hill Borough
where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more-detailed studies
have been conducted or undertaken by FEMA, the United States Army Corps of
Engineers or other qualified agency, or an individual. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Nonconforming Uses and Structures in the Flood Hazard District.
A structure or use of a structure or premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of
the Flood Hazard District provisions but which is not in conformity with those provisions shall
be subject to the requirements of this Part 5.
General Provisions.
No encroachment, land development, improvement or reconstruction of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such
action have been notified by Fountain Hill Borough and until all required permits or approvals
have been first obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office. In
addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development (DCED) shall be notified prior to any alteration or
relocation of any watercourse.
Any new construction, uses, activities or land development occurring within the Flood Hazard
District shall be undertaken only in strict compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and
with all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations, including the Fountain Hill

Variances Within Flood Hazard Districts.
General. If compliance with any of the requirements of this Chapter would result in an
exceptional hardship for a prospective builder, developer or landowner, the Zoning Hearing
Board and Building Code Appeals Board (Boards) may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements.
Variance Procedures and Requirements. Requests for variances shall be considered by the
Boards in accordance with this Chapter and with the following:
No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use or activity within any
floodplain or floodway area that would cause any increase in the base flood elevation.
No variance shall be granted for any of the prohibited uses or activities in § 504G to
locate in the Flood Hazard District.
If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification necessary to provide relief.
In granting any variance, the Boards shall attach whatever reasonable conditions and
safeguards they consider necessary in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare and to achieve the objectives of this Chapter.
Whenever a variance is granted, the Boards shall notify the applicant, in writing, that:
The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance.
Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
In reviewing any request for a variance, the Boards shall consider but not be limited to
the following:
There is good and sufficient cause for the variance.
Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
The granting of the variance will not result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase
in flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense,
create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with any
other applicable state or local ordinance regulations.
The review factors listed in § 504J(3) below.
A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by the
Boards. In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall be included in
the annual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Review Factors. In reviewing applications for a variance, the Boards shall consider all
relevant factors and procedures specified in other parts of this Chapter and:
The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by
encroachments.

Streetlighting Exempted. This § 507 shall not apply to streetlighting that is owned, financed or
maintained by the Borough or the state, to temporary emergency lighting, or to an individual porch
light of a dwelling.
Definitions. For the purposes of this § 507, the following definitions shall apply:
DIRECTLY VISIBLE
Allowing a direct line of sight to the light source or lamp.
FOOTCANDLE
The amount of light striking a vertical or horizontal plane, measured in lumens per square
foot. One footcandle equals one lumen per square foot.
FULL-CUTOFF LIGHT FIXTURE
A light fixture for which no light output is emitted above 90° horizontal at any lateral angle
around the fixture.
FULLY SHIELDED LIGHT FIXTURE
A light fixture with all light emitted from the fixture being projected below the horizontal.
Height of Lights. No luminaire, spotlight or other light source that is within 150 feet of a lot line of
an existing primarily residential use lot shall be placed at a height exceeding 20 feet above the
average surrounding ground level. In other areas, this height shall not exceed 25 feet above the
average surrounding ground level. This limitation shall not apply to lights needed for air safety nor
lights intended solely to illuminate an architectural feature of a building nor lighting of outdoor
public recreation facilities.
Diffused. All light sources, including signs, shall be properly diffused as needed with a translucent
or similar cover to prevent exposed bulbs from being directly visible from streets, public sidewalks,
dwellings or adjacent lots.
Shielding. All light sources, including signs, shall be installed and maintained so that they are
shielded around the light source and carefully directed, aimed and placed to prevent the lighting
from creating a nuisance to persons in adjacent dwellings and to prevent the lighting from shining
into the eyes of passing motorists.
Flickering. Flashing, flickering or strobe lighting is prohibited, except for temporary nonadvertising
seasonal lights between October 25 and January 10.
Spillover. Exterior lighting on a lot shall not cause a spillover of light onto a residential lot after
10:00 p.m. that exceeds 0.1 horizontal footcandle at a residential lot line. Exterior lighting on a lot
shall not cause a spillover of light onto a street that exceeds five footcandles.
Gasoline Sales Canopies. Any canopy over gasoline pumps shall have a maximum distance
between the ground level and the underside of the canopy of 20 feet. If the ground level is sloped,
or the canopy is sloped to deflect noise and soot away from neighboring properties, then a portion
of the canopy may have a greater height, provided that the maximum height is 20 feet at the
portion of the canopy that is closest to an adjacent street. All light fixtures under the canopy shall
be recessed into the canopy or screened by an extension around the bottom of the canopy so that
lighting elements are not visible from another lot or street.
Hours of Sign Lighting. If an internally lit sign is within a residential district or across the street from
a residential district, the lighting shall be turned off between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m.
if the use is not open to the public during those hours. If such use is open to the public between
10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., the lighting of the sign shall be turned off a maximum of 30 minutes
after the use closes to the public.

§ 508. Steep Slopes.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to control the intensity of development on slopes
exceeding 15%. Such slopes are considered steep. Controlling the intensity of development on
steep slopes will assist in preventing future problems associated with accelerated soil erosion and
sedimentation, stormwater runoff, on-lot sewage disposal operations, earth slippages, and
vehicular access to buildings. Further, this Section will assist in steering development to lands
more physically suited for new construction.
Regrading. Non-man-made slopes of over 15% shall not be regraded after the adoption of this
Chapter in such a manner that circumvents the requirements of this Chapter.
Applicability. This Section shall apply to all land, buildings and uses and all grading of land in
preparation for building in all zoning districts. This Section shall not regulate slopes that were
clearly man-made prior to the adoption of this Chapter.
Submission.
Any application for subdivision or land development or any application for a zoning or building
permit for a principal building or principal use or any proposal to extensively alter the
preexisting contour of land shall include the submission of a detailed topographic map if the
existing lot involved includes any areas of 15% or greater slope that in the aggregate total
greater than 1,000 square feet.
The topographic maps shall be at a scale of one inch equals 50 feet or larger and shall show
the preexisting contours of all lands proposed for any subdivision, land development, building
or use. Such contours shall be at intervals of five feet of vertical change. Contours shall be
based on an actual field survey supervised and certified by a registered land surveyor.
The topographic map shall clearly identify areas that have a preexisting slope of between
15% and 25% slope and areas of greater than 25% slope.
The applicant shall clearly designate the proposed building site, including an area of 25 feet
around the proposed building location and 15 feet around all driveways, patios or deck areas
for each lot that includes or is proposed to include any areas of 15% or greater slopes. Such
building location shall then become binding, once approved, unless a subsequent submission
and approval occurs under this Section.
Lot Areas.
If a proposed building site would not include any areas with slopes exceeding 15%, the
requirements of the steep slopes section are not applicable.
If a proposed building site would include any areas with existing slopes of between 15% and
25%, but would not include any areas of 25% or greater slope, the following requirements
shall apply to each lot:
A minimum lot area of 43,560 square feet;
A minimum lot width of 120 feet, measured at the minimum front yard setback line;
Thirty-foot minimum setbacks along the front yard, the rear yard and each of two side
yards; and
A maximum impervious cover of 30%.

Thirty-foot minimum setbacks along the front yard, the rear yard and each of two side
yards; and
A maximum impervious cover of 15%.
Slopes of Accessways and Driveways. No portion of any accessway or driveway, including parking
area driving isles and other routes for vehicular access, shall have a finished slope in excess of
12%.
§ 509. Tree Preservation.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
The presence of living trees in our surrounds is important and desirable from an ecological,
environmental and aesthetic standpoint.
Except as otherwise herein provided, it shall be unlawful for anyone to cut down any tree in any
zone in the Borough of Fountain Hill which is six inches or more in diameter at a point 4 1/2 feet
above ground level.
It shall be lawful to cut down such trees six inches or more in diameter if the tree is sick, infected,
damaged, dead, is in such position or condition that it constitutes a danger to neighboring property
or to the public generally, or is located within the legal right-of-way of a public street; provided,
however, that, except in case of emergency, no such tree shall be cut down unless and until a
permit to do so has been obtained from the Zoning Officer. In case of emergency where time does
not allow the prior obtaining of such a permit, a permit shall be applied for within 72 hours of the
cutting down of any tree.
It shall be lawful in any calendar year for the owner of any tract of land to cut down on said tract of
land up to three trees six inches or more in diameter not of the type referred to in Subsection C
above for any private or commercial purpose upon first obtaining from the Zoning Officer a permit
to do so.
When a zoning permit is issued for a building, structure or use, it shall be lawful to cut down any
trees which exist in the space occupied by such building, structure or use, any space within 15
feet of any such building or structure, and any space to be occupied by and all space within 10
feet of all sides of any driveway, parking area, water system or sewage disposal system; provided,
however, that no such trees shall be cut down until the Zoning Officer has issued a permit for the
marked trees to be cut down in such manner that it can be determined after the cutting that only
those trees for which the permit was issued have been cut down.
The above regulations in this § 509 shall not apply to forestry which is permitted in accordance
with the provisions of § 510.
§ 510. Forestry.

Forestry shall be a permitted-by-right use in all zoning districts of Fountain Hill. (See the definition
of "forestry" in Part 2.)
Forestry shall be conducted in accordance with the following requirements, conditions and/or
approvals:
Zoning Permit. A zoning permit shall be obtained from the Zoning Officer prior to harvesting or
otherwise removing 40 or more trees with a trunk diameter of three inches or more at a height
of three feet above the average ground level on any tract of land larger than two acres. Prior
to the issuance of a zoning permit, an erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be
submitted by the applicant to the County Conservation District for review, recommendation
and approval.
Forestry Management Plan. A forestry management plan shall be prepared and filed when
harvesting 40 or more trees involving more than two acres. This plan shall be prepared by a
qualified forester or forest technician and shall be consistent with the Timber Harvesting
Guidelines of the Pennsylvania Forestry Association.
Clear-Cutting and Canopy Preservation.
Clear-cutting shall be prohibited except on tracts of less than 15,000 square feet in size.
On tracts of land ranging in size between 15,000 square feet and two acres, at least 10%
of the timber shall be preserved.
Clear-cutting shall be prohibited on areas with slopes greater than 15%.
When harvesting or otherwise removing 40 or more trees on tracts larger than two acres,
at least 30% of the forest cover (canopy) shall be kept, and the residual tree(s) shall be
well distributed. At least 30% of these residual trees shall be composed of highest value
species as determined by a forester and pursuant to the forestry management plan.
§ 511. Vibration Control.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
No person shall operate or permit the operation of any device or conduct or permit any use to be
conducted that creates vibration which is above the vibration perception threshold of an individual
at or beyond the property boundary of the source (if on private property) or at 50 feet from the
source (if on a public space or public right-of-way).
For the purposes of § 511A, "vibration perception threshold" means the minimum ground- or
structure-borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a normal person to be aware of the
vibration by such direct means as, but not limited to, sensation by touch or visual observation of
moving objects.

§ 602. General Regulations for Off-Street Parking.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
General. Parking spaces, aisles and driveways shall be laid out to result in safe and orderly use
and to fully take into account all of the following: vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular
movement within the site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-through facilities. No
parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off the lot.
Existing Parking. Any parking spaces serving such preexisting structures or uses at the time of
adoption of this Part 6 shall not in the future be reduced in number below the number required by
this Part 6.
Change in Use or Expansion. A structure or use in existence at the effective date of this Part 6
that expands or results in a change of use of an existing principal building shall be required to
provide all of the required parking for the entire size and type of the resulting use, except as
follows:
If an existing lawful business or institutional use includes less parking than would be required,
and the applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that there is insufficient area on the lot to meet
the required amount of parking, then that deficit of parking shall be grandfathered for new
business or institutional uses. For example, if an existing store included three parking spaces
and was required to provide seven spaces, there is a deficit of four spaces. Therefore, if that

store is converted to an office that would need 10 spaces, the office would need to provide a
total of six spaces (10 minus the preexisting deficit of four).
If a business or institutional use expands by an aggregate total maximum of 10% in the
applicable measurement (such as building floor area) beyond what existed at the time of
adoption of this Part 6, and the applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that there is insufficient
area on the lot to meet the required amount of parking, then no additional parking is required.
For example, if an existing building included 3,000 square feet, and a single minor addition of
300 square feet was proposed, then additional parking would not be required.
Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All required numbers of parking spaces
and off-street loading spaces shall be available as long as the use or building which the spaces
serve still exists, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the minimum required by
this Part 6. No required parking area or off-street loading spaces shall be used for any other use
(such as storage or display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for parking.
Location of Parking.
Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the same lot or abutting lot with the principal
use served, unless special exception approval is granted. The only standard that must be met
to obtain the special exception approval is for the applicant to prove to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that a method of providing the spaces is guaranteed to be available
during all of the years the use is in operation within 200 feet walking distance from the
entrance of the principal use being served. This distance may be increased to 300 feet for
employee parking. A written and signed lease shall be provided.
The Zoning Hearing Board may require that the use be approved for period of time
consistent with the lease of the parking and that a renewal of the permit shall only be
approved if the parking lease is renewed.
Flexibility in Parking. As a special exception, an applicant may prove to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Hearing Board that the minimum amount of off-street parking should be modified for a
specific application because of one or more of the following characteristics;
The applicant proves that parking will be shared with another use that will reduce the total
amount of parking needed because the uses have different peak times of parking need and
that there is a legally guaranteed method to make sure that the parking will continue to be
available during all of the years that the use is in operation; or
The applicant proves that the parking demand for a particular use is unusually low because of
some unusual and peculiar characteristic of the use.
§ 603. Design Standards for Off-Street Parking.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
General Requirements.
Backing Onto a Street. No parking area shall be designed to require or encourage parked
vehicles to back into a public street in order to leave a parking space, except for a singlefamily
dwelling with its access onto a local street or parking court. Parking spaces may back
onto an alley.
Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor vehicle may proceed to
and from the parking space provided for it without requiring the moving of any other vehicle,
except for spaces serving a single-family, twin or townhouse dwelling.
Parking areas shall not be within a required buffer yard or street right-of-way.

landscaped planting strip, except for necessary and approved vehicle entrances and exits to
the lot.
Stacking and Obstructions. Each lot shall provide adequate area upon the lot to prevent
backup of vehicles on a public street while awaiting entry to the lot or while waiting for service
at a drive-through facility.

Each use shall provide off-street loading facilities, which meet the requirements of this Section,
sufficient to accommodate the maximum demand generated by the use and the maximum size

and unloading along an alley.
At the time of review under this Part 6, the applicant shall provide evidence to the Zoning Officer
showing that the use will have sufficient numbers and sizes of loading facilities. The Planning
Commission and/or Borough Council may provide advice to the Zoning Officer on this matter as
part of any plan review by such boards. For the purposes of this Section, the words "loading" and
"unloading" are used interchangeably.
Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall not intrude into approved buffer areas and
landscaped areas.

Portable Signs (Including Signs on Mobile Stands) and Other Temporary Signs.
Purpose. These standards recognize portable signs as a particular type of sign that has the
characteristics of a temporary sign but that has been inappropriately used as a permanent
sign. This Section is based on the policy that if a use desires to regularly display a sign for
regularly changing messages, that it erect a permanent sign within all of the requirements of
this Part 7.
Definition.
PORTABLE SIGN
A freestanding sign that is attached to a chassis or legs that allows it to be towed or
carried from one location to another and that is not permanently attached to the ground.
Portable signs are prohibited in all districts, except as a temporary charitable event sign
complying with § 703.
Signs on Freestanding Walls. A freestanding sign may be attached to a decorative masonry or
stone wall with a maximum height of five feet and a maximum length of 10 feet without being
regulated by the wall setback regulations of this Chapter and with the wall itself not counting
towards the maximum sign area. Sight distance requirements shall still be met.
Sign Area Bonus. In a commercial district, the maximum sign area for a freestanding sign may be
increased by 25% beyond the size that would otherwise be allowed if the sign is not internally
illuminated and if the base of the sign is surrounded by landscaping.
§ 705. Abandoned or Outdated Signs.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Signs advertising a use no longer in existence shall be removed within 90 days of the cessation of
such use. If the owner of a property does not remove such sign within 30 days after receiving a written
notice from the Zoning Officer, the sign may be removed by the Borough at the expense of the property
owner.
These time limits shall not apply to a sign intended to be reused with a new sign face serving a
building that is clearly temporarily vacant and being offered to new tenants or for purchase.
§ 706. Location of Signs.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
The following shall regulate the location of signs:
Setbacks. A sign shall not intrude into or project over an existing street right-of-way, unless
specifically authorized by a permit from the Borough or PennDOT. Projecting signs meeting the
requirements for such signs and official signs shall be allowed within the right-of-way. The
Borough Police Department, Zoning Officer or his/her designee or any other person shall have the
authority to remove and dispose of unauthorized signs within the street right-of-way or that are
attached to a utility pole or tree.
The Borough Council may approve a temporary banner over a street cartway to advertise a
charitable or Borough-sponsored event.
Sight Clearance. No sign shall be so located that it interferes with the sight clearance
requirements of § 803C.

[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
See § 507, Control of Light and Glare, in Part 5 (including § 507H) and provisions in § 704A within
residential districts.
§ 708. Vehicles Functioning as Signs.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Any vehicle or trailer displaying a sign area greater than 20 square feet that is being used in such a
manner that the carrying of sign(s) no longer is incidental to the primary purpose of the vehicle or
trailer but becomes a primary purpose in itself shall be considered a freestanding sign and shall be
subject to all of the requirements for freestanding signs. This shall include but not be limited to a
vehicle that is parked in the front yard of a business within clear view of a street and that is not moved
to another lot at least once a week.
§ 709. Prohibited Signs.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Any moving object used to attract attention to a commercial use shall be prohibited. Any banner or
flag that does not meet the requirements of this Part 7 shall be prohibited.
Flashing, blinking, twinkling, animated or moving signs of any type shall be prohibited. A sign may
electronically change from one message to another message, provided that the message does not
flash and stays on for a duration of at least 25 seconds. In addition, flashing lights visible from a
street shall not be used to attract attention to a business. This restriction specifically includes
window signs but does not prohibit seasonal Christmas lighting or displays that comply with § 703.
Signs which emit smoke, visible vapors or particles, sound or odor shall be prohibited.
Signs are prohibited which contain information that states that a lot may be used for any purpose
not permitted under the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
Signs shall be prohibited that are of such character, form, shape or color that they imitate or
resemble any official traffic sign, signal or device or that have any characteristics which are likely
to confuse or distract the operator of a motor vehicle on a public street (such as prominent use of
the word "danger").
Signs or displays visible from a lot line that include words or images that are obscene or
pornographic shall be prohibited.
Balloons of greater than 40 cubic feet that are tethered to the ground or a structure for periods of
12 hours shall be prohibited.
Floodlights and outdoor lasers used for advertising purposes shall be prohibited.

be kept in good condition and repair. The Zoning Officer shall, by written notice, require a property
owner or lessee to repair or remove a damaged, dilapidated or unsafe sign within a specified period of
time. If such order is not complied with, the Borough may repair or remove such sign at the expense of
such owner or lessee.
§ 711. Measurement and Major Types of Signs.

roof.
FREESTANDING SIGN
See Part 2.

spire of a place of worship.
ILLUMINATED SIGN, INTERNALLY
A sign illuminated by light from within the sign rather than a source adjacent to or outside of
the sign. A sign within a display case with lights only shining onto the front of the sign shall be
considered to be externally illuminated.
OFF-PREMISES SIGN
See Part 2.
SIGN
See Part 2.

§ 712. Off-Premises Signs (Including Billboards).
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Purposes. Off-premises signs are controlled by this Part 7 for the following purposes: to ensure
that a physical environment is maintained that is attractive to desirable types of development; to
prevent visual pollution in the Borough and protect property values, especially in consideration of
the fact that most commercial areas of the Borough are within close proximity to existing
residences; to prevent glare on adjacent property and streets; to avoid the creation of additional
visual distractions to motorists, especially along busy arterial streets that involve complex turning
movements and numerous traffic hazards; to recognize the numerous alternative forms of free
speech available in the Borough, including existing nonconforming off-premises signs and onpremises
signs; and to carry out the purposes listed in § 701.
Nonconforming Off-Premises Signs. This Section is not intended to require the removal of an
existing lawfully placed off-premises sign that is in a structurally sound condition.
PennDOT Signs. Signs erected and maintained by PennDOT are permitted by right in all districts.
Permitted Off-Premises Signs. Except for signs allowed by § 703, an off-premises sign is only
permitted if it meets the following requirements:
District. An off-premises sign is only permitted in the GC District.
Location. An off-premises sign shall be set back a minimum of 25 feet from all lot lines and
street rights-of-way.
Maximum sign area: 300 square feet.
Spacing. Any off-premises sign shall be separated by a minimum of 1,000 feet from any other
off-premises sign, including signs on either side of a street and including existing signs in
other municipalities. No lot shall include more than one off-premises sign.
Maximum Height: 35 feet above the elevation of the adjacent street or highway, measured at
the street or highway center line.
Attached. No off-premises sign or sign face shall be attached in any way to any other offpremises
sign, except that a sign may have two sign faces of 300 square feet each if they are
placed approximately back-to-back.
Control of Lighting and Glare. See standards in § 507.
Residences. No off-premises sign greater than 30 square feet in sign area shall be located
within 200 feet from a lot line of an existing dwelling.

Frontage Required onto Improved Street.
Each proposed new lot, principal nonresidential building and apartment building shall directly
abut one of the following:
A public street, not including an alley;
A street that will be dedicated to the Borough as part of the subdivision plan which
created such lot; or
A private street which meets all of the requirements of a public street.
In the case of townhouses or apartments, each dwelling unit may be served with vehicle
access onto a private parking court which then has access onto a street meeting Borough
standards, provided that there is an acceptable system to ensure that the parking court will be
properly maintained.
Number of Principal Uses and Principal Buildings Per Lot.
A lot in a commercial or industrial district may include more than one permitted principal use
per lot and/or more than one permitted principal building per lot, provided that every
requirement is met for each use and each building. If differing dimensional requirements apply
for different uses on the lot, then the most-restrictive requirement shall apply.
For example, if Use 1 requires a one-acre lot area and Use 2 on the same lot requires a
two-acre lot area, then the lot shall have a minimum lot area of two acres.
The applicant shall submit a site plan that demonstrates that each structure would meet
the requirements of this Part 8.
The lot may include a condominium form of ownership of individual buildings, with a
legally binding property owners' association, if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough Solicitor, that there will be
appropriate legal mechanisms in place and compliance with applicable state law.
A lot within a residential district shall not include more than one principal use and shall not
include more than one principal building, unless specifically permitted by this Part 8.
A manufactured/mobile home park, condominium residential development or apartment
development may include more than one principal building per lot, provided that all other
requirements of this Chapter are met.
A condominium form of ownership of individual dwelling units, with a legally binding
owners' association, may be established if the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning Officer, based upon review by the Borough Solicitor, that there will be appropriate
legal mechanisms in place and compliance with applicable state law.

requirements of this Part 8, water towers, clock or bell towers, steeples of places of worship, electrical
transmission lines, elevator shafts, windmills, skylights, chimneys, mechanical equipment, or other
appurtenances usually required to be and customarily placed above the roof level and not intended for
human occupancy. See also the definition of "height" in § 202.
§ 803. Special Lot and Yard Requirements, Sight Distance and
Buffer Yards.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
In General.
No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way that it would result in
another lot, building or use not being able to meet the requirements of this Part 8. This
includes but is not limited to setback areas, nonimpervious areas and off-street parking areas.
Emergency Access. All principal buildings shall have adequate provisions for access by
emergency vehicles and fire ladders in order to reach all sides of a building.
Exceptions to Minimum Lot Areas, Lot Widths and Yards.

minimum depth of the front yard, unless a larger width is provided for a side yard.
Projections Into Required Yards.
Cornices, eaves, sills or other similar architectural features, exterior stairways, fire
escapes or other required means of egress, rain leads, chimneys, ground-mounted doors
for basement access, window awnings, chase for heating pipes, or other similar
structures that do not include space usable by persons may extend or project into a
required yard not more than three feet, except as may be required within a drainage or
utility easement.
Steps, stoops, fire escapes, handicapped ramps, and landings necessary to provide
entrance to a building may be located within a required setback area. Stoops, fire
escapes and handicapped ramps serving an existing building may extend into a street
right-of-way where necessary, if granted written approval by the Zoning Officer.
See also exceptions for decks and accessory buildings in the notes of § 307A.
Front Yard Setback Exception. In any district within a block containing a lot proposed for
construction or expansion of a building, where 50% or more of the improved lots on such
block frontage currently have front yards of lesser depth than is currently required for that
district, and where the clear majority of such lots are already developed, the average of such
existing front setbacks shall establish the minimum front yard depth for the remainder of the
frontage.

Sight Clearance at Intersections.
Clear sight triangles shall be provided, within which no obstruction to vision shall be permitted
between a height of 24 inches to 10 feet above the center-line grade of each street
intersection. Such clear sight triangles shall be established from the point of intersection of
the center lines of the intersecting streets for a distance of 75 feet where both streets are local
streets, 100 feet where one or both streets are collector streets, and 150 feet where one or
both streets are arterial streets.
In § 202, see the definition of "alley," which is distinguished from a street.
Where a street intersects with an alley, a clear sight triangle shall be established with one leg
of the triangle 15 feet long along the edge of the right-of-way of the street and one leg of the
triangle 10 feet long along the center line of the alley, with the two legs connected by a third
longer leg.
Where two alleys intersect, a clear sight triangle shall be established with each leg of the
triangle 10 feet long along the center line of each alley, and with the two legs connected by a
third longer leg.
Within these clear sight triangles, no new sight obstruction shall be allowed that obstructs the
views of motorists of oncoming vehicle and pedestrian traffic at a height between two and 10
feet in elevation. To the maximum extent feasible, this clear sight triangle shall also be cleared
of existing obstructions, such as by trimming vegetation.
Buffer Yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following standards shall be required
under the following situations:
Buffer Yard Width, When Required. Buffer yards shall have a minimum width of 20 feet,
except 10 feet in the TC District and 30 feet in the GC and I Districts. Buffer yards shall be
required in the following situations, and where otherwise required by this Chapter.
Buffer Yard to be Provided by the Following:

Screening and Buffer Is:
(a) Alongside and rear lot lines of any new: Abutting or across an alley from an
existing dwelling within a residential
district and visible from such
dwelling
[1] Principal commercial or industrial use
[2] Area of 10 or more new off-street parking
spaces
[3] An outdoor industrial storage area
[4] An area routinely used for the overnight
parking of two or more tractor-trailer
trucks

Plants needed for the visual screen shall not be placed within an existing street right-ofway.
However, deciduous trees may be permitted by the Borough to be placed within a
street right-of-way.
The buffer yard may include areas within a required front, side or rear yard, or a paved
setback area, provided that the larger yard requirement shall apply in case of overlap.
Characteristics of Buffer Yards.
The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures, dumpsters, commercial or
industrial storage or display, manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display. Buffer yards shall primarily include
evergreen plants, in addition to any required shade trees.
As a special exception use, the applicant may prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board that an alternative method of screening will satisfactorily avoid conflicts
between uses and provide an attractive appearance. For example, the Board may
approve a decorative brick wall to be placed between a loading area and an abutting
street.
Plant Screen.
Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of trees or shrubs extending the length of
the lot line.
Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have a minimum height when
planted of three feet. In addition, an average of one deciduous shade tree, with a
minimum trunk diameter of two inches measured six inches above the ground level,
shall be placed for each 50 feet of length of the buffer yard. The shade trees may be
clustered or spaced unevenly. Where street trees are approved and provided in the
right-of-way, or healthy existing trees will be preserved, those trees may serve in
place of this shade tree requirement.
Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such species, spacing and size
as can reasonably be expected to produce within five years a mostly solid yearround
visual screen at least six feet in height.
The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the plants will not obstruct a
street or sidewalk.
The plant visual screen shall be interrupted only at:
Approved points of approximately perpendicular vehicle or pedestrian ingress
and egress to the lot;
Locations necessary to comply with safe sight distance requirements; and
Locations needed to meet other specific state, Borough and utility requirements.
American arborvitae and similar weak-stem plants shall not be used to meet the
buffer yard requirements. If more than 20 evergreen plants are proposed, no more
than 50% shall be of one species.
Where space allows, evergreen trees should be planted at diagonal offsets so that
there is room for future growth of the trees.

Parking Lot Screening. If six or more new off-street parking spaces are provided within 30 feet
from the right-of-way of Broadway and Delaware Avenue, a six-foot-wide planting area shall
be provided between the parking and the street right-of-way. To provide security and oversight
of the parking area from a street, species of plants should be used that can be trimmed to a
height of less than four feet. This provision shall not apply if a more-intense buffer is required
under § 803D(1) above (such as for truck parking).
Buffer Yard Plans. See § 804E.
Fences.
Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside of any required plant screening.
As a condition of any variance or special exception approval, the Zoning Hearing Board
may require the installation of a fence in addition to a buffer yard. As a condition of any
land development approval, the Borough Planning Commission may require the
installation of a fence in addition to a buffer yard.
§ 804. Landscaping.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or apartment lot which is not used for structures,
loading areas, parking spaces and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be
provided with an all-season, well-maintained vegetative groundcover and shall be landscaped with
trees and shrubs. Landscaped areas shall be kept free of debris, rubbish and noxious weeds.
See also the buffer yard provisions in § 803.
Parking Area Trees.
One deciduous tree shall be required for every 10 new off-street parking spaces.
If a lot will include 20 or more new parking spaces, landscaped areas shall be provided within
the parking area. Otherwise, the trees may be planted around the parking area.
Trees required by this Section shall meet the following standards:
Type of Trees Permitted. Required trees shall be chosen from the Borough's approved
list of trees.
Quality of Trees. Required trees shall be of symmetrical growth and free of insect pests
and disease.
Minimum Size. The trunk diameter (measured at a height of six inches above the finished
grade level) shall be a minimum of two inches or greater.
Planting and Maintenance. Required trees shall be:
Planted with adequate unpaved surface around each for water and air; and
Properly protected by curbs, curb stops, distance or other devices from damage from
vehicles.
Street Trees. As part of the construction of any new street or any new principal nonresidential
building or any new apartment building, street trees shall be required to be planted. An average of
one street tree shall be planted for every 50 feet of street length. The street trees do not need to
be planted at specific intervals but may be moved to fit with utilities, driveways and other features.

The trees shall be in locations approved by the Zoning Officer. These locations may or may
not be within the street right-of-way, depending upon the circumstances of the site. If the trees
are not located in the right-of-way, they shall be placed within the yard immediately adjacent
to the right-of-way.
New street trees shall not be required where existing healthy street trees will be preserved
and will serve the same purpose.
The type, quality, size, planting and maintenance shall be as specified in § 804C and of a
height, at the time of planting, that ensures that the lowest branches do not conflict with
pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
Landscaping Maintenance. All shade tree, buffer yard and other landscaping required by this
Chapter shall be perpetually maintained by the property owner. Any landscaping needed to meet
an ordinance requirement that dies, is removed, or is severely damaged shall be replaced by the
current property owner as soon as is practical considering growing seasons, within a maximum of
150 days.
Review. Where landscaping is required by this Part 8, the applicant shall submit a site plan
showing proposed initial sizes, locations and species of plantings and locations of any fencing in
sufficient detail to determine compliance with this Section. Such landscaping plan should be
provided to the Zoning Officer for review and approval.
§ 805. Nonconformities.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Proof and Registration of Nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility of, with the burden of proof
upon, a party asserting a nonconformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A property owner
may request a written statement of nonconformity from the Zoning Officer after providing sufficient
evidence.
Continuation. A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot, as defined by this Part 8, may be
continued and may be sold and continued by new owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or
change in use of a nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this Section.
Expansion of or Construction upon Nonconformities.
Nonconforming Structure.
The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to be reconstructed or
expanded, provided:
That such action will not increase the severity or amount of the nonconformity (such
as the area of the building extending into the required yard) or create any new
nonconformity [except as provided by Subsection C(1)(c) below]; and
That any expanded area will comply with the applicable setbacks in that district and
other requirements of this Part 8.
In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a nonconforming use, any
expansion shall also meet the requirements of this Section regarding nonconforming
uses.
Extension Along a Nonconforming Setback. If an existing building has a lawfully
nonconforming building setback, additions may occur to increase the height above such
setback or to extend other portions of the building out to the nonconforming side or rear
setback line, provided that:

The structure shall not be extended beyond the existing nonconforming setback line;
No additional nonconformity shall be created;
The new nonconforming extension shall not be greater than 25% of the existing floor
area;
All other requirements of this Chapter shall be met; and
Such addition shall not be permitted for a nonresidential building that abuts an
existing principal residential use.
Nonconforming Lots.
Permitted Construction on a Nonconforming Lot. New permitted structures for a single
permitted-by-right principal use and its customary accessory uses may be constructed,
reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming lot of record held in single and separate
ownership as a permitted-by-right use if minimum setback requirements are met.
Lot Width. The fact that an existing lawful lot of record does not meet the minimum lot
width requirements of this Part 8 shall not by itself cause such lot to be considered to be
a nonconforming lot.
Expansion of a Nonconforming Nonresidential Use. A nonconforming use or a building used
by a nonconforming use shall not be expanded, except in accordance with the following
provisions:
An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall require special exception
approval from the Zoning Hearing Board under Part 1.
Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same lot that the nonconforming
use was located upon at the time the use became nonconforming.
The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use or the total land area covered
by the nonconforming use, whichever is more restrictive, shall not be increased by
greater than 40% beyond what existed in the nonconforming use at the time the use first
became nonconforming, under this Chapter or a previously adopted zoning ordinance,
whichever came first.
The above maximum increase shall be measured in aggregate over the entire life of
the nonconformity. All expansions of the nonconforming use and/or building(s) that
occurred since the use originally became nonconforming shall count towards the
above maximum increase.
Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required setbacks and other
requirements of this Part 8, unless the Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
Expansion of a Nonconforming Residential Use. An existing nonconforming residential use
may be expanded as a permitted-by-right use, provided that:
The number of dwelling units or rooming house units is not increased;
The expansion meets all applicable setbacks;
No new types of nonconformities are created;
A nonconformity is not made more severe; and
All other dimensional requirements of this Chapter are met.

Nonconforming Sign. The provisions of this Part 8 shall not be interpreted to provide a right to
expand or extend a nonconforming sign. Instead, any expansions or extensions of a
nonconforming sign shall comply with this Part 8.
Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities. A nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or
damaged may be rebuilt in a nonconforming fashion only if:
The application for a building permit is submitted within 18 months after the date of damage
or destruction;
Work begins in earnest within 12 months afterwards and continues; and
No nonconformity may be created or increased by any reconstruction. The property shall be
properly secured during such time in such a way to keep out trespassers and to avoid harm to
neighboring properties.
Abandonment of a Nonconformity.
If a nonconforming use of a building or land is discontinued, razed, removed or abandoned for
12 or more months, subsequent use of such building or land shall conform with the
regulations of the district in which it is located, except:
As provided for in Subsection D, Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities, of this Section.
The applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence that the nonconformity was not
abandoned.
An existing lawful separate dwelling unit may be unrented for any period of time without being
considered abandoned under this Part 8.
Changes from One Nonconforming Use to Another.
Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not revert to a nonconforming
use.
A nonconforming use may be changed to a different nonconforming use only if permitted as a
special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board. However, special exception approval is not
needed for a simple change within an existing building from one lawful nonconforming retail
store use to another retail store use or from one lawful nonconforming personal service use to
another personal service use, provided that the new use complies with any Zoning Hearing
Board conditions that applied to the previous use and is not more objectionable in external
effects than the previous use.
Where special exception approval is required for a change of a nonconforming use, the Board
shall determine whether the applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equal or less objectionable in external effects than the preexisting
nonconforming use with regard to:
Traffic safety and generation (especially truck traffic);
Noise, dust, fumes, vapors, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire, hazardous substances, and
explosive hazards;
Amount and character of outdoor storage;
Late night and early morning hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings;
and
Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.

§ 806. Dumpster Screening and Location.
[Ord. 736, 9/8/2008]
Any newly placed solid waste dumpster shall be screened on all sides as necessary to screen
views from public streets and dwellings. Such screening shall consist of decorative masonry walls,
mostly solid weather-resistant wood fencing or fencing of a similar appearance (such as white
vinyl vertical planks). Primarily evergreen plantings are also encouraged in addition to the fence or
wall. The fence or wall shall include a self-latching door or gate.
Setback from Dwellings. An outdoor solid waste container with a capacity of over 25 cubic feet
shall be kept the maximum distance that is feasible from any abutting dwelling, in the
determination of the Zoning Officer, provided that the container is not in the minimum front yard. In
any case, an outdoor solid waste container shall be kept a minimum of 15 feet from an abutting
dwelling. A solid waste dumpster shall not be located in a front yard.
If a solid waste dumpster is moved from one part of a lot to another part of a lot, then it shall come
into compliance with this § 806.
All waste containers shall be completely enclosed, and the lid shall be kept in place. The locations
of all dumpsters shall be shown on all site plans and land development plans submitted to the
Borough.
This Section shall not apply to dumpsters temporarily placed during actual construction or
demolition on the premises, or for recycling containers that do not involve garbage, or for portable
storage containers [see Part 1, § 103G(3) regarding portable storage containers]. Also, see the
Code of Ordinances of the Borough of Fountain Hill, Chapter 21, Streets and Sidewalks, Part 6,
