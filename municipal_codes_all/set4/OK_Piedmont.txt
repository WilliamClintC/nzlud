infrastructure use fee shall be used for the future
expansion and improvements of the City's water,
wastewater, and roadway systems. Funds
collected shall be paid into the water,
wastewater, and roads capital improvement
account and accounted separately therein. Such
funds and the interest accruing thereon shall be
used exclusively for expansion, improvements,
and to pay debt service obligations issued to
finance said future improvement and expansion
of said water, wastewater, and roadway systems.
C. The new Infrastructure Use Fee established by
subsection A, above, shall be waived for owners of
property as of May 24, 2011 whose residential

protect the public health, safety and welfare of the

CHAPTER 6. FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
Section 12-601. Statutory Authorization, Findings of
Fact, Purpose and Methods.
A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION
B. The Legislature of the State of Oklahoma has in
(statutes) 82 O.S. §§1601-1618, as amended,
Chapter 23 delegated the responsibility of local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
minimize flood losses. Therefore, the City of
Piedmont, Canadian County, Floodplain Board adopts
the following floodplain management regulations:
C. FINDINGS OFF ACT
1. The flood hazard areas of the incorporated areas
of the City of Piedmont, Oklahoma are subject to
periodic inundation, which results in loss of life
and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental
services, and extraordinary public expenditures
for flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and
general welfare.
2. These flood losses are created by the cumulative
effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause
art increase in flood heights and velocities, and
by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses
vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands
because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood
damage.
D. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
E. It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Protect human life and health;
2. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly
flood control projects;
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES
July 2020
166
3. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
5. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone
and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
6. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for
the sound use and development of floodprone
areas in such a manner as to minimize future
flood blight areas; and
7. Insure that potential buyers are notified that
property is in a flood area.
F. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES
1. In order to accomplish its purposes, these
regulations use the following methods:
2. Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to
health, safety or property in times off109d, or
cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
3. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
4. Control the alteration of natural floodplains,
stream channels, and natural protective barriers,
which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
5. Control filling, grading, dredging and other
development which may increase flood damage;
6. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters
or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as
garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part
of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the

reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before "start of construction" of the improvement. This
includes structures that have incurred "substantial
damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified
by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions or
B. Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a "historic structure."
VARIANCE - is a grant of relief to a person from the
requirement of these regulations or ordinance when
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or
development in a manner otherwise prohibited by these
regulations. (For full requirements see Section 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
VIOLATION - means the failure of a structure or other
development to be fully compliant with this community's
floodplain management regulations. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in

be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION - means the height, in
relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of
1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
Section 12-603. General Provisions.
A. LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
These floodplain management regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the incorporated limits of the City of
Piedmont, Canadian County, Oklahoma.
B. BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The areas of special
flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering
report entitled The Flood Insurance Study for
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES
July 2020
169
Canadian County and Incorporated Areas dated June
7, 2019, along with the Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM) are hereby adopted by reference and declared
to be a part of these regulations. These regulations
shall go into effect on June 7, 2019, and until that time
the current regulations shall remain in effect.
C. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A
Development Permit shall be required to ensure
conformance with the provisions of these floodplain
management regulations.
D. COMPLIANCE. No structure or land shall hereafter be
located, altered, or have its use changed without full
compliance with the terms of these regulations and
other applicable regulations.
E. ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
These regulations are not intended to repeal,
abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where
these regulations and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions
shall prevail.
F. INTERPRETATION. In the interpretation and
application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be:
1. Considered as minimum requirements;
2. Liberally construed in favor of the governing
body; and
3. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other
powers granted under State statutes.
G. WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OR LIABILITY. The
degree of flood protection required by these
regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. On rare occasions greater floods can
and will occur and flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the
community or any official or employee thereof for any
flood damages that result from reliance on these
regulations or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.

D. STANDARDS FOR AREAS OF SHALLOW
FLOODING (AO/AH ZONES). Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in Article 3,
Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding.
These areas have special flood hazards associated
with base flood depths of 1 to 3 feet where a clearly
defined channel does not exist and where the path of
flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flows
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by
ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following
provisions apply:
1. All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated above
the highest adjacent grade at
2. least as high as the depth number specified in
feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if
no depth number is specified).
3. All new construction and substantial
improvements of non-residential structures;
i. Have the lowest floor (including basement)
elevated above the highest adjacent grade
at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet on the community's FIRM
(at least two feet if no depth number is
specified), or;
ii. Together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities be designed so that below the base
flood level the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effects of buoyancy.
4. A registered professional engineer or architect
shall submit a certification to the Floodplain
Administrator that the standards of this Section,
as proposed in Article 4, Section C (l) a., are
satisfied.
5. Require within Zones AH or AO adequate
drainage paths around structures on slopes, to
guide floodwaters around and away from
proposed structures.
E. FLOODWAYS. Floodways - located within areas of
special flood hazard established in Article 3, Section
B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the
velocity of floodwaters that carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following
provisions shall apply:
1. Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and
other development within the adopted regulatory
floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
2. If Article 5, Section E (1) above is satisfied, all
new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of Article 5.
3. Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1,
Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance
Regulations, a community may permit
encroachments within the adopted regulatory
floodway that would result in an increase in base
flood elevations, provided that the community
first completes all of the provisions required by
Section 65.12.
F. SEVERABILITY. If any section, clause, sentence, or
phrase of these Regulations is held to be invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way affect the
validity of the remaining portions . of these
Regulations. ·
G. PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE. No structure
or land shall hereafter be constructed, located,
extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other
applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of
this ordinance by failure to comply with any of its
requirements (including violations of conditions and
safeguards established in connection with conditions)
shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who
violates this ordinance or fails to comply with any of its
requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined
not more than$ 500.00 or imprisoned for not more
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES

than sixty days, or both, for each violation, and in
addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in
the case. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the
City of Piedmont Floodplain Board, Piedmont City
Council, or City Attorney from taking such other lawful
action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.
H. CERTIFICATION. It is hereby found and declared by
The City of Piedmont Floodplain Board that severe
flooding has occurred in the past within its jurisdiction
and will certainly occur within the future; that flooding
is likely to result in infliction of serious personal injury
or death, and is likely to result in substantial injury or
destruction of property within its jurisdiction; in order

maintenance or improvements to these existing dedicated
streets. Nothing in these regulations shall prohibit the City

to the specifications set forth in these regulations.
However, due to the number of miles of streets involved
the City bas a limited financial ability to reconstruct existing
streets, and such streets will be constructed or
reconstructed under the following conditions: Prior to major
construction by the City of an existing street, an
engineering study shall be obtained to determine the
condition of the base and pavement of the street to
determine the necessary scope of work. From this study a
correlation can be made relative to what construction is
neces.my to meet these standards. The priority of street
construction projects will be set by the City Council. A
financial plan shall be developed for payment of the costs
of street improvements providing a well-managed financial
structure using the funds available to the City through
existing funds, grants, loans. etc. to meet the financial
obligations. At least once annually the City Council will
develop and implement a schedule of paving
improvements based on existing needs and updated to
meet banging circumstances.

connection fee shall be determined at the
time of installation of the water main based
on the actual cost of construction, excluding
the difference in cost attributable to the
construction of an oversized main.
iii. Records. The City shall maintain records of
all mains where connection fees are
applicable and shall collect such fees prior

v. Computation of connection fees. .
a) The connection fee for property
abutting the main shall be based on
onehalf
of the construction cost,
excluding the difference in cost
attributable to the construction of an
oversized main, based on the number
of feet property abutting oh the main. If
the property owner on the butt
(terminus or end) of an approach main
wishes to connect to the end of main,
the connection fee shall be the full cost
of the approach main, excluding the
difference in cost attributable to the
construction of an oversized-main, but
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES

including engineering. and right-of-way
costs based on the number of feet
which would be needed to extend the
main across the entire front footage of
the connecting property. The City and
Piedmont Municipal Authority have the
option of limiting extensions from the
butt of an approach main to one
hundred (100) feet
b) If the main is on the boundary of the
installing Developer's property, the
abutting property owner shall not be
permitted to receive water service from
said main until a connection fee, based
on one-half of the actual cost of the
boundary main excluding the
difference in cost attributable to the
construction of an oversized main,
based on the number of feet of property
abutting the main has been paid.
c) Where the approach or boundary main
is installed after the effective date of
this policy and non-abutting property
desires service from such main through
internal mains, a connection fee shall
be collected, based on one-half of the
construction cost excluding the
difference in cost attributable to the
construction of an oversized main,
based on the rate applicable for one
hundred (100) feet of abutting property.
d) No connection fee shall be charged for
Piedmont-owned fire hydrants or
connections to properties or facilities
o:wned by the City of Piedmont.
e) Ten percent (I 0%) of all connection
fees collected by the City of Piedmont
shall be retained by the City of
Piedmont to defray administration
costs.
f) The amount to be repaid to the
installing developer from connection
fees shall not exceed the total
construction cost of :the approach or
boundary main. Any administrative
fees retained by the City of Piedmont
shall be excluded from the computation
of the payment to the developer.

Fees for connection of another subdivision or
facility to this Project nor shall any connection be
exempt from the "tap fee" established by the
Piedmont Municipal Authority. The requirement
to pay Connection fees shall not be affected by
whether the property to be served is zoned
residential; commercial, industrial, or any other
designation.
4. Connection Fees, as required herein, shall paid
to the City of Piedmont prior to making any
connection to or obtaining any sanitary sewer
service from the Project.

ARTICLE II. ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT
REMEDIES
Section 17A-31. Notification of Violation.
Whenever the Director finds that any user has violated or
is violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
requirement, the Director may serve upon said user a
written notice of violation. Within the stated number of
days, in no case more than five days, of the receipt of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include
specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to
the Director. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this chapter
shall limit the authority of the City to take any action,
including but not limited to emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of
violation.
Section 17A-32. Consent Orders.
The Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent
orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other
similar documents establishing an agreement with any
user responsible for noncompliance. Such orders will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period also specified by the
order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this chapter
and shall be judicially enforceable.
Section 17A-33. Show Cause Hearing.
The Director may order any user which causes or
contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear
before the Director and show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why
this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The
notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at
least five days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user.
Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate
enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing
date. A show cause hearing shall not be a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the user; taking
enforcement action; or invoking an immediate emergency
suspension of discharge where the discharge threatens
imminent or substantial endangerment to the health, safety
or welfare of persons.
Section 17A-34. Compliance Orders.
When the Director finds that a user has violated or
continues to violate this chapter, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge
directing that1he user come into compliance within the
stated number of days, but in no case more than two days.
If the user does not come into compliance within the stated
number of days, sewer service shall be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other
related appurtenances be installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional selfmonitoring,
and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the
sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a Federal pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order
release the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall
not be a prerequisite to taking any other action against the
user.
Section 17A-35. Cease and Desist Orders.
A. When the Director finds that a user is violating this
chapter, the user's wastewater discharge permit, any
order issued hereunder, or any o1her pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past
violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing 1he user to:
1. immediately comply with all requirements.
2. take such appropriate remedial or preventive
action as may be needed to properly address a
continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or termination of the
discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a
prerequisite to taking any other action against the
user.
Section 17A-36. Emergency Suspensions.
A. The Director may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever
such suspension is necessary in order to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or cause an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of
persons. The Director may also immediately suspend
a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation
of the POTW, or which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment.
1. any user notified of a suspension of its discharge
shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the Director shall take such
steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to
prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, and
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The Director shall allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City that
the period of endangerment has passed, unless
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES
July 2020
237
the termination proceedings set forth in Article II
are initiated against the user.
2. a user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for
any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent
any future occurrence to the Director prior to the
date of any show cause or termination hearing
under Article II.
B. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as requiring
a hearing prior to any emergency suspension under
this article. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted
as precluding or limiting the authority of the City to
take any action, including but not limited to other
enforcement actions, without issuing a notice.
Section 17A-37. Termination of Discharge.
A. In addition to those provisions in Section l 7A-306 of
this chapter, any user that violates the restrictions,
prohibitions, requirements, conditions, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued pursuant to this
chapter is subject to discharge termination.
Additionally, any user that violates the following is
subject to termination of discharge:
1. violation of wastewater discharge permit
conditions.
2. failure to accurately report the wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge.
3. failure to report significant changes in operations
or wastewater volume, constituents and
characteristics prior to discharge.

accordance with the City's enforcement response plan.
However, the City reserves the right to take other action
against any user when the circumstances warrant. Further,
the City is empowered to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user. These actions may
be taken concurrently.
ARTICLE IV. SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT
ACTION
Section 17A-91. Performance Bonds.
The Director may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply
with the provisions of this chapter, any orders, or a previous
wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City,
in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Director
to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
Section 17A-92. Liability Insurance.
The Director may decline to reissue a wastewater
discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply

Code governing such nuisances, including but not limited
to reimbursing the City for any costs incurred in removing,
abating or remedying said nuisance.
ARTICLE V. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO
DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
Section 17A-121. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional
and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards and/or local pretreatment
standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the industrial user. An upset does not
include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment
facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or intentional, careless or
improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards and/or local pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Paragraph (c) are
met.
C. An industrial user who wishes to establish the
affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate,
through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. an upset occurred and the industrial user can
identify the cause(s) of the upset
2. the facility was at the time· being operated in a
prudent and workmanlike manner and in
compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures.
3. the industrial user has submitted the following
information to the City within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the upset (if this information
is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
i. a description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance.
ii. the period of noncompliance, including
exact dates and times or, if not corrected,
the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue.
iii. steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate and prevent recurrence of the.
noncompliance.
iv. In an enforcement proceeding, the industrial
user seeking to establish the occurrence of
an upset shall have the burden of proof.
v. Industrial users will have the opportunity for
a judicial determination on any claim of
upset only in an enforcement action brought
for noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards and/or local
pretreatment standards.
vi. The industrial user shall control production
of all discharges to the extent necessary to
maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards and/or local
pretreatment standards upon reduction,
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES
July 2020
239
loss or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method
of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other
things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
Section 17A-122. General/Specific Prohibitions.
An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an
enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance
with the general and specific prohibitions of this chapter if
it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know
that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass-through or
interference and that either: (a) a local limit exists for each
pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass-through or interference, or (b) no local limit exists, but
the discharge did not change substantially in ' nature
or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the
City regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in
the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable
sludge use or disposal requirements.
Section 17A-123. Bypass.
A. For purposes of this section:
1. Bypass means the intentional diversion of waste
streams from any portion of an industrial user's
treatment facility.
2. Severe property damage means substantial
physical damage to property, damage to the
treatment facilities which causes the facilities to
become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence
of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in
production.
B. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur
which does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for
essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.
These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of
Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
C.
1. if an industrial user knows in advance of the need
for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
City, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass if possible.
2. an industrial user shall submit oral notice of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards to the City within 24
hours :from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written
submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass bas not been corrected, the anticipated
time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
reoccurrence of the bypass. The City may waive
the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D.
1. bypass is prohibited, and the City may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for
a bypass, unless:
i. bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury or severe property
damage.
ii. there were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal
periods of equipment downtime. This
condition is not satisfied if adequate backup
equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering
judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive
maintenance; and
iii. the industrial user submitted notices as
required under Paragraph (c) of this section.
2. the Director may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the
determines that the industrial user will meet the
three conditions listed in Paragraph (dXl) of this
section.
ARTICLE VI. CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC SEWERS
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Section 17A-151. Required.
A. The owners of all lots lying alongside or abutting upon
any alley or street upon which a lateral of the City's

sewer connection must be made as required, giving 30
days time in which to make the proper connection. If, after
30 days from the day of the service of said notice, the
proper connection has not been made, then no person
shall maintain or use any sewer connection not conforming
to the provisions hereof.
DIVISION 2. PERMIT AND INSPECTION
Section 17A-181. Required.
A. No person shall make or attempt to make any
connection to a sewer:
1. without first obtaining a sewer permit.
2. until the sewer connection has been properly
inspected as provided in this chapter.
B. If a sewer connection is made without a sewer permit
and without inspection, then said connection shall be
closed and disconnected from such sewer by order of
the Public Works Director.
Section 17A-182. Reimbursement of Assessment Paid
by City.
A. Whenever the construction cost of sanitary sewers
has been or may be levied and assessed against the
property abutting thereon, as provided by the laws of
the state, and the City has paid or may be liable to pay
such assessments in whole or in part from City funds,
then any owner or occupant of any property abutting
such sewers who makes application for permission to
tap such sewers shall not be issued a permit unless
he shall:
1. have paid to the City the amount of the
assessments that have been paid by the City
prior to the issuance of the permit.
2. agree in writing with the City that:
i. any unpaid or unmatured assessments
levied against the property shall be or
remain a lien against the property so long as
the assessments remain unpaid; and
ii. :from the date of the issuance of the permit
the unpaid assessments shall become and
remain a lien in the same manlier and form
as is provided for in levying assessments
against property abutting upon lateral
sewers under the laws of the state, as if the
same had been originally levied under the
laws of the state. Such lien shall remain in
force and effect until the assessments shall
be fully paid and satisfied as provided by the
statutes relating to the construction of lateral
sewers.
B. The property owner or occupant shall be required:
1. to pay the actual cost of the construction of the
sewer properly chargeable to the abutting
property, as provided under the laws of the state,
and any interest that the City has been required

use the sanitary sewer in the manner provided by the
existing ordinances of the City relating to such
connections.
Section 17A-183. Connections Where No Special
Assessment Made.
A. Whenever sanitary sewer mains or submains have
been constructed, and the City has paid charges in
whole or in part out of funds of the City, other than
those charges provided for in Section 17A- 182, and
when any owner or occupant of any property abutting
upon such sanitary sewer main or submain makes
application for connecting to such sewer with a private
line, no permit shall be issued to any abutting owner
or occupant until such owner or occupant shall have
paid to the City, prior to the issuance of such permit,
his proportionate share of the cost of such sanitary
sewer main or submain, which share, for each
residential tap, shall be as established in Chapter 60,
the General Schedule of Fees, and for each
nonresident tap shall be 1/2 of the cost of the line
abutting the property.
B. Such cost to the nonresidential property owner or
occupant shall be determined by the following
formula:
1. cost of the project minus lift stations and plant
cost, divided by the product of the linear feet of
the project times pipe diameter in inches, all
multiplied by half the number of linear feet
abutting the main or submain times eight inches.
2. where an owner or occupant has a large lot in
excess of 150 linear feet abutting on a sanitary
sewer main or submain, the lot size shall be
computed on the basis of a maximum lot size of
150 linear feet on such main or submain.
3. where any owner of property abutting upon a
proposed sanitary sewer main or submain
donates to the City an easement or right-of-way
20 feet in width over all his property abutting the
alignment of the main or submain and said
donation is 50 feet or fraction thereof in length,
such owner for said proposed sewer shall in
exchange for the donated easements or right-ofway
receive a $100.00 credit for the first 50 feet
or fraction thereof in length of donated easement

or right-of- way toward reducing the amount due
for the connection permit charges set forth
herein. This credit shall expire if not exercised by
the donor prior to his transfer of the fee to said
property.
C. The costs herein provided shall be in addition to all
other fees.
DIVISION 3. STATE PERMIT EXEMPTION
Section 17A-190. Municipal Systems.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this division is to quality for
exemptions from the Department of Environmental
Quality construction permit requirement for
wastewater collection systems, pursuant to Chapter
655 of the Oklahoma Administrative Code, entitled
"Water Pollution Control Construction Standards,"
adopted by the Board of Environmental Quality on
November 24, 1993..Gravity sewage construction
lines not larger than 12 inches in diameter and small
sewage treatment systems are the only systems
eligible for the exemption from the requirements of
issuance of State construction permits, provided all
systems constructed in whole or in part with funds
from the United States EPA and/or with funds
administered by the DEQ shall not be exempt from
the requirement of obtaining a State construction
permit.
B. System and connection requirement. All municipal
systems and any connection thereto must be
constructed in compliance with the applicable
regulations, rules and requirements of the DEQ or the
regulations, rules and requirements regulations of the
City, whichever standard is more stringent.
C. Approval required All sewer line extensions to sewage
treatment plants, lift stations, and interceptor lines
must be approved by the Director prior to actual
construction.
D. Approval withheld Approval shall be withheld if the
sewa.gt treatment plant, lift station or interceptor line
to which the sewer line extension is to attach has
reached or, with the addition of the proposed sewer
line extension, would reach treatment or hydraulic
capacities. Further, approval shall also be withheld if
the sewer line extension does not meet or exceed the
standards of the DEQ and the City, or may be withheld
for any other reason.
E. Review and approval of plans and specifications for
sewage collection systems. Prior to construction,
plans and specifications for sewage collection
systems must be reviewed, approved and signed by a
professional engineer licensed by the State of
Oklahoma and designated by the Director as being in
responsible charge of connections to the sewage
collection system for the municipality. All approved
plans and specifications must be signed by said
designated professional engineer indicating approval
to proceed with construction in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications. No sewage
collection system construction shall proceed until
plans and specifications have been reviewed and
approved in this manner.
F. Listing of projects. The Director must supply DEQ with
one copy of all such approved plans and
specifications together with a listing of all approved
projects monthly, on or before the fifteenth of each
month following approval by the plans and
specifications for each project. The listing shall
include the name, location and date of approval of
each such project.
G. Inspection. The City Engineer shall inspect each
approved project and shall prohibit commencement of
any sewage collection systems construction or
connection prior to approval of plans and

sewer line extension bring a connected lift station,
interceptor line or sewage treatment plant to its design
capacity, the construction or connection of the
proposed sewer line extension may still be allowed, to
the extent approved by DEQ, under the following
circumstances:
1. the City must apply, in writing, to the DEQ for a
variance allowing the specified construction to
proceed within the area.
2. the application must detail what the City will do to
ensure that the construction or connection will
not worsen problems or treatment capacity, flow
or bypassing of sewage.
3. the application must include timetables for
correcting any stated problems, prior to the
connection of any additional loadings or flows, as
a result of the construction for which approval is
sought.
4. the application, if approved, will become a
condition of any permit issued for such
construction by the DEQ.
5. approval of construction in an area at design
capacity, which has not received such a variance
from the DEQ, will result in revocation of the
City's overall sewer line permit exemption status,
as provided by the rules and regulations of DEQ.
Section 17A-191. Small Sewage Treatment Systems.
Small sewage treatment systems may be installed, without
the necessity of obtaining a permit from the DEQ, under
the following circumstances:

DISCHARGES
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Section 17A-211. Prohibited Discharge Standards.
A. No industrial user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater
which causes pass-through or interference. These
general prohibitions apply to all industrial users of the
POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical
pretreatment standards or any other National, State or
local pretreatment standards or requirements.
Furthermore, no industrial user may contribute the
following substances to the PO'IW:
1. pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard
in the municipal wastewater collection and
POTW, including, but not limited to, waste
streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than
140 degrees (60 degrees Celsius) using the test
methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21, as
amended.
2. any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or
more than 10.S, or otherwise causing corrosive
structural damage to the POTW or equipment, or
endangering City personnel.
3. solid or viscous substances in amounts which will
cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW
resulting in interference, but in no case solids
greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension.
4. any wastewater containing pollutants, including
oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or
pollutant concentration which, either singly or by
interaction with other pollutants, will cause
interference with either the POTW, or any
wastewater treatment or sludge process, or
which will constitute a hazard to humans or
animals.
5. any wastewater having a temperature greater
than 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees
Celsius), or which will inhibit biological activity in
the treatment plant resulting in interference, but
in no case wastewater which causes the
temperature at the introduction into the treatment
plant to exceed 104 degrees (40 degrees
Celsius).
6. any discharge of nonpolar or saturated oil, nonbiodegradable
cutting oil, or products of mineral
oil origin which is greater than 100 mg/I or in

Facilities or changes in environmental
requirements.
2. Maximum wastewater impurity concentration
limits.
Maximum TDS Concentration = 6,000mg/L
Maximum Chloride Concentration = 1,000 mg/L
Maximum Sulfate Concentration= 1,000 mg/L
F. Special conditions for City users and extrajurisdictional
users.
1. permittee shall be responsible for any damage to
City facilities caused by or contributed to by the
discharge of pollutants or impurities from
permittee's facility. In order to minimize damage
to City's facilities, the permittee may be required
through surcharges or permit fees to pay for
modifications to City facilities to minimize the
impact of JDS, chlorides, and sulfates. These
impacts may include, but not limited to include
the design of a diffuser for rapid mixing of high
TDS wastewater into the City's wastewater
treatment and collection facilities, which will
minimize damage from corrosion and the primary
clarifier from density interference with the
removal of BOD and TSS.
2. in accordance with the City's discharge control
policy, the permittee is being informed that at
some time in the future additional pretreatment
may be required to control the discharge of TDS,
chloride, and sulfate from permittee's facility.
These revised permit requirements will contain a
compliance schedule with milestones for design
and installation of pretreatment facilities;
3. permittee shall provide, in its permit application,
estimates of water requirements and wastewater
based on operational controls at its facility.
Permit limits have been developed for the
permittee as not exceed concentration limits and
monthly average mass limits. These not to
exceed limits will allow the permittee flexibility in
the design and operation of its facility within
these limits. The permittee must be in
compliance with discharge limits at all times. If
the permittee must be in compliance with
discharge limits at all times. If the permittee
desires to change discharge flow and/or strength
above its established permit limits, a new permit
application shall be submitted to the City for
review and approval prior to any changes.
4. the City is under no obligation to grant approval
of a revised permit that increases flow or
strength. The City reserves the right to make any
individual perm.it limits or discharge standards
more restrictive. The City reserves the right to
establish discharge standards and permit limits
that are more restrictive for outside City users
than for inside City users. The City reserves the
right to make any individual permit limits or
discharge standards more restrictive in order to
meet any changes or modifications to State or
Federal law or as it may determine to be in the
best interest of The City of Piedmont and its
users.
Section 17A-215. City’s Right of Revision.
The City reserves the right to establish by ordinance or in
wastewater discharge permits more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW if deemed
necessary to comply with the objectives presented in this
chapter or the general and specific prohibitions in this
chapter.
Section 17A-216. Special Agreements.
A. The City reserves the right to enter into special
agreements with industrial users setting out special
terms under which they may discharge to the POTW.
In no case will a special agreement waive compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement.
However, the industrial user may request a net gross
adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance
with 40 CFR 403.15, as amended. The industrial user
may also request a variance from the categorical
pretreatment standard from the EPA. Such a request
will be approved only if the industrial user can prove
that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally
different from the factors considered by the EPA when
establishing that pretreatment standard. An industrial
user requesting a fundamentally different factor
variance must comply with the procedural and
substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, as
amended.
B. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, that
contain the substances or possess the characteristics
enumerated in this chapter and that in the judgment of
the Director may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater works, processes, equipment, or
receiving waters, or that otherwise create a hazard to
life or constitute a health hazard or public nuisance,
the Director may:
1. reject the wastes;
2. require pretreatment to an acceptable condition
for discharge to the public sewers;
3. require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; and/or
4. require a variance agreement to treat such
wastes; said agreement shall remain in effect for
a period of one year and shall be renewable at
the discretion of the Director. Payment to cover
the cost of handling and treating the wastes shall
be under the provision of Chapter 60 the General
Schedule of Fees.

and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Director and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and
laws.
Section 17A-217. Dilution.
No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process
water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to
achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment
standard or requirement. The Director may impose mass
limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements,
or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is
appropriate.
Section 17A-218. Waivers and Variances.
A. An Industrial User may submit to the Director of the
Utility a written request for a waiver or variance of
specific pollutant limitations. All requests will be
evaluated by the Director and, on a case-bycase
basis, a determination will be made within 60 days of
receipt of the request. All limits shall be met until the
Industrial User receives written approval from the
Director granting the request The Director may deny
any request for a waiver. The following conditions
shall apply to all waivers granted:
1. waiver of applicable Federal Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or the pollutants
outlined in Paragraph l 7A-214 (a) is prohibited.
2. capacity at the Wastewater Treatment Facility
must be available for the requested pollutant(s).
3. the duration of the waiver will be specified and
shall in no event exceed five years. Application
for renewal of the waiver must be made at least
60 days before expiration.
4. any violation of the Industrial Waste Discharge
Permit or Special Use Authorization conditions
may result in the immediate revocation of the
waiver.
5. the waiver will be issued to a specific user for a
specific operation. A waiver shall not be
reassigned, 1ransferred, or sold to a new owner,
new user, different premise5> or a new or
changed operation without the approval of the
Director.
6. notwithstanding the language in any individual
permit or any individual waiver, all permit waivers
are subject to revocation or modification by the
Director subsequent to any periodic review of the
technically based local limits.
7. the Industrial User will bear the cost of any
testing or evaluation deemed necessary by the
Director in evaluating any waiver or the impact of
any waiver or class of waivers upon the POTW.
B. Upon the request of any permitted commercial
laundry, the Director may grant a variance in the
discharge requirements to perm.it discharge up to a
pH of 11.0. Notwithstanding the language in any
individual permit or any individual variance, all permit
variances are subject to revocation or modification by

limitations as specified in this chapter and by the
Federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities
required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable
to the City shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the City for review,
and shall be acceptable to the City before construction
of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the
provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in
the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall
be reported to and be acceptable to the City prior to
the user's initiation of the changes.
B. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment
standards shall be made available to officials of the
Environmental Protection Agency or approval
authority upon request.
Section 17A-242. Additional Pretreatment Measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may
require industrial users to restrict their discharge peak
flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be
discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage
waste streams from industrial waste streams, and
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance
with the requirements of this article.
B. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided by
the user when, in the opinion of the director, the
interceptors are necessary for the proper handling of
wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease
and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall
not be required for residential users. All interceptor
units shall be of type and capacity approved by the
director and shall be so located to be easily accessible

discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be
provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities
and operating procedures to provide this protection
shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be
approved by the City before construction of the facility.
All existing users shall complete such within 90 days
of the initial approval of this chapter by the
Environmental Protection Agency. No user who
commences contribution to the municipal wastewater
collection and treatment system after the initial
approval of this article by the Environmental
Protection Agency shall be permitted to introduce
substances into the system until accidental discharge
procedures have been approved by the City. Review
and approval of such plans and operating procedures
shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of
an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the
user to immediately telephone and notify the Director
or his designated representative of the incident The
notification shall include date, time, and location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.
B. Written notice. Within five days following an accidental
discharge, the user shall submit to the Director a
detailed written report describing the cause of the
discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense,
loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred
as a result of damage to the municipal wastewater
collection and treatment system, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties
or other liability which may be imposed by this chapter
or other applicable law. ·
C. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently
posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent
and accessible place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers

A. Septic tank waste may be accepted into the POTW at
a designated receiving structure within the treatment
plant area, and at such times as are established by
the Director, provided such wastes do not violate the
provisions of this chapter or any other requirements
established or adopted by the City. Wastewater
discharge permits for individual vehicles to use such
facilities shall be issued by the Director;
B. The discharge of hauled industrial wastes as
"industrial septage" requires prior approval and a
wastewater discharge permit from the City. The
Director shall have authority to prohibit the disposal of
such wastes, if such disposal would interfere with the
treatment plant operation. Waste haulers are subject
to all other sections of this chapter.
C. Fees for dumping septage will be established as part

Section 17A-305. Wastewater Discharge Permit
Transfer.
A. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific
user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold
to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a
new or changed operation without the approval of the
director. Changes in operation or processing which
result in a change in the permit conditions, limitations,
or requirements will require a new permit, and the
existing permit will not be reassigned. Any succeeding
owner or user shall comply with the terms and
conditions of the existing permit
B. Wastewater discharge permits may be reassigned or
transferred to a new owner and/or operator only if the
permittee gives at least 30 days advance notice to the
director, the permit premises have not changed, the
processes and operations at the premises have not
changed, and the director approves the wastewater
discharge permit transfer. The notice to the director
must include a written certification by the new owner
and/or operator which:
1. states that the new owner and/or operator have
no immediate intent to change the facility's
operations and processes. ·
2. identifies the specific date on which the transfer
is to occur.
3. acknowledges full responsibility for complying
with the existing wastewater discharge permit'
C. Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders
the wastewater discharge permit voidable on the date
of the facility transfer.
Section 17A-306. Wastewater Discharge Permit
Revocation.
A. Wastewater discharge permits may be revoked for the
following reasons:

certified mail of any proposed changes in his permit at least
30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes
or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable
time schedule for compliance. Upon determination by the
Director that a user's contribution to the POTW has
changed or increased, the Director may require the user to
reapply for a permit or amend the user's existing permit.
Section 17A-309. Potential to Discharge Permit
Required.
All categorical and non-categorical users who claim no
process discharge, total recycling of categorical and/or
non-categorical waste or the separate disposal of all
categorical and/or non-categorical wastes are hereby
required to obtain a permit for potential to discharge.
Provided however, that should the Director determine that
the categorical or non-categorical user is discharging
categorical or non-categorical waste into the POTW then
the potential to discharge permit shall be revoked and the
user shall be required to obtain the appropriate permit and
meet the applicable requirements of this chapter. A fee for

shall submit to the control authority at least once every
six months (on dates specified by the control
authority) a description of the nature, concentration,
and flow of the pollutants required to be reported by
the control authority. These reports shall be based on
sampling and analysis performed in the period
covered by the report, and performed in accordance
with the techniques described in 40 CPR 136, and
amendments thereto. Where 40 CFR 136, does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Administrator
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical
techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analysis shall be performed
by using validated analytical methods or any other
applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the City or other
persons, approved by the Administrator. This
sampling and analysis may be performed by the
control authority in lieu of the significant noncategorical
industrial user. Where the City itself
collects all the information required for1he report, the
non-categorical significant industrial user will not be
required to submit the report.
B. All industrial users not subject to categorical
pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the City as the Director may
require.
Section 17A-338. Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling

hazardous waste shall notify the City, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director and
state hazardous waste authorities (ODEQ) in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which,
if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CPR 261, as amended. Such notification
must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CPR 261, as amended, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous,
batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more
than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month
to the City, the notification shall also contain the
following information to the extent such information is
known and readily available to the industrial user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained
in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste
stream discharged during that calendar month, and an
estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following
12 months. All notifications must take place no later
than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any
notification under this paragraph need be submitted
only once for each h8.2'Jlltlous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed discharges must be
submitted to the Director. The notification requirement
in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported under the self-monitoring requirements of
this chapter.
B. Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of this
article during a calendar month in which they
discharge no more than 1S kilograms of hazardous
wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), as amended. Discharge of more than 1S
kilograms of non-acute b.a7.ardous wastes in a
calendar month. or of any quantity of acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
C. Subsequent months during which the industrial user
discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
D. In the case of any new regulations under§ 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance
as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify
the City, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Waste Division Director and state hazardous waste
authorities of the discharge of such substance within
90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
E. In the case of any notification made under this section,
the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in
place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.

sufficient, wastewater compliance samples shall he a
composite sample of at least four (4) grab samples of
equal proportion taken at equal time intervals during a
user’s normal production day. The Director may use
production records and flow data to establish a user’s
normal production day, and may require grab samples
to be taken at greater intervals to prepare a composite
sample. An instantaneous grab sample shall be used
to determine compliance on batch or intermittent
discharge. The monthly average limit shall apply to
batch or intermittent discharge in determining user
compliance.
B. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH. cyanide,
phenols, toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic
chemicals must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.

subsequent year. Said first four months shall be the
four consecutive monthly billing periods or two
consecutive bimonthly billing periods each and every
day of which falls within the six months between
October 1 and March 31. The winter period
consumption base shall be recalculated annually and
shall become effective after the last billing period of
the base setting months.
B. New accounts. If a residential domestic sewer user
does not have a winter period consumption base at
his current residential or housekeeping unit. for
whatever reason, and had not relocated within the
service area as provided in Subsection (3), a winter
period consumption base of 7,000 gallons shall be
assigned for his new residential or housekeeping unit
until a winter period consumption base, as provided in

provisions of section 18-46 of this chapter, any person
desiring to effect an earth change shall file a written
application for an earth change permit with the city
engineer. Any area affected by the earth change and
within the jurisdictional area of the City of Piedmont
must be included in the permit application.
Applications shall be in such form and content as the
city engineer shall establish, and shall be
accompanied by the payment of a permit fee in
accordance with the fee schedule adopted by the city
council. The site plan and design standards
established by the applicant and approved by the city

permit application shall contain the following
information:
1. The name and address of the legal owner of the
property for which the permit is requested;
2. A vicinity sketch and boundary line survey of the
site for which the permit is requested, including a
legal description of such property;
3. Site drawings indicating each separate land area
to be excavated, filled, graded, or leveled, the
finished depth of each separate land cut or fill,
the present and future (as completed) points of
entry and discharge for surface water on the
subject property, and identification of all
temporary or permanent structures or other
devices to be erected or established for the
PIEDMONT CODE OF ORDINANCES
July 2020
275
purpose of controlling or regulating surface
water, erosion and sedimentation on such
property;
4. The applicant's plans for controlling on-site
erosion and off-site sedimentation for the
purpose of preventing the deposit of sediment
from the lot or tract under application upon any
other off-site public or private property or
watercourse during all phases of project
construction; and
5. The applicant's plans for receipt of surface water
on the property under consideration and
discharge of surface water from this property
during periods of construction, and a statement
specifying the anticipated time period for the
completion of all drainage improvements.
If the city engineer is unable to determine from the
application submitted that it meets the policies and
standards governing the issuance of the requested
permit, the city engineer shall request the applicant in
writing to furnish such additional information which
may be essential to such determination.
C. Duplication of information. No applicant for an earth
change permit shall be required to resubmit any
documents, drawings, or other information which was
previously submitted by such applicant in conjunction
with the processing of any drainage plan previously
accepted by the city engineer.
Section 18-404. Expiration; Extension for Additional
Year.
An earth change permit shall expire one year after the date
it is issued. Earth change permits may be extended for an
additional year following review by the city engineer.
Section 18-405. As-Built Drawings.
A. As-built drawings, clearly showing any changes from
the approved earth change permit, shall be submitted
to the city engineer upon completion of construction of
the earth change. The as-built drawings shall be
reviewed by the city engineer. If the submitted "asbuilt"
drawings cannot be accepted, the applicant and
certifying engineer if one was used to obtain the
permit, shall be advised in writing of the reasons for
their disapproval. "As-built" drawings must be
accepted prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy and the use or occupancy of a site,
development, or other improvement.
B. The city engineer may waive the requirement for asbuilt
drawings on minor, residential projects. However,
such a waiver shall not relieve the applicant from the
responsibility of completing the earth change in
accordance with the accepted earth change permit.
Section 18-406. Policies.
The issuance of earth change permits shall be governed
by the following policies of the city:
A. No earth change shall be permitted which creates a
public hazard upon any property within the city
through the obstruction, impairment, sedimentation,
blockage or alteration of any drainage facility.

l5 Curbs and Curbed Sections
as are often used on urban facilities to control
drainage, delineate the pavement edge, channelize
vehicular movements, control access, limit right-ofway
needs, provide separation between vehicles
and pedestrians and present an attractive
appearance. In urban areas, curbs have a major
benefit in containing the drainage within the
pavement area and in channelizing or controlling
traffic into and out of adjacent properties.
8. 1. 5. 1 Warrants ( Curbed Section)
Selecting a curbed section or uncurbed section
depends upon many variables, including vehicular
speeds, urban/rural location, drainage and
construction costs. The following discusses those
factors which will determine whether or not a
curbed section is warranted:
1. Urban Location. Because of restricted
right- of -way and other constraints, curbed
sections are typically used in urban areas.
Suburban Location. Where design speeds
50 mph or more, uncurbed sections are
typically used. The exceptions listed under #3 for
rural locations also apply to- high-speed suburban
facilities. Where design speeds are less than 50
mph, the use of a curbed or uncurbed section will
be made on a project-by:project basis considering
right-of-way constraints, drainage, pedestrian
activity, channelization needs, driveway access
control, etc.
3. Rural Location. The use of curbs on rural
highways is usually limited to conditions such as
the followinga.
ollowing
a. where a raised median is present;
b. where there is sufficient development
along the highway and there is a need to
channelize traffic into and out of
properties;
C. where it is absolutely necessary to control
drainage;
d where restricted right-of-way provides no
room for roadside ditches; and/or
C. at other sites ( e.g., interchanges,
intersections) as determined by the
Geometric Design Branch.
14- 16. 11
8. 1. 5. 2 Curb Types
There are two basic types of curbs - mountable and
barrier. By definition, mountable curbs have a
height of6 inches or less with a face no steeper
than I horizontal to 3 vertical. Barrier curbs may
range in height between 6 inches and 12 inches
with a face steeper than i horizontal to 3 vertical.
Figure 8. 1C presents the basic curb types used by
ODOT. The ODOT Standard Drawings provide
additional information on the design details and
placement for the different curb types. This
includes details on driveway radii, construction
items, etc.
8. 1. 5.3 Curb Type Selection
The following discusses those factors which should
be considered when selecting a curb type:
1. Material. Concrete curbs are typically used.
2. Outside Curb. Barrier curbs are typically
used on the outside of the roadway.
3. Raised Medians. Mountable curbs are
typically used with raised medians.
4. S Reeds. Barrier curbs may be used where
the design speed is 45 mph or less. Mountable
curbs may be used at any design speed.
5. Vehicular Encroachment. Where sidewalks,
roadside appurtenances, etc., are present, it is
desirable to restrict vehicular encroachment beyond
the curb. Although no curb type will prohibit
encroachments, barrier curbs are superior to
mountable curbs. Where vehicular encroachment
is permissible or even desirable, mountable curbs
should be used.
6. Sidewalks. Where sidewalks are present,
barrier curbs are typically used.
7. Local Practices. Where local practices differ
from ODOT practices, ODOT criteria should
prevail on State highways. On non -State highways,
local practices will normally govern.

the increased time granted by the City for the completion of said Work, the sum per day given in
the following schedule, unless specified otherwise in the Bid or Special Provisions, will be
deducted from the monies due the Contractor, not as a penalty but as liquidated damages.
Minimum Amount of Contract Amount of Liquidated Damages per Day
Less than $100,000 $ 300.00
100.000 and less than $ 1, 000,000 $ 400.00
1, 000,000 and over $500.00 or up to 0.052% of the contract price per day
The sum of money thus deducted for such delay, failure or non -completion is not to be
considered as a penalty but should be deemed, taken and treated as reasonable liquidated
damages since it would be impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages.
111. 10 — TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS

or periods as he may deem necessary, due to unsuitable weather or such other conditions as

When Work is suspended for any one of the causes itemi2ed above, or for any other cause or
causes, the Contractor shall discontinue the Work or such part thereof as the Council shall
designate, whereupon the Surety may, at its option, assume the Contract or that portion thereof
which the Council has ordered the Contractor to discontinue and may perform the same or may,
with the written consent of the City Engineer, approved by the Council, sublet the Work or
portion of the Work so taken over, provided, however, that the Surety shall exercise its option, if
at all, within two (2) weeks after the written notice to discontinue Work has been served upon
the Contractor and upon the Surety or its authorized agent. The Surety, in such event, shall
assume the Contractor's place in all respects and shall be paid by the City for all Work
performed by it in accordance with the terms of the Contract and, if the Surety, under the
provisions hereof, shall assume said entire Contract, all monies remaining due the Contrador at

the Work progresses, subject to all the terms of the Contrail.
In the event the Surety does not, within the time herein before specified, exercise its right and .
option to assume the Contract, or that portion thereof which the Council has ordered the
Contractor to discontinue, then the City shall have the power to complete by Contract or
otherwise as it may determine, the Work herein described, or such part thereof as it may deem
necessary and the Contractor hereby agrees that the City shall have the right to take
possession of and use any of the materials, plant, tools, equipment, supplies and property of
every kind provided by the Contractor for the purpose of the Contractor' s Work and to procure
other tools, equipment and materials for the completion of the same and to charge to the
account of the Contractor the expense of said Contract for labor, materials, tools, equipment
and expenses incident thereto. The expense so charged shall be deducted by the City. out of
such monies as may be due or may at any time thereafter become due the Contractor under
and by virtue of the Contract or any part thereof. The City shall not be required to obtain the
lowest Bid for the Work of completing the Contract but the expense to be deducted shall be the
actual cost of such Work. In case such expense is less than the sum which would have been
payable under the Contract, if the same had been completed by the Contractor, the balance
shall operate as liquidated damages, as herein above set out. In case such expense shall
exceed the amount which would have been payable under the Contract, if the same had been
completed by the Contradar then the Contractor and the Contrador' s Surety shall pay the
amount of such excess to the City on notice from the Council of the excess so due. When any
particular part of the Work is being carried on by the City by Contract or otherwise under the
provisions of this section, the Contractor shall continue the remainder of the Work in conformity
with the terms of the Contract and in such manner as in no wise to hinder or interfere with the

I. Policies
A. Drainage polices.
1. Stormwater drainage system design
The stormwater drainage system shall be designed to pass the peak stormwater
run-off received from upstream and from the subject property for storms with
durations up to twenty-four (24) hours and return periods of up to one hundred
100) years.
2. Development impact on flooding
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be constructed such
that it will not increase the frequency of flooding or the depth of inundation of
structures during the 50% (2 -year), 20% (5 -year), 10% (10 -year), 2% ( 50 -year),
and 1% (100 -year) flood events. A commercial or mufti -family development site
under 5 acres shall be constructed such that it will not increase the frequency of
flooding or the depth of inundation of structures during the 20%15 -year), 10%
10 -year), 2% ( 50 -year), and 1% ( 100 -year) flood events.
3. . Development impact on peak flow rates
Peak flows shall not be increased at any location, upstream or downstream of
any development for the 50% (2 -year), 20% (5 -year), 10% (10 -year), 2% ( 50 -
year), and 1% ( 100 -year) flood events unless approved by the City Engineer and
provisions of Sec 1.A.(4) are met. In order to compare the effects of the project,
existing conditions shall be computed and compared to the "with proposed
project" conditions at all points of discharge from the project and at points
downstream as specified by the City Engineer to ensure that there is no Increase
in the discharges.
4. Offsite drainage requirements
The City may require improvements, provision of drainage easements, provision
of improvements, agreements, and/ or easements beyond the boundaries of the
development. The required construction of offsite drainage improvements are:
a. to facilitate flow of storm water from or through the property,
b. to avoid damage from changed runoff conditions,
c. to provide continuous improvement of the overall storm drainage
system, and
d. to accommodate other drainage conditions or requirements.
Where storm water runoff flows require the logical extension of any street and
its associated drainage In order to prevent flooding, ponding, or uncontrolled
runoff the extension shall be provided by the developer.
5. Stormwater management control
1
No action shall be taken in any land Improvement by any developer, contractor,
or tot owner that will alter or otherwise change existing designed and installed
storm water management control, nor shall any action be taken on existing
property that shall adversely affect storm water runoff in any manner contrary
to the provisions of this Chapter. Whether temporary In nature to service only
the construction phase of development, or whether a combination of temporary
and permanent serving a dual purpose, the first techniques to be employed in
the development of a site shall be the management of storm water and drainage
in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Chapter.
6. Completion of stormwater facilities
Developers shall complete construction of stormwater facilities to control runoff
and erosion prior to issuance of any building permits.
7. Use of Design Criteria
Regulation of peak flows to allowable levels, as determined by subparagraphs (2)
and (3) herein, shall be achieved by on-site or off-site storage and/ or other water
management facilities as provided in these Drainage Criteria.
8. Downstream improvements and easements
Subject to requirements in the City Drainage Standards for a drainage plan or
earth change permit, downstream conveyance may be improved or easements
obtained for inundated areas to compensate for increased flow depths if such
improvements comply with the policies of this chapter.
9. Concentration of flows
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be constructed so that
it will not cause harm to other properties as a result of concentrating flows.
10. Requirement for hydraulic analyses
If a tract of land under development has a drainage basin of 10 acres or larger
within its boundary, then a hydraulic (backwater) analysis of the existing and
proposed drainage system shall be provided to show any impact the proposed
development has on the floodplain area and elevation.
11. Compensatory storage
Compensation shall be provided for filling or development which diminishes the
flood storage capacity of the flood plain area from drainage basins of 10 acres or
larger, by providing compensatory storage or other method as determined by
the City Engineer.
12. Use of natural channels and streams
The design of any development shall provide for the maximum use of open
channels and natural streams for drainage areas of 40 acres or more, and
detention storage to control runoff rates. Natural drainage channels and
techniques shall be given priority consideration in preparation of stormwater
drainage system designs and shall be designed or improved as an integral part of
the landscape of the area In accordance with the following guidelines:
2
a) Drainage channel Improvements shall be developed and designed
to preserve and protect trees and other worthy botanical and geological
features to the maximum extent practicable. Vegetation shall be
preserved when feasible. Riparian habitat shall be maintained when
feasible, during improvements
bj Wherever channel improvements are required to accommodate
storm runoff in a specified manner, the designs shall provide maximum
practical utilization of turf, sodding, and natural ground surface
protection techniques in order to protect the environment by reducing
erosion potential.
C) Water quality control measures shall be incorporated into
stormwater management designs, subject to approval of the City
Engineer. Additionally, impacts on receiving water quality shall be
assessed for all flood management projects.
d) The City Engineer may require open channels for other
drainageways for just cause.
13. Open section roads and borrow ditches
Open section roads and bar ditches may be used In Zoning Districts A- 1, RE, RE -1,
1- 2, 1- 3 or in developments where the road frontage for every lot is at least 145
i'\ feet. The conditions identified in Section V.C.7.
14. Storm sewer requirements
Storm sewers shall be used for all developments wherein the conditions given in
this manual for use of open section roads are not met. Storm sewers may be
used in any development at the developer' s discretion and may be required by
the City Engineer where there are no viable alternatives to fit the site or
geographic conditions. Storm sewers may be used to alleviate existing drainage
problems, subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Open ditches may be
used at the discretion of the qty Engineer in specific locations where green
solutions are more desirable within the maintenance requirements of the City.
8. Erosion andsediment control policies.
1. Requirements for construction
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be designed,
constructed and completed in a manner which minimizes the exposure of bare
earth to precipitation. Contractor shall file NOI, develop SWPPP and otherwise
comply with applicable local, state, or federal regulations. Contractor shall
provide a copy of the NOI and SWPPP to the city.
2. Minimize sediment -related pollution
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be constructed in a
manner that will minimize soil dispersal, sedimentation, erosion, or other similar
forms of pollution:
3
a) From any surface of the site into drainage channel provided or
created within the development,
b) From the site into drainage channels adjacent to and remote from
the site.
3. Sedimentation facilities
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be constructed only if
appropriate sedimentation facilities are installed and maintained throughout the
construction period.
4_ Hest Management Practices
All development, redevelopment, and earth changes shall be accompanied by
Hest Management Practices for controlling sediment and erosion so as to
minimize the amount of sediment leaving the site.
General Requirements
A. tot Drainage

effective, existing, and proposed conditions hydraulic models shall be submitted
to the city for review. The City may request any other analysis or documentation
deemed necessary to demonstrate that the project is in compliance with the City
Flood Damage Reduction ordinance and requirements of the NFIP. The City may
require a CLOMR for any project if needed to ensure compliance with the NFIP.
4. LOMR requirements
A LOMR is required as a follow-up to the CLOMR, or if any work has been
completed within the designated floodway, or if the project requires any change
in the effective hydraulic model, the delineated 1% ( 100 -year) floodplain, or the
effective flood profiles. No occupancy permits will be approved until the LOMR is
approved by the City for submittal to FEMA.
5. Mapping requirements

H. Design Standards - Stormwater Detention facilities
1. General Design Criteria
All calculations and plans for detention facilities shall be presented to the
CITY for review and approval. Information submitted shall include:
a) inflow and outflow hydrographs.
b) A comparison of the pre -project and with -project peak discharges
at the point(s) of discharge from the development and at points
downstream as required by the City Engineer.
c) Elevation -Storage -Discharge relationships.
d) Discharge rating curves for each component of the outflow
structure.
e) Taiiwater rating curves at the outlet. Tailwater shall be considered
when designing the outlet structure.
f) Erosion protection measures at the outlets and spillway.
g) Embankment design in accordance with OWN guidelines,
including slope protection in case of overtopping, slope stability, and
maintenance access. _
10- N,
h) Multiple use plans (parks, playgrounds, sports fields, etc.).
31
i) Trash rack design.
2. On -Site Stormwater Detention
a) On-site detention facilities shall shown to be effective in
controlling the peak discharges from the development immediately
downstream of the development.
b) The volume of on-site detention required is calculated by
comparing the total runoff volume, in acre-feet, of the existing condition
1% (100 -year) flood with the volume of the proposed conditions 1% ( 100 -
year) flood. The comparison is made using the existing conditions and
proposed conditions hydrographs, calculated as specified in Section V -B
and subsections.. The Modified Rational Method may be used to
determine detention volume required for a single, homogeneous
watershed no larger than 40 acres or with a time of concentration of no
more than 15 minutes. The detention must discharge directly off-site to
a borrow ditch or other major storm drainage component. Hydrograph
methods shall be used if the discharge from the detention is to be
combined with discharge from another sub -watershed for purposes of
routing through or off the site or sizing downstream structures.
C) On-site detention facilities shall be designed so that there is no
increase in the peak discharge from any point of the development during
the 50% (2 -year), 20% (5 -year), 10% (10 -year), 2% (50 -year), and 1% ( 100-
year) flood events. This applies at the point(s) of discharge from the
development as well as at points downstream, as required by the City
Engineer.
d) The erosive effects of the increased runoff volume from the onsite
detention facility shall be mitigated by armoring the stream bank
downstream.
e) Mitigation for other water quality impacts of the urban runoff
leaving the on-site detention facility shall be provided.
3. Design Standards for Open Space Detention
a) All earth slopes and areas subject to erosion, such as, adjacent to
trickle channels, inlet structures, and outlet structures, shall be slab
sodded with Bermuda sod or protected with other erosion control
measures. All other earth surfaces, within the area designated for
detention pond site, shall have an established growth of Bermuda grass
or other approved species. All grass covered areas shall be fertilized, to
current recommendations, watered and in an established growing
condition prior to completion and approval of the detention pond.
b) Detention facilities shall be environmentally sound and
compatible with the area ( neighborhood).Where feasible, multiple uses
for the facilities should be established.
32
c) The city will accept dedication and maintenance responsibilities
for drainage and detention facilities on a case-by-case basis under
advisement of the City Attorney and Engineer. Otherwise, the
maintenance responsibility shall belong to the private sector.*A written
agreement between the development and the City defining the
maintenance requirements and responsible parties shall be made prior to
the development's acceptance by the City.
4. Design Standards for Parking Lot Detention
a) Parking lot detention may be used on properties that do not
receive offsite water.
b) The maximum depth in the detention pond shall be 12 inches,
occurring during the 1% (100 -year) storm.
c) The total flooded area during the 100 -year storm shall not exceed
25% of the parking areas and drives.
d) The unit volume curves included herein may be used to design the
outlet if a two-stage weir is used.
e) The 20% (5 -year) storm must completely fill the bottom 6 inches
up to the first weir.
f) The 1% ( 10D -year) volume must fill the entire 12 -inch depth of
water.
g) There must be a 6 -inch drop off from the outlet elevation to the
ground immediately downstream.

Vt. Green Development
A. The City encourages developers to incorporate stormwater management techniques
that include water quality benefits, also known as " Green infrastructure" or "tow
Impact Development."
S. Specific structural requirements of this manual, such as requirements for concrete
liners, may be waived by the City Engineer to accommodate use of low impact
development techniques. In no rase will any requirements dealing with off-site,
upstream, or downstream impacts be waived.
C. Proposals for Green Development shall be presented to the City as an application for a
Planned Unit Development (PUD). The PUD design statement shall include specific

AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING AND IMPOSING A NEW DEVELOPMENT EXCISE
TAX ON NEW CONSTRUCTION; ESTABLISHING AMOUNT OF TAX AND REQUIRING
COLLECTION BEFORE ISSUANCE OF A BUILDING PERMIT; PROVIDING FOR
ACCOUNTING FOR TAXES COLLECTED AND RESTRICTING USES FOR PROCEEDS
OF THE TAX TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND TO PAY DEBT SERVICE
OBLIGATIONS ISSUED TO FINANCE FUTURE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OF THE
CITY INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPROVEMENTS AND EXPANSION OF THE
WATER, WASTEWATER, AND ROADWAY SYSTEMS OF THE CITY OF PIEDMONT;
PROVIDING FOR SUBMITTAL OF THE TAX PROPOSITION TO THE QUALIFIED
ELECTORS OF THE CITY OF PIEDMONT; PROVIDING FOR EFFECTIVE DATE;
PROVIDING FOR REPEALER AND SEVERABILITY; AND DECLARING AN
EMERGENCY.
BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PIEDMONT, OKLAHOMA:
Section 1. Legislative Findings: The City Council of the City of Piedmont, Oklahoma,
finds and recommends that the costs of future improvements and expansion to the City' s capital
improvement needs should be borne by the users whose demand has created the need for future
expansion of City facilities and capital improvements. The capital needs of the City continue to
expand as the population grows but the amount of revenues received by the City from its
available revenue sources has failed to provide sufficient funds to meet the need for capital
expenditures. The imposition of a development excise tax on new construction provides a
method where new development bears its proportionate costs of capital facilities necessitated by
such new development. The City Council desires to establish a mechanism through which to
finance the future growth and expansion of the City' s infrastructure needs including water
systems, wastewater system, and roadways. Upon recommendation of its professional staff and
consultants, based further on recommendation of the City' s Planning Commission and Piedmont
Municipal Authority, the City Council has and does hereby determine that such costs should be,
in the future, imposed upon the development of land with the collection of an excise tax to be
collected at the date of issuance of the building permit on each new structure excluding only the
construction of accessory buildings. The City Council finds that there are a number of vacant
lots in approved subdivisions and future subdivisions, either platted or soon to be platted, the
development of which will impose an increased demand on the City' s capital needs including but
not limited to water, wastewater, and roadway systems, and the City Council therefore finds that
it is necessary to adopt the provisions of this excise tax for the imposition of appropriate costs on
such lots and future developments in order to provide the necessary and essential services
required to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the owners and occupants of these new
structures.
Section 2. A new law is hereby adopted to read as follows:
SECTION NEW DEVELOPMENT EXCISE TAX.
1. There is hereby established and imposed a New Development Excise
Tax to be levied and collected on new construction in the following amounts and
to be used as set forth herein:
A. For all new construction, excluding accessory building
construction, the sum of $ for each structure up to 2200
square feet and $ per square foot for each square foot of building
in excess of 2200 square feet.. For building expansions which include
the installation of any plumbing fixtures the sum of $_ per square foot
for each additional square foot added to the existing structure.
B. The tax imposed herein shall be collected at the time a building
permit is issued based upon the square footage of the building for which
the permit is issued.
C. The funds collected from the imposition of this development
excise tax shall be used only for capital improvements of the City,
including but not limited to the future expansion and improvements of the
City' s water, wastewater, and roadway systems. Funds collected shall be
paid into a non -fiscal, capital improvement account and accounted for
separately therein. Such funds and the interest accruing thereon shall be
used exclusively for capital improvements, including but not limited to the
expansion, improvement, and to pay debt service obligations issued to
finance said future capital improvements and expansion and upgrade of
water, wastewater, and roadway systems.
Section 2. This ordinance shall become effective upon its approval by a majority of the
qualified electors voting thereon at a regular or special election in the City of Piedmont,
Oklahoma.
Section 3. Repealer. All ordinances in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.
Section 4. Severability. If any part, article, section, or subsection of this ordinance shall
be held invalid or unconstitutional for any reason, such holding shall not be construed to impair
or invalidate the remainder of said ordinance, notwithstanding such holding.
Section 5. Emergency. It being immediately necessary for the preservation of the public
peace, health, safety, and welfare of the City of Piedmont and the inhabitants thereof that this
ordinance be put into full force and effect, an emergency is hereby declared to exist by reason
whereof this ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and its passage and approval.

Article I. Zoning Ordinance
Chapter 0. Preface
Section 1-0-1. Effect on District Classifications.
This Ordinance carries forth the zoning districts that were transformed into new districts in 1987. Additionally, it incorporates the RE-
1 and RE-2 districts that were created in 1991. Concurrent with this revision a new Overlay District is created to account for any city,
municipal authority, school district, flood plain area or planned unit development. This includes buildings, structures, or surrounding
grounds. The RS-3 district is retained as a carry-over district, for those districts so zoned; however, no further zoning into this district
will be allowed.
All properties reclassified to another Zoning District under the provisions of this Ordinance shall be subject to both the District Ues
and Development Regulations of the applicable Districts in this Ordinance.
Section 1-0-2. Effect on Development Regulations.
The development and construction regulations contained in this Ordinance shall henceforth apply uniformly to all property within the
corporate limits of the City of Piedmont regardless of the date of that property being established in a particular Zoning District
classification.
Section 1-0-3. Plats, Siteplans, and Improvement Plans Previously Approved.
Any plat application, site development plan or improvement approved prior to the effective date of this Ordinance shall remain valid
and subject to those provisions in effect at the time of this Ordinance.
Section 1-0-4. Completion of Approved Buildings.
Nothing herein shall require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of a building or structure for which a building
permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this Ordinance, or an amendment to this Ordinance, if the actual construction of
said building or structure is in accordance with those provisions in effect at the time the permit was issued.

Chapter 2. General Description of the Districts
Section 1-2-1. A-1, General Agricultural District.
This district is intended to provide for the continued use of land situated on the fringe of the urban area for agricultural purposes, until
land so designated is needed and desired for urbanization. Although such areas may be located in close proximity to residential and
commercial uses, the continuation of agricultural uses is considered an essential part of the Piedmont community. This district is
intended further to prevent location of low standard, scattered residential, commercial or industrial development, except in accordance
with this Ordinance and the Piedmont Comprehensive Plan. The types of uses, the area and the intensity of and uses permitted in
this District are designed to encourage and protect agricultural uses until urbanization is warranted and the appropriate change in
district classification is made.
Section 1-2-2. RE, Rural Estates Residential District.
This district is intended to provide a location for the land situated on the fringe of the urban area that may be either agricultural or
urban in character. This area commonly has been subdivided by ownership into various shaped tracts usually ranging from two and
one-half (2 ½) acres to up to four and ninety-nine hundreds (4.99) acres in size (excludes five (5) acres or more). The use of land in
these areas will represent a variety of urban and rural uses including the single-family dwelling unit on a small tract, residential uses
with farm animals on acreages and agricultural endeavors of a limited scale. It is the purpose of this district to promote a compatibility
between uses and to encourage and provide an orderly transition from agricultural or urban character.
Section 1-2-3. RE-1, Medium Size Rural Estates Residential District.
This area commonly has been subdivided by ownership into various shaped tracts usually ranging from one (1) acre up to two and
forty-nine hundreds (2.49) acres in size (excludes two and one-half (2.5) acres or more). It is the purpose of this district to provide for
the use of parcels of land in accordance with rules and regulations of the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality governing
residential sewage system wherein either a public water supply or a private well could be utilized with a subsurface sewage absorption
field.
Section 1-2-4. RE-2, Minimum-Size Rural Estates Residential District.
This area commonly has been subdivided by ownership into various shaped tracts usually ranging from Twenty-one Thousand Seven
Hundred Eighty (21,780) square feet to up to Ninety-nine hundredths (.99) acres in size (excludes one (1) acre or more). It is the
purpose of this district to provide for the use of parcels of land in accordance with rules and regulations of the Oklahoma Department
of Environmental Quality governing residential sewage system wherein a public water supply is used with a subsurface sewage
absorption field.
Section 1-2-5. RS-1, Urban Estate Residential District.
An Urban Estates Residential District (or subdivision) may be defined as a planned, natural area within the City limits which includes
many of the major daily activities of the families living within the City limits which includes many of the major daily activities of the
families living within the area. These activities may center around a neighborhood school, church, or other social activity. The Urban
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 12
Estates Residential subdivision is not intended to be wholly self-sufficient, but should provide common interests for its residents. It is
further intended that social and recreational facilities will be developed within the area. One (1) square mile is a desirable maximum
size and will aid in retaining common neighborhood interest.
Section 1-2-6. RS-2, Single-Family Residential District.
This is a restrictive residential district. The principal use of land is for single-family dwellings and related recreation, religious, and
educational facilities normally required to provide the basic elements of a balanced and attractive residential area. These areas are
intended to be defined and protected from the encroachment of uses not performing a function appropriate to the residential
environment. Internal stability, attractiveness, order, and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air, and open
space for dwellings and related facilities, and through consideration of the proper functional relationship of each element.
Section 1-2-7. RS-3, Single-Family Residential District (Minimum-Size Lots).
This is a restrictive, high-density residential district for use of single-family dwellings and related recreational, institutional, educational,
and religious uses. This district provides for the smallest residential lot allowed under the zoning ordinance. This zoning district is
limited to those properties that are served by adequate public water supply and public sewer service.
Section 1-2-8. RD-1, Two-Family Residential District.
This is a residential district to provide for a slightly higher population density but with basic restrictions similar to the Single-Family
Districts. The principal use of land is for single-family and two-family dwellings and related recreational, religious, and educational
facilities normally required to provide a balanced and attractive residential area. These areas are intended to be defined and protected
from the encroachment of uses not performing a function appropriate to the residential environment. Internal stability, attractiveness,
order and efficiency are encouraged by providing for adequate light, air, and open space for dwellings and related facilities, and
through the consideration of the proper functional relationship and arrangement of each element. This district may be used to achieve
transition areas between commercial areas and the Single-Family Districts, or to provide buffering areas between Single-Family
Districts and other community functions with intrusive characteristics (such as major transportation routes).
Section 1-2-9. RM-1, Multi-Family Residential District.
This residential district is intended to provide for multiple-family developments which may have a relatively intense concentration of
dwellings units served by large open spaces including common areas and facilities, thereby resulting in low gross densities. The
principal use of land may be for one or several dwelling types ranging from single-family to low-rise multiple family dwellings, and
including garden apartments, condominiums, and town homes. This district will typically be located with close access to the arterial
street system so as to result in minimum traffic mixing with less intensive residential areas.
Section 1-2-10. RMH, Mobile Home Residential District.
The purpose of this district is to provide for the establishment of a higher density residential patter within which the mobile home park
will be compatible. The district is intended to provide for a permanently established residential environment. The mobile home parks
and travel trailer parks permitted should be well designed and developed to provide a desirable living area. Recreational areas should
also be incorporated into the development of uses in this district. Because of the intensity of use in this district, they should be located
with close access to the arterial street system so as to result in minimum traffic mixing with less intensive residential areas. Locations
selected should also be suitable for accomplishment of the screening, utility, draining, and other requirements of this Ordinance.
Section 1-2-11. C-1, Local Commercial District.
This commercial district is for the conduct of retail trade and to provide personal services to meet the regular needs and for the
convenience of the people of adjacent residential areas. Because these shops and stores may be an integral part of the neighborhood,
closely associated with residential, religious, recreational, and educational elements, more restricted requirements for light, air, open
space, and off-street parking are made than are provided in other commercial districts.
Section 1-2-12. C-2, General Commercial District.
This commercial district is intended for the conduct of personal and business services and the general retail business of the community.
Persons living in the community and in the surrounding trade territory require direct and frequent access. Traffic generated by the
uses will be primarily passenger vehicles and only those trucks and commercial vehicles required for stocking and delivery of retail
goods.
Section 1-2-13. C-3, Central Commercial District.
This commercial district is intended to provide for continued use and re-use of areas of existing development in the community. The
land may be previously platted into lots, block, or parcels in sizes not appropriate for contemporary use. Therefore, these regulations
may provide parking requirements, setbacks, arrangements of uses on land parcels, combinations of uses, and other aspects of use
which are designed for the efficient use of spaces in this district. The objective of harmony between the uses in this district and
surrounding areas shall be followed in the application of this district.
Section 1-2-14. I-1, Restricted Light Industrial District.
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 13
This industrial district is intended primarily for production and assembly plants that have processes which are conducted so the noise,
odor, dust, and glare of each operation is completely confined within an enclosed building. These industries may require direct access
to rail, air or street transportation routes; however, the size and volume of the raw materials and finished products involved should not
produce the volume of freight generated by the uses of the general and heavy industrial districts. Buildings in this district should be
architecturally attractive and surrounded by landscaped yards.
Section 1-2-15. I-2, General Industrial District.
This industrial district is intended primarily for the conduct of light manufacturing, assembling, and fabrication, and for warehousing,
wholesale, and service uses. These do not depend primarily on frequent personal visits of customers or clients, but may require good
accessibility to major rail, air, or street transportation routes. These districts need to be carefully located to assure good relationships
with residential areas.
Section 1-2-16. I-3, Heavy Industrial District.
This industrial district is intended to provide for heavy industrial uses and other uses not otherwise provided for in the districts
established by these Regulations. The intensity of uses permitted in this district makes it desirable that they be located down wind
and separated from residential and commercial uses whenever possible.
Section 1-2-17. Overlay District.
An overlay district is one that “fits over” an already existing zoning district. It is restrictive in nature and has limited use application.
The underlying land reverts to the currently assigned zoning if the “overlay” is removed. These districts are designated by the City of
Piedmont and apply to all buildings, structures and surrounding grounds owned, operated or designated by the City of Piedmont; the
Piedmont Municipal Authority; the Piedmont School District; that flood prone land area designated on the official flood plan maps; and
any land designated to be developed under the Planned Unit Development (PUD) concept. The minimum restrictions as set forth in
Chapter Four are waived for this district to insure the appropriate use of land while safeguarding the public health, safety and general
welfare of the populace while making its public utilities/facilities as efficient as possible while maintaining the value of surrounding
property values.

Section 1-5-10. Planned Unit Development.
A. Planned Unit Development Purpose. The Planned Unit Development, herein referred to as PUD, is a special zoning district
category that provides an alternative approach to conventional land use controls. The PUD may be used for particular tracts
or parcels of land that are under common ownership and are to be developed as one (1) unit according to a Master Design
Statement and a Master Development Plan. The PUD is subject to special review procedures and, once approved by the
City Council, it becomes a special zoning classification for the property it represents. The intent and purpose of the planned
Unit Development provisions are to:
1. Encourage innovative land development while maintaining appropriate limitations on the character and intensity of use,
assuring compatibility with adjoining and proximate properties, and following the guidelines of the Comprehensive
Plan.
2. Permit flexibility within the development to maximize the unique physical features of the particular site.
3. Encourage efficient use of land, facilitate economic arrangement of buildings and circulation systems, and encourage
diversified living environments and land uses.
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 24
4. Achieve a continuity of function and design within the development, and encourage diversified living environments and
land uses.
5. Provide a vehicle for negotiating modifications in standard development requirements in order to both encourage
innovative development and protect the health, safety and welfare of the community.
B. Authorized Planned Unit Developments. A PUD may be authorized by an amendment to the Official Zoning Districts Map
after public hearings by the Planning Commission and City Council, provided it complies with the following requirements.
1. Location and Uses: A PUD shall be considered a special zoning district, and may be authorized for any use, or
combination of uses, permitted in this chapter.
2. PUD Master Plan Required: The basis for review and approval of a PUD application shall be the PUD Master Plan,
which shall be adopted as a part of the rezoning ordinance, in conformance with the requirements described in these
regulations.
i. For a Simplified PUD (SPUD) that is no more than five (5) acres in size the PUD master plan shall be the Simplified
PUD application to be provided by the Planning staff.
ii. For a Simplified PUD that is a single tract or parcel of land no more than five (5) acres in size, and proposes to
add uses that are not allowed in the proposed zoning district or modify development regulations to make them
less restrictive, the Master Development Plan shall consist of two (2) elements: the Simplified PUD application
provided by the Planning staff and a Master Plan submitted in accordance with the requirements of Section (iii)(a)
Master Development Plan Map.
iii. If the PUD is more than five (5) acres in size, the Master Plan shall consist of a Design Statement and a Master
Development Plan Map.

drawn at an appropriate scale, at a maximum of one inch equals one hundred feet (1”=100’) on one (1) or
more twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch (24”x36”) sheet(s). The purpose of the map is to conceptually portray
the development commitments described in the PUD Design Statement. The complexity of the map
information will depend upon the number and extent of varied land uses in the PUD.
A single-use PUD, for example, should require less graphic information than a mixed-use proposal, and it
may be sufficient to outline and identify those general areas where conventional zoning district regulations
will be utilized.
The Master Development Plan Map shall be submitted in accordance with the following:
1) Existing Conditions
i) General location and acreage in the PUD.
ii) Sufficient information, including density of the surrounding area, to demonstrate the relationship
of the PUD to adjoining land uses, existing or proposed.

such as native rock outcroppings, steep slopes, environmentally sensitive lands, wildlife habitats,
stream corridors, and significant vegetation, including tree canopy and healthy mature trees.
v) Specific location of right-of-way widths of adjacent arterial streets, and connectivity points with
adjacent sites.
vi) Areas where access to streets will be limited, and the number where appropriate.
2) Proposed PUD Elements
i) Land use designations for each distinct use in the PUD, including the identification of any public
buildings, schools, and other public uses.
ii) Public circulation system, including the general location of collector and local streets, pedestrian

C. PUD and SPUD Review Criteria.
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 27
1. Purpose: Because the PUD and SPUD provide the opportunity for higher densities, greater design flexibility, mixed
land uses and improved marketability, the applicant should be prepared to provide amenities and services that might
not be required or possible in conventional development. Review and approval is, therefore, a process of negotiation
between the City and the applicant to achieve the intent and purpose of these regulations and the Comprehensive
Plan.
The factors within this section should be specifically included as review criteria for the evaluation of a PUD application.
Other factors not listed herein may also be considered in the review process in order to respond to specific design and
land use proposals.
2. Design Standards:
i. The proposed PUD or SPUD shall be designed to provide for the unified development of the area in accordance
with the spirit and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan, and the land uses and zoning districts adjacent to it.
ii. Design of the PUD or SPUD may provide for modification of conventional chapter requirements for elements such
as yard area, density, setback and height on individual lots, in accordance with the PUD or SPUD Master Plan.
iii. Density, land use and intensity of use requirements shall be based on the PUD or SPUD Master Plan and shall
be reviewed carefully for conformance to the Comprehensive Plan.
iv. Building, Plumbing, Mechanical or Electrical Code requirements shall not be amended in the design of a PUD or
SPUD.
v. The maximum number of dwelling units within a PUD or SPUD shall be based on calculation of gross density,
which shall be established in the PUD or SPUD Master Plan. Gross density shall be calculated by dividing the
total land area to be developed for residential uses, exclusive of arterial streets, by the number of dwelling units.
vi. Location and type of housing shall be established in a general pattern and shown on the Master Development
Plan Map (where applicable).
3. Minimum Design and Construction Standards for Streets and Alleys: Streets and alleys for PUDs and SPUDs shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with City standards and specifications for right-of-way width and paving crosssections.
If modifications are proposed they shall be consistent with the following criteria and must be companion with
the appropriate subdivision plat.
i. Public Streets and Alleys: Proposed public street and alley modifications shall satisfy the following criteria:
a) Street right-of-way and paving widths shall be adequate to provide a traffic carrying and utility installation
capacity related to the design of the overall street system, the function of the individual street and the land
uses served.
b) Paving cross-sections shall be designed to be adequate to provide acceptable drainage in conformity with
the drainage plan for the PUD or SPUD, to receive loading commensurate with anticipated traffic, based on
the design of the overall street system, and to have a maintenance level commensurate with that of facilities
constructed to regular standards.
ii. Private Streets and Alleys: Proposed private street and alley modifications shall satisfy the criteria for public facility
modifications listed above, and the owner/applicant shall provide restrictive covenant documents providing for
any ongoing and long-term maintenance of private street and alley facilities that will not be provided by the City.
4. General Design and Development Guidelines
i. Density: Proposed residential densities should conform to density guidelines in the Comprehensive Plan and
should be allocated in a manner, and at a scale, that will be compatible with adjacent developed neighborhoods.
ii. Amenities: Amenities should be considered an important justification for development and City-approval of a PUD.
Where gross or net densities are to be increased to promote economy of development, or where other methods
of land use intensification are proposed, usable open space should be furnished, along with provisions for its
permanent retention and continued maintenance. Sidewalks and pedestrian ways should be planned where
necessary to provide for both an amenity and public safety.
iii. Relationship to Abutting Uses:
a) The Master Development Plan Map shall show, graphically, the treatments that will be employed to separate
the PUD from abutting properties, including commitments to landscaping, screening, earthen berms or
similar techniques.
b) Design landscape improvements and related features to:
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 28
1) Create a visual transition of landscaping to adjoining lots and developments.
2) Screen incompatible uses.
3) Minimize any negative impact of the development on adjacent sites and roadways.
c) It is appropriate to specifically establish areas with height limitations where a transition to more intense uses,
or where a higher intensity development abuts a lower intensity area, is proposed.
d) Where a PUD or SPUD proposes a mix of uses which would generally be incompatible with a conventional
development, the PUD Master Plan should specifically establish appropriate guidelines to assure
harmonious development.
iv. Site Design:
a) Arrange structures and buildings on the site to:
1) Complement existing development on adjacent properties by similar placement and proportion of
building form(s).
2) Screen undesirable views, such as service areas and trash receptacles, from pedestrian views and
public streets.
b) Demonstrate that the arrangement of open space or natural features on the site will create desirable and
functional environments for patrons, pedestrians and occupants by:
1) Preserving unique natural resources such as significant vegetation, watercourses, or native rock
outcroppings, where possible.
2) Providing protection to preserve existing healthy, mature trees where they exist.
3) Respecting desirable natural resources on adjacent sites.
4) Promoting the use and preservation of existing natural watercourses and patters of stormwater disposal
in the design of drainage facilities, where allowable.
v. Safety
a) Conform to Crime Prevention through Environmental Design principles by:
1) Providing convenient, safe, well-marked and direct routes for pedestrian connections from the public
street to building entrances;
2) Providing pedestrian scaled lighting for pedestrian circulation and visibility;
3) Providing effective lighting for vehicular traffic that does not overwhelm the quality of pedestrian lighting;
4) Framing open space with buildings that visually contain and provide for natural surveillance;
5) Providing for visibility around structures, screens, fences or enclosures to avoid the creation of areas
of concealment.
b) Provide site illumination that is designed, located, and installed to achieve specific average footcandles in
order to provide safe pedestrian and vehicle circulation as well as minimize adverse impacts on adjacent
properties. This standard shall apply to light poles and/or wall mounted luminaries for all areas within the
site to achieve the following standards:
1) Provide site illumination to achieve a maintained average of three (3) footcandles (not less than .75
footcandles) throughout all parking areas;
2) Provide site illumination to achieve a maintained average of six (6) footcandles (not less than 1.5
footcandles):
i) Along pedestrian walkways and common areas;
ii) Within areas of concealment in need of visual access;
iii) At all building entries and exits;
PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 29
iv) Provide site illumination that is designed, located, and installed in a manner to minimize light
trespass on adjacent properties by utilizing cutoff luminaries, house-side shields, and/or lightlimiting
accessories where needed.
vi. Circulation Systems
Organize circulation systems within the site to:
a) Provide adequate and safe pedestrian and vehicular circulation by defining walkways and distinguishing
areas of foot traffic from vehicular movement using methods such as crosswalks and pathway striping,
landscaping, and sidewalks.
b) Provide continuous pedestrian and vehicular connections to adjacent sites using sidewalks, streets, and
open-space linkages where physically possible.
c) Provide pedestrian pathways that connect parking areas and points of destination.
d) Provide pedestrian access to public transportation stops.
vii. Common Access: In commercial or industrial developments, the PUD or SPUD Master Plan should establish
specific standards and locations for common access driveways, both within the development and abutting arterial
streets. Approval of the bonus provisions in this chapter for shared parking facilities should only be authorized in
a PUD where this access commitment is provided for in the PUS or SPUD Master Plan.
D. Modifications to PUD or SPUD

will be heard. Such application shall show the location and intended uses of the site, the existing land uses within three
hundred (300) feet, a certified list of the names and addresses of the owners of property within three hundred (300) feet of
the exterior boundary of the subject property, and any other material pertinent to the request which the Planning commission
may require. The Planning commission may require part or all of the information set forth for site plan reviews in Chapter 5,
Section 1-5-13(R). A fee shall be collected in an amount equal to the fee for a rezoning application.

PIEDMONT ZONING CODE
March 2020
Page | 42
1. General Description and Authorization. The uses listed above as special use permits are so classified because they
more intensely dominate the area in which they are located than do other uses permitted in the district, and because
these uses present unique security and safety issues which are not shared by other uses in the district. With
consideration given to setting, physical features, compatibility with surrounding land uses, traffic, and aesthetics,
certain uses may locate in an area where they will be compatible with existing or planned land uses. The Planning
Commission and City Council shall review each case on its own merits apply the criteria established herein, and, if
appropriate, authorize said use by granting a special use permit for it.
2. Application. Application and public hearing procedures for a special use permit shall be completed in the same manner
as an application for rezoning. A site plan shall be included with the application as outlined in the zoning ordinance.
3. Criteria for special permit approval. The City Council shall use the following criteria to evaluate a special use permit:
i. Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the policies of the comprehensive plan;
ii. Whether the proposed use shall be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the applicable zoning district
regulations;
iii. Whether the proposed use shall adversely affect the use of neighboring property;
iv. Whether the proposed use shall generate pedestrian and vehicular traffic that is hazardous or in conflict with the
existing and anticipated traffic in the neighborhood;
v. Whether the facility presents a health or safety hazard to neighboring properties or the community at large;
vi. Whether the facility is to be located in proximity to residential structures, elementary or secondary public and/or
private schools, or other incompatible uses.
vii. Whether utility, drainage, parking, loading, signs, lighting access, and other necessary public facilities to serve
the proposed use shall meet the adopted codes of the city;
viii. Whether the facility has obtained all necessary permits to operate under the laws of the State of Oklahoma.
ix. The City Council may impose specific conditions regarding location, design, operation, screening, and security to
assure safety, to prevent a nuisance, and to control the noxious effects of excessive sound, light, odor, dust or
similar conditions.
4. Status of special use permits. Once a special use permit has been granted for a lot, said special use permit may not
be expanded to another lot without application for a new special use permit. The special use permit will only authorize
the specific use approved by the City Council. No additional use(s) shall be allowed on the premises of the special use
except as specifically authorized in the special use permit. For example, a special use permit for an approved treatment
facility would not allow a change of use or adding of additional uses such as inmate halfway house. All special use
permits shall expire by default:
i. If the use is not established within 12 months following approval by the City Council and no extension is approved.
When a building permit has not been issued for construction within 12 months of City Council approval, the
applicant or owner may request a hearing for an extension of the initial special use permit approval. Good cause
for an extension shall mean that the owner shows evidence that he has contractors or applications for continual
development within the next year following the original approval;
ii. If the use once established has been discontinued for a period of 12 months or abandoned;
iii. Whenever the City Manager finds that any proposed construction or occupancy will not, in his or her opinion,
substantially comply with the special use permit, he or she shall refer the question to the City Council for review.
Section 1-7-5. Conditional Permit.
Procedures. Whenever in Chapter 4, Chapter 5, or otherwise a specific use is permitted or provided subject to a conditional use permit
the following procedure is established to integrate the conditional use with the other land uses located in the district. These uses shall
be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
A. An application shall be filed with the Planning Commission twenty-four (24) days in advance of the date at which the matter
will be heard. Such application shall show the location and intended use of the site, a certified list of the names and
addresses of all the property owners and existing land uses within three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundary of the
subject property, and any other material pertinent to the request which the Planning Commission may require. A fee shall
be collected in an amount equal to the fee for a rezoning application.
B. The Planning Commission shall hold one (1) or more public hearing(s) thereon after having mailed notice by first class mail
to all property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundaries of the subject property at least twenty (20)

Chapter I. General Provisions
Section 1-1. Purposes.
The regulation of land subdivision for residential and other
uses is widely accepted as a function of municipal and county
government in the United States. It has become widely
recognized as a method of insuring sound community growth
and the safeguarding of the interest of the home owner, the
subdivider, and the local government. The business of
building a city, and this includes its environs, requires the
safeguarding of these interests and the assurance that land
subdivision will provide permanent assets to the locality.
These subdivision regulations seek to prevent excessive
governmental operating costs. At the same time they seek to
assure to the maximum degree possible that the means
whereby land can be developed for the highest possible use
as determined by consideration of social, economic, and
environmental factors with all of the necessary protections for
the prevention of deterioration, obsolescence, slums, and
blight. These subdivision regulations compliment the
Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinances of the City of
Piedmont.
These regulations are adopted for the following purposes:
A. To protect and provide for the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the City of Piedmont.
B. To provide for adequate light, air, and privacy, to
secure safety from fire, flood, and other physical
dangers, and to prevent overcrowding of the land.
C. To implement the Comprehensive Plan.
D. To insure proper legal descriptions, monumenting
of land, and adequate and accurate platting and
records of land subdivision.
E. To insure that public facilities are available that will
have sufficient capacity to serve the proposed
subdivision and the general community.
F. To protect and conserve the value and desirability
of land and neighborhoods throughout the
community.
G. To harmoniously relate the development of the
various tracts of land to the existing community, and
facilitate the future development of adjoining tracts.
H. To provide opportunities and guidance toward the
best possible design for each tract of land and
thereby preserve the natural beauty and
topography of the community, and insure
appropriate development with regard to natural
features and the aesthetics of the community.
I. To establish reasonable standards of design and
procedures for subdivision, resubdivisions,
and
other land divisions in order to further the orderly
layout and use of land.
Section 1-2. Policy.
It is the policy of the Piedmont Planning Commission and the
City of Piedmont that these regulations are adopted for the
purpose of establishing standards for reviewing of plans,
plats, and replats as provided for in the Oklahoma Statutes,
Title 11, Article XLV, Section 45-104.
Section 1-3. Authority.
These subdivision regulations and minimum standards for
land development are adopted by resolution of the Piedmont
Planning Commission and ratified by ordinance of the City of
Piedmont in accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma
Statutes, Title 11, Article XLV, Sections 45-101 through 45-
104. (Appendix B).
In all instances where these regulations provide for actions
and/or approvals to be taken by the Piedmont Planning
Commission, such actions shall be requested through the City
Manager of the City of Piedmont.
Section 1-4. Jurisdiction.
The provisions of these regulations shall apply throughout the
jurisdiction of the City of Piedmont. This jurisdiction consists
of all lands inside the incorporated limits of the City of
Piedmont.
These regulations and development standards shall apply to
public improvements, plats of lands, subdivision of land, and
private roadways in either platted or unplatted areas within the
corporate limits of Piedmont as provided for in the Oklahoma
Statutes, Title 11, Article XLV, Section 45-104 (See appendix
B).
These regulations and development standards shall apply to
the following forms of land subdivision:
A. The division of land into two or more tracts, lots,
sites, or parcels, any part of which, when
subdivided, shall contain less than five (5) acres in
area; or
B. The division of land, previously subdivided or
platted, into tracts, lots, sites or parcels, or less than
five (5) acres in area.
C. The dedication, vacation, or reservation of any
public easement through any tract of land
regardless of the area involved, including those for
use by public and private companies; or
D. The dedication or vacation of any street or alley
through any tract of land regardless of the area
involved.
E. The division of land into two or more tracts, lots,
sites, or parcels, any part of which, when divided,
shall contain less than forty (40) acres but more
than five (5) acres only where all public streets and
roads abutting the tract of land do not have a public
dedication of right-of-way equal to the minimum
right-of-way width set forth in Section V-2 of the
subdivision regulations.
NOTE 1: Determination of lot size and lot frontage of lots five
acres or more. (Appendix Q, Figures 1 and 2).
The area of the tract, lot, site, or parcel shall be based on its
legal description and shall be the total area measured within
the described lot lines. For improvement purposes, the lot
frontage shall abut the street (dedicated or non-dedicated)
right-of-way to determine lot setbacks and building lines.
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 6
NOTE 2: Determination of lot size and lot frontage of lots less
than five acres. (Appendix Q, Figures 3 and 4)
In subdivision of land into plats of lots and blocks, or tracts,
lots, sites, or parcels of less than five acres with or abutting
dedicated streets, the lot lines shall abut the street right- ofway.
On non-dedicated streets, the lot frontage shall abut the
street right-of-way to determine lot setbacks and building
lines.
Section 1-4A. Jurisdiction over Lots Five Acres or Larger
Under Certain Conditions.
A. Application. This section shall govern any
subdivision of land into two or more lots, five acres
but not greater than forty acres in size, where a
street is proposed to be constructed to provide
access to the lots. See Appendix Q regarding a
specific checklist for this type of development. All
other regulations stated in the Subdivision
Regulations shall not apply. This section does not
apply to division of land into tracts five acres or
larger when every lot abuts a section line road and
no new street is proposed to provide access to lots.
In that case, the only requirement is a 17-foot
roadway easement for all lots abutting the section
line road.
B. Minimum Street Standards. The minimum street
width of the proposed street shall be fifty feet (50’)
of right-of-way with a twenty-four feet (24’) roadway
surface. The radius of any cul-de-sac street shall be
a minimum of sixty feet (60’) of roadway surface
within the cul-de-sac. Adequate road drainage is
required as part of a drainage study provided by a
certified engineer. A cul-de-sac shall be required on
any dead-end street of sufficient size to allow
maneuvering by emergency vehicles, garbage
trucks, and school buses. The minimum street
construction standard shall be as attached hereto
as Exhibit “A” and incorporated into the street
construction standards adopted by Part 14, Chapter
3 of the Piedmont Code of Ordinances and Section
VI-5, Street Improvements, of the Piedmont
Subdivision Regulations.
C. Zoning. All zoning regulations of the agricultural
zoning district shall apply to lots created under this
section.
D. Covenant. A covenant running with the land shall
be submitted providing for perpetual street
maintenance and drainage improvement
maintenance by property owners within the plat,
and requiring annual assessments for such
improvements. A copy of the approved unrecorded
plat and a legal description for each lot should be
included as an attachment to the covenant. The
covenant shall be recorded with the County Clerk’s
office and a copy shall be maintained by the City of
Piedmont."
E. Restriction of Sale of Lots and Information Required
on Deeds. No lot may be sold or any construction
commenced in a subdivision subject to this Section
until the Final Plat of the proposed development
has been approved by the Planning Commission
Chairman of the City of Piedmont. Where the
subdivision is not being served by a public water
supply, all deeds conveying lots in the approved
subdivision shall contain language as follows: “This
subdivision is not served by a public water supply.”
Further, all deeds conveying lots in the approved
subdivision must contain the following language:
“The roadway abutting this property is a private
road and is not maintained by the City of Piedmont
or any other governmental agency.” A conspicuous
sign shall be erected at the entrance to the
subdivision that reads: “PRIVATE ROAD – NOT
MAINTAINED BY THE CITY OF PIEDMONT.”
F. Violations. It shall be an offense to attempt to
subdivide land subject to this Section without first
complying with this Section. It shall further be an
offense to sell or offer for sale lots in a proposed
subdivision until the survey of plat described in this
Section is certified by the Planning Commission
Chairman and submitted to the City of Piedmont
Clerk, and all provisions of this Section are
complied with.
Section 1-5. Amendment.
The Piedmont Planning Commission and the City of
Piedmont, Oklahoma, may from time to time, adopt, amend,
and make public rules and regulations for the administration
of these regulations to the end that the public be informed and
that the approval of plans and plats be expedited.
Section 1-6. Violation and Penalty.
A. No building permit shall be issued for any new
structure or change, improvement, or alteration of
any existing structure on any tract of land which
does not comply with all of the provisions of these
Regulations.
B. A violation of these Regulations shall be deemed
an offense and shall be punishable by fine. Any
person, partnership, or corporation violating any of
the provisions of these Regulations, upon
conviction thereof, shall be fined in an amount
based upon the fee schedule for each violation, and
each day of continuation of an offense shall be a
separate violation.
C. The City of Piedmont may issue citations to
suspected violators of these Regulations, which
citations shall state the violation that is alleged, the
time of the observation of the offense, any
correction of the violation which is sought, the time
allowable for the accomplishment of said
corrections, and the further action which will be
taken to seek remedy should correction not be
accomplished. The issuance of such citations does
not preclude the filing of charges in District Court,
nor shall the issuance of such citations be a
mandatory process precedent to the filing of
charges in District Court.
Section 1-7. Definitions.

to the Planning Commission a preliminary plat and final plat
or a lot-split plat of the tract or parcel to be subdivided or
developed. The final and preliminary plat shall not be
combined but shall represent separate submittals.
After review and recommendation by the Planning
Commission of the preliminary plat and/or final plat the same
shall be submitted to the City Council for their review and
approval or denial. The City Council shall be the authority for
discretionary review and approval and/or denial of the
preliminary plat, and final plat, and no right shall accrue to the
subdivider or owner of the land until final approval by the City
Council is obtained.
Section 2-2. Time Limitations and Required Submittals.
A. PRELIMINARY PLAT. The applicant shall submit to
the City Manager four (4) copies of the Preliminary
Plat, either preliminary or final public improvement
plans, and one (1) copy of the Preliminary Plat
checklist forty-two (42) days before the meeting at
which consideration is requested. Where the
preliminary plat is only a part of a larger tract of land
to be developed, the preliminary plat shall show the
entire area to be developed accompanied by
preliminary drainage calculations, a plan view of the
water, sewer, and street layout, and preliminary
flow line and top-of-rim elevations for sewer
improvements. The proposed phasing of
development shall also be shown with time frames
for the phases. At the option of the applicant a
Preliminary Plat may be submitted with preliminary
construction plans. After the granting of an approval
of submission of a Preliminary Plat with preliminary
construction plans the applicant shall submit the
necessary four (4) copies of the final improvement
plans within six (6) months. If the final construction
plans are not submitted within six (6) months, all
conditional approvals shall be void. The Planning
Commission shall act upon all submissions related
to Preliminary Plats within ninety (90) days of the
receipt of materials or the Plat shall be considered
to have been approved. This time limit provision is
not to apply if changes have been requested by the
Planning Commission, if the submission is
incomplete, or if there is a lack of a quorum for a
meeting . In so far as a Preliminary Plat may be
approved through this time limit provision, that
approval relative to the dedication of easements or
rights-of-way, shall only constitute an authority for
the subdivider to submit the Plat to the City Council
of the City of Piedmont as provided in Chapter III,
Section 3. If a Final Plat covering all or part of the
land shown in a Preliminary Plat has not been filed
with the City Manager within two (2) years after the
approval of the Preliminary Plat, then all approvals
shall be void.; except where a preliminary plat is
approved for development in phases, then a final
plat must be submitted for at least the first phase in
two (2) years, and subsequent phases must be
completed in five (5) years. Subdividers may
request an extension of time for completion of
phased development.
B. FINAL PLAT. The applicant shall submit to the City
Manager four (4) copies of the final Plat, and four
(4) copies of the "As Built" plans for all
improvements installed and one (1) copy of Final
Plat checklist, fourteen (14) days before the
meeting at which consideration is requested. The
Planning Commission shall act upon all
submissions related to Final Plats within ninety (90)
days of the date of receipt of materials or the Plat
shall be considered to have been approved. This
time limit provision is not to apply if changes have
been requested by the Planning Commission, if the
submission is incomplete, or if there is a lack of a
quorum for a meeting. In so far as a Final Plat may
be approved through this time limit provision, that
approval relative to the dedication of easements or
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 9
rights-of-way, shall only constitute an authority for
the subdivider to submit the Plat to the City Council
of the City of Piedmont as provided in Chapter III,
Section 4. If a Final Plat is not filed on record with
the County Clerk of Canadian County within six (6)
months after the approval of the Planning
Commission, then all approvals shall be void.
C. LOT-SPLIT PLAT. The applicant shall submit to the
City Manager one (1) copy of the Lot-Split Plat
materials within fourteen (14) days of the meeting
at which consideration is requested. The Planning
Commission or City Manager acting as the
Designated Representative shall act upon the Lot-
Split Plat within sixty (60) days of the receipt of
materials or the Plat shall be considered to have
been approved.
Section 2-3. Official Recording.
No plat or other land subdivision instrument shall be filed in
the office of the County Clerk of Canadian County, Oklahoma,
until it shall have been approved by the Planning Commission
and City Council of the City of Piedmont. It shall be unlawful
to present for recording any plan, plat, or re-plat to any public
office unless the same shall bear thereon, by endorsement,
the approval of the Piedmont Planning Commission and City
Council. The disapproval of any such plan, plat, or re-plat by
the City Council of the City of Piedmont shall be deemed a
refusal of the proposed dedications shown thereon.
Section 2-4. Filing Fees.
A. At the time of submitting each of the respective
plats to the Secretary of the Planning Commission
or other designated agent, the following fees shall
be payable to the City Clerk of the City of Piedmont:
1. The Preliminary Plat fee shall be based on fee
schedule.
2. The Final Plat fee shall be based on fee
schedule.
3. The Lot-split Plat fee shall be based on fee
schedule.
B. No part of the subdivision plat or lot-split plat fees
shall be refundable.
Section 2-5. Variances and Exceptions.
Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size
or shape, or is surrounded by such development or unusual
condition that the strict application of the design requirements
contained in these regulations would result in real difficulties
and substantial hardships or injustices, the developer shall
submit written justification and proof of such condition. The
Planning Commission may vary or modify such design
requirements so that the subdivider is allowed to develop his
property in a reasonable manner, but so, at the same time,
the public welfare and interests of the Piedmont Community
are protected and the general intents of these regulations are
preserved. Such variances may be granted only by the
affirmative vote of no less than three-fourths (3/4) of the
Planning Commission and confirmed by a simple majority
vote of the City Council.
A request for a variance as provided for in this section shall
be submitted in writing to the Planning Commission, shall
state the variances requested, and provide reasons justifying
the granting of variances of exceptions.
Section 2-6. Surety Bonding.
In lieu of the improvements as approved in connection with a
Preliminary Plat, the subdivider may elect to file a surety bond
with the City of Piedmont to secure the actual construction of
such improvements according to plans and specifications
within a time period of not to exceed two (2) years from the
date of the approval of the Final Plat. Such bond shall be
based on fee schedule, and the form of the surety shall be
made satisfactory to both the Planning Commission and the
City Council of the City of Piedmont to which such
improvements will be proposed for dedication.
Section 2-7. Electronic Copy Required for Plat
Applicants.
A. In addition to the requirements of Section 2-2 of
these Subdivision Regulations, Preliminary Plat
applicants shall also submit one (1) electronic copy
of the Preliminary Plat, either preliminary or final
public improvement plans and the Preliminary Plat
Checklist.

these Subdivision Regulations, Final Plat
applicants shall also submit one (1) electronic copy
of the Final Plat, the “As Built” plans for all
improvements installed, the Final Plat Checklist.
C. In addition to the requirements of Section 2-2 of
these Subdivision Regulations, Lot-Split Plat
applicants shall submit one (1) electronic copy of
the Lot-Split Plat materials.
Chapter III. Subdivision Platting Procedures
Section 3-1. Subdivision Classification, Procedures,
Issuance of Permits, Notice of Submission or Preliminary
Plat.
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed no building
permits may be issued on the tract of land being subdivided
until the owner, or his agent, has applied for and obtained
Planning Commission and City Council approval of the
preliminary plat and required improvement plans, and the
owner, or his agent, has obtained approval of a subdivision
bond as required in these regulations; or the owner, or his
agent, has actually constructed the required improvements,
and the improvements have been accepted by the City
Council of the City of Piedmont. Provided, where the tract of
land being subdivided meets the minimum lot size of the
zoning district in which it is located and abuts on a public
street, a conditional building permit may be issued for one
"model home" on the tract of land after City Council approval
of the Preliminary Plat but without posting a subdivision bond
or completion of the required improvements. The "model
home" permit shall be conditioned such that no occupancy
permit will be issued and no contract for sale of the home shall
be made until a subdivision bond is posted or the required
improvements are installed and accepted by the City Council
of the City of Piedmont.
Lot split plats shall be approved in accordance with Section
III-5 of these regulations. Upon initial receipt of a subdivision
proposal the City Manager shall make a staff review of the
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 10
proposal and provide a report to the applicant and the
Chairman of the Planning Commission. All required
documents, fees, and checklist information must be received
by the City Manager at least forty-two (42) days prior to the
Planning Commission meeting at which consideration is
required. The proposed subdivision may be processed as a
standard subdivision or a lot-split subdivision as follows:
A. Standard Subdivision:
1. Preliminary plat
2. Final plat
B. Lot-split subdivision as required.
Upon initial receipt of a subdivision proposal the City Manager
shall determine if the proposal shall be classified as a
standard subdivision or a lot-split subdivision. If a subdivision
proposal is determined to be a lot-split subdivision, the
Chairman shall determine what information, drawings, and
procedures will be necessary for submission of the plat to the
Planning Commission in accordance with these regulations
and the policies of the Planning Commission. The Chairman
shall consider in each case the nature of a proposed lot-split
subdivision and the relationship of the proposal to:
surrounding land uses, topography, property shape, property
size, adjacent ownership, public access, and public facilities
in order to determine the extent to which the platting process
must be followed. The above determination of the Chairman
may be reviewed and revised by the Planning Commission
upon request of the subdivider.
At least twenty (20) days before the Planning Commission
meeting where a Preliminary Plat is considered the City Clerk
shall mail notice to all property owners of land within three
hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundaries of the property
included in the Preliminary Plat. The subdivider shall submit
with the Preliminary Plat a list of names and addresses of all
record property owners within three hundred (300) feet of the
exterior boundary of the Preliminary Plat. The list shall be
current and certified by an engineer, land surveyor, attorney,
bonded abstracter, or other person qualified by experience or
training to research county records. The mailed notice shall
contain the legal description of the proposed Preliminary Plat,
a map showing the location of the plat in relation to existing
streets and other identifying landmarks, the number of lots
proposed to be subdivided, and the date, time, and location of
the meeting of the Planning Commission meeting where the
Preliminary Plat will be considered.
Section 3-2. Repealed.
Repealed.
Section 3-3. Preliminary Plat.
All actions of the Planning Commission shall be deemed a
recommendation to the City Council, but shall not constitute
final approval of the Preliminary Plat, or Final Plat until same
has been approved by the City Council of the City of
Piedmont. Approvals by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute an acceptance of dedication or a commitment to
accept dedications.
After the subdivider has prepared the Preliminary Plat, he may
take either of the following actions:
A. He may present the Preliminary Plat and
Preliminary Plat checklist to the Planning
Commission and obtain approval thereof before
proceeding with preparation of the improvement
plans; or,
B. He may present, either preliminary or final
Improvement Plans to the Planning Commission at
the time the Preliminary Plat is presented.
All actions of the Planning Commission shall, in so far as the
Plat involves dedications to the public, constitute only an
authorization of the subdivider to submit the Plat for
consideration of the local government to which the
dedications are proposed. Such Planning Commission
actions shall not constitute an acceptance of dedication or a
commitment to accept dedication.
Whenever the Subdivider presents to the Planning
Commission the Preliminary Plat, Preliminary Plat checklist,
Improvement Plans, and the Planning Commission finds that
the Plat and Improvement Plans meet all the requirements of
these regulations, or after the applicant and the Planning
Commission agree upon any revision, it shall approve the
Preliminary Plat and Improvement Plans by placing a
certificate of approval upon each copy of the plat and plans.
Such certificate of approval shall bear the signature of the
chairman of the Planning Commission and shall provide that
the approval given thereby does not constitute approval for
purposes of recording.
The Preliminary Plat shall include and be accompanied by all
information shown in Chapter IV of these Regulations.
Section 3-4. Final Plat.
The purpose of the Final Plat is to create a record document
which accurately describes the subdivided land, both as to
accurate dimensions, and as to legal provisions which are
pertinent to the subdivision. Much of the reason for this step
is to make the transfer of the land more simple and certain.
Land sales by reference to a legally filed plat are generally
less complicated and more likely to provide the precise legal
situation sought. The certainty of such sales derives from the
assurance of an accurate survey and processes designed to
assure the provision of facilities necessary to service the land.
A Certificate of Approval will be placed on each copy of the
Final Plat for the signature of the Chairman of the Planning
Commission.
At the time the Final Plat and Final Plat checklist are submitted
to the City Manager, the subdivider shall take one of the
following courses of action:
A. If the subdivider elects to complete all
improvements as specified in the construction plans
submitted with the Preliminary Plat, he shall submit
the "as built" specifications and "as built" original
tracings of all improvements. If the City Manager
finds that the "as built" plans and specifications
comply with requirements, and that the actual
construction is as shown in the plans and
specifications, and he shall endorse his approval
thereon.
B. If the subdivider elects to deposit the surety bond
as specified in Chapter II, Section 11-6, he shall
submit plans for all improvements required under
this title, such plans to bear the improvements
required under this title, such plans to bear the
approval of the Planning Commission. Upon
completion of a portion of the construction of the
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 11
required improvements, the Planning Commission
may release a portion of the surety bond in the
amount of the costs of the constructed
improvements, as estimated by the Planning
Commission. Before any portion of the surety bond
may be released the City Manager shall approve
the "as built" plans and specifications for that
portion of the improvements for which the
Subdivider has required release of the surety bond.
All actions of the Planning Commission approving final plats
or parts thereof shall be deemed only an authorization for the
subdivider to submit the plat to the City Council for review and
approval or denial. Planning Commission approval shall not
constitute an acceptance of dedication.
Section 3-5. Lot-Split Plat.
The purpose of providing for the processing of Lot-Split Plats
is to facilitate the conveyance of simple property division.
Those matters which shall be considered as LotSplits
shall
be those which involve the dividing or re-dividing of a single
parcel of land not more than one time, dividing shall not
involve the extension, opening, vacating, narrowing, or
change of alignment of any thoroughfare, street , right-of-way,
or easement. The determination of eligibility for processing as
a Lot-Split Plat shall be determined from the records of the
ownership of the property as of the date these regulations may
be officially adopted. The Chairman of the Planning
Commission is hereby authorized to approve lot splits under
the following conditions:
A. The requested deed approval divides one tract of
land into no more than two tracts, lots, or parcels.
B. The lot split does not create any unusable tract of
land and does not landlock any parcel of land.
C. The lots, tracts, or parcels of land created meet all
the applicable zoning ordinances pertaining to lot
width, depth, and area requirements for the zoning
district in which the land is located.
D. All tracts, lots, or parcels remaining after or created
by the lot split shall abut on a public street and a
public utility easement; provided, residential lots
abutting on a private street which private street was
constructed before January 1, 2005, may be eligible
for a lot split.
E. Any tract of land shall only be eligible for one lot
split deed.
F. Any subsequent subdivision of the original tract, lot,
or parcel and/or the newly created tract, lot, or
parcel shall comply with the applicable subdivision
procedures, and shall not be eligible for this lot split
approval procedure.
The procedure for lot split deed approval shall consist of filing
the following documents with the City Clerk:
A. Original or certified copy of deed to original tract
showing book and page number of recording, and
original of deed for lot split for which approval is
sought. The applicant shall also provide an original
deed reflecting the description of the tract
remaining after the lot-split plat.
B. Certified survey showing boundary lines,
improvements, easements, and rights-of-way for
the property being divided by the lot-split plat and
the property remaining after approval of the lot-split
plat, if deemed necessary by the Chairman and the
Planning Commission, and such other relevant
information as may be required by the Chairman of
the Planning Commission, including any or all of the
items shown in Chapter IV of these Regulations.
C. Payment of the fee based on the fee schedule.
LOT LINE ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE.
The Chairman of the Planning Commission is hereby
authorized to approve lot line adjustments under the following
conditions:
A. No additional tract, parcel, or lot shall be created by
any lot line adjustment.
B. All tracts altered by the lot line adjustment shall
meet the applicable lot width, lot depth, and area
requirements of the zoning district in which the
property is located.
C. All tracts resulting from a lot line adjustment shall
abut on public utility easement and public street.
D. Unusable tracts, parcels, or lots shall not be
created.
The procedure for lot line adjustments shall consist of the filing
with the City Clerk the following documents:
A. Proposed deed(s) with legal description.
B. Copy of original deed(s).
C. A certified survey consisting of boundary lines, all
improvements and easements; and a copy of the
deed(s) of lots abutting the proposed lot line
adjustment, if deemed necessary by the Chairman
of the Planning Commission.
Section 3-6. Other Properties.
To facilitate the administration of these regulations the
Piedmont Planning Commission shall review the conveyance
of all properties within the jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission which are of less than five (5) acres in size. The
Planning Commission hereby empowers the Chairman of the
Planning Commission to place the approval of the Piedmont
Planning Commission on such conveyances as represent
properties which were recorded as separate parcels in the
office of the County Clerk of Canadian County on the effective
date of these regulations. This approval shall be placed upon
the instrument conveying the property, and it shall be
necessary to acquire the approval only once for any given
property which may subsequently be sold by the same
description. This approval shall be provided free of charge.
Section 3-7. Deed Approval.
A subdivision of land into lots, tracts or parcels. Said
subdivision shall include all processes related to the
conveyance of title by: deed described by metes and bounds;
deed described by reference to an unapproved plat; and/or
deed resulting from the adjustment of lot lines in an approved
plat.
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 12
A. Classification as Deed Approval. Subdivision of
land shall be classified as a deed approval if:
1. An existing lot, tract, site or parcel of land
which is zoned commercial or industrial is
subdivided into two or more parcels. Said
subdivision shall include all processes related
to the conveyance of title by:
i. Deed by metes and bounds description;
ii. Deed described by reference to an
unapproved plat; and/or
iii. Deed resulting from the adjustment of lot
lines in an approved plat.
2. The subdivision does not involve nor include
the dedication or abandonment of public
rights-of-way and/or easements.
3. The subdivision can satisfy these regulations
and other applicable ordinances and statutes
without the construction of streets, water
facilities, storm drainage facilities or other
improvements, except as necessary to directly
serve the created lots and to provide a direct
connection to an existing and approved
system. It is the intent of this provision to limit
this classification to those cases where the
improvements required by these regulations
have been provided and all such improvement
requirements, except for the extension of
service to individual lots, have been satisfied.
4. The property is zoned commercial or
industrial.
B. Classification as Deed Approval Not Construed to
Waive Requirements. The classification of a
subdivision as a deed approval procedure shall not
be construed to waive any requirements of these
regulations, nor the provisions of any other
ordinance or statute pertaining to the property.
C. Deed Approval Procedure. Administrative review
and approval of deed approvals is required in
accordance with the following procedures:
1. Submittal of Application. Application for deed
approval review shall be filed with the
Community Development Director. Such
application shall consist of the proposed deed
with the legal description provided there on, or
attached there to as Exhibit for the subject
property, a site plan or survey of the subject
property and all easements necessary for
service of the property by public utilities or to
provide common parking or vehicular access
areas. A fee, as set forth by the Piedmont City
Council shall also accompany the application.
2. Subdivision Review Process. The Community
Development Director shall review the
application and may submit it for review and
comment to other agencies and/or
departments as staff deems necessary. Within
ten (10) days of the official date of application,
the Community Development Director shall
approve or disapprove the application for deed
approval and shall notify the applicant of said
decision.
However, the applicant may waive this requirement
and consent to an extension of said period. If the
application is not approved by the Community
Development Director within the required time
period, the applicant may apply to the Planning
Commission for public hearing and action. Copies
of all deed approved under this section by the
Community Development Director shall be
forwarded to the Chairman of the Planning
Commission and the Mayor and City
Councilmembers.
D. Delegation of Authority for Administrative Approval
of Deeds.
The Community Development Director has the
authority to approve deeds either for lot split or
metes and bounds approval under the following
conditions:
1. Pre-Existing Deeds. The property to be
conveyed by the deed submitted for review
existed in its present configuration prior to its
annexation to the City or prior to the July 1,
1987, adoption of the Piedmont Subdivision
Regulations.
2. Exempted Deeds.
i. The configuration of the property to be
conveyed was created by a court decree
or by an action of other governmental
authority. Documentation of such court
decree or governmental action shall be
required.
ii. The property to be conveyed is bounded
on all sides by properties that have
previously received deed approvals by
the Community Development Director or
Planning Commission. Documentation of
such deed approvals shall be required.
iii. The deed submitted for review is
exempted from the requirements of
Planning Commission approval by any
provision of State law. Documentation of
such exemption shall be required.
iv. The property to be conveyed existed in
its present configuration prior to July 1,
1987 and meets the following criteria:
a) It is in compliance with all
requirements and regulations of the
Drainage and Flood Ordinances
b) It is not landlocked nor does it
landlock another lot, tract or parcel
of land.
c) All instruments for the dedication of
required public rights-of-way and/or
easements have been submitted.
This shall mean, in cases where
private easements are required,
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 13
that the applicant must submit
certified copies of the instrument(s)
filed ofrecord with the Oklahoma
County Clerk.
d) The applicant has submitted a
written agreement to extend all
sanitary sewer lines and water
mains, and has agreed that no
improvement shall be constructed
on the property that would in any
way affect the construction of these
sanitary sewer lines and water
mains until these lines and mains
are in place and meet the standards
of the City of Piedmont. Where such
extensions of sanitary sewer lines
and water mains are not
reasonable, as determined by
applying current professional
standards of planning and civil
engineering, the applicant may
submit written authorization from
the State Department of
Environmental Quality for the use of
a private sanitary sewage treatment
facility. In all cases where public
sanitary sewer and/or public water
facilities are not available and the
extension of such facilities is not
required, the deed submitted for
approval shall have affixed to its
face: "NOT SERVED BY PUBLIC
SEWER AND/OR WATER AS OF
THIS DATE." In all cases where
improvements or the extension of
improvements are required, the
provisions regarding assurance of
completion, as prescribed in these
subdivision regulations, shall be
satisfied.
3. Other Deeds Eligible for Administrative
Approval.
i. The property to be conveyed is located
within an existing subdivision and is
zoned commercial or industrial. Said
property shall be in full compliance with
the subdivision regulations. A deed(s)
conveying property in subdivisions which
are found to be non-complying because
of ordinance or regulation changes will
be considered to be a pre-existing
deed(s) and may be approved
administratively so long as the
subdivision was in compliance with the
ordinances and regulations in force at the
time of its creation.
ii. The property to be conveyed meets the
following criteria:
a) All current Subdivision
Regulations are met, including all
ordinances and regulations
relating to the improvements of
streets and the installation of
water, sewer and drainage
facilities.
b) Properties must front on approved
public or private streets meeting
City standards.
c) All applicable regulations of the
Planning and Zoning Ordinances
are met, including those regulations
concerning non-conforming uses.

Drainage and Flood Ordinances are
met.
e) All applicable regulations of the
sewer ordinances are met.
f) Reserved.
g) Where the property is part of a
Planned Unit Development the
preservation and maintenance of
common areas shall be provided by
restrictive covenants enforceable by
the City.
h) Lots, tracts or parcels zoned
commercial or industrial must
maintain a minimum frontage/width
of seventy five (75) feet or the
minimum lot width of the zoning
district, whichever is greater, at the
front property line except where a
smaller lot is part of an approved
Planned Unit Development.
i) Instruments for the dedication of all
necessary public easements are
submitted. This shall mean, in
cases where public or private
easements are required, that the
applicant must submit certified
copies of the instrument(s) filed of
record with the County Clerk.
j) The applicant has submitted a
written agreement to extend all
sanitary sewer lines and water
mains, and has agreed that no
improvement shall be constructed
on the property until these lines and
mains are in place and meet the
standards of the City of Piedmont.
Where such extensions of sanitary
sewer lines and water mains are not
reasonable, as determined by
applying current professional
standards of planning and civil
engineering, the applicant may
submit written authorization from
the State Department of
Environmental Quality for the use of
a private sanitary sewer treatment
facility. In all cases where public
sanitary sewer and/or public water
facilities are not available and the
extension of such facilities is not
required, the deed submitted for
approval shall have affixed to its
face: "NOT SERVED BY PUBLIC
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 14
SEWER AND/OR WATER AS OF
THIS DATE." In all cases where
improvements or the extension of
improvements are required, the
provisions regarding assurance of
completion, as prescribed in these
Subdivision Regulations shall be
satisfied.
k) Approval of the deed submitted
shall not create a substandard lot on
adjoining property. The deed
submitted may be approved if the
substandard lot created on the
adjoining property is combined with
other property to create a standard
lot. Both deeds must be approved
simultaneously and a recorded
covenant shall be required to
combine the lots for development.
4. Limits of Delegated Authority. No further
delegation of the Planning Commission's
authority for the approval of lot splits or deed
approval is hereby granted or implied. Nothing
in this Section shall prevent the applicant from
requesting a public hearing before the
Planning Commission.
E. Staff Guidelines Regarding Improvements.
1. Required Improvements. When requests for
lot splits or deed approvals are submitted to
the Planning Commission, requirements for
improvements shall be determined by the
Planning Commission.
2. Paving. The Community Development
Director shall require the installation of proper
street paving with the approval of all deeds, if
that paving does not already exist, except that
the Community Development Director may
vary that requirement when it would be
impractical to require paving because the
property is abutting a street included within an
approved street bond program or where such
paving can be best accomplished through an
assessment district.
3. Water. The Community Development Director
shall require the extension and installation of
water mains to serve all subdivided property if
such property is, as determined by applying
current professional standards of planning and
civil engineering, reasonably accessible to an
existing water main. If the subdivided tract is
not reasonably accessible to a water main, this
requirement may be waived and private water
well utilized under the following conditions:
i. Proper approval of water well drilling by
the State Department of Environmental
Quality.
ii. Meet the locational criteria if water well
and septic tank are both used.
4. Sanitary Sewer. The Community
Development Director shall require the
extension and installation of sanitary sewer
lines to serve all subdivided property if such
property is, as determined by applying current
professional standards of planning and civil
engineering, reasonably accessible to an
existing sanitary sewer main. If the subdivided
tract is not reasonably accessible to a sanitary
sewer main, this requirement may be waived
and a septic or other system approved by the
Oklahoma Department of Environmental
Quality utilized under the following conditions:
i. The septic system shall be installed and
inspected as required by the State
Department of Environmental Quality.
ii. Minimum lot sizes shall be as follows:
a) Public water/septic system - one
half acre.
b) Private water well/septic system -
35,000 square feet or as otherwise
required by Oklahoma Department
of Environmental Quality.
F. Force of Approval. Once the initial deed or any
subsequent deed has been approved by the
Community Development Department or Planning
Commission, such approval relates back to the
original lot split and covers all future conveyances
using the same legal description.

Chapter V. Design Standards
Section 5-1. Community, General.
The quality of the design of the community, both in the urban
area and on the fringes of the urban development is
dependent on the quality of design of the individual
subdivisions in the area. Good community design can be
accomplished by following a few principles. These better
approaches to the layout of new areas result in a more livable
community. The violation of some of the basic rules
concerning design of streets, ditches, and other features can
lead to such unpleasant situations as: streets that deteriorate
and are expensive to maintain, street intersections that are
dangerous, drainage ditches that clog up and cause flooding,
building lots that are difficult or expensive to construct upon,
or difficulties with erosion during the time of development and
even throughout the life of the home.
The figures which follow show some of the better ways of
creating a subdivision. The use of good design, and holding
to these methods of development can provide for the least
expense in the building of a subdivision. This is especially
true considering the costs that come to the purchasers of
property that has been improperly developed, and the fact that
there is no cheaper time to solve development problems than
before houses are built and lots are sold.
The intent of these design standards is to prevent the strip
platting of land onto arterials as shown in the shaded area of
Figure 5-1 for the reasons as set forth below. No plat shall be
approved which provides for platting of lots fronting onto
arterials except in the limited case where owing to unusual
circumstances a variance is granted as provided in Section II
- 5 of these regulations.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-1.
Figure 5-1 shows some of the patterns of streets and lots that
might be possible in the development of areas in large, "rural
estates" type lots. In the shaded area is shown a frequent
approach to the creating of lots in rural settings. There are a
number of problems from the arrangement of lots in a road
frontage strip as in the shaded area, such as: 1. long narrow
parcels which are of reduced usefulness to the buyer, 2.
increased numbers of driveways intersecting arterials (this is
a problem for the County to keep ditches and culverts clean
and working), 3. the narrower lots result in closer spacing of
houses with less privacy and greater possibility of individual
sewer disposal system failures, and 4. the frontage of each
house upon an arterial street means greater exposure of the
dust, traffic, litter and drainage problems which occur (also
there is a loss of privacy, and the danger that the road may
have to be widened at some time in the future--taking part of
the front lawn). Some of the other styles of lot arrangements
can provide more usable shape, more privacy, safer traffic,
more workable utility layout, better spacing of buildings, etc.
From the standpoint of planning for the future there is one
major advantage to the unshaded lots over those in the
shaded area, street frontage, strip-type lots. That is,
development in rural areas such as this usually occurs without
the availability of public sewer (and sometimes without water).
However, at a later time these utilities are often made
available as the population of the area increases. Once
utilities are available there may be a desire to divide some of
the lots again. It can be seen that with the long narrow lots of
the street frontage type development, there is little that can be
done in the way of re-dividing a lot. On the other hand, the
more square shaped lots of the other layouts would be much
easier to change and divide. This has been proven to be of
value numerous times as towns have grown out and around
areas that were developed when they were "out in the
country".
Section 5-2. Design of Neighborhood Features.
A. STREETS. The purpose of classifying streets by
functions is to plan for future development in an
orderly fashion, to reduce the total long-term cost to
the public, and to improve mobility and safety on
streets by assessing street function for traffic
volume, speed, and land accesses. The
arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and
location of all streets shall conform to all of the
elements of the Comprehensive Plan and shall be
designed in accordance with the Street Inventory
and Street Standards for the City of Piedmont, as
amended, and with the following provisions:
1. Streets shall be planned to conform with the
street designations shown in the
comprehensive plan, subdivision regulations,
and zoning ordinance.
2. Whenever a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed major street, the
Planning Commission may require service
streets, reverse frontage with screen planting
contained in a non-access reservation along
the rear property line, deep lots, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to
afford separation from traffic.
3. Reserve strips controlling access to street
shall be prohibited except where their control
is placed in the City of Piedmont under
conditions approved by the Planning
Commission and acceptable to the subdivider.
4. Where the plat to be submitted includes only a
part of the tract owned or intended for
development by the subdivider, a tentative
plan of a proposed future street system for the
unsubdivided portion may be required by the
Planning Commission.
5. Where a tract is subdivided into larger than
normal building lots or parcels, such lots or
parcels shall be arranged to permit the logical
location and opening of future streets and
appropriate resubdivision, with provision for
adequate utility easements.
6. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than
one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be
avoided.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-1.
7. Street right-of-way must be dedicated before it
is occupied for private development so that
space will be available for future development
of the street. The classifying of streets by
functions and designating street right-of-way
widths will allow expansion of streets while still
maintaining traffic or existing streets. Right-ofway
widths shall be in accordance with the
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 19
planning documents and shall be not less than
the following:
Type of Street Right-of-Way Width
Arterial 100 feet
Collector 80 feet
Local 60 feet
The one hundred (100) feet right-of-way for an
arterial street is sufficient width to provide six
(6) through lanes plus median, if necessary;
four (4) lanes plus median with ample width for
bicycle and pedestrian movement, or for
parking along both sides. The eighty (80) feet
right-of-way for a collector street is sufficient
width to provide four (4) through lanes and a
median could be provided, if necessary. The
sixty (60) feet right-of-way for a local street is
sufficient width for two (2) through lanes with
parking on both sides with a border area for
landscaping. It could be connected to four (4)
lanes without parking, if necessary.
8. The paved width of all streets shall be
adequate to serve the existing and future
estimated traffic load for the facility. Lane
width for all streets shall be as follows:
i. All arterial streets shall have lanes for
traffic movement of not less than eleven
(11) feet or more than twelve (12) feet in
width, and lanes for parallel parking or
emergency stopping of not less than ten
(10) feet in width.
ii. All collector streets shall have lanes for
traffic movement of not less than nine (9)
feet or more than twelve (12) feet in width
and lanes for parallel parking of not less
than eight (8) feet in width. Streets should
be developed in accordance with the
standards shown in Section VI-5.
9. Cul-de-sacs shall contain a maximum of 30
residential lots or be a maximum of one
thousand feet (1,000’). No cul-de-sac longer
than 1,000 fee shall serve more than 30
residential lots without a secondary means of
egress. The radius of all cul-de-sac streets
shall be a minimum of sixty feet (60’) of paved
surface within the cul-de-sac.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-2.
10. Half streets shall be prohibited except where
essential to the reasonable development of
the subdivision in conformity with the other
requirements of these regulations; and
provided that the Planning Commission finds
it will be practical to obtain the dedication of
the other half of the street easement when the
adjoining property is subdivided. Wherever a
half street is adjacent to the tract being
subdivided, the other half of the street shall be
platted within the tract being subdivided.
11. The arrangement of streets shall be such as to
cause no hardship to the subdividing of
adjacent properties. The Planning
Commission may require the dedication of
street rights-of-way to facilitate the
development of adjoining properties.
12. No street names shall be used which will
duplicate or be confused with the names of
existing streets. Street names shall be subject
to the approval of the Planning Commission.
13. Local streets shall be laid out so that their use
by arterial traffic will be discouraged.
14. Streets shall intersect at approximately right
angles.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-3.
15. Street grades shall be as follows:
i. The minimum grade of all streets shall be
0.4%.
ii. Except where unusual topographic
conditions justify it, the maximum grade
of all streets shall not be greater than the
following:
Street Type Grade
Arterial 5%
Collector 7%
Local 10%
16. street corner shall be as follows:
i. Street corners on local residential streets
shall have a minimum radius of twenty
(20) feet at curb line or its equivalent.
ii. Street corners on collector streets shall
have a minimum radius of twenty-five
(25) feet at the curb line or its equivalent.
iii. Street intersections involving major
thoroughfares shall have a minimum
street corner radius of thirty (30) feet at
the curb line or its equivalent.
iv. In order to provide for traffic safety, there
shall be platted on each corner of each
intersection of two streets a sight triangle
which shall be described as a triangle
having twentyfive
(25) foot sides on
each of the street rights-of-way, or a
radius of twenty-five (25) feet. The plat or
the covenants of the addition shall clearly
prohibit any construction or planting of
landscaping materials that reach greater
than two (2) feet in height in this right-ofway.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-4.
17. Street lights shall be located in accordance
with the street light policy and guidelines
adopted by the City Council.
B. ALLEYS. Alleys shall be as follows:
1. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and
industrial districts, except that the Planning
Commission may waive this requirement
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 20
where other definite and assured provision is
made for service recess, such as off-street
loading, unloading and parking consistent with
and adequate for the uses proposed.
2. Alleys serving commercial and industrial areas
shall be not less than thirty (30) feet in width.
3. Alleys are not required for residential areas,
but when provided shall be not less than
twenty (25) feet in width.
4. Alley intersections and sharp changes in
alignment should be avoided, but where
necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently
to permit safe vehicular movement•
5. Dead-end alleys should be avoided, but if
necessary, shall be provided with adequate
turn around facilities at the dead end, as
determined by the Planning Commission.
C. EASEMENTS.
1. Where alleys are not provided, easements not
less than ten (10) feet wide shall be provided
along each rear lot line. A five (5) foot
easement along side lot lines of individual lots
may be required where necessary for use by
public and private utilities.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-5.
The Planning Commission may require air
rights and easements of greater width for the
extension of main storm and sewage disposal
systems and other utilities where it is deemed
necessary.
2. When a subdivision is adjacent to unplatted
land, the easements for public and private
utilities shall be:
i. Provided as twenty (20) feet wide on the
land being subdivided; or,
ii. Provided as ten (10) feet wide on the land
being subdivided with an easement ten
(10) feet wide being presented adjacent
and simultaneous to the presentation of
the final plat
D. BLOCKS.
1. The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks
shall be determined with due regard for the
following:
i. Provision of adequate building sites
suitable to the special needs of the type
of use contemplated.
ii. Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and
dimensions.
iii. Needs for convenient access, circulation,
control and safety of street traffic.
iv. Limitations and opportunities of
topography.
2. Blocks for residential use shall not be longer
than eighteen hundred (1800) feet, measured
along the center line of the block. When a
block extends six hundred (600) feet in length,
the Planning Commission may require a
dedicated easement not less than five (5) feet
in width and a paved crosswalk not less than
five (5) feet in width to provide pedestrian
access across the block.
3. Blocks used for residential purposes should
be of sufficient width to allow for two (2) tiers
of lots of appropriate depth (not less than two
hundred (200) feet in width). Blocks intended
for business and industrial use should be of a
width suitable for the intended use, with due
allowance for off-street parking and loading
facilities.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-6.
E. LOTS.
1. Residential lots shall be not less than seventyfive
(75) feet in width at the front building line
and shall abut a street a distance of not less
than thirty-five (35) feet.
2. The area of residential lots shall be not less
than seven thousand and five hundred (7,500)
square feet.
3. In residential subdivisions where individual
sewage disposal systems are to be installed,
the area of the lot shall be not less than
required under Section VI-8 of these
Regulations.
4. Lots are not required for subdivision for
commercial and industrial use, but when
provided should be of appropriate size and
arrangement to provide for adequate off-street
parking and loading facilities based on the
intended use.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-7.
5. Side lot lines should be approximately at right
angles or radial to street lines.
6. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots
should be avoided except where they are
needed to provide for the separation of
development from traffic arteries or to
overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation. A planting screen
easement of at least twenty (20) feet may be
required along the portion of the lots abutting
such a traffic artery or other use where
screening is required. There shall be no rightof-
access across a planting screen easement.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-8.
F. BUILDING LINES. Building lines shall be provided
for all residential subdivisions as follows:
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 21
1. A front building line shall be located twentyfive
(25) feet back of the street right-of-way
line.
2. A side yard building line on the side of a corner
lot abutting the street shall be located not less
than fifteen (15) feet back of the street right-ofway
when such lot is back to back with another
corner lot, and not less than twenty (20) feet
back of the street right-of-way line in every
other case.
3. A side yard building line shall be provided not
less than ten (10) feet back of a crosswalk
right-of-way line on the side of a lot abutting a
mid-block crosswalk .
4. Restrictions requiring buildings to be located
within the building lines shown on the plat shall
be set forth on the plat or on a separate
recorded instrument.
See Appendix A. Figure 5-2-9.
G. SIDEWALKS.
1. Residential Districts.
i. Sidewalks shall be required for all new
residential construction on all lots one (1)
acre or less on the frontage abutting
public streets. Unless required by final
plat, no sidewalks shall be required on
single-family residential lots larger than
one (1) acre used for residential
purposes having frontage on public
streets. All corner lots shall have
sidewalks installed on both street
frontages.
ii. Sidewalks shall also be required on any
residential property requiring curb and
gutter. However, any existing residential
property already under construction or
already in existence shall not be required
to install sidewalks pursuant to this
division.
iii. The Planning Commission shall
determine whether sidewalks shall be
required for the common grounds located
within any subdivision.
iv. If a sidewalk is required on a residential
lot, a sidewalk may, at the discretion of
the Planning Commission, be required on
any contiguous lots owned by the same
property owner.
v. When occupancy permits have been
issued for eighty percent (80%) of any
residential subdivision, the Developer
shall install sidewalks on all remaining
lots.
2. Commercial and Industrial Zoning Districts.
Sidewalks shall be installed for all new
construction within commercial and industrial
zones on all lots having frontage on public
streets. Sidewalks shall extend to the entrance
of said business.
3. Platted Subdivisions. Sidewalks shall be
required on all new subdivisions on public
streets which form the exterior boundary of
such subdivisions.
4. Location of Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be
constructed in the street right-of-way. All
sidewalks shall be built in accordance with
OKC Standards, Specifications and Standard
Details (See, OKC DWG 700). Meandering
sidewalks are also allowed and shall be part of
the site design for the development.
5. Time of Construction. Sidewalks shall be
required at the time of building permit and
completed before a certificate of occupancy is
issued provided, sidewalks on exterior
boundaries of platted subdivisions shall be
installed by the developer at the time of
installation of other plat improvements.
6. Existing Sidewalks. Existing sidewalks shall
not be removed except for the purpose of
replacement.
Section 5-2.1. Design of Neighborhood Features (Cul-de-
Sacs).
Cul-de-sacs shall contain a maximum of 30 residential lots or
be a maximum of one thousand feet (1,000’). No cul-de-sac
longer than 1,000 feet shall serve more than 30 residential lots
without a secondary means of egress. The radius of all culde-
sac streets shall be a minimum of sixty feet (60’) of paved
surface within the cul-de-sac.
Chapter VI. Land Improvements
Section 6-1. General Provisions.
All improvements shall be designed and installed in
accordance with all of the elements of the Comprehensive
Plan and shall meet the minimum standards established by
the ordinances and regulations relating thereto. Subdivider
shall reimburse the City of Piedmont for the cost of City's
engineering review. The cost shall be based on the fee
schedule.
Section 6-2. Plan Preparation.
Plans for the improvements herein required shall be prepared
by a qualified engineer, registered to practice in the State of
Oklahoma. Four (4) sets of prints of the purposed plans and
specifications for all improvements shall be filed with the City
Manager at the time of the submission of the Preliminary Plat.
With the Preliminary Plat subdivider may submit preliminary
construction plans or final construction plans. In the event the
subdivider submits preliminary construction plans, then the
final construction plans will be submitted to the Planning
Commission within six (6) months following approval by the
City Council of the Preliminary Plat and preliminary
construction plans. The preliminary construction plans shall
include drainage calculations and all public improvements, but
construction profiles are not required. Once the City Engineer
has approved the Preliminary Plat and construction plans
(either preliminary or final), then the notice of public hearing
required under Section III-1 of these Regulations will be
PIEDMONT SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
July 2020
Page | 22
mailed and the matter scheduled on the next available
Planning Commission agenda. This public hearing
requirement may be combined with the public hearing on any
required rezoning.
If preliminary construction plans are submitted and approved,
then the subdivider shall submit final construction plans
including construction profiles and Department of
Environmental Quality approvals for water and sewer lines at
least twenty (20) days prior to the Planning Commission
meeting at which the plans are scheduled for approval. The
final construction plans must be completed and approved by
the City's Engineer prior to placing the plans on the agenda
for approval.
Four (4) sets of "as built" plans and specifications, certified
and signed by an engineer registered to practice in the State
of Oklahoma, shall be filed with the City Manager prior to the
acceptance by the City Council of any improvement installed
by the subdivider.
Section 6-2A. Permits and Inspection Fees.
Prior to construction of any public improvements under these
regulations a permit shall be issued and a permit inspection
fee shall be paid at the time of application for the permit. This
fee shall be used to defray the cost of providing on-site
inspection of the public improvement. The fees shall be one
based on the fee schedule.
Section 6-3. Improvement Alternatives.
In lieu of completion of the improvements herein required, the
Planning Commission may require the subdivider to file an
executed surety bond using the form provided as Appendix H
of these regulations. These instruments shall be conveyed to
the Secretary of the Planning Commission, and he shall
deposit them with the City Clerk where after acceptance by
the City Council they shall be on file as the subdivider's good
and faithful assurance of the installation of surety, and shall
be based upon the fee schedule. The term of the bond shall
be until the completion of the installation of the improvements
according to the plans and specifications as approved by the
Planning Commission, but not to exceed two (2) years.
In lieu of filing the surety bond as outlined above and shown
in Appendix H to these regulations, the subdivider may secure
and place on deposit with the City Clerk an irrevocable Letterof-
Credit written by a bank certified to do business in the State
of Oklahoma. Such Letter-of-Credit shall be drawn in favor of
the City of Piedmont, shall be irrevocable for the surety term
of two (2) years, and shall be based on the fee schedule.
Section 6-4. Permanent Markers.
Each lot and block comer shall be marked with iron pipes or
pins not less than onehalf
inch(½") in diameter, and not less
than eighteen inches (18") long at least one inch (I") below the
finished grade.
Section 6-5. Street Improvements.
The subdivider of any subdivision designed to be used for
residential, commercial, industrial, and or other purposes shall
lay out, grade, and otherwise improve all streets that are
designated on the approved plat or that directly serve the
subdivision in accordance with the specifications of the City of
Piedmont Street Standards, and in accordance with the
following provisions:
A. The design of an improvement of an intersection of
any new street with the existing state or federal
highway shall be in accordance with the
specifications of the Oklahoma State Highway
Department, but in no case shall the standard be
less than the applicable specifications of the City of
Piedmont.
B. Whenever a subdivision contains an arterial that
requires a street facility that is more costly than is
required to serve the future occupants of the
subdivision (i.e. four-lane road or channelization of
intersection), the subdivider shall be required to pay
only the portion of the cost of the street that would
equal the cost of an improvement required to serve
only the subdivision, as determined by the
Piedmont Planning Commission and the City of
Piedmont. Proposed through streets shall be
extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be
subdivided. Subdivisions that adjoin existing streets
shall dedicate additional right-of-way width
requirements as set forth in Piedmont's Street
Standards and Inventory. No half street paving shall
be permitted on primary arterial streets unless
specifically authorized by the City Council.
C. Where the subdivision entry is on a collector or
arterial street, an acceleration and deceleration
lane shall also be constructed at developer's cost in
accordance with the approved City specifications
for a distance to be determined by the City
Engineer.
D. Where the improvement of the abutting arterial
street is not feasible as determined by the Planning
Commission and City Council, the developer shall,
in lieu of constructing the street improvements, pay
to the City a transportation fee to be determined as
follows:
1. A transportation fee based on the fee
schedule shall be paid by the developer at the
time of approval of the final plat.
2. All funds collected shall be placed in a nonfiscal,
capital improvement account to be used
exclusively for improvements to section line
road/arterial streets, abutting or directly
serving the subdivision.
E. A developer may, at his option, elect to improve the
full width of arterial streets abutting his subdivision
(developer is only legally responsible for paving
onehalf
of the arterial street). In that instance the
developer may submit a request for reimbursement
of the cost of the half street that is not his legal
responsibility to pave. The City Council may, in its
absolute discretion, agree to appropriate funds then
or later from the transportation fee account for such
reimbursement.
F. All driveways which connect with public or private
streets shall be constructed in accordance with
"Standard Design of Driveway Entrances for
Oklahoma Highways", as amended and prepared
by the Oklahoma State Department of
Transportation.
G. The regulations shall apply jointly with the adopted
standard construction details of streets of arterial,

provide more than one, but not all of, the
following amenities: private park, swimming
pool, clubhouse, pedestrian walkways, water

Department of Environmental Quality governing
water line construction adopted by the City of
Piedmont or the Piedmont Municipal Authority.
B. Water lines within subdivisions and required
extensions of existing water lines shall be six inches
(6") minimum in diameter. Greater line sizes may

system. Smaller line sizes may be permitted where
necessary to preserve water quality under such
unusual circumstances as recommended by the
City Engineer and approved by the Planning
Commission and City Council.
C. Fire hydrants shall be installed at such locations
determined by the Fire Chief/City Engineer.
Subdivisions not connected to the public water
supply shall provide fire hydrants on a minimum six
inch (6") water main within 1,000 feet of every lot in
the subdivision where adequate public water
service is available within 300 feet of any part of the
subdivision. Adequate public water service means
that the volume and pressure at the location of the
tap has adequate flow and pressure to meet
minimum fire flow requirements.
Section 6-8. Sewage Disposal Systems.
A. The developer shall connect to the municipal
sewage disposal system if the boundary of the lot
or tract is within three hundred (300) feet of a
municipal sewage lateral or main (Ordinance #100).
If the boundary of the lot or tract is not within three
hundred (300) feet of a municipal sewage lateral or
main, the developer shall install a residential
sewage disposal system and construct it in
accordance with the Oklahoma State Department
of Environmental Quality Rules and Regulations
governing residential sewage disposal systems.
B. When subdivisions contain ten (10) acres or more,
the Piedmont Planning Commission may require
the subdivider to install a sewage disposal system
that is adequate to serve all of the lots within the
subdivision.
Section 6-9. Maintenance and Supervision.
A. Where the subdivision contains sewer, sewage
treatment plants, water supply systems, or other
physical facilities necessary or desirable for the
welfare of the area, or that are of common use or
benefit which are not or cannot be satisfactorily
maintained by an existing public agency, provision
shall be made which is acceptable to the Planning
Commission and the City Council for the proper and
continuous operation, maintenance, and
supervision of such facilities.
B. Prior to issuance of a permit for subdivision
improvements the subdivider shall be required to
post a maintenance bond for the subject
improvements. This bond shall be for the assurance
of the servicing of facilities installed, and shall be
given as an irrevocable guarantee. The term of
maintenance bonds shall be one (1) year on water
and sewer improvements, and five (5) years on
street and drainage improvements. The amount of
the bonds shall be based on the fee schedule. In
the cases of street and drainage improvements the
bond shall be based on the fee schedule. The time
frames of the bonds shall begin to run upon the date
of acceptance by the City Council. These
maintenance bonds shall be irrevocable. In lieu of
filing of the abovestated
maintenance bond the
subdivider may secure and place on deposit with
the City Clerk an irrevocable Letter-of-Credit written
by a bank certified to do business in the State of
Oklahoma. Such Letter-of-Credit shall be drawn in
favor of the City of Piedmont and shall be
irrevocable for the stated term. In addition, the
contractor for the subdivision improvements will
provide general liability insurance limits of
$1,000,000.00 and worker's compensation
coverage with statutory limits. The proof of
insurance shall be in the form of a certificate naming
Piedmont as Certificate holder, and providing for
fifteen (15) days notice of cancellation or nonrenewal.
