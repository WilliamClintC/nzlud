1. Sexual Harassment Policy of the Borough of Emmaus.
A. Background. Section 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 VII, 42 U.S.C.
§ 2000e-2(a) provides:
It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer 
. . . to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to
his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,
because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin[.]
§ 1-106 EMMAUS CODE § 1-107
FWD:12
In 1980, the EEOC issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment
a violation of § 703 of Title VII, establishing criteria for
determining when unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature
constitutes sexual harassment, defining the circumstances under
which an employer may be held liable and suggesting affirmative
steps an employer should take to prevent sexual harassment. This
policy is enacted by the Borough of Emmaus which the intention of
complying with the statutory provisions and the "Policy Guidelines
on Sexual Harassment" published by the EEOC (N-915-050, 3/19/
90 and subsequent revisions.)
B. Scope. This policy covers all public officials and employees of the
Borough of Emmaus including, volunteer, part-time and seasonal
employees.
C. Definitions.
(1) Sexual Harassment. Title VII does not prohibit all conduct of a
sexual nature in the workplace. Thus, it is crucial to clearly
define sexual harassment: only unwelcome sexual conduct that
is a term or condition of employment constitutes a violation. 29
CFR 1604.11(a). The EEOC's guidelines define two types of
sexual harassment: "quid pro quo" and "hostile environment."
The guidelines provide that "unwelcome" sexual conduct
constitutes sexual harassment when "submission to such
conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or
condition of an individual's employment," 29 CFR
1604.11(a)(1). "Quid pro quo harassment" occurs when
"submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is
used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such
individual," 29 CFR 1604.11(a)(2). The EEOC's guidelines also
recognize that unwelcome sexual conduct that "unreasonably
interfer[es] with an individual's job performance" or creates an
"intimidating, hostile or offense working environment" can
constitute sex discrimination, even if it leads to no tangible or
economic job consequences.
(2) Unwelcome Conduct. Sexual harassment is "unwelcome . . .
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature . . ." 29 CFR
1604.11(a). Because sexual attraction may often play a role in
the day to day social exchange between employees, "the
distinction between invited, uninvited-but-welcome, offensivebut-
tolerated, and flatly rejected" sexual advances may well be
difficult to discern. Barnes v. Costle, 561 F.2d 983, (D.C. Cir.
1976). But this distinction is essential because sexual conduct
becomes unlawful only when it is unwelcome. In Henson v. City
of Dundee, 682F.2d at 903, the Eleventh Circuit provided a
general definition of "unwelcome conduct" as: the challenged
conduct must be unwelcome "in the sense that the employee
§ 1-107 FOREWORD § 1-107
FWD:13
did not solicit or incite it, and in the sense that the employee
regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive."
D. Restatement of Policy. Emmaus Borough values our employees and
volunteers and is committed to providing a safe and secure
workplace. It continues to be the policy of the Borough that sexual
harassment of employees, elected and appointed officials,
volunteers, seasonal employees or applicants for employment is
unacceptable conduct which will not be tolerated by the Borough.
Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome sexual advances,
requests for sexual favors and other verbal, visual or physical
conduct of a sexual nature. No supervisor or other employee shall
threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that another
employee's or applicant's refusal to submit to sexual advances will
adversely affect that person's employment, work status, evaluation,
wages, advancement, duty assignments, shifts or any other
condition of employment or career development. Similarly, no
employee shall promise, imply or grant any preferential treatment
in connection with another employee or applicant engaging in
sexual conduct or the promise thereof.
E. Reporting and Complaint Procedure. Any employee or volunteer
who feels that he or she is a victim of sexual harassment by any
supervisor, management official, other employee or any other
person in connection with employment or service with the Borough
should bring the matter to the immediate attention of their
supervisor and complete and sign an incident report. An employee
who is uncomfortable for any reason in bringing such matter to the
attention of his or her supervisor should report the matter and
submit the incident report to the Borough Manager. Any questions
about this policy or potential sexual harassment should also be
brought to the attention of the same persons. The Borough will
promptly investigate all allegations of sexual harassment in a
manner which will protect the confidentiality of the persons
involved as much as possible during the investigation and take
appropriate corrective action, up to and including dismissal from
position, if warranted.
F. Sanctions, Discipline, Dismissal Resulting from Violation of Policy.
Any employee or volunteer who is determined, after an
investigation, to have engaged in sexual harassment in violation of
this policy will be subject to appropriate sanctions up to and
including termination. In the event of suspension, reassignment,
loss of salary, loss of position or termination of employment, the
Borough shall follow the applicable provisions of the collective
bargaining agreement, if any, or the disciplinary procedures of the
Borough if contractual provisions do not apply.
G. Education and Questions Regarding Policy. The Borough Manager

§ 1-354 EMMAUS CODE § 1-354
FWD:42
(3) It is understood that MPOETC also administers a physical
fitness test for its applicants. The applicant must also pass the

abilities. Within 30 days following the oral examination, applicants
whose scores are passing shall be informed of their numerical
scores on the oral examination as well as their numerical score on

physical fitness testing if not already administered.
7. Veterans' Preference Points. Pursuant to the Soldiers Preference Act,4
any applicant for the position of Patrol Officer who qualifies as a
"soldier" under the Act shall receive an additional 10 points on top of
his total score if the applicant received passing scores under
Subsections 4 and 6. Any applicant requesting veterans' preference
points must furnish sufficient proof of both service and honorable
discharge in accordance with instructions from the Commission in
order to be eligible to receive the veterans' preference points.
8. Background Investigation - Polygraph Examination.
A. As part of the background investigation process, an applicant who
has successfully completed the requirements of § 1-354,
Subsections 1 through 7, of the Rules and Regulations, and is
4. Editor's Note: See 51 Pa.C.S.A. § 7101 et seq.
§ 1-354 FOREWORD § 1-354
FWD:43
determined to be one of the top three applicants pursuant to the
requirements of § 1-354, Subsection 9F, of the Rules and
Regulations, shall be administered a polygraph examination. The
Commission shall require an applicant to take and pass a polygraph
examination as a condition of further eligibility prior to the
completion of the remainder of the background process. The party
administering the polygraph examination shall be a qualified
professional who shall be appointed by the Commission. The
polygraph examiner shall render an opinion in writing to the Chief
of Police as to whether the conditional appointee has adequately
completed the polygraph examination. The polygraph examiner's
opinion concerning the applicant will address whether that party
has any issues which call into question the person's character,
history, records and other information revealed by the polygraph
examination which would call into question that person's ability to
perform the functions and tasks of a police officer in an appropriate
manner. In the instances where the polygraph examiner does not
suggest a "pass" or "fail" of the exam, the polygraph examiner
shall indicate any and all "significant responses" with a detailed
explanation of the response. The Commission shall have the sole
discretion as to the passing or failing of a candidate's polygraph
examination based on the report submitted by the polygraph
examiner.
B. Failure of the polygraph examination disqualifies the applicant
from any further consideration and shall result in the removal of
the applicant from the eligibility list. However, within 10 days after
notice of the applicant's failure of said polygraph examination, the
person may request, in writing, to the Borough Manager, a second
polygraph examination. The applicant must prepay 100% of the
costs related to such re-examination. Failure to request and pay for
such polygraph reexamination as set forth above shall conclusively
mean that that person has not met a condition of the background
investigation and he shall no longer be considered.
C. If an applicant fails the polygraph examination, the next eligible
applicant, based on the weighted scores pursuant to § 1-354,
Subsection 2, of the rules, and who has successfully completed all
requirements of § 1-354, Subsections 1 through 7, of the Rules and
Regulations, shall be administered a polygraph examination. This
process shall continue in order of the eligibility list, based on
weighted scores, until such time that there are three eligible
applicants for further consideration.
9. Background Investigation.
A. Pursuant to the applicant successfully passing the polygraph
examination requirements in Subsection 8 above, the Commission
shall request the Chief of Police or the Chief's designee to conduct
a background investigation on each applicant who has passed the
written examination, oral examination, physical fitness test, and
§ 1-354 EMMAUS CODE § 1-354
FWD:44
polygraph examination. The background investigation shall
include, whenever reasonable or practicable, interviews with the
applicant's family, acquaintances, current and former employers,
current and former neighbors, references and current and/or
former teachers and school officials. In addition, the applicant's
record of criminal convictions shall be investigated. The applicant
may be interviewed directly when the information collected during
the background investigation requires clarification or explanation.
B. The Chief or his designee shall request a credit check on all
applicants that have passed the written, oral, physical fitness
testing, and polygraph examination. This information shall be
reviewed to determine whether, in the Chief or his designee's
discretion, the applicant's credit history is unsatisfactory so as to
possibly affect police work. The applicant may be interviewed
directly when the information collected during the credit check
investigation requires clarification or explanation.
C. After the background investigation is completed, the Chief, or his
designee, shall make a written recommendation to the Commission
on whether the applicant is appropriate for consideration for
appointment as a police officer.
D. This recommendation shall be in writing and if the
recommendation is to disqualify, then a detailed written
explanation of the reasons for disqualification must be included.
The Commission shall make the final determination on whether the
information collected during the background investigation
warrants rejection of the applicant.
E. Within 30 days after the Commission considers the
recommendation of the Chief of Police or his designee, each
applicant will be informed of whether he has passed the
background investigation.
F. The Chief of Police or the Chief's designee shall report the results
of the background examiner to the Commission in segments of
three at the election of the Commission. If the Commission requests
background investigations, the Chief shall begin his background
investigations on the applicants with the top three scores
(including, where applicable, veterans' preference points). When
requested by the Commission, the Chief will then proceed
sequentially with additional applicants until such time that there
are three successful eligible applicants. The process shall continue
with applicants having the next highest scores until the
Commission is satisfied that it has an appropriate number of
passing applicants for the current opening and/or all projected
openings, provided that there are either three eligible applicants
for certification or, if there are not enough applicants to fill the
requirement of three, that all eligible applicants have been
processed.

FWD:45
§ 1-355. Certification of the List of Eligible Applicants and
Appointment. [Ord. No. 1189, 4/15/2019]
G. During the background investigation, there may be instances
where the Chief of Police and/or his appointed investigative team
may require additional information regarding an applicant's
background. Investigators shall have the right to conduct
fingerprint-based criminal history checks on any and all applicants
during the background investigation.
1. Creation of Eligibility List.
A. At the completion of the examination requirements set forth in
§ 1-354, written examination, oral examination, background
investigation and physical fitness test, the Commission shall rank
the applicants who have satisfied the requirements for
appointment on an eligibility list. The eligibility list shall contain
the names of the individuals eligible for appointment listed from
highest to lowest based on their scores on the examinations
administered by the Commission and any points for which the
applicant was entitled by virtue of 51 Pa.C.S.A. Ch. 71 (relating to
veterans' preference). In the case of tied scores, the tie will be
broken by giving preference to the applicant who has the highest
oral score. If both are tied, then the applicants will draw lots to
determine the eligibility list ranking.
B. At the election of the Commission, the eligibility list shall be
certified, beginning with a segment of the top three applicants,
based upon the receipt of the results of the background
investigation as set forth in § 1-354, Subsections 8 and 9, including
all other requirements of § 1-354 of the Rules and Regulations. The
certified list shall initially consist of three applicants and the same
shall be valid immediately without awaiting results from the
background investigations of the lower-scoring applicants. The
Commission shall add to the certification list further names upon
receipt and review of the results of the subsequent background
investigations on the remaining successful applicants.
C. The eligibility list shall be valid for one year from the date the
Commission approves the whole list or, if segmented, from the date
of approval of the first group of applicants. The eligibility list shall
include all applicants that have successfully completed all
requirements of § 1-354, Subsections 1 through 7, of the Rules and
Regulations. Before the expiration of the original first year, the
Commission may, at its sole discretion, by a vote of the majority of
the Commission at a duly authorized Commission meeting, extend
the list for up to an additional 12 months. The Commission may, at
its sole discretion, void an eligibility list at any time for any reason.
2. Removal from Eligibility List.
§ 1-354 EMMAUS CODE § 1-355
FWD:46
A. If a person on the eligibility list fails to respond to a notice sent to
that party's current address on file with the Commission or fails to
appear for any scheduled testing or interviews, that party's name
shall be removed from the eligibility list upon action of the
Commission.
B. If a person no longer desires to remain on the eligibility list, that
person shall notify the Commission of the same and the
Commission shall remove that person's name from the list.
C. The name of a person appearing on the eligibility list shall be
removed if that person declines or fails the additional testing for a
conditional appointment to a permanent position in the Police
Department.
D. The name of a person appearing on the eligibility list shall be
removed by the Commission if that person indicated availability for
appointment and is so appointed but fails to report for duty at the
time prescribed, unless, in the opinion of Borough Council, such
person can show good and sufficient reason for failing to report.
E. The Commission may, at its own discretion, remove from the
eligibility list the name of any person certified for appointment
consideration and rejected (or not hired) three times.
F. In the event of any of the above after the Commission takes action
to remove the person's name from the eligibility list, it shall notify
the person in writing of that person's removal from the list.
G. The name of the person appearing on the eligibility list shall be
removed from the list if that person is conditionally appointed to a
position in the Police Department and no notice to the person
conditionally appointed shall be necessary.
3. Appeals from Removal from Eligibility List. Any person on the eligibility
list who is aggrieved by removal therefrom may request a hearing, in
writing, before the Civil Service Commission within 10 days after notice
of the same. Failure to make such a request within the aforesaid time
frame is a waiver of the person's right of appeal. The Civil Service
Commission will appoint a time and place for a public hearing within 10
days if possible, at which time the Commission shall take testimony and
review the decision to remove the applicant from the eligibility list. The
person removed from the eligibility list may have any attorney present.
A representative appointed by Borough Council may present the case
on behalf of the Borough. The decision of the Commission shall be final.
4. Certified List of Applicants.
A. The certified list of applicants shall include the applicants who have
the three highest weighted scores in the written and oral
examinations, with consideration of veterans' preference, and have
successfully completed all requirements of § 1-354 of the Rules and
§ 1-355 FOREWORD § 1-355
FWD:47
Regulations. The certification list may include more than three
applicants pursuant to the requirements of § 1-355, Subsection 1,
of the Rules and Regulations.
B. The applicants who have the three highest weighted scores and
have successfully completed all requirements of § 1-354 of the
Rules and Regulations shall be certified by the Commission for
consideration of employment by Borough Council.
C. Should any of the top three applicants remove their name from the
eligibility list or become ineligible pursuant to the Rules and
Regulations, the Commission shall process additional applicants in
accordance with § 1-354, Subsections 8 and 9, until such time that
there shall be three certified applicants.
D. If, for any reason, there are not enough eligible applicants to meet
the requirement of three certified applicants, the Commission may
certify and refer less than three applicants for Borough Council's
consideration.
5. Appointment.
A. Borough Council may fill any vacancy in an existing position in the
Police Department which occurs as a result of expansion of the
police force, retirement, resignation, disability or death by the
reappointment or reinstatement of a former employee of the Police
Department who had been furloughed. Except for physical and
psychological examinations, no other testing shall be required for a
furloughed employee or a rehired or reappointed employee.
B. If no furlough list exists or if positions remain to be filled after all of
the officers on the furlough list were offered reemployment, every
position, except that of Chief of Police, shall be filled only in the
following manner:
(1) Borough Council shall notify the Commission of any vacancy
which is to be filled and shall request the certification of three
names from the eligibility list;
(2) If three names are not available, then the Commission shall
certify the names(s) remaining on the list pursuant to the
requirements of successfully completing § 1-354, Subsections
8 and 9, of the Rules and Regulations;
(3) Borough Council may make a conditional appointment from
one of the three names certified based solely on the merits and
fitness of the applicants. However, when one of the three
applicants on the certified list is a veteran, that applicant shall
be given conditional hiring preference;
(4) Borough Council may, at its sole discretion, appoint any
applicant who has passed the required examinations for
§ 1-355 EMMAUS CODE § 1-355
FWD:48
appointment (or promotion) although the applicant's name
does not appear on the certified list of three when the
applicant qualifies for veterans' preference.
C. Borough Council may object to one or more of the persons certified
for the reasons set forth in § 1-353, Subsection 12, and/or § 1-355,
Subsection 2, of the Rules and Regulations. If the applicant to
whom Borough Council objects fails to timely exercise the rights of
appeal under § 1-355, Subsection 3, or if the Commission declines
to uphold the appeal, the Commission shall strike the name of that
applicant from the eligibility list and certify the next highest name
for inclusion on the list of three applicants for each name stricken
off.
6. Physical and Psychological Medical Examinations. After Borough
Council selects an applicant from the eligibility list, the applicant shall
receive a conditional offer of employment to the position.
A. The offer of employment shall be conditioned upon the conditional
appointee undergoing a physical and psychological medical
examination and a determination that the conditional appointee is
capable of performing all the essential functions of the position
including Act 120 certification. Physical medical examinations shall
be under the direction of a physician or other qualified medical
professional. Psychological medical examinations shall be under
the direction of a psychiatrist or psychologist.
B. The physician or other qualified medical professional and the
psychiatrist or psychologist shall be appointed by Council and shall
render an opinion as to whether the conditional appointee has a
physical or mental condition which calls into question the person's
ability to perform all of the essential functions of the position for
which the person was conditionally appointed.
C. If the opinion rendered by the physician, other qualified medical
professional, psychiatrist or psychologist calls into question the
conditional appointee's ability to perform all essential functions of
a position, a person designated by Council shall meet with the
conditional appointee for the purpose of having one or more
interactive discussions on whether the conditional appointee can,
with or without reasonable accommodation, perform all the
essential functions of the position.
D. If, at the conclusion of the interactive discussion under Subsection
6C, Council determines that the conditional appointee is not
qualified, the appointing officer or body shall give written notice to
the conditional appointee and the Commission.
E. Nothing in this act shall be construed to authorize physical or
psychological medical examinations prior to conditional
appointment.
§ 1-355 FOREWORD § 1-355
FWD:49
F. As used in this subsection, the following definitions shall apply:
MEDICAL EXAMINATION  An examination, procedure, inquiry
or test designed to obtain information about medical history or a
physical or mental condition which might disqualify an applicant
if it would prevent the applicant from performing, with or without
a reasonable accommodation, all of the essential functions of the
position.
PHYSICIAN  Has the meaning given to it in 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1991
(relating to definitions).
QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL  An individual, in
collaboration with or under the supervision or direction of a
physician, as may be required by law, who is licensed:
As a physician assistant pursuant to the Act of December 20,
1985 (P.L. 457, No. 112), known as the "Medical Practice Act
of 1985,"5 or the Act of October 5, 1978 (P.L. 1109, No. 261),
known as the "Osteopathic Medical Practice Act";6 or
(1)
As a certified registered nurse practitioner pursuant to the Act
of May 22, 1951 (P.L. 317, No. 69), known as "The Professional
Nursing Law."7
(2)
7. Failure of Conditional Appointee to Pass All Conditions.
A. Borough Council, when making a conditional appointment, shall
include as conditions of the appointment passage of a physical
examination and mental examination. Borough Council may include
such other conditions as it deems appropriate.
B. Failure of the conditional appointee to pass all conditions imposed
by Council within the time frames set forth in their appointment
shall result in that person's immediate termination from any
further consideration for appointment as a police officer with the
Borough. A person who has failed one of the conditions may
request an opportunity to meet and discuss that person's failure of
the condition with Borough Council. Borough Council has the
option to grant such meeting and it may take any appropriate steps
concerning further opportunities for the conditional appointee. It is
specifically understood that such meeting with Borough Council is
not an appeal nor is Council bound to take any steps whatsoever.
The failure of the condition set by Council as a condition of
employment automatically ends the conditional appointee's status
with the Borough.

FWD:50
A. Newly Hired Officer.
(1) Every successful applicant to the position of Patrol Officer
position within the Police Department shall serve a twelvemonth
probationary period commencing upon the swearing in
of the officer. For newly hired police officers, the one-year
probationary period shall not commence until after the officer
has completed training under Act 120 and receives a
certification number. During the probationary period, a newly
hired officer may only be dismissed for cause for the reasons
set forth in § 1-356, Subsection 1. However, at the end of the
twelve-month probationary period, if the conduct of the
probationer has not been satisfactory to the Borough of
Emmaus, and after a public vote of Borough Council, the
probationer shall be notified in writing by the Borough
Manager or his designee that the appointment will not be
permanent and the appointment shall cease. At that time, a
newly hired officer's employment shall end. Any officer, who is
not informed in writing of dismissal, shall receive a permanent
appointment to the new position. Any probationer who is
notified in writing that appointment will not be made
permanent has no rights of appeal under the Rules and
Regulations.
B. Newly Promoted Officer.
(1) Every successful applicant to a promotional position within the
Police Department shall serve a twelve-month probationary
period commencing upon the swearing in of the officer in the
new rank. A promoted officer, during probation, may be
returned to a prior rank only for cause for the reasons set forth
in § 1-356, Subsection 1, or because of incapacity for duty due
to the use of alcohol or drugs. However, at the end of the
twelve-month probationary period, if the conduct of the
probationer has not been satisfactory to the Borough of
Emmaus, and after a public vote of Borough Council, the
probationer shall be notified in writing by the Borough
Manager or his designee that the appointment will not be
permanent and the appointment shall cease. At that time, a
promoted officer shall return to a previous rank. Any officer,
who is not informed in writing of dismissal, shall receive a
permanent appointment to the new position. Any probationer
who is notified in writing that appointment will not be made
permanent has no rights of appeal under the Rules and
Regulations.
9. Provisional Appointments. Whenever there are urgent reasons for the
filling of a vacancy in any position in the Police Department and there
are no names on the eligibility list for such appointment, Borough
Council may nominate a person to the Commission for noncompetitive
examination, and such nominee may be certified by the Commission as
§ 1-355 FOREWORD § 1-355
FWD:51
§ 1-356. Suspension, Removals and Reductions in Rank. [Ord. No.
1189, 4/15/2019]
qualified after such noncompetitive examination, and may be appointed
provisionally to fill such vacancy. It shall thereupon become the duty
of the Commission, within three weeks of the provisional appointment,
to hold a competitive examination and certify a list of persons and
then a regular appointment shall then be made from the name or
names submitted by the Commission; provided that nothing within this
section shall prevent the appointment, without examination, of persons
temporarily as police officers in cases of riot or other emergency.
10. Academy Training. If an applicant for conditional appointment is
required to attend the academy to become Act 120 certified before
being sworn in as a police officer, the Borough will make it part of the
conditional offer of employment that the applicant will have the cost of
tuition and expenses for his taking the Act 120 coursework for
certification be deducted from his salary (to the extent not paid by the
state or any other agency). Borough Council shall determine the
amount of temporary salary, if any, to be paid to a conditionally
employed applicant who is not Act 120 certified until he is sworn in as a
police officer. Consistent with the CBA, all calculation of benefits will
only occur after the police officer is sworn in and begins work as a
police officer.
1. Grounds for Disciplinary Action.
A. No person employed in the police force of the Borough covered by
civil service shall be suspended without pay, removed or reduced in
rank except for the following reasons:
(1) Physical or mental disability affecting the person's ability to
continue in service, in which case the officer shall receive an
honorable discharge from service;
(2) Neglect or violation of any official duty;
(3) Violation of any law which provides that the violation
constitutes a misdemeanor or felony;
(4) Inefficiency, neglect, intemperance, immorality, disobedience
of orders or conduct unbecoming an officer;
(5) Intoxication while on duty;
(6) Engaging or participating in or conducting of any political or
election campaign while on duty or in uniform or while using
Borough property otherwise than to exercise the person's own
right of suffrage;
§ 1-355 EMMAUS CODE § 1-356
FWD:52
(7) Engaging or participating in the conduct of a political or
election campaign for an incompatible office as provided in
Section 1104(f) of the Borough Code.8
B. A person so employed shall not be removed for religious, racial or
political reasons.
C. A written statement of any charges made against any person so
employed shall be furnished to the person within five days after the
same are filed. The person so employed shall have 10 days from the
date of receiving the notice in which to submit a written request for
a hearing to the Civil Service Commission.
2. Furloughs.
A. If for reasons of economy or other police officers in the department,
then the Borough shall furlough the person or persons, including
probationers, last appointed to the respective force. Such removal
shall be accomplished by furloughing in numerical order
commencing with the person last appointed until such reduction
shall have been accomplished.
B. In the event said police force shall again be increased, the
employees furloughed shall be reinstated in the order of their
seniority in the service. The provisions of this subsection as to
reduction in forces are not applicable to the Chief of Police.
3. Removal of Names from Furlough Lists.
A. In addition to other reasons stated as grounds for removal in the
Rules and Regulations, the name of a person appearing on a
furlough list shall be removed by the Commission if that person:
(1) Is appointed to a position in the Police Department; or
(2) Declines an appointment to a permanent position in the Police
Department; or
(3) Indicated availability for appointment and is so appointed but
fails to report for duty at the time prescribed, unless, in the
opinion of Borough Council, such person can show good and
sufficient reason for failing to report.
B. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall be construed as
authorizing the removal of the name of a person from a furlough list
who refuses to accept a position of lower rank than that from which
furloughed.
4. Notice of Suspension, Removal or Reduction in Rank.
8. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 46104(f).
§ 1-356 FOREWORD § 1-356
FWD:53
A. Whenever a police officer is suspended without pay, removed or
reduced in rank, the specific charges warranting such actions shall
be stated in writing by the Borough Council or the Mayor. The
charges shall be stated clearly and in sufficient detail to enable the
officer to understand the charges and to allow the officer an
opportunity to respond to those charges. The charges shall specify
the clause of Subsection 1 which provides the basis for the
disciplinary action as well as an explanation of the factual
circumstances upon which the appointing authority relied in
finding a violation of Subsection 1.
B. Within seven days after Borough Council has voted or the Mayor
has determined to impose the disciplinary action, a written
statement of the charges shall be delivered to the officer either by
personal service or by certified and regular mail. In addition, the
charges shall notify the officer of the right to appeal under § 1-356,
Subsection 1, of the Rules and Regulations. A copy of the statement
of charges shall also be served upon the members of the Civil
Service Commission.
5. Appeals/Hearings on Suspension Pay, Removal or Reduction in Rank.
All appeals of disciplinary actions for full-time police officers (police
covered by the current CBA) will be handled in accord with the terms of
the CBA (collective bargaining agreement). If, for any reason, the
disciplinary actions are not covered by the CBA or in the future are
removed from the CBA (or are held to be required under civil service
law), then the disciplinary appeals will be heard by the Civil Service
Commission in accordance with the following Rules and Regulations:
A. The officer who has been suspended, removed or reduced in rank
may appeal the decision of the disciplinary authority by written
notice to the Secretary of the Commission at Borough Hall
requesting a hearing. This request shall be received by the
Borough Manager within 10 days after the officer received notice
of the discipline. The officer may prepare written responses to any
charges filed not later than the date fixed for the hearing. Failure of
the officer to provide written responses to any of the charges shall
not be deemed an admission by the officer.
B. The Commission shall schedule a hearing within 10 days from the
officer's written request for a hearing unless continued by the
Commission for cause at the request of the Commission, Borough
Council or the officer. At any such hearing, the officer against
whom the charges have been made may be present and
represented by counsel, may call witnesses and present testimony
and documentation in his defense. Borough Council may also be
represented by counsel, call witnesses and present evidence as is
necessary to support the charges. A stenographic record of all
testimony shall be taken at every hearing and preserved by the
Commission. In the event the charges are dismissed, the record
shall be sealed and not be available for public inspection.
§ 1-356 EMMAUS CODE § 1-356
FWD:54
C. In conducting the hearing, the Commission's standard of review
shall be to determine whether substantial evidence has been
presented to support the reason for the disciplinary action. If the
Commission finds that sufficient evidence has been introduced to
support the charge, the Commission shall not modify the penalty
imposed by the Borough Council unless it finds that the penalty
imposed was arbitrary, discriminatory or an abuse of the Borough's
discretion. In considering the appropriateness of the discipline, the
Commission shall not substitute its judgment for that of the
Borough Council. The Commission may request post hearing briefs,
and shall issue a written decision containing specific findings of
fact and conclusions of law within 60 days of receipt of the hearing
transcript. Either the officer or the Borough has the right to appeal
the decision of the Commission to the Court of Common Pleas.
6. Hearing Procedure on Suspension, Removal or Reduction in Rank.
A. All testimony shall be given under oath administered by the
Chairperson. The Commission shall have the power to issue
subpoenas as set forth in § 1-352, Subsection 13.
B. Unless the Council or the person sought to be suspended, removed
or reduced in rank requests that the proceedings before the
Commission be open to the public, the proceedings before the
Commission, pursuant to this section (concerning hearings on
suspension, removal or reduction in rank) shall be held in the
nature of a closed executive session that shall not be open to the
public. Any such request shall be presented to the Commission
before the civil service hearing commences.
C. The deliberations of the Commission, including interim rulings on
evidentiary or procedural issues, may be held in private and shall
not be subject to a request for being open to the public, the Council
or the person sought to be suspended, removed or reduced in rank.
The Commission's disposition of the disciplinary action shall
constitute an official action which shall occur at a public meeting
held pursuant to 65 Pa.C.S.A. Chapter 7 (relating to open
meetings).
D. If the Commission sustains the charges, the officer who was
suspended, removed or reduced in rank may file an appeal with the
Court of Common Pleas within 30 days from the date of entry by the
Commission of its final order. No order of suspension shall be made
by the Commission for a period longer than one year. In the event
that the Commission fails to uphold the charges, then the person
sought to be suspended, removed or demoted shall be reinstated
with full pay for the period of the suspension, removal or demotion
and no charges related to the suspension, removal or reduction in
rank shall be officially recorded in the officer's record.

take such testimony as may be offered and render a written decision.
The decision of the Commission shall be final.

shall present his/her notice and photo I.D., or valid motor vehicle
operator's license to the examiner before being examined.
B. Failure to report for an examination in accordance with the
instructions contained in the notice shall be a cause for
disqualification, absent a waiver of such requirement by the
Commission upon good cause shown. The decision of the
Commission on any waiver request shall be final and binding.
2. Examination Process. Examination for promotion shall consist of a
written examination and an oral examination. Questions in the written
and oral examinations shall be practical in nature and fairly test the

examination shall be 70% on each segment. Any applicant who fails to
attain the minimum passing score on any examination shall be
disqualified from further consideration for promotion and his/her name

40% of the written examination score and 60% of the oral examination
score to obtain the final score. Veterans' preference shall not be added
for calculation of promotional eligibility lists.
4. Notice of Applicant's Grade. When the grading of each examination is
completed, the Secretary shall give each applicant written notice of his/
her grade. Any applicant not receiving a passing grade on any
examination is disqualified from continuing in the selection process for
the position for which he/she applied.
5. Administration of Examinations. Administration of the written and oral
examinations and the evaluations of the service records and
performance shall be the responsibility of the Commission. The

reserving the right to accept or reject for cause, in whole or in part, the
recommendations, evaluations and conclusions provided by such
agencies or individuals.

7. Breaking Tie Scores. When two or more eligible applicants receive the
same final overall score, the order in which the names of such persons
appear on the eligibility list shall be determined by giving preference to
the applicant who has the highest oral score. If a tie exists, the final tiebreaker
shall be the length of service of each applicant.
8. Eligibility List. When all examinations and evaluations have been
completed and final overall scores have been computed, the
Commission shall prepare a promotion eligibility list.
1. Certification of Promotion. Upon receipt of a request from Borough
Council for certification of a list of eligible applicants for promotion to
the rank specified, the Commission shall certify the names of the top
three persons, or a lesser number if three are not available, on the
promotion eligibility list for the rank to be filled.
2. Promotional Appointment. When Borough Council receives the certified
list of eligible applicants from the Commission, it may elect to make an
appointment from such list of eligible applicants, unless it makes
objections to the Commission. Should such objections be sustained by
the Commission, the Commission shall remove the name of such person
from the eligibility list and certify the next highest person on the list.
After an appointment is made, the names of those persons not
appointed shall be returned to the eligibility list unless removed for
cause as stated above.

that the Commission certify the nomination by subjecting the nominee
to a noncompetitive examination administered by the Commission.

3. Examination Procedure. If Borough Council elects to allow the nominee
to be covered by civil service protection, the nominee shall take both a
written examination and an oral examination.
A. The written examination administered to the nominee shall be of
such a nature as to fairly and thoroughly evaluate that person's
police job knowledge. The Commission shall select the type of

deduction to be matched by payments by the Borough of Emmaus to be

provisions of the law and regulations promulgated by the State Agency and
the Federal Security Administrator. Such payments which are delinquent
shall bear interest at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per month until such time as
payments are made.

Emmaus in the necessary amount to pay into the contribution fund as
provided in Section 4 of the Enabling Act and in accordance with the
plan, or plans, and agreement. Authority is given to the Mayor and the

Quality Of Life Ticketing
§ 5-401. General Provisions. [Ord. 1159, 9/18/2017]
This part shall be known and may be cited as the "Quality of Life Ticketing
Ordinance of the Borough of Emmaus."
§ 5-402. Purpose. [Ord. 1159, 9/18/2017]
The purpose of this part is to provide for a mechanism by means of issuance
of tickets rather than citation to permit a citizen who believes they may
have been in violation to pay the ticket rather than cause the issuance of
a citation and a costly and protracted legal hearing before a judge and
unnecessary appeals. The resolution in this manner is beneficial from a
twofold perspective in that it permits the Borough to maintain and enforce
its laws and permits a citizen so accused to resolve the dispute in a manner
that does not unduly burden the resident by requiring the issuance of a
citation and a court hearing. It also does not deprive the citizen the right to
dispute the ticket and receive the full benefit of procedural and substantive
due process of law.
§ 5-403. Definitions. [Ord. 1159, 9/18/2017]
OWNER  Any person, agent, operator, firm or corporation having a legal
or equitable interest in the property; or recorded in the official records
of the state, county, or municipality as holding title to the property; or
otherwise having control of the property, including the guardian of the
estate of any such person, and the executor or administrator of the estate
of such person if ordered to take possession of real property by a court.
PERSON  Any individuals, corporation, partnership, or any other group
acting as a unit.
§ 5-404. Enforcement. [Ord. 1159, 9/18/2017]
1. The provisions of any part so enumerated shall be enforced by Police
Officers and Code Enforcement Officers who are sworn to uphold and
enforce the law of the municipality.

Code and Property Maintenance Ordinance are hereby deemed and

where the violation exists.
D. By mailing the notice or violation ticket to the violator's address of
record first-class mail with a certificate of mailing.
6. Each day after the issuance of a ticket that a violation continues or is
permitted to continue constitutes a separate offense for which a
separate fine may be imposed.
7. If the Borough has corrected a violation, the cost thereof shall be
charged to the owner of the property by whatever means is available to
the municipality.
1. A person in receipt of a violation ticket shall have 10 days within which
time to pay the amount of the ticket. In the event the ticket is not paid

private property without the express permission of the owner or
occupant, and merchants operating in and on the streets, sidewalks,
rights-of-way and other public areas of the Borough. By their very
nature, these merchants operate in locations which, as a general
matter, are neither fixed nor established, and they are therefore
movable, transient and temporary. Unless exempt, transient merchants,
as well as persons and individuals soliciting or securing contributions to
various causes and organizations, regardless of profit and nonprofit
status, and conducting regulated activities in the Borough are subject
to the requirements of this Part.

a licensing program for transient merchants whose activities do not
include door-to-door activities or the entry upon private property and a
permitting system for those who desire to conduct door-to-door

transient business.

taking of orders, either by sample or otherwise, of any goods, wares,

business for the sale of personal property, whether the business is
conducted from a fixed location within the Borough or by an individual

are not be considered part of this Part.
1. Every person desiring to undertake a regulated activity shall first apply
to, and obtain from, the Borough either a Class 1 or Class 2 license in
accordance with the requirements of this Part.
2. If the regulated activity of the transient merchant involves a door-todoor
activity and/or the entry upon private property without the prior,
express permission of the occupant, then the transient merchant shall
apply for a Class 1 license in accordance with the requirements of this
Part.

3. Residential Permit Parking Program. The Emmaus Police Department is
hereby authorized to designate, subject to the approval of Borough
Council as hereby provided, certain streets and other public areas
within the Borough of Emmaus as permit parking areas in which
resident vehicles displaying valid parking permits may stand or be
parked without limitation by parking time restrictions established by
this section. Vehicles not displaying valid parking permits may stand or
be parked for a limited time not to exceed the time specified upon
adequately posted signs.
4. Designation of Residential Parking Areas. A residential area or street
shall be considered for designation as residential permit parking area
provided that designation criteria establishment by this section be
satisfied and that Borough Council, through enactment of an ordinance,
authorize the posting of appropriate signs specifying time limits and
period of the day for its application.
5. Designation Criteria. A residential area shall be deemed impacted and
thereby eligible for residential permit parking providing that the
following criteria are satisfied:
A. At least 50% of the street level, from footage use, is residential or
nonbusiness related.
B. During any period between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., on
Wednesdays, except holidays, the number of vehicles parked and/or
standing, legally or illegally, at on-street parking spaces, is equal to
70% of the legal on-street parking capacity of the area.
C. If the above criteria is not met at any time, the Emmaus Police
Department shall notify the Borough Council. The Borough Council
may consider revoking the residential parking permit status for
that street.
D. A street may be considered as a potential residential parking area
upon the receipt by Borough Council of a verified petition signed by
at least 90% of the residents on that street.
E. The signature of a resident on the petition demonstrates a
willingness to purchase a permit for this program.
F. Surveys shall be conducted of potential residential parking areas to
establish whether the criteria for establishing resident parking has
been satisfied.
G. Once established, a residential parking area may be abandoned
upon receipt of a verified petition signed by at least 90% of the
residents of that street.
6. Issuance of Permit Parking. Following Borough Council's approval of
the designation of residential permit parking area, the Police

independent of water volume usage metered by this Borough in
connection with the water system, the quarterly billing dates shall be
the fifteenth days of January, April, July and October, respectively, in

paid within 30 calendar days after each quarterly billing date, an
additional sum of 10% shall be added to such net bill, which net bill,
plus such additional sum, shall constitute the gross bill. Payment made
or mailed and postmarked on or before the last day of such 30 calendar
day period shall constitute payment within such period. If the end of
such 30 calendar day period shall fall on a legal holiday or a Sunday,
payment made on or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding
week day which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment within
such period.
Whenever service to any improved property shall begin after the first
day or shall terminate before the last day of any quarterly billing period,
sewer rentals and charges for such period shall be prorated equitably,
if appropriate, for that portion of the quarterly billing period during
which such improved property was served by the sewer system.
3. Every owner of improved property which is connected to the sewer
system initially shall provide this Borough with and thereafter shall
keep this Borough advised of his correct address. Failure of any person
to receive quarterly bills for sewer rentals and charges shall not be

extension of the period of time during which the net bill shall be
payable.

§ 18-206. Measuring Volume of Sanitary Sewage and Industrial
Wastes. [Ord. 368, 1/18/1960, § 6]
1. Methods of Measuring Volume.
A. Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property
discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the
sewer system is supplied by the water system, the volume of water
furnished, as determined from meter readings of the water system,
shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/
or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and charges,
subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this Part.
B. Whenever an improved property discharging sanitary sewage and/
or industrial wastes into the sewer system shall have a source or
sources of water supply in addition to or other than the water
system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter
on such additional or other source or sources of water supply. The
total volume of water consumed, as determined from the meter
readings of the water system and the meter readings of the meter
or meters on such additional or other source or sources of water
supply, or the meter readings of the meter or meters on such other
source or sources of water supply, as appropriate, shall be used as
the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial
wastes in computing the sewer rentals and charges, subject to
adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this Part.
C. Whenever an improved property shall use water from the water
system and/or water from a source or sources of supply in addition
to or other than the water system for cooling or unpolluted
commercial or industrial process purposes, and all or part of the
water so used shall not be discharged into the sewer system, the
volume used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and charges may be
adjusted by one of the following methods:
(1) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the
connection to the sewer system. The readings from such meter
or measuring device shall be used as the measure of discharge
of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing
sewer rentals and charges.
(2) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the
volume not being discharged into the sewer system. The
readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the total water meter readings and the
remainder shall be used as the measure of discharge of
sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer
rentals and charges.
(3) If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Borough, to install a
meter or other measuring device to determine continuously the

volume not discharged into the sewer system, this Borough
shall determine, in such manner and by such method as it
may prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is being
discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used
as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals and charges shall
be the percentage so determined of the quantity measured by
the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such estimated
percentage shall be submitted to this Borough, after notice of
such estimate. The decision of this Borough with respect to the
matter shall be final for the then current calendar year.
2. Measuring Devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall not
be owned by this Borough in connection with the water system but
which shall be required or permitted under provisions of this Part shall
be furnished and installed by the owner of the improved property at his
expense, shall be under the control of this Borough and may be tested,
inspected or repaired by this Borough whenever necessary. The owner
of the improved property upon which such meter or other measuring
device shall be installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and
safekeeping; and all repairs thereto shall be made at the expense of the
owner, whether such repairs shall be made necessary by ordinary wear
and tear or other causes. Bills for such repairs, if made by this Borough,
shall be due and payable immediately upon completion of such repairs
and shall be collected in the same manner as quarterly bills for sewer
rentals and charges.
3. Meter Readings. The Borough shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or other measuring devices and the same shall be available to
this Borough at all reasonable times.

plans to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for
review.
(2) The Planning Commission will consider the plan to determine if
it meets the standards set forth in this Part and the Borough
Zoning Ordinance.
(3) The Planning Commission shall act on the Preliminary Plan
within 60 days of the official filing date, but in any event shall
act on the plan in time for the Borough Council to render their
decision within 90 days from the official filing date. In the
event that any variance from this chapter is requested by the
applicant or is deemed necessary for approval, the variance
and the reasons for its necessity shall be entered into the
records of the Borough Council.

the subdivision or land development as to the character and
intensity of development, the arrangement and approximate
dimensions of streets, lots, and other planned features. The
approval binds the subdivider or developer to the general
scheme of the subdivision shown, unless a revised preliminary
plan is submitted, and permits the subdivider to proceed with
final detailed design of improvements, to arrange for
guarantee to cover installation of the improvements, and to
prepare the final plan. Approval of the preliminary plan does
not authorize the sale of lots nor the recording of the
preliminary plan.

GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
§ 22-501. Application. [Ord. 551, 6/7/1976; as revised by Ord. 675,
11/17/1986]
The following principles, standards and requirements will be applied by the
Borough Council and Planning Commission to evaluating plans for proposed
subdivision or land developments. The standards and requirements outlined
herein shall be considered minimum standards and requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Where
literal compliance with the standards herein specified is clearly impractical,
the Borough Council may modify or adjust the standards to permit
reasonable utilization of property while securing substantial conformance
with the objectives of this chapter.
§ 22-502. Land Requirements. [Ord. 551, 6/7/1976; as revised by
Ord. 675, 11/17/1986; and as amended by Ord. 803, 9/19/1994, § 1;
and by Ord. 940, 1/7/2002, § 3]
1. Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
2. Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life,
safety, health, or property, shall not be subdivided or developed until
such hazards have been eliminated or unless adequate safeguards
against such hazards are provided for in the Subdivision or Land
Development Plan. Land included as having unsuitable characteristics
would be the following:
A. Land located in a floodplain subject to flooding or which has a high
ground water table.
B. Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding
condition upon other land.
C. Land subject to subsidence.
D. Land subject to underground fires.
E. Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 10%.
F. Land which, because of topography or means of access, is
considered hazardous by the Borough Council.
G. Land which is subject to ground pollution or contamination.
3. Proposed subdivisions of land developments shall be coordinated with
existing nearby neighborhoods so that the community as a whole may
develop harmoniously.
4. Proposed land uses shall conform to the Borough Zoning Ordinance.
§ 22-501 FOREWORD § 22-502
FWD:449
§ 22-503. Street System. [Ord. 551, 6/7/1976; as revised by Ord.
675, 11/17/1986]
5. The Borough of Emmaus Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27] has recently
added §§ 27-503, 27-517 and 27-518. Those standards are hereby
incorporated herein and made part of this chapter under this section
will be part of any review process for subdivision and land development,
as the same may be applicable.
1. Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or parts
thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Borough
and shall be coordinated with existing or proposed streets in adjoining
subdivisions or land developments.
2. Proposed streets shall further conform to such county and state road
and highway plans as have been prepared, adopted or filed as
prescribed by law.
3. Streets shall be related to the topography so as to produce usable lots
and acceptable grades.
4. Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the
subdivisions or land development and to adjacent unsubdivided
territory unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is
not feasible. Streets giving such access shall be improved to the limits
of the subdivision or land development and shall be improved to
Borough specifications. Reserve strips and land-locked areas shall not
be created.
5. Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design. Local
access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic
and, where possible, arterial streets shall be designed for use by
through traffic.
6. Where the proposed subdivision or land development contains or is
adjacent to an existing or proposed arterial street or a highway
designated as a Limited Access Highway by the appropriate highway
authorities, provisions shall be made for marginal access streets at a
distance acceptable for the appropriate use of the land between the
arterial street or Limited Access Highway and the marginal access
streets. The Borough Council may also require rear service areas,
double frontage lots, or such other treatment as will provide protection
for abutting properties, reduction in the number of intersections with
primary streets, and separation of local and through traffic.
7. Half or partial streets will not be permitted in new subdivisions or land
developments except where essential to reasonable subdivision or
development of a tract in conformance with the other requirements and
standards of this chapter and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the street can be secured.

FWD:450
§ 22-504. Street Design. [Ord. 551, 6/7/1976; as revised by Ord.
675, 11/17/1986]
8. Wherever a tract to be subdivided or developed borders an existing half
or partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan.
9. Dead-end streets shall be prohibited, except as stubs (with adequate
turning capability) to permit future street extension into adjoining
tracts, or when designed as culs-de-sac.
10. New reserve strips, including those controlling access to streets, shall
be forbidden.
11. Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets
in a proposed subdivision or land development shall be made to provide
for the proper projection of streets into the unsubdivided land.
12. Street names shall be coordinated with existing or platted street names,
and if a new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or
platted street, it shall bear the same name as the existing or platted
street.
13. No street shall be laid out or opened which extends to or crosses any
boundary between the Borough and any other municipality except with
the specific approval of the Borough Council and upon such condition as
the Borough Council may impose. If the street is proposed to serve a
commercial area, an industrial area or a residential area of 50 dwelling
units or more, located in another municipality, the street shall not be
approved unless the area is also served by a street in the other
municipality and unless the relevant traffic facilities of the Borough are
adequate to handle the anticipated volume.
14. All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective
Lengths except where otherwise required by the Borough Council
pursuant to Subsection 2.C. of § 22-504.
1. Street Classification.
A. Three functional classifications are hereby established for the
streets and roads in Borough:
(1) Arterial. This classification includes highways which provide
intra-county or inter-municipal traffic of substantial volumes
where the average trip lengths are usually five miles or
greater. Generally, these highways should accommodate
operating speeds of 35 to 55 miles per hour.
(2) Collector. This classification is intended to include those
highways which connect local access highways to arterial
highways. They may serve intra-county and intra-township
traffic. They may serve as traffic corridors connecting
residential areas with industrial, shopping and other service.
§ 22-503 FOREWORD § 22-504
FWD:451
They may penetrate residential areas. Generally, these
highways will accommodate operating speeds of 35 miles per
hour.
(3) Local Access. This classification is intended to include streets
and roads that provide direct access to abutting land and
connections to higher classes of roadways. Traffic volumes will
be low and travel distances generally short. These streets and
roads should be designed for operating speeds of 25 miles per
hour or under.

provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum
radius to the edge of the finished street or curb line of not less than
50 feet.
B. Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line
and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried
to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of
the street into the adjoining tract. At such time as such a street is
extended, the overage created by the turnaround outside the
boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the
property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround.
C. Commercial and industrial culs-de-sac shall be reviewed for
adequacy by the Borough Engineer. His recommendations will be

shall provide proper sight distances as specified herein above.
6. Street Intersections.
A. Local streets shall not intersect with collector or arterial streets on
the same side at intervals of less than 800 feet as measured from
center line to center line.
B. The distance between center lines of streets opening onto the
opposite side of a proposed or existing street shall be not less than
150 feet unless the streets are directly opposite each other.
C. Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets shall be avoided. Where this proves impossible, such
intersections shall be designed with extreme care for both
pedestrian and vehicular safety.
D. Streets shall be all laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right
angles. Local streets shall not intersect collector or arterial streets
at an angle of less than 75°. The intersection of two local streets
shall not be at an angle of less than 60°.

alter, construct any structure, or deposit any material or thing, or
commit any act which will affect normal or flood flow in any communal
stream or water course without having obtained prior approval from
the Borough or Department of Environmental Protection, whichever is
applicable.
3. Where a subdivision or land development is traversed by a natural
watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-ofway
conforming substantially with the line of such watercourse and of
such width as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.
4. The Borough will assure that all permanent streams, not under the
jurisdiction of other official agencies, are maintained open and free
flowing.
5. The subdivider or developer, and each person, corporation, or other
entity which makes any surface changes shall be required to:
A. Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the drainage
area.
B. Design drainage facilities to handle runoff from upstream areas,
assuming full development of those areas, based upon the
Comprehensive Plan for Borough.
C. Design, construct, and/or install such drainage structures and
facilities as are necessary to prevent erosion damage to the
subdivision or land development, adjacent property and
downstream property. Such structures and facilities shall
§ 22-504 FOREWORD § 22-506
FWD:455
satisfactorily convey such surface waters to the nearest practical
street, storm drain, detention pond, or natural water course.
6. Storm sewers, culverts, and related installations shall be provided to
permit unimpeded flow of natural water courses, to drain all low points
along streets, and to intercept storm water runoff along streets at
intervals reasonably related to the extent and grade of the area
drained.
7. Storm sewers, as required, shall be placed in front of the curb or curb
line when located in a street right-of-way. When located in undedicated
land, they shall be placed within an easement not less than 15 feet wide,
as approved by the Borough Engineer, who may require additional
width of easement as circumstances warrant.
8. Street drainage will not be permitted to cross intersections or the
crown of the road.

and for stormwater management facilities in minor subdivisions.
13. Where the estimated runoff based upon the above methods is doubtful,
several recognized methods should be studied and compared.
14. The minimum design criteria shall be a ten-year storm. Higher
frequency conditions shall be used in sensitive areas and where an
overflow would endanger public or private property.
15. Runoff calculations must include complete hydrologic and hydraulic
design and analysis of all control facilities.

[Ord. 551, 6/7/1975; as revised by Ord. 675, 11/17/1986]
16. Control Facilities.
A. Permanent control measures/facilities shall be designed to assure
that the maximum rate of stormwater runoff is not greater after
development than prior to development for a ten-year storm
frequency. More stringent criteria may be required in sensitive
areas where storm water problems presently exist.
B. Control Facilities shall be designed to meet, as a minimum, the
design standards and specifications of the "Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Handbook for Lehigh County."
(1) Detention ponds may be waived by the Borough Council on the
recommendation of the Borough Engineer at sites in close
proximity to the major streams. This is to facilitate drainage
prior to stream flooding.
(2) In areas underlain with limestone geology, ponds shall be
limited to the detention (dry) type unless the developer can
show a special need for a retention pond, in which case it shall
have a lining. Detention ponds shall be prohibited in areas of
known sinkholes unless the pond is lined. If a sinkhole develops
in a pond or channel before acceptance by the municipality, a
lining shall be required.
(3) Any ponds with slopes steeper than three to one shall be
fenced with a six-foot fence with a type subject to the approval
of the municipality.
C. A maintenance program for control facilities must be included as
part of the Grading and Drainage Plan.
(1) Maintenance during development activities of a project shall
be the responsibility of the contractor, developer, and owner.
(2) Arrangement for maintenance of permanent control facilities
after completion of development activities shall be made
before approval of final plans is given by the Borough Council.
(a) In cases where permanent control facilities are owned by
an entity, it shall be the responsibility of that entity to
maintain control facilities (e.g., homeowner's association).
In such cases a legally binding agreement between the
owner and the Borough shall be made providing for
maintenance of all permanent erosion control facilities,
including the inspection by the Borough.

1. Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from
buildings and to prevent the collection of storm water in pools.
Minimum 2% slopes away from structures shall be required.
2. Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the
nearest practical street, storm drain, or natural water course. Where
drainage swales are used to deliver surface waters away from
buildings, their grade shall not be less than 1% nor more than 4%. The
swales shall be sodded, planted or lined as required. A Grading and
Draining Plan shall be required for all subdivisions and land
developments, except minor subdivisions.
3. No final grading shall be permitted with a cut face steeper in slope than
two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following
conditions:
A. The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable
to sustain a slope of steeper than two horizontal to one vertical, and
a written statement of a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, to that effect is submitted to the Borough Engineer and
approved by him. The statement shall state that the site has been
inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified
hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or damage to
property.
B. A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound
engineering standards for which plans are submitted to the
Borough Engineer for review and approval is provided.
4. No final grading shall be permitted which creates any exposed surface
steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical except under one or
more of the following conditions:
A. The fill is located so that settlement, sliding or erosion will not
result in property damage or be hazardous to adjoining property,
streets, alley, or buildings.
B. A written statement from a civil engineer, licensed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion
control, certifying that he has inspected the site and that the
proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not
endanger any property or result in property damage, is submitted
to and approved by the Borough Engineer.
C. A wall is constructed to support the face of the fill.
5. The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three feet from
property or right-of-way lines of street or alleys in order to permit the
normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting
property. All property lines, where walls or slopes are steeper than one
horizontal to one vertical and five feet or more in height shall be

§ 22-508. Blocks and Lots. [Ord. 551, 6/7/1976; as revised by Ord.
675, 11/17/1986]
protected by a protective fence no less than three feet in height
approved by the Borough Engineer.
6. All lots must be kept free of any debris or nuisances whatsoever.
1. The length, width, shape, and design of blocks shall be determined with
due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type
proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Borough,
the topography of the land being subdivided, and the requirements for
safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation.
2. Unless the topography of the land being subdivided or the existing
pattern of development in the immediately adjacent area shall be
otherwise than herein required, the following minimum standards for
the design and size of blocks and lots shall prevail:
A. Blocks shall not exceed 1,600 feet in length, nor be less than 500
feet in length.
B. Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to
accommodate two tiers of lots, except where reverse frontage lots
bordering an arterial or collector street are used, or where due to
the contour of the land, or the necessary layout of the subdivision,
there is insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such
two tier design.
C. Crosswalks or interior pedestrian walks shall be required in blocks
exceeding 1,000 feet in length to provide for pedestrian circulation
or access to community facilities. Such walks shall be paved for
width of not less than four feet, shall be located in easements not
less than 10 feet in width, and shall, insofar as possible, be located
in the center of any such block.
D. Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the
elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use
requires other treatment. In such cases, off-street parking for
employees and customers shall be provided along with safe and
convenient limited access to the street system. Space for off-street
loading shall also be provided with limited access to the street
system. Extension of streets, railroad access right-of-way, and
utilities shall be provided as necessary.
E. Lot lines intersecting street lines shall be substantially at right
angles or radial to street lines.
F. Lots shall, in general, front on a street which has already been
dedicated to the Borough, or which the subdivider or developer
proposes to dedicate to the Borough in connection with approval of
the final plan. In commercial or industrial subdivisions or land

streets within the subdivision or land development, this
requirement may be waived by the Borough Council.
G. The Borough shall assign house numbers to each lot within a
subdivision.
H. Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the Borough Zoning
Ordinance.
I. Remnants of land, smaller than required for a lot, shall not be
permitted within any subdivision. Such remnants shall be
incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or dedicated to public use
if acceptable to the Borough Council.
J. Double frontage lots are prohibited except in accordance with
§ 22-508.2.B. above.
K. No residential lots shall be created which front upon an arterial or
collector street, as defined in § 22-504.A herein.
1. It is the policy of this Borough that all subdivided lands shall have
immediate access to a public street. Because of unique property
configuration and location, this Borough recognizes the need for limited
exceptions to the foregoing general policy.
2. No subdivision will be approved on a private street or road if more than
two lots already front on such street or road or if after subdivision more
than two lots will front on such private street or road.
1. In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the
degree to which the applicant of a subdivision or land development plan
has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic
to the site, shall be assessed. Terms of approval of a plat may be subject
to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved
existing natural features, such as, but not limited to, trees, wooded
areas and water course.
2. Open space. Where the applicant is offering for dedication, or is
required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or
preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work,"
which will confine excavation, earth moving procedures and other
changes to the landscape, may be required to ensure preservation and
prevent despoilation of the character of the area in open space.

3. Tree preservation. Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed
unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within
the proposed building area, or within utility locations and equipment
access areas. In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level
shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.
4. Topsoil preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills
have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after
grading. All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting
on slopes of less than 10% and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes
10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater.
5. Landscaping. For all multi-family, apartment, office, commercial, and
industrial subdivisions or land developments, a landscaping plan shall
be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open
space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and
natural barriers.
6. Buffer planting requirements. Buffer Yard requirements should be as
specified in the Borough Zoning Ordinance.
7. Preserved landscaping. When there is a conscientious effort to preserve
the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such
preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable to
required planting improvements, i.e., landscaping and buffer screening,
the plan may be received in lieu of additional landscaping
requirements.
8. Trees. The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not
be permitted. The planting of any trees within the private property of
each residential lot shall be at the discretion of the property owner or
developer.
9. Watercourse Protection. Where a subdivision or land development is
traversed by a natural watercourse, there shall be provided a drainage
easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the line of such
watercourse and of such width as will be adequate to preserve natural
drainage. Such easement shall be in addition to the open space
required in Sec. 510.2.
1. Areas meeting the criteria for recreation lands as set forth in Part 2,
"Definitions," shall be offered for dedication to the Borough, subject to

provision as stated in § 22-511, subsection (2).
2. Cash in lieu of recreation land dedication may be offered, subject to the
approval of the Borough Council, as follows:
A. The cash in lieu shall be $1,000 per lot or dwelling unit (the
estimated value of 1,100 square feet of recreation land) or such
other amount that the Borough Council may adopt by ordinance as
shall be in effect at the time of payment.
B. The use of the monies shall be restricted to the purchase of lands or
for recreation or open space accessible to the subdivision or land
development, the improvement of said areas, the construction of
recreational facilities, parks and other related capital expenditures,
as recommended in the Borough's Park and Recreation Plan.
C. The monies shall be deposited in an interest bearing, separate trust
account established for this purpose by Borough Council.
D. Cash in lieu of recreation land dedication shall be deemed as an
improvement and subject to the provisions of Section 509 and
subsequent sections of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.

1. General Purpose.
A. The Borough Council finds that the minimization of erosion and
control of sedimentation in connection with land development and
subdivision are in the public interest, affecting public health, safety
and welfare, and therefore those regulations governing erosion
control and sedimentation control are necessary for the Borough.
B. No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, no grading,
excavating, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other
vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time
that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been
processed with and reviewed by the Borough Engineer and/or
Lehigh County Soil and Water Conservation District, or there has
been a determination by the above entities that such plans are not
necessary.
C. No subdivision or land development plan shall be approved unless:
(1) there has been an Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan
approved by the Borough Council that provides for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation consistent with this section, and an
improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited
with the Borough in the form of an escrow guarantee which will
ensure installation and completion of the required improvements;
or (2) there has been a determination by the Borough Council that a
plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation is not necessary.
D. Where not specified in this chapter, measures used to control
erosion and reduce sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the
standards and specifications of the Soil Conservation Service. The
Borough Engineer, or other officials as designated, shall ensure
compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies of which are
available from the Soil and Water Conservation District.
2. Performance Principles. The following measures are effective in
minimizing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where
applicable in the control plan:
A. Stripping of vegetation, regrading, or other development shall be
done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion.
B. Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum, and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
C. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected,
and supplemented.
D. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
§ 22-512 FOREWORD § 22-512
FWD:463
E. Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
F. Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
G. The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
H. Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where necessary, the rate of surface water
runoff will be structurally retarded.
I. Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt
traps, or similar measures.
3. Grading for Erosion and Other Environmental Controls. In order to
provide suitable sites for building and other uses, improve surface
drainage, and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
A. Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently
possible condition as one of the first items of work done on a
subdivision or development. The wearing surface shall be installed
in accordance with this section and as approved in the Final Plan.
B. Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging
the cut face of excavations or the sloping surfaces of fills, by
installation of temporary or permanent drainage across or above
these areas.
C. Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
D. Fills placed adjacent to watercourses shall have suitable protection
against erosion during periods of flooding.
E. During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control
will be exercised.
F. Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing
streams. Provisions will be made for the installation of temporary
or permanent culverts or bridges.
4. Responsibility.
A. Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation,
grading or other development, it shall be the collective
responsibility of the land developer and subdivider, and of the
contractor, person, corporation and other entity causing such
sedimentation to remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage

B. Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities
during the construction and development period is the
responsibility of the land developer or subdivider.
C. It is the responsibility of any developer or subdivider, and any
person, corporation, or other entity doing any act on or across a
communal stream, watercourse or swale, or upon the floodplain or
right-of-way, to maintain as nearly as possible in its present state
the stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during
the pendency of the activity to return it to its original or equal
condition after such activity is completed.
D. The subdivider or land developer shall provide and install, at his
expense, in accordance with Borough requirements, all drainage
and erosion control improvements (temporary and permanent)
shown on the Erosion and Sediment Control Plan.

5. Design Standards and Improvements in Designated Floodplain Areas.
A. General.
(1) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in any Designated Floodplain Area may be platted
for development with the provision that the developer
construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
§ 22-513 FOREWORD § 22-513
FWD:467
(2) No subdivision or land development, or part thereof, shall be
approved if the proposed development or improvements will
individually or collectively, increase the one-hundred-year
flood elevation more than one foot at any point.
(3) Building sites for residences or any other type of dwelling or
accommodation shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for these uses may be permitted outside the floodway
area in a Floodplain Area if the lowest floor (including
basement) is elevated to the Regulatory Flood Elevation. If fill
is used to raise the elevation of a site, the fill area shall extend
laterally for a distance of at least 15 feet beyond the limits of
the proposed structures and access shall meet the
requirements of § 22-513.5.C hereinbelow.
(4) Building sites for structures or buildings other than for
residential uses shall not be permitted in any floodway area.
Sites for such structures or buildings outside the floodway in a
Floodplain Area shall be protected as provided for in
§ 22-513.5.A.(3) above. However, the Borough Council may
allow the subdivision or development of areas or sites for
commercial and industrial uses at an elevation below the
Regulatory Flood Elevation if the developer otherwise protects
the area to that height or assures that the buildings or
structures will be floodproofed to the Regulatory Flood
Elevation.
(5) If the Borough Council determines that only a part of a
proposed plat can be safely developed, it shall limit
development to that part and shall require that development
proceed consistent with this determination.
(6) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself
and the Borough Council determines that additional controls
are required to insure safe development, they may require the
developer to improve appropriate deed restrictions on the
land. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every deed and
noted on every recorded plat.
B. Drainage Facilities.
(1) Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow
of surface waters without damage to persons or property. The
system shall insure drainage at all points along streets, and
provide positive drainage away from buildings and on-site
waste disposal sites.
(2) Plans shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
The Borough Council may require a primary underground
system to accommodate frequent floods and a secondary
surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods.
Drainage plans shall be consistent with local, county and
§ 22-513 EMMAUS CODE § 22-513

prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto adjacent
properties.
C. Streets and Driveways. The finished elevation of proposed streets
and driveways shall not be more than the one foot below the
Regulatory Flood Elevation. Profiles and elevations of streets and
driveways to determine compliance with this requirement and as
required by other provisions of this Subdivision Ordinance shall be
submitted with the final plan. Drainage openings shall be sufficient
to discharge flood flows without unduly increasing flood heights.
D. Sewer Facilities. All sanitary sewer systems located in any
Designated Floodplain Area, whether public or private, shall be
flood proofed up to the Regulatory Flood Elevation.
E. Water Facilities. All water systems located in any Designated
Floodplain Area, whether public or private, shall be flood proofed
up to the Regulatory Flood Elevation.
F. Other Utilities and Facilities. All other public or private utilities and
facilities, including gas and electric, shall be elevated or flood
proofed up to the Regulatory Flood Elevation.

The above rates include lateral maintenance to curb stop and are
effective as of January 1, 2016, billing.
1. All bills for water consumed will be rendered quarterly. The water
consumed shall be determined by meter registration or by estimated
bills. All water consumed shall be determined by meter registration
unless the meter has been found to be registering inaccurately or has
failed to register, in which case a bill will be rendered based on previous
average consumption for a similar period when the meter was in order,
giving proper consideration to any change in facilities or practices that
may have occurred, or by such other fair and reasonable method as
shall be based on the best information available.
2. In cases of excessive meter registration, no adjustment will be made of
bills rendered prior to the billing period in which complaint was made

obligation to pay. The presentation of a bill to the customer is only a
matter of accommodation and not a waiver of this rule.
7. Metered water consumers may take the water allowed by their
minimum quarterly rate at any time during the quarterly billing period
but failure to use their full allowance in any one billing period shall not
entitle them to any rebate or allowance to use an excess in any other
quarterly billing period.

office of the Borough of Emmaus Water Department so that the water
may be turned off, and he will be responsible for all charges for water
service until such notice is given.

accuracy, shall bring or mail said bill, within 10 days to the Borough
Water Office in Borough Hall, and such bill shall be promptly
investigated by proper personnel.

number or location, the name of the owner and tenant, the purpose for
which service will be used, the exact time when the trench from curb to
the property and his service will be ready for making the connection
and shall guarantee that such service will be used continuously for at
least one year.
Whenever a service line is laid in contemplation of the erection of a
building on the premises in question, and said line is not attached for
the period of one year immediately following the granting of a permit,
the Borough shall have the right to disconnect the water at the main
and charge the owner for the cost of such service.
The application must be signed by the owner of the premises, or his
duly authorized agent.
2. Any property owner desiring a supply of water must make a written

estimated, payment must be made at the time application is submitted
and before the service is granted.

adequate facilities to render the service desired; if the service is of such
character that is likely to result in unfavorable service to other
customers; if the applicant's installation of piping is regarded as
hazardous or of such character that satisfactory service cannot be
given; or for other just cause.

violation of the rules of the Borough by either or any of said consumers
shall be deemed a violation as to all and the Borough may take such
action as could be taken against a single consumer, except that such
action shall not be taken until the innocent consumer who is not in
violation of the Borough's rules has been given reasonable opportunity
to attach his pipes to a separately controlled service connection.

2. Line Extensions. Whenever a developer, owner or occupant of a
property within the service territory of the company requests the
company to extend service to such property, the company will extend
service under the following conditions:
A. Requests by Bona Fide Service Applicant. Each company shall file
with the Commission, as part of its tariff, a rule setting forth the
conditions under which facilities will be extended to supply service
to an applicant within its service area. Upon request by a bona fide
service applicant, a utility shall construct line extensions within its
franchised territory consistent with the following directives:
(1) Line extensions to bona fide service applicants shall be funded
without customer advance where the annual revenue from the
line extension will equal or exceed the company's annual line
extension costs.
(2) If the annual revenue from the line extension will not equal or
exceed the company's annual line extension costs, a bona fide
service applicant may be required to provide a customer
advance to the utility's cost of construction for the line
extension. The utility's investment for the line extension shall
be the portion of the total construction costs which generate
annual line extension costs equal to annual revenue from the
line extension. The customer advance amount shall be
determined by subtracting the utility's investment for the line
extension from the total construction costs.
(3) The company's investment for the line extension shall be based
on the following formula, where X equals the utility's
investment attributed to each bona fide applicant:
§ 26-123 EMMAUS CODE § 26-123
FWD:570
X = [AR - OM] divided by [I + D]; and,
AR = The company's annual revenue
OM = The company's operating and maintenance costs
I = The company's current debt ratio multiplied by
the company's weighted long-term debt cost rate
D = The company's current depreciation accrual rate
B. Customer Advance Financing, Refunds and Facilities on Private
Property.
(1) For Use by Companies with Gross Annual Receipts of
$10,000,000 or More. When a customer advance is required
from a bona fide service applicant for service and the bona fide
applicant is unable to advance the entire amount due, the
company shall either:
(a) Allow the applicant to pay the advance plus the financing
costs equal to the company's weight cost of long term
debt, over a period of not less than three years.
(b) Provide information to the bona fide service applicant on
financial institutions that may offer financing to the
applicant for the main extension.
(2) When a customer advance is required of a service applicant
and an additional customer or customers attach service lines to
the line extension within 10 years, the utility shall refund a
portion of the advance to the customer. Deposits made for
additional facilities other than the line extension, such as
booster pumps, storage tanks and the like, are contributions in
aid of construction and need not be refunded.
(3) The company will refund to the applicant, during a period of 10
years from the date of the extension deposit, a per-customer
amount for each additional bona fide service applicant from
whom a street service connection shall be directly attached to
such main extension as distinguished from extensions or
branches thereof. Provided, however, that the total amount
refunded shall not exceed the original deposit without interest,
and provided that all or any part the deposit not refunded
within said ten-year period shall become the property of the
company and shall be treated as contributions in aid of
construction for ratemaking purposes. The per customer
refund amount shall equal the utility's investment attributed to
each bona fide applicant as calculated in the formula contained
in this tariff.
(4) A utility shall require a customer to pay, in advance, a
reasonable charge for service lines and equipment installed on
private property for the exclusive use of the customer.
§ 26-123 FOREWORD § 26-123
FWD:571
(5) Special utility service shall mean residential or business
service which exceeds that required for ordinary residential
purposes. Subsection (G)(1)(a) through (c) of this tariff does
not apply to special utility service. By way of illustration and
not limitation, special utility service shall include: the
installation of facilities such as oversized mains, booster
pumps and storage tanks as necessary to provide adequate
flows or to meet specific pressure criteria, or service to large
water consuming commercial and industrial facilities. An
otherwise bona fide applicant requesting service which
includes a "special utility service" component is entitled to
bona fide applicant status, including the corresponding
company contribution towards the costs to the line extension
which do not meet the special utility service criteria.
C. Requirement for Extension Deposit Agreement. Where extension of
facilities is not fully funded by the company pursuant to Rule A of
this section, the execution by the applicant of an extension deposit
agreement for customer contribution or advance shall be a
condition of extending the facilities. Upon notice that the company
is prepared and able to go forward with the work, the applicant will
deposit with the company the amount specified in the extension
deposit agreement.
D. Size of Line. The company shall have the exclusive right to
determine the type and size of lines to be installed and the other
facilities required to render adequate service. However, where the
company decides to install a pipe larger than necessary to render
extension of adequate service to the applicant, estimated or actual
cost figures in the extension deposit agreement shall include only
the material and installation cost for a pipe the size of which is
necessary to provide adequate service to the applicant. Any
incremental costs of a larger pipe will be the responsibility of the
company. All estimated or actual cost figures referred to in the
extension deposit agreement shall include a reasonable allowance
for overhead costs and taxes as appropriate. The minimum pipe
size for main extensions will be six inches pursuant to Commission
regulation at 52 Pa.Code § 65.17(b).
E. Length of Extension. In determining the necessary length of an
extension, the terminal point of such extension shall be at that
point in the curb line, which is equidistant from the side property
lines of the last lot for which water service is requested. A company
service connection will be provided only for customer service lines
that extend at right angles from the curb line in a straight line to
the premises to be served.
F. Cost True-up. At the conclusion of the line extension project there
shall be a reconciliation of the actual costs incurred to the amount
of extension deposit that has been paid by the customer. If the
actual cost exceeds the deposit, the applicant shall be responsible
§ 26-123 EMMAUS CODE § 26-123
FWD:572
for payment to the company of the difference. If the deposit
exceeds the actual cost, the company shall refund the difference.

E. Variances from the Prohibition of Nonessential Uses of Water In Local
Emmaus Borough Water Emergency. Where the Borough Council has
independently declared a Water Emergency due to local shortage of
potable water or equipment failure or pipe breakage, the following
procedures shall be implemented to afford persons a forum for seeking
relief from the restrictions. If the water emergency has been declared
by the Borough Council, the Council shall sit as a committee of the
whole to hear such applications, utilizing the standards of review and
application procedures as set forth in the Zoning Ordinance at Chapter
27, § 27-116(2), for conditional use applications. Such decision shall be
appealable to the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas as a decision
of an agency under the Local Agency Law. Where the water emergency
is declared by the Governor, the procedures set forth in 4 Pa.Code,
Chapter 119, shall be applicable.
F. Procedure for Exemptions or Variance From the Prohibition of
Nonessential Uses of Water.
(1) If compliance with the prohibition of nonessential use of water
would result in extraordinary hardship upon a water user, the
water user may apply for an exemption or variance.
§ 26-204 FOREWORD § 26-204
FWD:579
(2) For purposes of this section, extraordinary hardship means a
permanent damage to property or other personal or economic loss
which is substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by
other water users subject to the prohibition of nonessential use of
water.
(3) A water user that believes it suffers an extraordinary hardship and
desires to be wholly or partially exempt from the prohibitions or
nonessential use of water may apply for an exemption or variance
under the following procedures:
(a) The water user shall submit a written application with full
documentation supporting the need for the requested relief to:
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator c/o Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Water Supply &
Community Health, Post Office Box 8467 Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania 17105-8467.
(b) The application shall contain information specifying:
(i) The nature of the hardship claimed and the reason for the
requested exemption or variance.
(ii) The efforts taken by the water user to conserve water and
the extent to which water use may be reduced by the
applicant without extraordinary hardship.
(c) The Commonwealth Drought Coordinator will review the
application in consultation with the staff of PEMA and other
appropriate Commonwealth agencies, and may request the
water user to provide within a reasonable time additional
information as necessary to review the application.
(d) The Commonwealth Drought Coordinator, as agent for PEMA
and the Council, is authorized to render a decision regarding
applications received for exemption or variance. The
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator will provide the water
user and other interested parties notice in writing of the
decision and the reasons for the decision. When possible, the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator will provide a decision
within seven working days of submission of an application or of
additional information as necessary to review the application,
unless appealed under this section, the decision of the
Commonwealth Drought Coordinator shall be considered a
final action on the application.
(e) A water user aggrieved by a decision of the Commonwealth
Drought Coordinator may, within 30 days of notice of the
decision, appeal the decision to the Council.
(f) An appeal from an initial decision of the Commonwealth
Drought Coordinator will not act as an automatic supersedes,

FWD:580
§ 26-205. Enforcement, Fines and Penalties. [Ord. 880, 3/1/1999,
§ 205]
In the event of a drought emergency, (as declared by a river basin
commission and or by a proclamation or executive order issued by the
Governor), the Borough is authorized to collect fines and/or excess use
charges as set forth in its Local Rationing Plan as filed with and approved
by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency from any water user.
Fines may also be imposed upon water users for violation of any part of
this Part, upon a finding by a District Justice of noncompliance with an
official Borough directive or emergency plan, at a rate not in excess of
$300 per day per event. A water user who violates this Part by violating a
but, upon cause shown and where the circumstances require
it, the Commonwealth Drought Coordinator or the Council, or
both, will have the power to grant a supersedes.
(g) When an initial decision is appealed, the Council will provide
the water user with an opportunity for a hearing. The council
will appoint a presiding officer to act as the hearing officer.
Hearings will be conducted under 1 Pa. Code, Part II, (relating
to general rules of administrative practice and procedure).
(h) The hearing examiner will provide the record of the hearing, if
any, and a recommendation to PEMA and Council for review
and adoption.
(i) The Council will notify the water user in writing of its final
decision and the reasons for the decision regarding the appeal.
(4) An exemption or variance will only be granted to a water user to
the extent necessary to relieve extraordinary hardship and will be
conditioned upon compliance with all reasonable conservation
measures required by this Part or the variance or exemption.
(5) An exemption or variance approved by the Council may be modified
or rescinded if public health, safety and welfare require further
reduction in water use.
(6) An exemption or variance granted to a water user for a specific
property, purpose or person is not transferable to another property,
purpose or water user without prior written approval from PEMA
and the Council.
G. Implementation Period. This Part shall be implemented upon
declaration by the Governor of a drought or water shortage emergency,
and shall remain in effect during the period of the emergency until
terminated by action of the Governor or by concurrent resolution of the
General Assembly. Notice of the termination of the drought emergency
and the reversion of this Part to a standby status will be submitted to

LITTLE LEHIGH CREEK WATERSHED ACT 167 STORMWATER
MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE
A.
General Provisions.
§ 26-301. Short Title. [Ord. 1011, 6/5/2006, § 101]
This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Little Lehigh Creek
Watershed Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 26-302. Statement of Findings. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 102]
1. The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater
resulting from development throughout a watershed increases
flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, changes the natural hydrologic patterns, destroys
aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic pollutant concentrations and
loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and
control stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater
recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental
to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the
people of the municipality and all of the people of the
Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities
are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from
their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).23
23.Note: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.

§ 26-303. Purpose. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 103]
§ 26-304. Statutory Authority. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 104]
The municipality is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority
of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq., as
F. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer
systems can contribute to pollution of waters of the Commonwealth
by the municipality.
1. The purpose of this Part is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed by minimizing the
damages and maximizing the benefits described in § 26-302 of this Part
by provisions designed to:
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities which cause such problems.
B. Utilize and preserve the desirable existing natural drainage
systems.
C. Encourage infiltration of stormwater, where appropriate, to
maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface
and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.
D. Maintain the existing flows and quality of streams and
watercourses in the municipality and the Commonwealth.
E. Preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of streams.
F. Provide for proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater
management BMPs that are implemented in the municipality.
G. Provide review procedures and performance standards for
stormwater planning, design and management.
H. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
I. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa.Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
"existing uses" and maintain the level of water quality to support
those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality
in "special protection" streams.
J. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
K. Provide standards to meet the NPDES permit requirements.24
24.Note: Throughout this Part, these provisions are from the DEP Guidance on MS4
Ordinance Provisions and are not required for municipalities not subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations.

§ 26-306. Exemptions. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 106]
1. This Part shall only apply to those areas of the municipality which are
located within the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed as delineated on an
official map available for inspection at the municipal office. A map of the
Little Lehigh Creek Watershed at a reduced scale is included in
Appendix A for general reference. (Municipalities subject to the NPDES
Phase II regulations must ensure that all of the ordinance provisions
required to meet the MS4 NPDES requirements apply across the entire
municipality.) The following activities are defined as regulated activities
and shall be governed by this Part:
A. Land development.
B. Subdivision.
C. Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways,
parking lots, etc.).
D. Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
E. Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
F. Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
G. Regulated earth disturbance activities.
1. Impervious Cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those
defined in §§ 26-305.E and 26-305.F, which would create 10,000 square
feet or less of additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage
plan preparation provisions of this Part. All of the impervious cover
added incrementally to a site above the initial 10,000 square feet shall
be subject to the drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part. If a
site has previously received an exemption and is proposing additional
development such that the total impervious cover on the site exceeds
10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover on the site proposed
since the original ordinance date must meet the provisions of this Part.
A. The date of the Municipal Ordinance adoption of the original Little
Lehigh Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinance (1978) shall
be the starting point from which to consider tracts as "parent
tracts" in which future subdivisions and respective impervious area
computations shall be cumulatively considered.
B. For development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining conformance with these criteria.

§ 26-307. Compatibility with Other Ordinance Requirements. [Ord.
1011, 9/5/2006, § 109]
Approvals issued pursuant to this Part do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
C. Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways,
storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway
areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or
for the proposed regulated activity.
D. Any additional areas proposed to initially be gravel, crushed stone,
porous pavement, etc., shall be assumed to be impervious for the
purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria. Any existing
gravel, crushed stone or hard packed soil areas on a site shall be
considered as pervious cover for the purpose of exemption
evaluation.
2. Prior Drainage Plan Approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this Part is exempt from the
drainage plan preparation provisions of this Part, except as cited in
subsection C, provided that the approved drainage plan included design
of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions
in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under
the Municipalities Planning Code. If significant revisions are made to
the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval and the
effective date of this Part, preparation of a new drainage plan, subject
to the provisions of this Part, shall be required. Significant revisions
would include a change in control methods or techniques, relocation or
redesign of control measures or changes necessary because soil or
other conditions are not as stated on the original drainage plan.
3. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
4. No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in

limits are placed on site clearance prior to development allowing
for maximum retention of existing vegetation (woodlands and
other), minimum disturbance and compaction of existing soil
mantle and minimum site application of chemicals postdevelopment.
Typically, MD/MM includes disturbance setback
criteria from buildings as well as related site improvements such
as walkways, driveways, roadways, and any other improvements.
These criteria may vary by community context as well as by type
of development being proposed. Additionally, MD/MM also shall
include provisions (e.g., deed restrictions, conservation easements)
to protect these areas from future disturbance and from application
of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
MUNICIPALITY  Borough of Emmaus, Lehigh County,
Pennsylvania.

Regulated earth disturbance activities must he designed to
protect and maintain existing uses and maintain the level of
water quality necessary to protect those uses in all streams,
and to protect and maintain water quality in special protection
streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can
be impacted by addition of pollutants such as sediment, and
changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or
rates as a result of changes in land surface area from those
activities. Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters
must be managed to protect the stream bank, streambed and
structural integrity of the waterway, to prevent these impacts.

1. All regulated activities in the municipality shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this Part.
2. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unobstructed flow
in natural watercourses except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, pipe systems or open channels consistent with this Part.
3. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
4. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this Part. If diffused flow is proposed to be concentrated and
discharged onto adjacent property, the developer must document that
there are adequate downstream conveyance facilities to safely
transport the concentrated discharge to the point of predevelopment
flow concentration, to the stream reach or otherwise prove that no
harm will result from the concentrated discharge. Areas of existing
diffused drainage discharge shall be subject to any applicable release
rate criteria in the general direction of existing discharge whether they
are proposed to be concentrated or maintained as diffused drainage
areas.
5. Where a site is traversed by watercourses other than those for which a
one-hundred-year floodplain is defined by the municipality, there shall
be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the line
of such watercourses. The width of any easement shall be adequate to
provide for unobstructed flow of storm runoff based on calculations
made in conformance with § 26-327 for the one-hundred-year return
period runoff and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. The terms of the easement shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations which
may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
easement. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement to ensure proper
runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses for which the onehundred-
year floodplain is formally defined are subject to the applicable
municipal floodplain regulations.
6. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.

under [25] Pa. Code, Chapter 92.
4. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
5. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
1. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a drainage plan which
demonstrates compliance with this Part. This Part provides standards to
meet NPDES permit requirements associated with construction
activities and MS4 permit requirements.
2. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways. First, WQv shall be calculated using
the following formula:
WQv = (c)(P)(A)\12
Where:
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet
c = Rational Method post-development runoff coefficient
for the 2-year storm
P = 1.25 inches
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity
§ 26-323 FOREWORD § 26-324
FWD:601
Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff volume
from predevelopment to post-development for the two-year return
period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site shall be
considered in this calculation. The larger of these two calculated
volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and treated, except
that in no case shall the WQv be permitted to exceed 1.25 inches of
runoff over the site area. This standard does not limit the volume of
infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes of water quantity/
peak rate control.
3. The WQv shall be calculated for each post-development drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
4. If an applicant is proposing to use a dry extended detention basin, wet
pond, constructed wetland or other BMP that ponds water on the land
surface and may receive direct sunlight, the discharge from that BMP
must be treated by infiltration, a vegetated buffer, filter strip,
bioretention, vegetated swale or other BMP that provides a thermal
benefit to protect the high quality waters of the [Watershed Name] from
thermal impacts.
5. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
subsection 15, except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that
cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
6. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this Part.
7. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
subsection .15, except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that
cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
8. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed where an
applicant intends to use infiltration BMP's, the applicant shall conduct a
preliminary site investigation, including gathering data from published
sources, a field inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a
minimum of two percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G. This
investigation will determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal
high water table, soil permeability and location of special geologic
features, if applicable. This investigation may be done by a certified
Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO) except that the location(s) of
special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified geotechnical
professional.
9. Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
§ 26-324 EMMAUS CODE § 26-324
FWD:602
A. Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
B. Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet; except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be
below the invert of the BMP. (If the depth to bedrock is between
two and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water
table is not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth
to seasonal high water table is required.)
C. Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa. Code, § 73.15
percolation test in Appendix G) greater than or equal to 0.5 inches/
hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
D. Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(1) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(2) Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations; except for residential development where the
required set back is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet
upgradient from building foundations.
(3) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields; except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields.
(4) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is clone in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(5) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met; except for one and two family
residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
10. For entirely non-carbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in
subsection .21.
A. The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25)*(I)/12
§ 26-324 FOREWORD § 26-324
FWD:603
Where:
REv = Recharge volume in acre-feet
I = Impervious area in acres
B. The preliminary site investigation described in subsection .8 is
required and shall continue on different areas of the site until a
potentially suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is
determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas
that appear to be feasible based on the preliminary site
investigation, the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G shall be completed.
C. If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
D. The site must meet the conditions listed in subsection .9.
E. If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in subsection .15.
F. If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
11. In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to us
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
subsection .8 shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear
feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant shall
conduct the additional site investigation and testing as outlined in
Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and proposed loading rate,
each weighted as described in § 26-327, along with the buffer from
special geologic features shall be compared to the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D to determine if the site is recommended for
infiltration. In addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the
conditions listed in subsection .9 are required for infiltration in
carbonate areas.
Applicants are encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in
subsection .10, but are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a
carbonate site even if the site falls in the "Recommended" range on
the chart in Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be
subtracted from the WQv to be treated by non-infiltration BMPs. If
infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two
acceptable BMPs, as specified in subsection .15.
§ 26-324 EMMAUS CODE § 26-324
FWD:604
12. If a site has both carbonate and non-carbonate areas, the applicant
shall investigate the ability of the non-carbonate portion of the site to
fully meet this Part to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site
through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in subsection .11 or two other noninfiltration
BMPs as described in subsection .15 must be used. No
infiltration structure in the non-carbonate area shall be located within
50 feet of a boundary with carbonate bedrock, except when a
preliminary site investigation has been done showing the absence of
special geologic features within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration
area.
13. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the postdevelopment
two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80% or
more of the pre-development runoff volume for the carbonate portion of
the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the predevelopment
infiltration volume.
14. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
15. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet the requirement of this section. Acceptable BMPs
are listed below along with the recommended reference for design.

geologic feature(s). Additionally, stormwater runoff shall not be
discharged into existing on-site sinkholes.
19. Applicants shall request, in writing, public water suppliers to provide
the Zone I Wellhead Protection radius, as calculated by the method
outlined in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
Wellhead Protection regulations, for any public water supply well
within 400 feet of the site. In addition to the setback distances specified

and substantiated by the public water supplier in writing. If the
applicant does not receive a response from the public water supplier,
the Zone I radius is assumed to be 100 feet.

regulated activities must be managed to prevent the physical
degradation of receiving waters from such effects as scour and
streambank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements,
by controlling the two year post-development runoff to a 30% release
rate.
21. The municipality may, after consultation with DEP, approve alternative
methods for meeting the state water quality requirements other than
those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law including but not
limited to the Clean Streams Law.

§ 26-325. Stormwater Management Districts. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006,
§ 305]
1. Mapping of Stormwater Management Districts. To implement the
provisions of the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed Stormwater
Management Plan, the municipality is hereby divided into stormwater
management districts consistent with the Little Lehigh Creek Release
Rate Map presented in the plan update. The boundaries of the
stormwater management districts are shown on an official map which is
available for inspection at the municipal office. A copy of the official
map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix A for general reference.
2. Description of Stormwater Management Districts. Two types of
stormwater management districts may be applicable to the
municipality, namely Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts and
Dual Release Rate Districts as described below.
A. Conditional/Provisional No Detention Districts. Within these
districts, the capacity of the "local" runoff conveyance facilities (as
defined in Part 3B) must be calculated to determine if adequate
capacity exists. For this determination, the developer must
calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this Part. The larger of the two peak flows calculated
will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists. If adequate
capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site to the main
channel (as defined in Part 3B), these watershed areas may
discharge post-development peak runoff without detention
facilities. If the capacity calculations show that the "local" runoff
conveyance facilities lack adequate capacity, the developer shall
either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased
capacity of downstream elements to convey increased peak flows
consistent with § 26-326.16. Any capacity improvements must be
designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary
to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified
in § 26-326.4. By definition, a storm drainage problem area
associated with the "local" runoff conveyance facilities indicates
that adequate capacity does not exist. Sites in these districts are
still required to meet all of the water quality requirements in
§ 26-324.
B. Dual Release Rate Districts. Within this district, the two year postdevelopment
peak runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment
two year runoff peak. Further, the ten-year, twentyfive-
year and one-hundred-year post-development peak runoff must
be controlled to the stated percentage of the pre-development
peak. Release rates associated with the ten through one-hundred-
§ 26-325 EMMAUS CODE § 26-325
FWD:610
§ 26-326. Stormwater Management District Implementation
Provisions. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 306]
year events vary from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the
watershed.
1. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and post-construction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this Part.
2. Any stormwater management controls required by this Part and subject
to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release rate
criteria for each of the two, ten, twenty-five and one-hundred-year
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation methodology
specified in § 26-327.
3. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g. road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
4. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
Part shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
A. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
B. Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
C. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
5. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
§ 26-325 FOREWORD § 26-326
FWD:611
designed for up to a 100% release rate so long as the total runoff from
the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
6. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the pre-development peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the
overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.
7. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional/provisional no
detention subarea, the size of the pre-development drainage area on a
site may not be changed post-development to create potentially adverse
conditions on downstream properties except as part of a "no harm" or
hardship waiver procedure.
8. No portion of a site may be regraded between the Little Lehigh Creek
Watershed and any adjacent watershed except as part of a "no harm" or
hardship waiver procedure.
A. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development
site which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the
design release from the site will be the lesser of (a) the applicable
release rate flow assuming no closed depression(s) or (b) the
existing peak flow actually leaving the site. In cases where (b)
would result in an unreasonably small design release, the design
discharge of less than or equal to the release rate will be
determined by the available downstream conveyance capacity to
the main channel calculated using subsection .4 and the minimum
orifice criteria.
9. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in subsection .4 and the detention criteria in § 26-327.
10. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
11. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
§ 26-326 EMMAUS CODE § 26-326
FWD:612
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
12. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this Part.
13. "No Harm" Water Quantity Option. For any proposed development site
not located in a conditional/provisional no detention district, the
developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control
(including no detention) if the developer can prove that special
circumstances exist for the proposed development site and that "no
harm" would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that
specified by the plan. Special circumstances are defined as any
hydrologic or hydraulic aspects of the development itself not
specifically considered in the development of the plan runoff control
strategy. Proof of "no harm" would have to be shown from the
development site through the remainder of the downstream drainage
network to the confluence of the creek with the Delaware or Lehigh
River. Proof of "no harm" must be shown using the capacity criteria
specified in subsection .4 if downstream capacity analysis is a part of
the "no harm" justification. Attempts to prove "no harm" based upon
downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by
the following provisions:
A. The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated PSRM model
for the Little Lehigh Creek or as calculated by an applicant using an
alternate method acceptable to the municipality. The flow values
from the PSRM Model would be supplied to the developer by the
municipality upon request.
B. Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as
documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in
proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total
upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if
his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, he may use
up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity).
C. Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas would,
by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to prove "no
harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements
for the problem areas consistent with subsection .16. Any "no
harm" justifications shall be submitted by the developer as part of
the drainage plan submission per Part 3D. Developers submitting
"no harm" justifications must still meet all of the water quality
requirements of § 26-324.

§ 26-327. Calculation Methodology. [Ord. 1011, 9/5/2006, § 307]
14. Regional Detention Alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined based on the required
release rate at the point of discharge.
15. Capacity Improvements. In certain instances, primarily within the
conditional/provisional no detention areas, local drainage conditions
may dictate more stringent levels of runoff control than those based
upon protection of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the
developer could prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity
improvements to relieve the capacity deficiency in the local drainage
network, then the capacity improvements could be provided by the
developer in lieu of runoff controls on the development site. Peak flow
calculations shall be done assuming that the local watershed is in the
existing condition and then assuming that the local watershed is
developed per current zoning and using the specified runoff controls.
Any capacity improvements would be designed using the larger of the
above peak flows and the capacity criteria specified in subsection .4. All
new development in the entire subarea(s) within which the proposed
development site is located shall be assumed to implement the
developer's proposed discharge control, if any. Capacity improvements
may also be provided as necessary to implement any regional detention
alternatives or to implement a modified "no harm" option which
proposes specific capacity improvements to provide that a less
stringent discharge control would not create any harm downstream.
1. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the rational method or the soil-cover-complex methodology.
2. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D shall be calculated as follows:
(Area Tributary to infiltration BMP
Base area of infiltration BMP)
*100%
The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
All disturbed areas to be made
impervious:
Weight at 100%
All disturbed areas to be made
pervious:
Weight at 50%
§ 26-326 EMMAUS CODE § 26-327
FWD:614
All undisturbed pervious areas: Weight at 0%
All existing impervious areas: Weight at 100%
3. Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D is the measured soil thickness multiplied by the
thickness factor based on soil permeability (as measured by the
adapted 25 Pa.Code § 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G), as follows:
Permeability Range* Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 inches/hour 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 inches/hour 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 inches/hour 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 inches/hour 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 inches/hour 1.0
* If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 Pa.Code
§ 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 in/hr or less than 0.5 in/
hr, as measured by the adapted 25 Pa.Code § 73.15 percolation test in
Appendix G, are not recommended for infiltration.
4. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this Part shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the storage indication method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be either the Universal Rational Hydrograph or the
Modified Rational Method trapezoidal hydrograph which maximizes
detention volume. Use of the Modified Rational hydrograph shall be
consistent with the procedure described in Section "PIPE.RAT" of the
Users' Manual for the Penn State Urban Hydrograph Method (1987).
5. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the storage indication method.
6. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
7. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows.
§ 26-327 FOREWORD § 26-327
FWD:615
8. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum one foot
freeboard above the maximum pool elevation associated with the two
through twenty-five-year runoff events. A 0.5 foot freeboard shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two through onehundred-
year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minimum 0.5 foot freeboard measured to the top of basin.
The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas
tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention
facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design of
the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and
may be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year
event.
9. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable with a three inch orifice provided that as much of the site
runoff as practical is directed to the detention facilities. The minimum
three inch diameter does not apply to the control of the WQv.
10. Runoff calculations using the soil-cover-complex method shall use the
Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-four-hour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four hour rainfall depths for the
various return periods to be used consistent with this Part may be taken
from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2 or the PennDOT Intensity - Duration -
Frequency Field Manual ("PDT-IDF") (May 1986) for Region 4. The
following values are taken from the PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period 24-Hour Rainfall Depth
1-year 2.40 inches
2-year 3.00 inches
5-year 3.60 inches
10-year 4.56 inches
25-year 5.52 inches
50-year 5.48 inches
100-year 7.44 inches
A graphical and tabular presentation of the Type II-24 hour
distribution is included in Appendix C.
11. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2, Version 2.1, 2004, or the
Intensity-Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.
§ 26-327 EMMAUS CODE § 26-327
FWD:616
12. Runoff curve numbers (CN's) to be used in the soil-cover-complex
method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.
13. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix C.
14. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
A. Sheet Flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex method.
B. Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
C. Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.
D. Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.
15. If using the Rational Method, all pre-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all post-development calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
16. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C or other appropriate
standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities shall be
determined by methods acceptable to the municipality.
17. The Pennsylvania DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, apply to
the construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both
existing and proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments
throughout the watershed. Criteria for design and construction of
stormwater management facilities according to this Part may not be the
same criteria that are used in the permitting of dams under the Dam
Safety Program.

4. The municipality may require an "as-built survey" of all stormwater
BMPs and an explanation of any discrepancies with the drainage plan.
1. The municipality may hear requests for waivers where it is alleged that
the provisions of this Part inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The waiver request shall be in writing and accompanied by
the requisite fee based upon a fee schedule adopted by the municipality.
A copy of the waiver request shall be provided to each of the following:
municipality, municipal engineer, municipal solicitor and Lehigh Valley
Planning Commission. The request shall fully document the nature of
the alleged hardship.
2. The municipality may grant a waiver provided that all of the following
findings are made in a given case:
A. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity of lot size or shape, or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions, and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this Part in the stormwater
management district in which the property is located.
B. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Part, including the "no harm"
provisions, and that the authorization of a waiver is therefore
necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property.
C. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.

of meaning of a term that is not defined by this chapter to the Zoning
Hearing Board.

FWD:646
3. Removal of Members. This shall be governed by § 905 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
4. Organization of Board. This shall be governed by § 906 of the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
5. Zoning Hearing Board Functions. The Zoning Hearing Board shall be
responsible for the following:
A. Appeal of a Decision by the Zoning Officer.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant (a person affected or any agency of the Borough)
that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed
procedures, or has misinterpreted or misapplied any valid
provision of this chapter.
(2) See time limitations for appeals in § 27-111(6).
B. Challenge to the Validity of the Ordinance or Map.
(1) The Board shall hear challenges to the validity of this chapter
filed with the Board in writing by the landowner affected, any
officer or agency of the Borough, or any person aggrieved.
(2) After the conclusion of the hearing(s), the Board shall decide
all questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues of
fact, within the time limits of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
C. Variance.
(1) The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with the
Board in writing by any landowner (or any tenant with the
permission of such landowner).
(2) Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of state law. (As of 1993, the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq., provided
that all of the following findings must be made, where relevant:
(a) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot
size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
(b) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and
§ 27-111 FOREWORD § 27-111
FWD:647
a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property;
(c) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
(d) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and,
(e) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.)
(3) Variance Conditions. In granting any variance, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may
deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter and
to protect the public health and safety. The Board may in
variance cases prohibit certain otherwise permitted uses on a
lot where the Board finds that such uses would be contrary to
the public interest considering the facts and circumstances of
the case and the variance.
(4) Side Yard Exceptions for Accessory Structures.
(a) The following provision shall only apply to the placement
of a one story customarily accessory structure of less than
600 square feet of building floor area or a household
swimming pool serving a dwelling unit if such structure or
pool is proposed within the required setback area for such
use along abutting lot lines of another lot(s).
(i) If all abutting property-owner(s) of record along such
abutting affected lot line sign a notarized statement
clearly stating that he/she does not object to such
reduction of the required setback for the placement of
such structure or pool, and the Zoning Officer
determines that no other Borough requirement would
prevent such placement of such structure or pool,
then the Zoning Officer shall permit such reduction or
waiver of such required accessory setback, without
the requirement for a zoning variance.
(ii) In such case, future owners of such abutting lots shall
not have the right to require movement of such
structure or pool.
(b) If the abutting property owner does not provide such
waiver, that lack of support shall not by itself prevent the
Board from granting a variance.
§ 27-111 EMMAUS CODE § 27-111
FWD:648
D. Special Exception Uses.
(1) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Board in writing by any landowner (or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner), as provided
in this chapter and in accordance with such standards and
criteria contained in this chapter and the procedures in
§ 27-119.
(2) Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this chapter, as it
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter
and to protect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(3) See special exception use process in § 27-119.
E. Hearings. See § 27-112.
F. Records and Reports. The staff to the Board shall keep full public
records of its business.
G. Court Appeals. In the case of an appeal from the Board to the court
of common pleas, the appellant shall make the return required by
law and should promptly notify the Borough Zoning Hearing Board
Solicitor of such appeal.
H. Appeal by the Zoning Officer. See § 27-105(4).
6. Time Limits for Appeals. The time limitations for appeals shall be as
follows:
A. No person shall be allowed to file any appeal with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after the decision by the Zoning
Officer that is being appealed has been officially issued, or appeal
with the County Court of Common Pleas later than 30 days after a
decision of the Zoning Hearing Board has been officially issued,
except as may be provided under § 914.1 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10914.1.
B. The failure of an aggrieved person other than the landowner to
appeal an adverse decision directly related to a preliminary
subdivision or land development plan shall preclude an appeal from
a final plan approval except in the case where the final submission
substantially deviates from the approved preliminary plan.
C. This thirty-day time limit for appeals shall not apply to the
revocation of a permit under § 27-107(6).

8. Time Limits on Permits and Variances. The following time limits shall
apply to a zoning permit or the zoning portion of a building permit, but
shall not limit the time limits for a permit under the Borough Building
Code:
A. After a variance is approved or a conditional or special exception
approval is officially authorized under this chapter, then a zoning
permit shall be secured by the applicant within 12 months after the
date of such approval or authorization. Such action under such
permit shall then substantially begin within 12 months of the
issuance of the permit.
B. If the applicant submits complete plans for a required site plan
review or subdivision or land development approval or special
exception or conditional use approval that is related to the variance
or issuance of a permit under this chapter within the above time
limits, then such time limits shall begin after such plan review is
completed or such plan approval is granted.
C. For good cause the Zoning Officer may, upon application in writing
stating the reasons therefore, extend in writing the twelve-month
application period to up to 18 months.
D. If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits within the
above time period, or, after obtained, the permittee fails to
diligently commence substantial construction within 12 months or
allows interruptions in substantial construction of longer than six
months, it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant has
waived, withdrawn or abandoned the approval, and all such
approvals, variances and permits shall be deemed automatically
rescinded.
E. Any building construction shall be completed within 30 months of
issuance of an applicable permit, unless a written extension is
granted by the Zoning Officer for good cause, or unless a more
restrictive requirement is established by the Borough Building
Code [Chapter 5]. Otherwise, a permit shall be considered to have
automatically expired at the end of such thirty-month period.

organization to own, maintain and preserve the open space,
conforming to the following standards:
(a) The organization shall be established by the developer
prior to the occupancy, sale or rent of any dwellings.
Membership in the organization shall be binding upon all
property owners in the PRD.

unless an alternative form of ownership is approved by
Borough Council.
(d) If such organization shall fail to adequately maintain the
common open space in reasonable order and condition in

organization or upon the residents or owners of property
within the PRD setting forth the shortcomings of such
maintenance. Such notice shall state that deficiencies shall
be corrected within 30 days, or a longer period as may be
established by Borough Council. Such notice shall state
the date and place of a Borough Council public meeting on
such subject.
(i) If the deficiencies are not corrected within the time
limit established by Council after such public meeting,
then the Borough, at its option, shall have the
authority to accomplish or have accomplished such
maintenance for such time as determined to be
necessary by Borough Council. Such maintenance
shall not constitute a taking of the property, nor vest in
the public any rights to use the property.
(ii) The Borough Council may end such maintenance at its
option. Borough Council may at any time determine
that the property owners association is now able to
maintain the open space, and may return maintenance
responsibilities.
(iii) The cost of such maintenance by the Borough shall be
assessed ratably against the properties within the
PRD that have the right of use of the common open
space, and may be enforced through liens.
(2) The Borough Council may at any time, at its option, voluntarily
accept dedication of all or part of the common open space or
permit dedication to another appropriate governmental agency
or an established incorporated nature conservation
organization, if Borough Council deems appropriate, and if
officially offered by the entity currently responsible for
ownership and maintenance.

regulation otherwise granted the Borough by law.
(2) All provisions of an approved PRD plan shall run in favor of the
property owners of the PRD, but only to the extent expressly
provided in the development plan, and to the extent such
provisions, whether recorded by plat, covenant, easement or
otherwise may be enforced by law or equity by said residents
acting individually, jointly or through an organization
designated in the development plan to act on their behalf;
provided, however, that no provisions of the development plan
shall be implied to exist in favor of residents of the PRD except
as to those portions of the development plan which have been
finally approved and have been recorded.
(3) All provisions of the development plan authorized to be
enforced by the Borough under this section may be modified,
removed or released by Borough Council for good cause,
except grants or easements relating to the service or
equipment of a public utility subject to the following
conditions:
(a) No such modification, removal or release of the provisions
of the development plan by the Borough shall affect the
rights of property owners within the PRD to maintain and
enforce those provisions, at law or equity, as provided in
this section.
(b) No modification, removal or release of the provisions of
the development plan by the Borough shall be permitted
except upon a finding by Borough Council at a regular
public meeting or a public hearing on such matter that
such change is: (i) consistent with the efficient
development of the entire PRD and the preservation of the
open space; (ii) does not adversely affect the public
interest or the enjoyment of land adjacent to the PRD; and,
(iii) is not granted solely to confer a special benefit upon
any person.
(4) Property owners within the PRD may, to the extent and in the
manner expressly authorized by provisions of the development
plan, modify, remove or release their rights to enforce the
provisions of the development plan that are granted to them,
but no such action shall affect the right of the Borough to
enforce the provisions of the development plan in accordance
with the provisions of this section.

previously approved PRD (such as but not limited to the minor
shifting in the location of principal buildings, off-street parking
areas, driveways, accessways or common open space or
adjustments in phasing) shall require review of the Planning
Commission and approval by the Borough Council under the
same requirements that would apply to a revision to a final

4. Other Requirements. All of the same regulations in this chapter and
other Borough ordinances that would apply to any other development
shall also apply to a SFCD, except for those requirements that are
specifically stated in this section as being adjusted.
5. Conditions for Approval. In addition to the specific requirements of this
section, a SFCD shall only be approved as a conditional use if the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Borough Council, based upon
review by the Planning Commission, that the following conditions will
be met:
A. That the SFCD would clearly serve a valid public purpose that
would result in a development that would be superior to what
would result if the land would be development as a conventional
development. Such valid public purposes include but are not
limited to the following:
(1) The permanent preservation through deed restrictions of
dense forests, steep slopes, wetlands, creek valleys, highly
scenic areas or other sensitive natural features.
(2) The permanent preservation of a substantial area of land in
agricultural uses, in a sized tract that allows for efficient
agricultural use.
(3) The dedication of public parkland at a site along a perennial
waterway or that is adjacent to existing public parkland or
where a proposed park is recommended by the Borough's
Comprehensive Plan or Park and Recreation Plan or that is
otherwise deemed by the Borough Council to be clearly
suitable for active or passive recreation.
(4) The clustering of homes in a location that will be substantially
buffered from highly-noxious nuisance generating uses, such
as an existing or planned expressway or major arterial
highway.
B. That the SFCD has been designed in full consideration of important
natural features, including mature woodlands, creek valleys, steep
slopes and wetlands. Areas along creeks shall be preserved in their
natural state, except for landscaping, erosion control
improvements and needed utility, street and driveway crossings.
6. Open Space.
A. Minimum Amount of Open Space.
(1) A minimum of 20% of the tract area within a SFCD shall be
permanently preserved as public, semipublic or private open
space, which shall be preserved by a conservation easement or
dedication within the requirements of this section.
§ 27-308 FOREWORD § 27-308
FWD:713
(2) The required open space under this section shall be in addition
to any open space required to be preserved or dedicated or
fees in lieu of recreation land that may be required under other
sections of this chapter or the Borough Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance [Chapter 22].
B. Method of Preserving Open Space.
(1) The method of ownership and preservation of the required
open space shall be determined prior to conditional use
approval. The Borough shall be given right of first refusal at
the time of the conditional use review to accept proposed open
space as public open space. Required open space shall be
permanently preserved by one of the following methods:
(a) Dedication to Emmaus Borough as public open space, if
the Borough Council agrees in writing to such dedication
and agrees to maintain such land for public open space.
(b) Dedication to the County of Lehigh as public open space, if
the County government agrees in writing to such
dedication and agrees to maintain such land for public
open space.
(c) Dedication to the East Penn School District if the school
district agrees in writing to accept such dedication and to
use and maintain the land for public school buildings and
public open space.
(d) Dedication to a legally binding homeowner association as
common nonpublic open space, with such homeowners
being legally bound to ensure the maintenance and
preservation of such land.
(e) Dedication of the land itself or dedication of a permanent
conservation easement to an established nature
conservation organization acceptable to the Borough
Council. (Such dedication may or may not involve actual
ownership by such organization and may or may not
provide for public access.) If only a conservation easement
is to be dedicated, then such open space may remain
privately owned within certain lots that are larger than
would otherwise be required.
(f) Dedication of a permanent conservation easement to the
Borough, with such land remaining privately owned and
part of individual lots. The Borough may also require that
duplicate conservation easements be provided through
agreements with both the Borough and a nature
conservation organization to provide increased assurance
that the land will be preserved.
§ 27-308 EMMAUS CODE § 27-308
FWD:714
(2) The Borough Council shall only approve a SFCD if such Council
determines that there will be an acceptable method to ensure
permanent preservation of the required open space. Narrow
stretches of isolated publicly-owned open space stretching
between residential lots should be avoided because of limited
usefulness and to ensure the security and privacy of nearby
residents.
C. Open Space Standards. Required open spaces shall meet all of the
following requirements:
(1) Such open space shall be permanently deed restricted to
prevent the construction of buildings or the use for any
commercial purposes or the use of the land for commercial
forestry.
(2) Stormwater detention basins and areas within 25 feet of
existing or proposed buildings shall not count towards the
required open space, except for areas that the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Borough Council will clearly be
suitable and safe for active or passive recreation.
(3) Wetlands as defined by current federal or state regulations
shall not count towards the required open space.
(4) Land immediately beneath or within 50 feet of electric
overhead transmission lines of 35 or more kilovolts of intended
capacity and towers shall not count towards the required open
space.
(5) Open space intended to be open to the public shall meet one of
the following two requirements:
(a) Have pedestrian access a minimum of 20 feet width to a
public street or a private street to which the public is
permanently granted access and be a minimum of three
contiguous acres in area; or,
(b) Directly abut an existing common open space area which
has such access.
(6) Any homeowner association agreement shall be subject to
review by a Solicitor appointed by the Borough Council, and
the Borough Council may require reasonable adjustments to
such agreement based upon such review. The provisions of
§ 705(f) parts (1) and (2) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code, as amended, 53 P.S. § 10705(f) or such
successor sections, shall serve as a general guide for such
agreement.
(7) Improvements to Open Spaces. The application shall include a
detailed and legally binding (if approved) description of what

to be publicly dedicated to make it suitable for its intended
purpose.

passive recreation include preservation and planting of
trees, development of nature, bicycle or jogging trails, the
stabilization of creek banks and the removal of undesirable
vegetation.
(b) Examples of such improvements for areas intended for
active recreation include rough grading of land to create

course (with areas within the SFCD having a 3% maximum impervious
coverage), nature preserves, Borough-owned recreation and their
customary permitted accessory uses.
8. Phasing. The development shall include a phasing system that shall be
approved by the Borough Council. Such phases shall ensure that the
requirements of this Part would be met after the completion of any one
phase, and that the development could properly function without the
construction of additional phases.

addition to other requirements of this chapter, the following
requirements shall apply to all development in the B-C District:
A. Porches. No front porch in the B-C District shall be enclosed in any

1. Purposes.
A. To regulate development in areas of the Borough where streams
are known to possess flooding characteristics and/or chronic
wetness which, if indiscriminately developed, could pose hazards to
§ 27-515 EMMAUS CODE § 27-516
FWD:772
the public health, safety and welfare due to flood and pollution and
to regulate development in areas of known flooding in the Borough.
B. To reduce the financial burden imposed on the Borough, its
governmental units and its individuals by frequent and periodic
floods and overflows on lands.
C. To permit certain uses which can be appropriately located in such
areas and which will not impede the flow of flood waters, or
otherwise cause danger of life and property at, above or below
their locations along areas subject to flooding.
D. To provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of
stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation.
E. To regulate development in flood hazard areas in accordance with
the Federal Insurance Administration's requirements for flood
management and the Pennsylvania Floodplain Management Act, 32
P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
2. Designations. Flood hazard areas are designated and interpreted as
follows:
A. Identification of Floodplain Ares.
(1) Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be those
areas of the Borough of Emmaus which are subject to the onehundred-
year flood, as identified in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) dated November 7, 2001, and the accompanying maps
prepared for the Borough by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision
thereof.
(2) Description of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain area
shall consist of the following specific areas:
(a) FW (Floodway Area). The areas identified as "Floodway" in
the AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by the
FEMA. The term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources
of information for those floodplain areas where no
floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study.
(b) FF (Flood-Fringe Area). The remaining portions of the onehundred-
year floodplain in those areas identified as an AE
Zone in the Flood Insurance Study, where a floodway has
been delineated.
The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall
be the one-hundred-year flood elevations as shown in the
flood profiles contained in the Flood Insurance Study.
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:773
(c) FA (General Floodplain Area). The areas identified as Zone
A in the FIS for which no one-hundred-year flood
elevations have been provided. When available,
information from other federal, state, and other acceptable
sources shall be used to determine the one-hundred-year
elevation, as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no
other information is available, the one-hundred-year
elevation shall be determined by using a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest
the construction site in question.
In lieu of the above, the Borough may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional
engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by
the Borough.
(3) Changes in Identification of Area. The identified floodplain
area may be revised or modified by the Council where studies
or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal
Insurance Administration (FIA).
B. When exact measurements do not exist, the boundaries of the flood
hazard areas shall be determined by scaling distances off the Flood
Insurance Rate Map. A person who contests the location of a
boundary as shown on the map and is denied a permit shall appeal
the denial to the Zoning Hearing Board. The person contesting the
location of a flood hazard area shall have the burden of establishing
that the land does not lie within a flood hazard area.
C. Records of elevations of the lowest floor (including basement) and
floodproofing levels shall be obtained and maintained for all new or
substantially improved structures in the flood hazard areas and
shall indicate whether or not such structures contain a basement.
D. With any FW (Floodway Area), the following provisions apply:
(1) Any new construction, development, use, activity, or
encroachment that would case any increase in flood heights
shall be prohibited.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed, unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection, Bureau of Dams, Waterways and Wetlands.
§ 27-516 EMMAUS CODE § 27-516
FWD:774
E. Within any FE (Special Floodplain Area) or FA (General Floodplain
Area), the following provisions apply:
(1) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse, unless a permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Dams,
Waterways and Wetlands.
(2) No new construction or development shall be located within
the area measured 50 feet landward from the top-of-bank of
any watercourse.
(3) Any new construction or development, which would cause any
increase in flood heights, shall be prohibited within any
floodway area.
F. Elevation and Floodproofing Requirements.
(1) Residential Structures. Within any identified floodplain area,
any new construction or substantial improvement of a
residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood
elevation.
(2) Non-residential Structures.
(a) Within any identified floodplain area, any new construction
or substantial improvement of a non-residential structure
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation, or be
designed and constructed so that the space enclosed by
such structure shall remain either completely or
essentially dry during any flood up to that height.
(b) Any non-residential structure, or part thereof, having a
lowest floor which is not elevated to at least 1 1/2 feet
above the one-hundred-year flood elevation shall be
floodproofed in a completely or essentially dry manner in
accordance with the WI or W2 space classification
standards contained in the publication entitled "Flood-
Proofing Regulations" published by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (June 1972, as amended March 1992) or which
some other equivalent standard. All plans and
specifications for such floodproofing shall be accompanied
by a statement certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect which states that the proposed
design and methods of construction are in conformance
with the above referenced standards.
(3) Space Below the Lowest Floor.
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-516
FWD:775
(a) Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (including
basement) is prohibited.
(b) Partially enclosed space below the lowest floor (including
basement) which will be used solely for the parking of a
vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an area
other than a basement, shall be designed and constructed
to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood waters for
the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on exterior
walls. The term "partially enclosed space" also includes
crawl spaces.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
(i) A minimum of two openings having a net total area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed space.
(ii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
(iii) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, etc.,
or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.

May Endanger Human Life," shall be stored at or above the
regulatory flood elevation and/or flood proofed to the
maximum extent possible.
(6) Placement of Buildings and Structures. All buildings and
structures shall be designed, located, and constructed so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be
designed to have a minimum effect upon the flow and height of
flood water.
(7) Anchoring.
(a) All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in
accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.

7. A regulatory floodway is hereby adopted as that area within the flood
hazard area indicated on the Federal Insurance Administrator's Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map. The regulatory floodway shall be
designed to carry the waters of the base flood without increasing the
base flood level more than one foot at any point. In the regulatory
floodway, any development, substantial improvement or encroachment
(including fill) which will result in any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge is prohibited.
8. Areas Between the One-Hundred-Year and Five-Hundred-Year
Floodplain. Where permitted within any area lying between the onehundred-
year and a defined five-hundred-year floodplain, any structure

9. Variances in the Flood Hazard Areas Granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board. In addition to the factors stipulated in Part 1 of this chapter for a
variance, the following requirements shall be applicable:
A. Variances shall not be issued within the designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
B. Except for a possible modification of the freeboard requirement
involved, no variance shall be granted for any of the other
requirements of this section.
C. The applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of a
Borough official that:
(1) The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(2) Such construction below the base flood elevation increase risks
to life and property.
D. Variances.

§ 27-517. Karst Hazards. [Ord. 776, 6/21/1993, § 517; as added by
Ord. 802, 9/19/1994, § 3]
(1) General. If compliance with any of the requirements of this
Part would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective
builder, developer or landowner, the Borough may, upon
request, grant relief from the strict application of the
requirements.
(2) Variance Procedures and Conditions.
(a) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least
modification necessary to provide relief.
(b) In granting any variance, the Borough shall attach
whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it
considers necessary in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, and to achieve the objectives of this
Part.
(c) In reviewing any request for a variance, the Borough shall
consider, at a minimum, the following:
(i) That there is good and sufficient cause.
(ii) That failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(iii) That the granting of the variance will (i) neither result
in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense, (ii) nor create
nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the public, or
conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances and regulations.
(d) A complete record of all variance requests and related
actions shall be maintained by the Borough. In addition, a
report of all variances granted during the year shall be
included in the annual report to the Federal Insurance
Administration.
Notwithstanding any of the above, however, all structures
shall be designed and constructed so as to have the
capability of resisting the one-hundred-year flood.
1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to recognize the potential for
damage to public and private improvements, human injury or death,
and the disruption of vital public services which may arise by the
potential for sinkholes and/or subsidence within areas of carbonate
geology. A further purpose of this section is to minimize the potential
for such sinkhole and/or subsidence occurrence and to protect the
§ 27-516 FOREWORD § 27-517
FWD:787
ground water resource. Should the regulations of this and other
applicable regulations conflict, the most stringent regulations shall
apply.
2. Disclaimer of Liability. Wheras the exact occurrence of sinkholes and/or
subsidence is not predictable, the administration of these regulations
shall create no liability on behalf of the Borough Engineer, Borough
employees or Borough agencies as to damages which may be associated
with the formation of sinkholes or subsidence. That is, compliance with
these regulations represents no warranty, finding, guarantee, or
assurance that a sinkhole and/or subsidence will not occur on an
approved property. The Borough, its agencies, consultants and
employees assume no liability for any financial or other damages which
may result from sinkhole activity.
3. Karst Hazard Indicator Map. Areas of the Borough in which Karst
features are believed more likely to be present are shown on the Karst
Indicator Map at the end of this chapter. These areas of the "carbonate"
areas shown on the map. The sinkholes, quarries, limonite excavations,
solution pans, closed, semi-closed or linear depressions and iron
surface mines delineated on the Karst Hazard Indicator Map were
taken from two sources. (1) Sinkholes and Karst related features
mapping for Lehigh County prepared by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, Bureau of
Topographic and Geologic Survey (open file report 8701); (2) the Little
Lehigh Creek Basin Carbonate Prototype Area Closed Depression Map
prepared by R.E. Wright Associates, Inc. The Karst Hazard Indicator
Map is intended as a tool to assist applicants and the Borough in
identifying Karst hazard areas. However, the Karst Hazard Indicator
Map is not the exclusive tool for locating Karst features. The Borough
shall also utilize generally accepted geological techniques to locate
such features.
4. Procedures.
A. As part of the preliminary plan requirements for all subdivisions
and land developments the applicant shall engage a qualified
professional to review the existing aerial photos, soils, geological
and related data available to him as it may pertain to the subject
property and to make a site inspection of the property.
B. A site inspection by the applicant's professional using all available
data and with such assistance as is needed shall determine the
presence or absence of Karst surface features of the site, and
locate the same if present on a site plan at a scale no smaller than
one inch to 100 feet. In particular, the following features shall be
located, if present on, the site:
Closed depressions;
Open sinkholes;
§ 27-517 EMMAUS CODE § 27-517
FWD:788
Seasonal high water table indicators;
Unplowed areas in plowed fields;
Surface drainage into ground;
Limonite excavations and quarries;
Any Karst feature shown on the Karst Features Indicator Map.
C. The applicant must provide the Borough with a map at a scale of
one inch to 100 feet that shows the Karst features listed in
subsection (4)(B).
D. Based upon the site inspection, the applicant's professional shall
determine what further testing should be done by the applicant to
ensure compliance with performance standards set forth in
subsection (4)(B). Testing methodology shall be reasonable under
the circumstances, including (1) the scale of the proposed
development; and (2) the hazards revealed by examination of
available data and site inspection.
E. The applicant shall cause the additional testing, if any to be
effected, and shall submit test results to the Borough Engineer.
F. The Borough Engineer shall report to the Borough Planning
Commission and/or Council, with a copy to the applicant, his
opinion concerning the adequacy of the report submitted based
upon the scale of the development and the hazards revealed by the
report, and shall make recommendations to the Planning
Commission and/or Council based upon the report submitted
concerning site development, including stormwater management,
the layout of utility lines and building location. The Borough
Engineer may require the applicant to perform such additional
testing as may be appropriate.
5. Performance Standards.
A. All applicants for subdivisions or land developments shall comply
with the requirements of this Part regarding Karst hazards.
B. No stormwater detention facility shall be placed within 100 feet of
the features listed in subsection (4)(B), unless a detailed
geotechnical solution to the subsidence, pollution and safety
problems of the Karst feature has been presented by a competent
professional in carbonate geology.
C. No stormwater swale with design flows in excess of 10 cubic feet
per second for the ten-year flood may be constructed within 100
feet of the features listed in subsection (4)(B), unless a detailed
geotechnical solution to the subsidence, pollution and safety
problems of the Karst feature has been presented by a competent
professional in carbonate geology.

§ 27-518. Alluvial Soils Areas. [Ord. 776, 6/21/1993, § 518; as added
by Ord. 802, 9/19/1994, § 4; as amended by Ord. 940, 1/7/2002, § 1]
D. No storm sewer pipe shall be constructed within 100 feet of the
features listed in subsection (4) (B) unless it is concrete pipe
utilizing 0-ring joints.
E. No principal or accessory building, no structure and no impervious
surface shall be located closer than 100 feet from the edge of the
features listed in subsection (4) (B) unless a detailed geotechnical
solution to the subsidence, pollution and safety problems of the
Karst feature has been presented by a competent professional in
carbonate geology.
F. No septic systems or tile field, no swimming pool, no solid waste
disposal area, transfer area or facility, no oil, gasoline, salt or
chemical storage area, and no blasting for quarry or well
enhancement activities shall occur within 100 feet of the features
listing in subsection (4)(B) unless a detailed geotechnical solution
to the subsidence, pollution and safety problems of the Karst
feature has been presented by a competent professional in
carbonate geology.
G. Soil erosion and sedimentation control plans filed with the County
Soil Conservation Service shall detail safeguards to protect
identified Karst features.
H. All water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer lines located in a Karst
hazard area shall be so constructed as to not permit the flow of
water along the utility line trench, and shall be imperviously diked
at thirty-foot intervals.
1. Determination of Alluvial Soils Areas.
A. The following soil types have been designated as "alluvial soils" by
the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and
are identified as "soils subject to flooding" on the soil maps
published in the Soil Survey for Lehigh County, Pennsylvania,
issued November 1963:
Aw Atkins silt loam
Ln Linside silt loam
Mh Melvin silt loam
MkA Melvin silt loam, local alluvium, 0-3% slopes
MkB Melvin silt loam, local alluvium, 3-8% slopes
B. The Borough Zoning Officer shall require that a detailed on-site
survey be made (by a qualified engineer, soil scientist or qualified
sanitarian approved by the Borough Council) in accordance with
accepted on-site survey techniques to determine the exact extent
§ 27-517 EMMAUS CODE § 27-518
FWD:790
and nature of all areas susceptible to potential problems of
flooding, wetness or pollution before issuing a zoning permit for:
(1) Any proposed use within an "alluvial soils" area; or,
(2) Any underground sewage disposal system which is located
within 100 feet of an "alluvial soils" area.
2. Use Regulations. The following uses shall be prohibited on any portion
of a site which, upon completion of the detailed on-site survey
mentioned in subsection (1)(B), is found to contain potential hazards
due to flooding, wetness or pollution:
A. All new or substantially improved residential dwellings and
commercial, institutional or industrial structures, including
hospitals, nursing homes, jails and manufactured homes and their
accessory structures.
B. Any new or substantially improved structure which will be used for
the production or storage of any of the following materials or
substances, or which will be used for any activity requiring the
maintenance of a supply (more than 550 gallons or other
comparable volume, or any amount of radioactive substances) of
any of the following materials or substances on the premises:
acetone, ammonia, benzene, calcium carbide, carbon disulfide,
celluloid, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, hydrocyanic acid,
magnesium, nitric acid and oxides of nitrogen, petroleum products
(such as gasoline or fuel oil), phosphorus, potassium, sodium,
sulphur and sulphur products, pesticides (including insecticides,
fungicides and rodenticides) and radioactive substances, insofar as
such substances are not otherwise regulated, and substances and
materials defined by applicable federal and state regulations as
toxic or hazardous.

Part 6
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 27-601. Required Number of Parking Spaces. [Ord. 776, 6/21/
1993, § 601; as amended by Ord. 1009, 12/4/2006]
1. Overall Requirements.
A. Number of Spaces. Each use that is newly developed, enlarged,
significantly changed in type or increased in number of
establishments shall provide and maintain off-street parking spaces
in accordance with Table 6.1 and the regulations of this Part,
except as exempted by § 27-602(6) in the B-C district.
B. Uses Not Listed. Uses not specifically listed in Table 6.1 shall
comply with the requirements for the most similar use listed in
Table 6.1, unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Zoning officer, after a review by the Planning Commission, that an
alternative standard should be used for that use.
C. Multiple Uses. Where a proposed lot contains or includes more
than one type of use, the number of parking spaces required shall
be the sum of the parking requirements for each separate use,
except as may be allowed under § 27-601(2), below.
D. Calculation. Where the calculation of required parking spaces does
not result in a whole number, the calculation shall be rounded to
the closest whole number.
E. Shared Use. The required parking spaces for any number of
separate uses may be combined through an appropriate long-term
mechanism within a single lot. The required spaces assigned to one
use shall not be assigned to meet the requirements of a second use
except:
(1) As may be authorized by § 27-601(2), below; or,
(2) That 50% of the required parking spaces for a place of worship,
a theater, a membership club, (not including a restaurant or
tavern) or an auditorium whose public attendance would be at
night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use that will have an
insignificant or no parking demand during such nights or
Sundays.
F. Net Increase. The requirements of this Part shall be based upon the
net increase in parking spaces. If the creation of off-street parking
results in a reduction in the number of legal on-street parking
spaces, then those numbers of reduced parking spaces shall also be
required to be provided, unless the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that those on-street
parking spaces were rarely occupied.
§ 27-601 FOREWORD § 27-601
FWD:793
G. Off-Site Parking. See § 27-602(5) and § 27-602(6).
2. Reduction of Parking Requirements by Special Exception.
A. Purposes. To minimize impervious surfaces, while ensuring
adequate parking; to recognize unique circumstances may justify a
reduction in parking.
B. The Zoning Hearing Board may permit a reduction, through the
special exception process of § 27-119, of the number of parking
spaces required to be developed if the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Board that less parking spaces are needed.
(1) Proof. To prove that less parking spaces are needed, the
applicant shall provide existing and projected employment,
customer, resident or other relevant data. Such data may
include a study of parking at similar developments during peak
periods of use.
(2) Shared Parking. Under this section, an applicant may seek to
prove that parking permanently shared with another use or
another lot with shared internal access or another lot within
250 feet of the entrance to the use will reduce the total amount
of parking needed because the uses have different peak times
of parking need or overlapping customers.
(3) Reservation of Future Parking Areas. If a reduction is
permitted under this section, the Board may require as a
condition of the special exception that the lot include the
reservation, permanently or for a specified number of years, of
areas for use if needed in the future for additional parking.
(a) Such reservation shall be provided in a legal form
acceptable to the Zoning Hearing Board Solicitor. A legally
binding deed restriction is recommended.
(b) In such case, the applicant shall be required to submit site
plans to the Zoning Officer showing where and how the
additional parking could be accomplished. Such future
parking areas shall be designed to meet all Borough
requirements, including stormwater runoff. Such future
parking areas shall not be covered by buildings and shall
be attractively landscaped unless needed for parking.
(c) Such additional parking shall be required to be provided
within one year by the owner of the lot at that time after
the Zoning officer may determine in writing to such owner
that such parking has become needed to meet actual use.
Such determination shall be based upon the Zoning
Officer's on-site review on at least three different days.

1. General. Parking spaces and accessways shall be laid out to result in
safe and orderly use, and to fully take into account all of the following:
vehicular access onto and off the site, vehicular movement within the
site, loading areas, pedestrian patterns and any drive-through facilities.
No parking area shall cause a safety hazard or impediment to traffic off
the lot.
2. Existing Parking. Structures and uses in existence at the effective date
of this chapter shall not be required to add additional parking spaces to
meet the requirements of this Part unless: (A) the general type of use is
significantly changed; or, (B) the use is expanded a total aggregate over
time of more than 5% or 2,000 square feet in floor area, which ever is
more restrictive. Any parking spaces serving such pre-existing
structures or uses at the time of adoption of this chapter shall not in the
future be reduced in number below the number required by this
chapter.
3. Expansion of Use. If a existing building or use does not currently
conform to the off-street parking or loading requirements of this
chapter, then additional parking and/or loading facilities shall only be
required for any expansion of the use or building, except:
A. If such building or use would expand by a total aggregate of 50% or
more in a measurement of parking need addressed by § 27-601,
then sufficient off-street parking and off-street loading facilities
shall be required not only for the expanded area but also for the
pre-existing use or building.
4. Continuing Obligation of Parking and Loading Spaces. All required
numbers of parking spaces and off-street loading spaces shall be
available as long as the use or building which the spaces serve still
exist, and such spaces shall not be reduced in number below the
minimum required by this chapter. No required parking area or offstreet
loading spaces shall be used for any other use (such as storage or
display of materials) that interferes with the area's availability for
parking to serve a use, except that an owner of a parking area may
allow use of the spaces by another use during specific times of the day
and week when they are clearly not needed for the primary user.

1993, § 603; as amended by Ord. 793, 6/20/1994, § 1]
5. Location of Parking. Required off-street parking spaces shall be on the
same lot or abutting lot with the principal use served, unless the
applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that a
guaranteed long-term method of providing the spaces is available using
area of a lot within 500 feet (except as provided in subsection (6),
below) of the entrance of the principal use being served. Such method
may involve a deed restriction allowing using of the spaces during peak
hours of need, or a lease extending 20 years or for the life of use of the
property, whichever is of shorter duration.
6. Downtown Parking Exemption.
A. In recognition the need to strongly encourage new construction
and the reuse of building space in the downtown, and recognizing
the availability of on-street parking areas, the requirements in
§ 27-601 for minimum numbers of off-street parking spaces in this
Part shall not apply within the B-C district, except for:
(1) The new construction of an aggregate total after the adoption
of this chapter of more than 4,000 square feet of building floor
area; or,
(2) Any additional number of dwelling units or boarding house
units.
B. In any case, existing parking in the B-C district shall not be reduced
below a minimum equal to one space per 1.3 employee.
C. Within the B-C District, the provision of § 27-602(5), above,
permitting off-site parking shall be extended to a 700 feet distance.
7. Fees-in-Lieu of Parking. As a conditional use, the Borough Council may
permit all or part of the parking required in the B-C or R-HO district to
be waived if the applicant agrees to provides a fee-in-lieu of parking.
Such fees shall be accounted for separately and shall only be used for
acquisition and/or development of municipal vehicle parking areas.
Such one-time fee shall be $900 per parking space, unless such fee is
modified by future resolution of Borough Council.
1. General Requirements.
A. No parking area shall be designed to require or encourage parked
vehicles to back into a public street or alley in order to leave a
parking space, except for a single-family or two-family dwelling
with its access onto a local street or parking court.
B. Every required parking space shall be designed so that each motor
vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it
without requiring the moving of any other vehicle, except spaces
§ 27-602 FOREWORD § 27-603
FWD:805
for a single-family detached dwelling, twin dwelling or for approved
"valet" parking areas.
C. Parking areas shall not be within any of the following: a required
buffer yard or a required paved area setback.
D. Defined Traffic Ways. All parking areas shall include clearly defined
and marked traffic patterns. In any lot with more than 30 off-street

direct traffic within the lot. Major vehicular routes shall be
separated as much as is reasonable from major pedestrian routes
within the lot.
E. Separation from Street. All areas for off-street parking, off-street
loading and unloading and the storage or movement of motor
vehicles shall be physically separated from the street by a raised
curb, planting strip, wall or other suitable barrier against
unchanneled motor vehicle entrance or exit, except for necessary
and approved vehicle entrances and exits to the lot. All commercial
and industrial parking areas approved after the adoption of this
chapter shall be separated from the street by a grass or landscaped
strip of land. See § 27-603(7).
F. Stacking. Each lot shall provide adequate area upon the lot to
prevent back-up of vehicles on a public street while awaiting entry
to the lot, or while waiting for service at a drive-through facility.
G. Stormwater Management. The applicant for any new or expanded
parking lot that would result in 5,000 square feet or greater of
impervious coverage (compared to what previously existed),
outside of the B-C District, shall be required to submit stormwater
management calculations to the Borough Engineer and prove to the
satisfaction of the Borough Engineer that stormwater will be
adequately managed.
H. Landscaping. See § 27-603(7).
2. Size and Marking of Parking Spaces.
A. Each parking space shall include a rectangle with a minimum width
of nine feet and a minimum length of 18 feet, except:
(1) The minimum length shall be 21 feet for parallel parking.
(2) Compact. If a lot or parking deck includes more than 30
parking spaces, a maximum of 20% of the required spaces
include a rectangle with a minimum width of eight feet and a
minimum length of 16 feet; provided, that those spaces are
marked as "Compact Cars Only" and provided that those
spaces do not include the most desirable spaces in the lot or
deck.
§ 27-603 EMMAUS CODE § 27-603
FWD:806
(3) If a parking area is permitted to not be paved, then a minimum
width of 10 feet per space shall be used.
(4) If parking spaces serve a use involving more than 10,000
square feet of floor area for the retail sale of groceries, then
such parking spaces shall have a minimum width of 10 feet to
allow for shopping carts.
B. All spaces shall be marked to indicate their location, except those
of a single-family or two-family dwelling.
3. Aisles.
A. Each aisle providing access to stalls for one-way traffic only shall
be at least the minimum aisle width specified as follows:

90° 20 feet
B. Each aisle providing access to stalls for two-way traffic shall be at
least 20 feet in width.
C. Maximum length of parking aisle: 300 feet.
D. Modification. By special exception, the Zoning Hearing Board may
reduce the minimum size of parking spaces or aisles to reflect
congested conditions and the need for parking spaces in older
commercial areas of the Borough.
4. Access Drives and Driveways.
A. Width of Driveway/Accessway at Entrance onto Public Street (at
the edge of the cartway).
1-Way Use 2-Way Use
Minimum 12 feet 20 feet
Maximum 35 feet 50 feet

entrance to a state road.
B. Drainage. Adequate provisions shall be made to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a public street at the point of
driveway or access drive entry.
C. Separation Between Driveways. At least 50 feet shall be provided
between the center lines of any two accessways or driveways along
one street within one lot.
§ 27-603 FOREWORD § 27-603
FWD:807
D. Separation from Intersection. If a driveway or accessway enters
onto a collector or arterial street, then the center line of that
driveway or accessway where it enters the collector or arterial
street shall be a minimum of 75 feet from the center line of any
other street, where that street enters the collector or arterial street
at a different point than the driveway or accessway.
E. State Permit. Where there will be new or intensified access to a
state street or other work within the right-of-way of a state street, a
state highway occupancy permit shall be obtained, as applicable.
F. Sight Distance for Driveways. See § 27-803(3)(B).
5. Paving, Grading and Drainage.
A. Parking and loading facilities and including driveways shall be
graded and adequately drained to prevent erosion or excessive
water flow across streets or adjoining properties.
B. Paving. Except for landscaped areas, all portions of required
parking, loading facilities and driveways shall be surfaced with
asphalt, concrete or decorative paving block, except that portions
or all of driveways or parking areas may be left in grass or gravel
where the applicant proves to the full satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer that:
(1) The parking or driveway is clearly intended for use for a
maximum of one year or for a maximum of 14 days in a
calendar year; or,
(2) Serves an agricultural use; or,
(3) Involves a residential driveway with a length of over 100 feet.
6. Lighting of Parking Areas. See § 27-511 "Light and Glare Control."
Parking areas for six or more spaces and related pedestrian pathways
intended to be used at night shall be adequately illuminated for security
purposes.
7. Paved Area Landscaping.
A. Purpose. To ensure that parked or moving vehicles within a lot do
not obstruct sight distance or interfere with pedestrian traffic, to
aid in stormwater management along streets and to prevent
vehicles from entering or exiting a lot other than at approved
driveways.
B. See the requirements of § 22-514 through § 22-519 of the Borough
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance [Chapter 22].
C. The requirements of § 22-516 of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance [Chapter 22] regarding landscaping

§ 27-603 EMMAUS CODE § 27-603
FWD:808
use established or expanded after the adoption of this chapter,
regardless of whether such parking area would otherwise be
regulated by the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
[Chapter 22].
D. Any tractor-trailer truck loading area or any parking lot of six or
more spaces outside of a building shall be screened from any
abutting residential lot line by a solid wood fence, decorative
masonry wall or evergreen landscaping with a minimum height of
four feet. Such screen shall be designed and located to reduce the

B. Each space shall have sufficient maneuvering room to avoid
conflicts with parking and traffic movements within and outside of
the lot. No facility shall be designed or used in such a manner that
it threatens a safety hazard, public nuisance or a serious
impediment to traffic off the lot.
C. Each space and the needed maneuvering room shall be located
entirely on the lot being served and be located outside of required
buffer areas, paved area setbacks and street right-of-ways. An
appropriate means of access to a street shall be provided.
D. Paving, Grading and Drainage. See § 27-603(5).
3. Fire Lanes. Fire lanes shall be provided where required by state or
federal regulations or other local ordinances. The specific locations of

1. General Provisions.
A. These provisions are specific to the B-C District. Any conflicting
provision in any other part of this Part is superseded by these
provisions.
B. A wall, when used in this section shall mean a structure
constructed of brick, stone or other masonry and/or wrought iron.
2. Off-Street Parking. All off street parking, with the exception of deck
parking, shall be placed to the rear of the building that it is intended to
serve as indicated by the following graphic:
If this is not feasible because of physical limitations of the site, parking
may be placed to the side of the building; provided, that the perimeter
of the parking lot is surrounded by a buffer yard of screening, a fence
or a wall. The buffer yard with screening, fence or wall shall be at
least three feet, but not more than five feet, in height. Such buffer yard
with screening, fence or wall shall be aligned with the building facade.
An opening for pedestrian access shall be provided. In no case shall
parking be placed between a building and the front yard.
3. Parking as a Principal Use. When a parking lot is developed as a
principal use, it shall be surrounded by a buffer yard with screening, a
§ 27-605 FOREWORD § 27-606
FWD:811
fence, or a wall on every side of the lot that abuts a residential lot line
or street right-of-way, subject to all limitations of a clear sight triangle
as defined in this chapter.
4. Parking as an Accessory Use. Parking as an accessory use shall be
required to be located to the rear of the building. A buffer yard with
screening, a fence or wall shall be required when the parking lot abuts
a street. Such buffer yard with screening, fence or wall shall be aligned
with the building facade.
5. Traffic Flow. All parking lots with access from Main or Chestnut Streets
must be one way, egressing to a side street or an alley. Appropriate

1993, § 701; as amended by Ord. 816, 8/7/1995, § 1]
1. Purposes. To recognize that signs perform an important function by
identifying residences and businesses; to exercise the minimum control
of signs that is necessary to promote the health, safety and general
welfare by lessening hazards to pedestrian and vehicular traffic; to
preserve property values by preventing unsightly and detrimental
development which has a blighting influence upon residential, business
and industrial uses; to prevent signs from reaching such excessive size
that they obscure one another to the detriment of all concerned; and to
seek that signs be compatible with the overall character and scale of
the Borough.
2. See definitions of "sign" and "off-premises sign" in Part 2.
3. General. In all permitted districts, tethered balloons used primarily for
advertising purposes and spotlights and signs may be erected, altered,
maintained, used, removed or moved only in compliance with the
provisions of this section and other regulations of the Borough relating
to the erection, alteration, maintenance, use, removal or moving of
signs and similar devices.

§ 27-702. Types of Signs. [Ord. 776, 6/21/1993, § 702]
A. Signs in any district lawfully existing at the time of passage of this
chapter which do not conform to the requirements of this chapter
shall be considered nonconforming signs and may be continued.
B. If such a lawful on-premises nonconforming signs in a commercial
or industrial district or any off-premises sign is removed, it shall
only be replaced with a conforming sign. If such a lawful onpremises
nonconforming sign in a residential district is removed, it
may be replaced with a new noninternally illuminated sign that is
no more nonconforming in any measurement than the previous
sign.
C. Nonconforming signs may be repainted or repaired (including
lighting) provided such action does not increase the dimensions of
the existing sign. Copy may also be changed.
D. If a lawful principal business use is permitted or exists in a
residential district, the signs for such use shall comply with the
sign provisions of the B-C district.
1. The following definitions shall be used in determining whether signs
meet the measurement and type requirements of this Part:
A. Building Face. The vertical area of a particular side of a building,
but not including the area of any slanted roof.
B. Freestanding Sign. A sign which is self-supporting upon the ground
or which is primarily supported by poles attached to the ground
and not primarily supported by a building.
C. Height of Sign. The vertical distance measured from the average
ground level surrounding a sign to the highest point of the sign and
its supporting structure. Religious symbols, when not accompanied
by lettering, shall not be restricted by the sign heights of this Part
when attached to a tower or spire of a place of worship.
D. Illuminated Sign, Externally. A sign illuminated by light outside of
the sign instead of within the sign.
E. Illuminated Sign, Internally. A sign illuminated by light from within
the sign rather than a source adjacent to or outside of the sign. A
sign within a display case with lights only shining onto the front of
the sign shall be considered to be "externally" illuminated.
F. Off-Premises Sign. See Part 2.
G. Political Sign. A sign that advertises a person or party seeking

H. Sign. See Part 2.
I. Wall Sign. A sign primarily supported by or painted on a wall of a
building and which does not project more than 18 inches from such

partially read from an exterior lot line and which is attached to a
window or transparent door or that can be read through a window
or transparent door and which is not internally illuminated.
1. The sign area of a sign shall be calculated as follows:
A. The size of any sign shall be computed by multiplying its greatest
height by its greatest length, exclusive of supporting structures,
unless such supporting structure is illuminated or is in the form of a
symbol or contains advertising copy. In the case of signs that have
no definable edges, such as raised letters attached to a building
facade, the sign size shall be that area within a single continuous
perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of the actual message or
copy area.
B. The area of a sign shall be construed to include all lettering,
wording and accompanying designs and symbols, together with the
background, whether open or enclosed, on which they are
displayed.
C. Where the sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached to
or painted on a surface, building, wall or window, the area shall be
considered to be that of the smallest rectangle which encompasses
all of the letters and symbols.
D. In computing square foot area of a double-faced sign, only one side
shall be considered, provided both faces are identical. If the
interior angle formed by the two faces of a double-faced sign is
greater than 45°, then both sides of such sign shall be considered
in calculating the sign area.
E. Unless otherwise specified, all square footages in regards to signs
are maximum sizes.
1. Signs With Zoning Information. No sign shall be erected, containing
information on it which states or implies that a property may be used

through any other means.
4. Construction. All signs, except temporary signs, shall be constructed of
durable material and kept in good condition and repair. Illuminated

provisions regarding freestanding signs in the district in which such
vehicle is located.
13. Off-Premises Signs. See § 27-708(D).

then the required rear yard shall measured from the corner that is
furthest away from the front lot line. In such case, the lot shall have
two side lot lines.
E. Projections Into Required Yards. The following features may
project into required yards:
(1) Emergency fire escapes and exits added on to a building that
existed prior to the adoption of this chapter; provided, that
such does not intrude into a required front yard, intrudes a
maximum of eight feet into a required side or rear yard, and
does not project into an abutting lot.
(2) Routinely projecting architectural features such as bay
windows, cornices, eaves, fireplaces, flues, gutters, chimneys,
fire escapes or window sills which do not project more than
three feet into any required yard.

Services."
F. Previously Approved Setbacks. Where a subdivision or land
development was granted final approval prior to the adoption of
this chapter, and the lawful setbacks in effect at such time are
shown on the approved plans, at the option of the developer, those
approved setbacks may apply in place of any revised setbacks in
this chapter.
G. Front Yard Exceptions. When an unimproved residential lot is
situated between two or more lots with principal buildings with
principal building front yard setbacks with less depth than required
in that district, the minimum front yard shall be reduced to the
depth of such abutting improved lot that has the largest depth.

§ 27-803 EMMAUS CODE § 27-803
FWD:830
J. De Minimis. In cases where an inadvertent error has been made in
design or construction, the Zoning Officer may permit a variation of
up to 3% in one requirement of this chapter.
K. Culs-de-Sac. The minimum lot width may be reduced to 60% of
what would otherwise be required for lots abutting a cul-de-sac
street; provided, that the minimum width along the curbline is not
less than 30 feet for a dwelling unit other than a townhouse.
3. Sight Distance at Intersections.
A. Purpose. To ensure that traffic passing through an intersection or
turning onto a street can safely see oncoming traffic.
B. A clear sight triangle shall be provided and maintained at all street
and/or alley intersections. Such clear sight distance shall be
maintained between two feet and 10 feet above curb level. Such
triangle shall be 15 feet along the right-of-way lines of the streets
or alleys, measured from the intersection of such rights-of-way,
with the third longer leg of the triangle connecting the two ends,
unless a larger triangle is required under the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]. If the intersection is
rounded, the triangle shall be measured from the extended ends of
the rights-of-way.
C. Within such clear sight triangle, no grading shall occur or
structures (such as buildings, fences or walls) be placed or
expanded or vegetation be permitted that would obstruct the vision
of motorists of pedestrians and other traffic. The only obstructions
permitted within such triangle shall be transparent fences,
vegetation regularly maintained at less than two feet height,
mailboxes, sign or utility posts less than one foot in width and the
trunks of deciduous trees.
D. This sight distance triangle shall be shown on development plans
submitted to the Borough and be shown on any plan required to be
recorded. Such triangle shall serve as a permanent setback line for
all such visual obstructions and shall be binding upon present and
future owners of the land.
E. If a driveway or accessway enters onto a street, a required sight
triangle as stated above shall be maintained, except the length of
the triangle shall be eight feet long measured at the center line of
the driveway or accessway and at the street right-of-way line.
4. Buffer Yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations:
A. When Required. Buffer yards of primarily evergreen screening
shall be required whenever any new or expanded uses principal
commercial use, principal industrial use, industrial outdoor storage
area or development of 10 or more apartment dwelling units has a
§ 27-803 FOREWORD § 27-803
FWD:831
side or rear yard that abuts a residential lot line as defined by Part
2.
B. Width and Plants. Any required buffer yard shall have a minimum
width of eight feet and include plant screening as stated in the
buffer yard section (§ 22-519) of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance [Chapter 22]. Plants shall be chosen and
placed so as to reasonably be expected to form a solid year-round
visual screen with a minimum height of six feet within three years
of planting.
C. Location of Buffer Yards.
(1) The buffer yard shall be measured from the district boundary
line, future street right-of-way line or lot line, whichever is
applicable.
(2) Plants needed for the visual screen shall not be placed within a
future street right-of-way. The required buffer yard width shall
be in addition to the required future street right-of-way.
(3) The buffer yard may be within a required front, side or rear
yard, or a paved area setback area provided the larger width
requirement shall apply in case of overlap.
D. Characteristics of Buffer Yards.
(1) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display. No new
driveways or streets shall be permitted in the buffer yards
except at points of approved necessary perpendicular
crossings for ingress or egress.
(2) Maintenance. In buffer yards, all areas not covered by trees
and shrubs shall be well-maintained in an all-season vegetative
ground cover (such as grass) and shall be kept free of debris
and rubbish and shall not include grass areas higher than six
inches.
(3) Fence. Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside
of any required evergreen screening.
(4) Modifications. In situations where it would be impractical to
develop a screen that would meet all Borough requirements or
where an undue hardship would be created to an applicant, the
Zoning Hearing Board may agree to modify these requirements
to allow an acceptable alternative. Such alternative may, for
example, involve the development of a solid wooden fence that
has been treated to be weather-resistant. Such modification
shall only occur after a review by the Planning Commission.

(2) The Zoning Officer shall review such plans to determine that
the plans are in conformance with the terms of this chapter.
F. Occupancy Permit. A zoning occupancy permit for a use on the
premises shall not be issued until such time as the buffer yards and
other landscaping requirements established by Borough
ordinances are either:
(1) Actually installed in full compliance with such ordinance; or,
(2) If such season is not appropriate for planting, a performance
guarantee of 100% of the cost of such landscaping, with such
estimate approved by the Borough Manager, has been
deposited with the Borough Secretary. Such guarantee shall be
in an acceptable form to the Borough. Such guarantee shall
provide that the depositor agrees that if performance is not
completed within six months of any permit issued on or before
August 31 of any year or within nine months of any permit
issued on or after September 1 of any year, the Borough may
complete the landscaping and buffer requirements and charge
the cost against the deposit. Otherwise, the deposit shall be
returned in full with any interest earned after the satisfactory
completion of the work.
1. Ground cover. Any part of a commercial, industrial, institutional or
garden apartment lot which is not used for structures, loading areas,
parking spaces and aisles, sidewalks and designated storage areas shall

1. Registration of Nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility of a party
asserting a nonconformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A
property owner may request a written statement of nonconformity from
the Zoning Officer after providing sufficient evidence.
2. Continuation of Nonconformity. A lawful nonconforming use, structure
or lot as defined by this chapter may be continued and may be sold and
continued by new owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or
change in use of a nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with
this section.
3. Expansion of, Construction Upon or Change in Use of Nonconformities.
A. Nonconforming Structure.
(1) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded as follows:
(a) When a lawful structure exists on the effective date of this
chapter, or subsequent amendments thereto, that could
not be built under the terms of this chapter by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height or yards, it may
be continued as long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
1) In any residential district where a structure is
nonconforming because it does not fulfill the yard
requirements of the district in which it is located, it
§ 27-804 EMMAUS CODE § 27-806
FWD:834
may be enlarged, provided that the addition is
extended along the existing building line. Such
extensions shall not be permitted to encroach any
further into the yards than as currently
nonconforming, nor cause a nonconformity.
2) In no case shall any addition be larger than 25% of the
gross floor area of the existing building.
3) A nonconforming structure, which is damaged by fire,
explosion or act of God, may be rebuilt and used for
the same purposes, provided that the reconstruction
of the building is commenced within one year from the
date of the destruction of the building, and is carried
out to completion without undue delay. In no case shall
the reconstructed structure be larger than the one
existing at the time of destruction.
(2) In the case of a nonconforming structure that is occupied as a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
B. Nonconforming Lot.
(1) New permitted structures for a single permitted by right
principal use and its customary accessory uses may be
constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming
lot of record as a permitted by right use if all of the following
requirements are met:
(a) The lot area is at least 40% of the minimum lot area.
(b) The lot width is at least 40% of the minimum lot width.
(c) The lot is a lot of record that lawfully existed prior to the
adoption of this chapter or an applicable subsequent
amendment.
(d) Minimum setbacks and other requirements of this chapter
are complied with for any new construction or expanded
area.
(e) For a dwelling on a nonconforming lot, the front door shall
face a public street, and the dwelling shall have a side
facing onto a public street that has an appearance typical
of a front of a dwelling.
(2) Setbacks. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a special
exception to reduce the required setbacks for construction on
a nonconforming lot if the Board determines that such
reduction would result in a building that would be more
compatible with neighboring buildings than would be built if
the setback requirement was not reduced.
§ 27-806 FOREWORD § 27-806
FWD:835
(3) Integration/Merger. Contiguous nonconforming lots under
common ownership shall be integrated/merged to form lots
that would be conforming or less nonconforming.
(4) Variances. If a proposed development on a nonconforming lot
does not meet the requirements of the above § 27-806(3)(B),
subsections (1) and (2), then development of the lot shall not
occur unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board. In addition to the standards stated for a variance in the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10101 et
seq., the Zoning Hearing Board shall also review whether any
alternative permitted uses could reasonably be made of the
property that would less significantly adverse impacts upon the
established character of an existing residential neighborhood
than the proposed use.
C. Expansion of a Nonconforming Nonresidential Use. A
nonconforming use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall
not be expanded, except in accordance with the following
provisions:
(1) An expansion of more than 5% in total building floor area shall
require special exception approval from the Zoning Hearing
Board under § 27-119.
(2) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(3) The nonconforming use shall not be expanded by more than
25% beyond the total building floor area used by a
nonconforming use or the total area covered by impervious
surfaces of a nonconforming use, whichever is more
restrictive. Such measurement shall be based upon the floor
area and impervious surface area that existed at the time such
use became nonconforming.
(a) These maximum increases shall be measured in aggregate
over the entire life of the nonconformity.
(b) If the Zoning Hearing Board determines that such
measurements are not applicable to a particular use, then
the Zoning Hearing Board may establish a reasonable
measure to base the 25% expansion upon.
(4) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this chapter, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
(5) The Zoning Hearing Board may require a nonconforming use
that is expanding to provide: (i) a buffer yard with a planting
screen meeting the requirements of § 27-803; and/or, (ii) an
§ 27-806 EMMAUS CODE § 27-806
FWD:836
attractive weather-resistant solid wood fence of six feet
minimum height.
D. Expansion of a Nonconforming Residential Use. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded in floor area as a
permitted by right use provided that:
(1) The number of dwelling units or rental units, as applicable, is
not increased.
(2) The expansion meets all applicable setbacks.
(3) No new types of nonconformities are created.
(4) A nonconformity is not made more severe (including the
building area within the required setback area).
4. Damaged or Destroyed Nonconformities.
A. A nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or damaged
equal to 50% or more of its total value by fire, windstorm, lightning
or a similar cause deemed not to be the fault of the owner may
rebuild in a nonconforming fashion only if:
(1) The application for a building permit is submitted within 18
months after the date of damage or destruction.
(2) Work begins in earnest within 12 months afterwards.
(3) A nonconformity shall not be created or increased by any
reconstruction.
B. Rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed nonconformity shall not
begin until plans for rebuilding have been presented and approved
by the Zoning Officer. Any change of one nonconforming use to
another nonconforming use shall comply with the provisions of this
section.
C. Nonconforming Use of Open Land. All nonconforming off-premises
signs, junkyards, outside storage areas and similar nonconforming
uses of open land, when damaged to an extent of 50% or more of
replacement cost, shall not be continued, repaired or
reconstructed.
5. Abandonment of a Nonconformity.
A. If a non-conforming use of building or land is sufficiently shown to
be discontinued, razed, removed or abandoned, subsequent use of
such building or land shall conform with the regulations of the
district in which it is located, except as provided for in the
"damaged or destroyed non-conformity" provisions of this section.
§ 27-806 FOREWORD § 27-806
FWD:837
B. The party asserting abandonment of a building or land shall be
responsible to provide sufficient evidence to establish an intent to
abandon the use, and that such use was abandoned.
6. Floodplain. See the floodplain area regulations in Part 5.
7. Changes from One Nonconforming use to Another.
A. Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land or portion
thereof shall not revert to a nonconforming use.
B. A nonconforming use may be changed to a different type of
nonconforming use only if permitted as a special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board. The Board shall determine whether the
applicant has provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed
new use will be equally or less objectionable in external effects
compared to the preexisting nonconforming use. The Board should
review the following types of effects:
(1) Traffic generation (especially truck traffic).
(2) Noise, dust, fumes, gases, odor, glare, vibration, fire and
explosive hazards.
(3) Amount and character of outdoor storage.
(4) Hours of operation if the use would be close to dwellings.
(5) Compatibility with the character of the surrounding area.
C. District Changes. Any uses, structures or lots that become
nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be
regulated under this section on nonconformities.
8. Subdivision of Lots with Existing Buildings. Notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this chapter, a lot which had one or more
principal building existing prior to September 8, 1987, may be divided
into more than one nonconforming lot provided such division is for
purposes of conveyance into separate ownership and provided the
following conditions are met:
A. Each lot shall include a maximum of one principal building.
B. Each lot shall have vehicle access onto a public street.
C. Each lot shall be served by both public water and public sewage
service.
D. The boundaries of all lots shall be designed in such a manner to
maximize lot area, lot width, lot depth and yard areas and to result
in a functional configuration that minimizes nonconformities.
E. Variances of lot area, width, depth and yard areas shall require
action by the Zoning Hearing Board.

the adoption of this chapter, a temporary permit may be issued by the
Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception for structures or uses
subject to the following additional provisions:
A. Duration. The Zoning Hearing Board shall establish a limit on the
duration of the use. In the case of a special event, except under
special circumstances, this should be a maximum of six days in any
sixty-day period. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant a single
approval once for numerous occurrences of an event.
B. Statement from Owner. The applicant shall present a statement
from the owner of record of the land accepting responsibility to
ensure that the use or structure is removed once the permit
expires.
C. Removal. Such structure or use shall be removed completely upon
expiration of the permit without cost to the Borough. If the
structure or use is not removed in a timely fashion after proper
§ 27-806 FOREWORD § 27-807
FWD:839
notification, the Borough may remove the use or structure at the
cost of the person who owns the land upon which the structure or
use is located.
D. Conditions. The temporary use or structure shall: (1) be compatible
with adjacent uses; and, (2) clearly be of a temporary nature.
E. Fee. Either the Zoning Hearing Board or the Borough Council may
waive and/or return the required application fee if the applicant is a
Internal Revenue Service recognized and well-established
nonprofit organization, and the applicant clearly shows that the
proposed use is temporary and will be used to clearly primarily
serve a charitable or public service purpose.
F. Nonprofit. Only a well-established and Internal Revenue Service
recognized nonprofit organization proposing a temporary use to
clearly primarily serve a charitable or public service purpose shall
be eligible to receive approval for a temporary commercial use in a
district where that use is not permitted.
G. Special Events. For a special event that will attract significant
numbers of the public, the Zoning Hearing Board may deny the use
if it determines that the following will not be generally appropriate:
sanitary and water service, traffic control, off-street parking and
protection of the public health and safety.
H. Annual Special Events. If the Zoning Hearing Board grants a
special exception for a temporary use for an annual special event,
then the Board's grant of such temporary use upon an initial
application submitted by a non-profit organization applying to
conduct an event, shall authorize the Zoning Officer to grant a
permit for such temporary use in subsequent years, provided that
the application for a permit in subsequent years demonstrates to
the Zoning Officer's satisfaction that the event is the same, or
substantially the same, as in the year in which the Zoning Hearing
Board granted the temporary use, and that the applicant has
satisfied all of the conditions imposed by the Board for such use. If
the Zoning Officer determines that the proposed temporary use is
materially different from the event for which the Board granted
approval, or if the Zoning Officer determines that the proposed
event does not meet all of the conditions imposed by the Zoning
Hearing Board, then the Zoning Officer shall deny the application.
In the event of such denial, the applicant may appeal to the Zoning
Hearing Board pursuant to this section. An applicant may only
apply for a permit under this paragraph if it is conducting an
annual event. This paragraph shall not apply if the event was not
held and a permit issued by the Zoning Hearing Board or the
Zoning Officer in the immediately preceding year.
