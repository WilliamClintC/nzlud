§409. RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING.
1. Findings and Pumose. The Borough of Blairsville finds that:
A. Certain residential areas in the Borough are subjected to commuter vehicle parking,
therefore, depriving the residents of those areas of spaces in which to park their own
vehicles.
B. Those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree of commuter traffic which
substantially reduces the quality of the ambient air level.
C. The establishment of a parking pennit program for certain affected areas should facilitate
efficient movement of traffic by providing for parking preference during certain hours of
the day and days of the week. Therefore, the Borough of Blairsville considers it to be in
the interest of the people of the Borough to provide for the establishment of a residential
pennit parking program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by
neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions. For the purpose of this Section, words and terms listed in this subsection, as
follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by a person not
a resident of that residential area.
PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a residential area of
which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages a business enterprise or professional
office maintained at that address; for the purpose of this Section, a proprietor shall be
entitled to one (1) parking permit for that business or professional office address.
15-24
(15, PART 4)
RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a residential area and
who maintains either a voting residence, or bona fide occupancy, or both, at that address.
RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or parts of
public highways primarily abutted by residential property or residential and non-business
property (such as schools, parks, places of worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria. The residential areas designated in subsection (4) of this Section are those deemed
impacted and hence eligible for residential parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday through
Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles parked (or standing), legally or
illegally, on the streets in the area is equal to seventy (70) percent or more of the legal,
on-street parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a legal parking
space shall be twenty (20) linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in subsection (A), directly above, ten (10) percent or
more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the streets in the area are not registered in
the name of a person residing in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest
available information from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding registration of motor vehicles shall
be used.
Provided: In detennining that a specific area identified as impacted and eligible for
residential pennit parking is designated as a residential pennit parking area, the following
factors are taken into consideration:
( 1) The local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean air and envirorunent.
(2) The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the Borough.
(3) The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and related health
and safety hazards.
(4) The proximity of public transportation to the residential area.
(5) The desire and need of the residents for residential pennit parking and their
willingness to bear the administrative costs in connection with it.
(6) The need for parking in excess of the residential pennit parking program in
proximity to establishments located in the residential pennit parking area and used
by the general public for religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of Residential Pennit Parking Areas. The following are designated as residential
pennit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including
(Reserved)

MOTOR VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC
Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential pennit parking area, indicating the
days, hours, locations and conditions under which parking shall be by pennit only.
5. Application for Pennit. Application for a residential parking pennit shall be made to the
Borough of Blairsville by the person desiring the pennit, who shall be only the owner or the
driver of a motor vehicle who resides on or is a proprietor of property immediately adjacent to
a street or other location within a residential parking permit area. A separate application shall
be required for each motor vehicle, and each application shall be accompanied by a pennit fee,
set pursuant to resolution of the Borough Council, which shall be for the use of the Borough to
be applied to the cost of administering the residential permit parking program. Each application
shall contain the following information: the name of the owner or the driver, as the case may
be, of the motor vehicle; the address of the resident or the proprietor, as the case may be; the
make, model and registration number of the motor vehicle; and the driver number as taken from
the applicant's current driver's license. At the discretion of the Borough of Blairsville, the
applicant shall be required, at the time of making application, to present his driver's license and
the vehicle registration card.
6. Issuance of Pennit. Upon receipt of the application and the pennit fee, and detennination by
him that the information upon the application shows that the applicant is entitled to a residential
parking pennit, the Chief of Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking pennit,
which shall be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The pennit shall display the serial
and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential parking area number, and the
expiration date. The permit shall be renewable annually before the expiration date, upon making
application for renewal and payment of the pennit fee. It shall be unlawful and a violation of
this Section for any person to display other than the current and valid pennit while standing or
parking in a residential pennit parking area at any time when those pennits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and Exemption Parking Pennits. Temporary parking pennits may be issued by the
Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established pursuant to a resolution, to
bona fide visitors of residents of a designated residential permit parking area, and exemption
parking permits may be issued, without payment of a fee, to handicapped persons.
8. Responsibility of Pennit Holder.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section to the contrary, the holder of a residential
parking permit shall be pennitted to stand or park a motor vehicle operated by him in any
designated residential parking area during those times when parking of motor vehicles is
permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking permit has been
issued is so parked, that pennit shall be displayed so as to be clearly visible through the
windshield of the vehicle. A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to
the holder a parking space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to stand or park a motor vehicle
in any place where or at any time when stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles
is prohibited or set aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt
its holder form the observance of any traffic or parking regulation other than residential
pennit parking regulation or restriction.
15-26
(15, PART 4)
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on the permit shall use a
residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated; any such use or display by
a person other than the permit holder shall constitute a violation of this Section by the
permit holder and by the person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this Section for any person falsely to represent himself as
eligible for a residential parking permit or to furnish false information in an application
to the Borough of Blairsville in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
( 1) Revocation of Permits. The Borough of Blairsville shall have authority to revoke
the residential parking permit of any permit holder found to be in violation of any
provision of this Section. Upon written notification to him of the revocation, the
permit holder shall surrender the permit to the Borough of Blairsville. Failure to
do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this Section. Provided,
any person receiving such a notice may, within ten (10) days after the date of the
notice, appeal to Borough Council for a hearing on the revocation, and the
decision of Borough Council shall be final.
(Ord. 613, 9/ l 5/ 1998)

Zoning Dist·rict's & Use. Regulations
SECTION 300 PURPOSES:
The purpose of Article III of the Borough of Blairsville Zoning Ordinance is to regulate the land
uses in Borough of Blairsville by Zoning District. The districts demonstrate the cohesive use of
land within areas of similar environmental and quality of life characteristics. Specific land uses
based on a parcel-by-parcel basis will be discouraged as they may increase potential land use
conflicts. This concept promotes the quality of life, cohesive neighborhoods, and protection of
the natural environment of Borough of Blairsville.
SECTION 301 ZONING DISTRICTS:
The Borough of Blairsville is divided into eight (8) zoning districts. These districts represent the
most efficient use of land, both currently developed and vacant. Environmental controls allow
this to happen and become a reality thorough flood plain, slope, riparian buffers, and setback
requirements. Zoning Districts are described as follows:
SECTION 302 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (LDR) DISTRICT:
1bis land use classification is designed to provide areas that preserve the existing characteristics
of single-family detached dwelling units and is suburban in nature. Lot size in these areas are
expected to be between one-half (.5) and two (2) acres.
SECTION 303 MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL (MDR) DISTRICT:
1bis land use classification is designed to provide areas that preserve the existing characteristics
of single-family detached dwelling units. Lot size in these areas would be between one-quarter
(.25) and one-half (.5) an acre.
SECTION 304 IDGH DENSITY (HDR) DISTRICT:
1bis district has been fanned to allow higher net densities than normally pennitted in a Low
Density Residential or Medium Density Residential Zoning District for a variety of single and
multi-family household dweJling types at a variety of densities. Access to public sewer and
water is a standard that guided the location of these districts. Utilization of zoning techniques
such as Clustering, Zero Lot Line and Density Bonuses are encouraged in this district. Pennitted
uses include single household attached and detached dwelling units, as well as Garden
Apartments (no higher than two (2) stories) and Townhouses. A district that pennits the most
mixed types of dwelling units at the greatest variety of densities.
ZONING ORDINANCE B o r o u g h o f 6 I a i r s v i I I c
SECTION 305 RECREATION CONSERVATION (RC) DISTRICT:
This zoning district has been established for several purposes. The primary purpose is to preserve
the environmental and natmal features along the Conemaugh River. The principal pennitted uses
in the district are commercial recreational, recreational facilities and certain residential
developments.
SECTION 306 DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL (DC) DISTRICT:
This land classification will provide an area that allows for commercial activities that serve the
needs of the Borough ofBlairsville's residents, such as convenience and service retail activities.
This zoning district is designated to promote a captive downtown audience by allowing
residential uses on the upper floors of commercial and office establishments.
SECTION 307 TRANSITION ZONE (TZ) DISTRICT:
This land classification will provide an area that allows for commercial activities that serve the
needs of the Borough ofBlairsville's residents, such as professional offices. This zoning district
will provide a transition from the residential areas to the downtown. The uses in this district are
mix of residential, no-impact home businesses and less intense commercial uses, such as
professional offices, Bed and Breakfast or Inns.
SECTION 308 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL (LI) DISTRICT:
This land use classification provides for areas that allow commercial, greenways, and light
manufacturing activities. These areas are designated to limit the commuter and truck traffic,
stabilize the Borough of Blairsville tax base, and preserve environmentally sensitive areas. Odor,
noise, dust, point and non-point source pollution, and lighting are limited and/or prohibited in
these areas. The district encourages office buildings to be built on "green" commons with
commercial activities geared toward daily services and those associated with the primary use of
the structure.
SECTION 309 OFFICE COMMERC~ (O/C) DISTRICT:
The "Future Land Use Plan Section of the Southern Indiana County Cooperative Communities
Comprehensive Plan" section of the goals and objectives recommends the continued
development of the Borough ofBlairsville's Regional Commercial and Office Park area that is
accessible to the US Route 22 and Route 119 Iμterchange and corridor. The Office Commercial
District will promote professional office centei:s and commercial activity that is ancillary to the
permitted uses within this district. The district' encourages office buildings to be built on "green"
commons with commercial activities geared toward daily services and those associated with the
primary use of the structure. These activities include caf es, day care centers, bakeries,
restaurants, and food courts.

SECTION 603 MAXIMUM SOUND LEVELS:
No person, or noise generating equipment, machines, vehicle, or the like shall be imposed on any
adjacent property, any source of continuous sound (any sound that is steady, fluctuating, or
intermittent with a resurgence greater than one time in any fifteen second intervaJ) in such a
manner as to create a sound level; that exceeds the limits set forth for the receiving land use
category in the folJowing Table (Table-Vl-B), when measured at the property line on the
receiving land use.
SECTION 604 NOISE LEVEL AND HUMAN RESPONSE:
The ambient sound level of any operation (other than the operation of motor vehicles or other
transportation facilities, involved in the construction or demolition of structures, emergency
alann signals or time signals) shall not exceed the decibel levels listed in the tables shown.
1. The sound pressure level or ambient level is the all-encompassing noise
associated with a given envirorunent, being a composite of sounds from any
source, near and far. For the purpose of this chapter, "ambient noise level" is the
average over fifteen ( 1 5) minutes of the alleged offensive noise, excluding
random or intermittent noises. Averaging may be done by instrument analysis in
accordance with American National Standard S. 13-1971, or may be completed
manually as follows:
A. Observe a sound-level meter for five (5) seconds and record the best estimate
of central tendency of the indicator needle and the highest and lowest
indications;
B. Repeat the observations as many times as necessary to provide that
observations be made at the beginning and at the end of the fifteen-minute
period and that there shaJl be at least as many observations as there are
decibels between the lowest low indication and the highest high indication;
and
C. Calculate the arithmetical average of the observed central tendency
indications.
2. It shalJ be lllllawful for any person to operate any fixed machinery or equipment
or similar mechanical device in any manner so as to create any noise, which
would cause the noise level measured at the property line of the property affected
by the noise emission to be beyond permitted levels.
A. If the measurement location is on a boundary between two (2) zoning districts,
the lower sound level shall apply.
B. Noise limits shaJl not exceed the following:
