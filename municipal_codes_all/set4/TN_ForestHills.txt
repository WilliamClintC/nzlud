Preface
The Forest Hills Municipal Code contains the codification and revision of
the ordinances of the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee. By referring to the
historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine
the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 7 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
iii
(3) That the city agrees to pay the annual update fee as provided in the
MTAS codification service charges policy in effect at the time of the update.
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of the codes team, Emily Keyser, Linda Winstead,
Nancy Gibson, and Doug Brown, is gratefully acknowledged.

1-201. Applicability. This chapter is the code of ethics for personnel of
the City of Forest Hills. It applies to all full-time and part-time elected or
appointed officials and employees, whether compensated or not, including those
of any separate board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality appointed or created by the municipality. The words
"municipal" and "municipality" include these separate entities.
1-202. Definition of "personal interest." (1) For purposes of §§ 1-203
and 1-204, "personal interest" means:
(a) Any financial, ownership, or employment interest in the
subject of a vote by a municipal board not otherwise regulated by state
statutes on conflicts of interests; or
(b) Any financial, ownership, or employment interest in a
matter to be regulated or supervised; or
(c) Any such financial, ownership, or employment interest of the
officials or employees spouse, parent(s), step parent(s), grandparent(s),
sibling(s), child(ren), or step child(ren).
(2) The words "employment interest" include a situation in which an
official or employee or a designated family member is negotiating possible
employment with a person or organization that is the subject of the vote or that
is to be regulated or supervised.
(3) In any situation in which a personal interest is also a conflict of
interest under state law, the provisions of the state law take precedence over the
provisions of this chapter.
1-203. Disclosure of personal interest by official with vote. An
official with the responsibility to vote on a measure shall disclose during the
meeting at which the vote takes place, before the vote and so it appears in the
minutes, any personal interest that affects or that would lead a reasonable
person to infer that it affects the officials vote on the measure. In addition, the
official may recuse himself from voting on the measure. 1
1-204. Disclosure of personal interest in non-voting matters. An
official or employee who must exercise discretion relative to any matter, other
than casting a vote, and who has a personal interest in the matter that affects
or that would lead a reasonable person to infer that it affects the exercise of the
discretion shall disclose, before the exercise of the discretion when possible, the
Masculine pronouns include the feminine. Only masculine pronouns 1
have been used for convenience and readability.
1-6
interest on a form provided by and filed with the recorder. In addition, the
official or employee may, to the extent allowed by law, charter, ordinance, or
policy, recuse himself from the exercise of discretion in the matter.
1-205. Acceptance of gratuities, etc. An official or employee may not
accept, directly or indirectly, any money, gift, gratuity, or other consideration
or favor of any kind from anyone other than the municipality:
(1) For the performance of an act, or refraining from performance of
an act, that he would be expected to perform, or refrain from performing, in the
regular course of his duties; or
(2) That might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to influence
his action, or reward him for past action, in executing municipal business.
1-206. Use of information. (1) An official or employee may not disclose
any information obtained in his official capacity or position of employment that
is made confidential under state or federal law except as authorized by law.
(2) An official or employee may not use or disclose information
obtained in his official capacity or position of employment with the intent to
result in financial gain for himself or any other person or entity.
1-207. Use of municipal time, facilities, etc. (1) An official or
employee may not use or authorize the use of municipal time, facilities,
equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage to himself.
(2) An official or employee may not use or authorize the use of
municipal time, facilities, equipment, or supplies for private gain or advantage
to any private person or entity, except as authorized by legitimate contract or
lease that is determined by the governing body to be in the best interests of the
municipality.
1-208. Use of position or authority. (1) An official or employee may
not make or attempt to make private purchases, for cash or otherwise, in the
name of the municipality.
(2) An official or employee may not use or attempt to use his position
to secure any privilege or exemption for himself or others that is not authorized
by the charter, general law, or ordinance or policy of the municipality.
1-209. Outside employment. An official or employee may not accept
or continue any outside employment if the work unreasonably inhibits the
performance of any affirmative duty of the municipal position or conflicts with
any provision of the municipalitys charter or any ordinance or policy.
1-210. Ethics complaints. (1) The city attorney is designated as the
ethics officer of the municipality. Upon the written request of an official or
employee potentially affected by a provision of this chapter, the city attorney
1-7
may render an oral or written advisory ethics opinion based upon this chapter
and other applicable law.
(2) (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the city
attorney shall investigate any credible complaint against an appointed
official or employee charging any violation of this chapter, or may
undertake an investigation on his own initiative when he acquires
information indicating a possible violation, and make recommendations
for action to end or seek retribution for any activity that, in the attorneys
judgment, constitutes a violation of this code of ethics.
(b) The city attorney may request the governing body to hire
another attorney, individual, or entity to act as ethics officer when he has
or will have a conflict of interests in a particular matter.
(c) When a complaint of a violation of any provision of this
chapter is lodged against a member of the municipalitys governing body,
the governing body shall either determine that the complaint has merit,
determine that the complaint does not have merit, or determine that the
complaint has sufficient merit to warrant further investigation. If the
governing body determines that a complaint warrants further
investigation, it shall authorize an investigation by the city attorney or
another individual or entity chosen by the governing body.
(3) The interpretation that a reasonable person in the circumstances
would apply shall be used in interpreting and enforcing this code of ethics.
(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule, or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than as a violation of this code of ethics.
1-211. Violations. An elected official or appointed member of a separate
municipal board, commission, committee, authority, corporation, or other
instrumentality who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
punishment as provided by the municipalitys charter or other applicable law,
and in addition is subject to censure by the governing body. An appointed official
or an employee who violates any provision of this chapter is subject to
disciplinary action.

preceding elements, so as to endanger the health, safety, or welfare of other
citizens or to encourage the infestation of rats and other harmful animals.
(2) Smoke, soot, cinders. It shall be unlawful for any person to permit
or cause the escape of such quantities of dense smoke, soot, cinders, noxious

13-102. Notice to property owner. The city manager of the City of
Forest Hills is hereby directed to make regular inspections of all property within

the City of Forest Hills and to determine if a violation of this chapter exists. In
the event he shall find any such violation, he shall provide notice to the owner
of record to remedy the condition immediately. The notice shall be sent by
registered or certified Unites States mail, addressed to the last known address
of the owner of record. The notice shall be written in plain language and shall
state that the owner of the property is entitled to a hearing, and shall, at the
minimum, contain the following additional information:
(1) A brief statement that the property of such owner is in violation of
this chapter, which has been enacted under the authority of Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 6-54-113, and that the property of such owner may be cleaned up
at the expense of the owner and a lien placed against the property to secure the
cost of the clean-up;
(2) The name, office address, and telephone number of the city
manager;
(3) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition, which shall be
in conformity with the standards of cost in the City of Forest Hills; and

fails or refuses to remedy the condition within ten (10) days after receiving the
notice, the city manager shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied
or removed at a cost in conformity with reasonable standards and the cost
thereof assessed against the owner of the property. The city attorney shall
collect the costs assessed against the owner through an action for debt filed in
any court of competent jurisdiction. The city attorney may bring one (1) action
for debt against more than one (1) or all of the owners of properties against
whom such costs have been assessed, and the fact that multiple owners have
been joined in one (1) action shall not be considered by the court as a misjoinder
of parties. Upon the filing of a notice with the office of the register of deeds in
Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County, the costs shall be a lien on the
property in favor of the City of Forest Hills, second only to liens of the state,
county and municipality for taxes, any lien of Davidson County for special
assessments, and any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded
or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These costs shall be
placed on the tax rolls of Davidson County as a lien and shall be added to
property tax bills to be collected at the same time and in the same manner as
property taxes are collected. If the owner fails to pay the costs, they may be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as delinquent property taxes
are collected and shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as delinquent
property taxes.
(2) The city shall wait until cumulative charges for remediation equal
or exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) before filing notice with the register of
deeds and the charges becoming a lien on the property. After this threshold has
13-3
been met and the lien attaches, charges for costs for which the lien attached are
collectible as provided in subsection (1) above; provided, however no such
threshold shall be required prior to filing of suit by the city attorney for
collection of debt in a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. #2008-183, July
2008)
13-104. Appeal. The owner of record who is aggrieved by the
determination and order of the city manager may appeal the determination and
order to the City of Forest Hills board of commissioners. The appeal shall be
filed with the city manager within ten (10) days following the receipt of notice
issued pursuant to section 13-102 above. The failure to appeal within this time
shall, without exception, constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.
Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the City of Forest Hills board
of commissioners under this chapter may seek judicial review of the order or act.
(Ord. #2008-183, July 2008, modified)
13-105. Supplemental nature of this chapter. The provisions of this

and City of Nashville for taxes, any lien of the county for special assessments,

issuance of a citation for violation of a municipal ordinance referenced in the

totality of the circumstances.

residential property.

shall set a reasonable period of time to allow the alleged violator to remedy the
violation alleged in the citation before the fine is imposed. The remedial period
shall be no less than ten (10) or greater than one hundred twenty (120) calendar
days, except where failure to remedy the alleged violation in less than ten (10)
calendar days would pose an imminent threat to the health, safety or welfare of
persons or property in the adjacent area.
(3) Upon the levy of a fine pursuant to subsection (1), the hearing
officer shall within seven (7) business days, provide via certified mail notice to
the alleged violator of:

which the hearing is to be held, including a reference to the particular
sections of the statutes and rules involved.

days following the issuance of the citation. To confirm the hearing, the alleged
violator must make a written request for the hearing to the hearing officer
within seven (7) business days of receipt of the notice required in subsection (3).
(5) If an alleged violator demonstrates to the issuing officers
satisfaction that the allegations contained in the citation have been remedied
to the issuing officers satisfaction, the fine levied pursuant to subsection (1)
shall not be imposed or if already imposed cease; and the hearing date, if the
hearing has not yet occurred, shall be cancelled. (as added by Ord. #2013-209,

person without notice and opportunity for all parties to participate in the
communication.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), an administrative hearing officer
may communicate with municipal employees or officials regarding a matter
pending before the administrative body or may receive aid from staff assistants,
members of the staff of the city attorney or a licensed attorney, if such persons
do not receive ex parte communications of a type that the administrative
hearing officer would be prohibited from receiving, and do not furnish, augment,
diminish or modify the evidence in the record.
(3) Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters specifically
authorized by statute, no party to a contested case, and no other person may
communicate, directly or indirectly, in connection with any issue in that
proceeding, while the proceeding is pending, with any person serving as an
administrative hearing officer without notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate in the communication.
(4) If, before serving as an administrative hearing officer in a contested
case, a person receives an ex parte communication of a type that may not
properly be received while serving, the person, promptly after starting to serve,
shall disclose the communication in the manner prescribed in subsection (5).
(5) An administrative hearing officer who receives an ex parte
communication in violation of this section shall place on the record of the
pending matter all written communications received, all written responses to
the communications, and a memorandum stating the substance of all oral
communications received, all responses made, and the identity of each person

for a conference to consider:
(i) The simplification of issues;
(ii) The possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of
documents that will avoid unnecessary proof;
(iii) The limitation of the number of witnesses; and
(iv) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of
the action.

recites the action taken at the conference, and the agreements made by
the parties as to any of the matters considered, and that limits the issues
for hearing to those not disposed of by admissions or agreements of the
parties. Such order when entered controls the subsequent course of the
action, unless modified at the hearing to prevent manifest injustice.
(2) Upon reasonable notice to all parties, the administrative hearing
officer may convene a hearing or convert a pre-hearing conference to a hearing,
to be conducted by the administrative hearing officer sitting alone, to consider
argument or evidence, or both, on any question of law.
(3) In the discretion of the administrative hearing officer, all or part
of the pre-hearing conference may be conducted by telephone, television or other

Change 3, June 19, 2015 13-20
(a) The petition is submitted in writing to the administrative
hearing officer, with copies mailed to all parties named in the notice of
the hearing, at least seven (7) business days before the hearing;
(b) The petition states facts demonstrating that the petitioners
legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other legal interest may be
determined in the proceeding or that the petitioner qualifies as an
intervenor under any provision of law; and
(c) The administrative hearing officer determines that the
interests of justice and the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceedings
shall not be impaired by allowing the intervention.
(2) If a petitioner qualifies for intervention, the administrative hearing

time. Conditions may include:

cross-examination, and submit rebuttal evidence, except as restricted by a
limited grant of intervention or by the pre-hearing order.
(3) In the discretion of the administrative hearing officer and by
agreement of the parties, all or part of the hearing may be conducted by
telephone, television or other electronic means, if each participant in the hearing

Tennessee Code Annotated, title 8, chapter 44, unless otherwise provided by

right to cross-examination of such affiant is waived and the affidavit, if
introduced in evidence, shall be given the same effect as if the affiant had

(3) Findings of fact shall be based exclusively upon the evidence of
record in the adjudicative proceeding and on matters officially noticed in that
proceeding. The administrative hearing officers experience, technical
competence and specialized knowledge may be utilized in the evaluation of
evidence.
(4) If an individual serving or designated to serve as an administrative

13-617. Appeal to board of commissioners. (1) A person who is
aggrieved by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to appeal the final
decision to the board of commissioners.
(2) Proceedings for board review of a final order are instituted by filing
a written petition for review with the city manager not less than fourteen (14)
days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of
commissioners. Said appeal shall placed on the agenda and shall be heard at the
boards next regularly scheduled meeting. The board of commissioners may call
a special meeting to hear such an appeal; provided, however, nothing herein
shall obligate the board of commissioners to call a special meeting.
(3) Promptly upon receipt of a partys petition for review, the city
manager shall notify the administrative hearing officer of the appeal. Within
five (5) days after receipt of such notice, the administrative hearing officer shall
transmit to the city manager court the original or a certified copy of the entire
record of the proceeding under review.

appeal. Said statement must be received by the city manager not less than five
(5) days prior to the scheduled hearing before the board of commissioners. Each

Change 3, June 19, 2015 13-24
(c) A statement showing how said party was prejudiced by the
alleged error.
(5) The mayor shall preside over all such appeals to the board of
commissioners and shall determine the rules for procedure, including, but not
limited to, time limits for arguments by each side; provided, however, the files
of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the board of commissioners. The review shall not be confined to
the record.
(6) The board of commissioners may affirm, reverse, or modify the
decision of the administrative hearing officer or remand the case for further
proceedings. The board of commissioners shall reduce its findings of fact and
conclusions of law to writing and make them parts of the record. (as added by
Ord. #2013-209, April 2013)
13-618. Judicial review of final order. (1) A person who is aggrieved
by a final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review pursuant to
Tennessee Code Annotated, title 6, chapter 54, part 10, which shall be the only
available method of judicial review.
(2) Proceedings for judicial review of a final order are instituted by
filing a petition for review in the chancery court in Davidson County, Tennessee.
Such petition must be filed within sixty (60) calendar days after the entry of the
final order that is the subject of the review.
(3) The filing of the petition for review does not itself stay enforcement
of the final order. The reviewing court may order a stay on appropriate terms,
but if it is shown to the satisfaction of the reviewing court, in a hearing that
shall be held within ten (10) business days of a request for hearing by either
party, that any party or the public at large may suffer injury by reason of the
granting of a stay, then no stay shall be granted until a good and sufficient bond,
in an amount fixed and approved by the court, shall be given by the petitioner
conditioned to indemnify the other persons who might be so injured and if no
bond amount is sufficient, the stay shall be denied.
(4) Within forty-five (45) calendar days after service of the petition, or
within further time allowed by the court, the administrative hearing officer shall
transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire
record of the proceeding under review. By stipulation of all the parties of the
review proceedings, the record may be shortened. A party unreasonably refusing
to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional cost.
The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the
record.
(5) If, before the date set for hearing, application is made to the court
for leave to present additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the
court that the additional evidence is material and that there were good reasons
for failure to present it in the administrative proceeding, the court may order
that the additional evidence be taken before the administrative hearing officer
Change 3, June 19, 2015 13-25
upon conditions determined by the court. The administrative hearing officer
may modify its findings and decision by reason of the additional evidence and
shall file that evidence and any modifications, new findings or decisions with the
reviewing court.
(6) The procedure ordinarily followed in the reviewing court will be
followed in the review of contested cases decided by the administrative hearing
officer, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The administrative hearing
officer that issued the decision to be reviewed is not required to file a responsive
pleading.
(7) The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall
be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before
the administrative hearing officer, not shown in the record, proof thereon may
be taken in the court.
(8) The court may affirm the decision of the administrative hearing
officer or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or
modify the decision if the rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because
the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:
(a) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;
(b) In excess of the statutory authority of the administrative
hearing officer;
(c) Made upon unlawful procedure;
(d) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of
discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion; or
(e) Unsupported by evidence that is both substantial and
material in the light of the entire record. In determining the
substantiality of evidence, the court shall take into account whatever in
the record fairly detracts from its weight, but the court shall not
substitute its judgment for that of the administrative hearing officer as
to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.
(9) No administrative hearing decision pursuant to a hearing shall be
reversed, remanded or modified by the reviewing court unless for errors that
affect the merits of such decision.
(10) The reviewing court shall reduce its findings of fact and conclusions
of law to writing and make them parts of the record. (as added by

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.01. Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "The
Zoning Ordinance of Forest Hills, Tennessee" and may be referred to as "the
zoning ordinance" or "this ordinance."
1.02. Purpose. In addition to the purpose of zoning regulations
established in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 13-7-103, the purpose of this
ordinance is to implement the comprehensive plan adopted on January 21, 2010
and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals and general welfare
of the community.
These regulations are designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to
secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to provide adequate light and
air; to prevent overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population;
to establish a rational pattern of land use; and to encourage the most
appropriate use of land and to enhance the property values within the city. This
ordinance has been prepared with reasonable consideration, among other things,
as to the character of each district and its suitability for particular uses, and
with a view of conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most
appropriate use of land throughout the city.
1.03. Relationship with other laws.
(a) conflicts with other codes or laws. If a provision of this
ordinance is inconsistent with another provision of this ordinance, or with
a provision found in other adopted codes or ordinances of the city, the
more restrictive provision shall govern, unless the terms of the more
restrictive provision specify otherwise. The more restrictive provision is
the one that imposes greater restrictions or burdens, or more stringent
controls.
(b) Conflicts with private agreements. The city shall not be
responsible for monitoring or enforcing private easements, covenants, or
restrictions, although the city may inquire as to whether land is subject
to easements, covenants or restrictions during the review of applications.
(c) Conflicts with state or federal law. If a provision of this
Ordinance is inconsistent with a provision found in the law or regulations
of the state or federal government, the more restrictive provision shall
control, to the extent permitted by law.
1.04. Zoning map.
(a) Zoning map considered part of zoning ordinance.
Zoning districts established by this zoning ordinance are bounded and
defined as shown on the zoning map of the city (herein zoning map)
adopted concurrently with this zoning ordinance, which zoning map and
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-7
all pages and subparts thereof are hereby made a part of this zoning
ordinance and incorporated herein.
(b) Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. For
purposes of interpretation as may from time to time be necessary, the
following rules shall be used to determine the precise location of any
zoning district boundary shown on the official zoning map:
(i) Boundaries shown as following the corporate limits of
the city shall be construed as following such limits.
(ii) Boundaries shown as following, or approximately
following, streets shall be construed as following the centerlines of
such streets.
(iii) Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately
following, platted lot lines or other property lines, as shown on the
city subdivision plat maps, shall be construed as following such
lines.
(iv) Boundaries shown as following, or approximately
following, the centerlines of streams and water courses shall be
construed as following the channel centerline of such streams and
water courses. In the event of a natural change in the location of
such streams or water courses, the zoning district boundary shall
be construed as moving with the channel centerline.
(v) Boundaries shown as separated from, and parallel or
approximately parallel to, any of the features listed in subsections
(i) and (ii) above, shall be construed to be parallel to such features
and at such distances therefrom as are shown on the official zoning
map. (Ord. #2011-196, Jan. 2012, as replaced by Ord. #2013-210,
Dec. 2013)
ARTICLE II. ZONING DISTRICTS AND THEIR PURPOSE
2.01. General provisions. The city is hereby divided into zoning
districts of such number and character as are necessary to achieve compatibility
of uses within each district and to implement the comprehensive plan and to
achieve the other purposes of this zoning ordinance. For the purpose of this
zoning ordinance, all areas of the city are divided into the following zoning
districts:
District Minimum Lot Size
Estates 1A (E1A) Six (6) acres
Estates A (EA) Three (3) acres
Estates B (EB) Two (2) acres
Estates C (EC) One and one half (1.5) acres
Residential A (RA) One and one quarter (1.25) acres
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-8
District Minimum Lot Size
Neighborhood Conservation (NC1) and
(NC2)
One (1) acre
Open Space Subdivision One (1) acre
Historic Commercial (HC) One and one quarter (1.25) acres
Country Club (CC) One hundred sixty (160) acres
Institutional (IN) Places of worship: ten (10) acres
K-6 schools: twenty (20) acres
7-12 schools: fifty (50) acres
Municipal Floodplain Protection Overlay N/A
Hillside Protection Overlay N/A
2.02. Residential zoning districts. As indicated in the comprehensive
plan, the city is a residential community. The purpose of the residential zoning
districts is to provide the zoning standards and regulations to protect and
promote the residential character of various areas of the city and to ensure that
new development is performed in a manner that protects and enhances property
values. The purpose and intent of each of the residential districts is stated
below.
(a) Estates 1A (E1A) District (six (6) acres). The purpose of
this district is to maintain and preserve the countryside park-like
character in the area adjoining Percy Warner Park along Chickering and
Page Roads as shown on the comprehensive plan.
(b) Estates A (EA) District (three (3) acres). The purpose of
this district is to maintain and preserve the estate character in areas
shown on the comprehensive plan along Hillsboro Pike. This district is
established to provide greater setbacks and a more rural appearance
along one of the city's major streets.
(c) Estates B (EB) District (two (2) acres). The purpose of
this district is to maintain and preserve the estate character in the core
areas of the city, as shown on the comprehensive plan, for areas generally
east and west of Hillsboro Pike that are located beyond the corridor of the
street itself. This district is established to provide the desired estate
character in terms of lot size and setbacks.
(d) Estates C (EC) District (one and one half (1.5) acres).
The purpose of this district is to provide an estate character along Granny
White Pike as shown on the comprehensive plan. In light of the existing
smaller lot development located to the west of Granny White Pike, this
district is created to provide the estate character along the eastern border
of the city.
(e) Residential A (RA) District (one and one quarter (1.25)
acres). This district is primarily intended to recognize the character of
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-9
older developed and platted areas of the city; some of which predate the
creation of the city. The areas zoned in this district preserve a generally
suburban community character and cover those areas so designated in
the comprehensive plan. No rezoning of this district is ever envisioned.
This district respects those portions of the city where smaller lots were
an established form of development prior to incorporation.
(f) Neighborhood Conservation (NC1 and NC2) Districts
(one (1) acre). These districts are intended to preserve existing
neighborhoods that were developed as one (1) acre lots under zoning
district classifications no longer legal in the city, or which were developed
before the city was incorporated as a city. NC1 and NC2 Districts shall
never at any time in the future be used to develop new areas or lots
within the city. The NC1 and NC2 Districts make lots under these
districts conforming and, thereby, eliminate the problems landowners
typically would face when improving existing homes on nonconforming
lots within these classifications. Lots with minimum lot widths of one
hundred feet (100') are classified as NC1 and larger lots as NC2.
2.03. Non-residential zoning districts. The City of Forest Hills is a
residential community with limited non-residential uses, including religious,
educational, country club, and historic commercial uses. The purpose and intent
of the non-residential districts is to provide zoning standards and regulations
to govern and control these zoning districts and to protect the adjacent and
adjoining residential districts. The purpose, intent, and specific regulations
pertaining to each non-residential district is stated below.
(a) Historic Commercial (HC) District.
(i) Generally. This district is the only commercial zoning
district in the city. It is created for the sole purpose of preserving
the rights of historically commercial properties in the city. All
historic commercial district properties were commercially used
before the city was formed, for the sale of grocery products and
gasoline sales and have remained commercial for those uses. There
shall be no expansion of the boundaries of this district or new
designations of any land for historic commercial district
classification.
(ii) Specific requirements. In addition to all other
requirements of this zoning ordinance and of the municipal code,
all historic commercial uses shall comply with the requirements of
this section:
(1) The lot upon which the historic commercial use
is located has been used for convenience store purposes, as
in the nature of a country store, for at least sixty (60) years
prior to the controlling date.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-10
(2) The total area of the lot devoted to the use
shall not exceed two (2) acres.
(3) The maximum floor area of the principal
building located on the lot shall not exceed five percent (5%)
of the total lot area, with at least seventy percent (70%) of
the lot in landscaping.
(4) The lot must have a minimum frontage along
any arterial street of three hundred feet (300') as identified
in the city's major street plan.
(5) No accessory building or other structure may
be located on the lot, provided, however, the lot may have
covered gas pumps not to exceed two (2) pump structures
(six (6) nozzles per pump).
(6) There shall be screening as appropriate in the
rear yard and side yard areas pursuant to a landscaping
plan approved by the planning commission and board of
commissioners. Such screening may consist of existing
vegetation and landscape features or a combination of new
plant materials, berms, and fencing. All front yards shall be
appropriately landscaped. All landscaping and screening
requirements shall be incorporated into an integrated
landscaping plan for the property.
(b) Country Club (CC) District.
(i) Generally. This district is created to allow for
development of a country club, which may have such amenities as
a main club house and accessory buildings or uses as are
customarily incident to country clubs, generally, including without
limitation an eighteen (18) hole golf course, pro-shops, swimming
pool, tennis courts, food preparation, dining and similar facilities,
which may serve food and alcoholic beverages as are otherwise
permitted by law on the premises. The country club shall be owned
by a not-for-profit corporation for the sole use and benefit of its
members and their guests and shall not be for the use of the
general public other than as spectators at occasional tournaments.

writing on the plans that all buildings and Structures
comply with the requirements of the International Building
Code, as amended, and all applicable federal, state, and
local laws and regulations.
(d) Creation of new non-residential districts. Any
application for a new non-residential zoning district shall comply with the
following procedures:
(i) No new non-residential zoning district shall be
created unless a request to rezone is recommended by the planning
commission and approved by a majority vote of the board of
commissioners.
(ii) In the event that the planning commission does not
recommend the creation of a non-residential zoning district, then
the board of commissioners may approve the application, provided
that such application is approved by a two-thirds (2/3) majority
vote of the board of commissioners.
(iii) The planning commission, in making its
recommendation, and the board of commissioners, in making its
decision, shall consider whether the proposed district is consistent
with the comprehensive plan, in the best interests of, and promotes
the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity,
and general welfare of the city and the specific area in which the
non-residential use district would be located.
(e) Expansion, alteration, or replacements in
non-residential districts. Prior to materially expanding, altering, or

following requirements shall be met:
(i) The owner of the lot must submit for approval of the
planning commission and the board of commissioners a concept
plan.
(ii) There shall be screening as appropriate in the rear
yard and side yard areas pursuant to a landscaping plan approved
by the planning commission and board of commissioners. Such

landscaping and screening requirements shall be incorporated into
an integrated landscaping plan for the property.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-13
(iii) In considering the concept plan and in making its
recommendation to the board of commissioners, the planning
commission shall consider the following criteria:
(1) Whether the proposed expansion is consistent
with the goals of the comprehensive plan;
(2) Whether the proposed expansion complies with
all other requirements of this zoning ordinance, the
municipal code, and all applicable state and federal laws;
(3) Whether the proposed expansion is consistent
with, in the best interests of, and promotes the public
health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and
general welfare of the city and the specific area in which the
non-residential use district would be located;
(4) Whether the proposed expansion is consistent
with the suburban estates character of the city;
(5) Whether the proposed expansion will have a
material detrimental effect upon the adjoining neighborhood
with respect to (i) the flow of traffic, (ii) noise, and
(iii) lighting;
(6) Whether the proposed expansion provides
landscaping and buffering sufficient to reasonably screen
the non-residential use from adjacent residential areas; and
(7) Whether the proposed expansion is
architecturally compatible with the existing principal
building; or if said principal building is destroyed by fire, act
of God, or is voluntarily removed, whether the replacement
is consistent with the architectural style of the surrounding
area previously in existence on the lot.
(iv) If the planning commission recommends the concept
plan for approval by the board of commissioners, then a simple
majority vote of the board of commissioners shall be required to
approve the proposed expansion. If, however, the planning
commission does not recommend the concept plan for approval,
then the board of commissioners may approve the expansion,
provided that the application therefor is approved by a two-thirds
(2/3) majority vote of the board of commissioners.
(f) Notice of requests to re-zone and to alter, expand, or
replace non-residential uses. When application is made for a new
non-residential zoning district, or when a concept plan is submitted for
a proposed expansion, the city manager shall give notice thereof to all
residents of the city. Notice of the time and place of the planning
commissions first scheduled meeting to review the re-zoning application
or proposed expansion shall be published once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city and delivered to all residents of the city via United
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-14
States mail. Notice pursuant to this section shall only be required for the
first public hearing; provided, however, that the city manager may
provide further notices. The failure to notify residents by United States
mail due to an error in records or any other circumstance shall not
invalidate any recommendation of the planning commission or action of
the board of commissioners. The applicant for the request to re-zone,
alter, expand, or replace a non-residential use shall bear the full cost and
expense incurred by the city pursuant to the notice requirements of this
section.
2.04. Open Space Subdivision Zoning District (OS). The Open Space
Subdivision District is intended to be a voluntary option for new subdivisions of
land within the city. The city shall not mandate the rezoning of land into the
Open Space Subdivision District; rather, an applicant may elect to pursue
rezoning of land into this district. The Open Space Subdivision District is
intended to encourage and provide means for effecting desirable and quality
development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom than that
permitted under the basic district regulations, and to accomplish a
well-balanced, aesthetically satisfying city and economically desirable
development of building sites within an Open Space Subdivision. These
regulations are established to permit latitude in the development of the building
site if such development is found to be in accordance with the purpose, spirit and
intent of this zoning ordinance and the comprehensive plan and is found not to
be hazardous, harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment,
property values or the character of the neighborhood or the health, safety and
welfare of the community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification,
variation and imagination in the relationship of structures, open spaces and
heights of structures for developments conceived and implemented as
comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further intended to encourage
more rational and economic development with relationship to public services,
and to encourage and facilitate the preservation of open space.
(a) Conditions.
(i) Area. The minimum development site for any open
space subdivision shall be at least ten (10) acres. The minimum lot
size within each open space subdivision shall be one (1) acre.
(ii) Use. The open space subdivision shall be used
exclusively for residential uses.
(iii) Ownership. The land comprising the open space
subdivision shall be in single or corporate ownership at the time of
application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by all
owners of the property.
(iv) Design. Structures and open spaces within the site
shall be arranged to ensure that adjacent properties will not be
materially adversely affected. Where feasible, the least height and
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-15
density of buildings and uses shall be arranged around the
boundaries of the development.
(v) Specific regulations.
(1) The minimum lot width, front yard setback,
rear yard setback, and side yard setback shall be
determined by approval of the site concept plan.
(2) The minimum lot area shall be one (1) acre.
(3) The maximum height shall be thirty-five feet
(35').
(4) The maximum building cover shall be twelve
percent (12%).
(5) The maximum impervious surface ratio shall
be fifty percent (50%).
(vi) Open spaces. Each open space subdivision shall
provide a minimum of thirty percent (30%) of its total acreage to
be designated as open space and preserved in perpetuity in a
natural state. The open space shall be designated as such on the
final recorded plat. Preservation, maintenance and ownership of
required open spaces within the development shall be
accomplished by either:
(1) Creating a permanent conservation easement
on and over the said private open spaces to guarantee that
the open space remain perpetually undeveloped, with
oversight and administration by a land trust or similar
non-profit entity pursuant to an agreement which is
acceptable to the board of commissioners; or
(2) Vesting title to said private open space in a
homeowners association, established with articles of
association and bylaws, which are satisfactory to the board
of commissioners.
(vii) Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening
related to the uses within the site and as a means of integrating
the proposed open space subdivision into its surroundings shall be
planned and presented to the planning commission for approval,
together with other required plans for the development. A general
landscaping plan will show proposed trees, shrubbery, and other
landscaping for the open space area and common elements of the
subdivision. A grading and drainage plan shall also be submitted
to the planning commission with the application.
(viii) Signs. The size, location, design and nature of signs,
if any, and the number and direction thereof shall be detailed in
the application.
(ix) Desirability. The proposed location shall be shown as
necessary or desirable, and to contribute to the general well-being
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-16
of the surrounding area. It shall also be shown that under the
circumstances of the particular case, the proposed subdivision will
not be materially detrimental to the health, safety or general
welfare of persons residing in the vicinity of the open space
subdivision.
(b) Creation of an Open Space Subdivision District.
(i) Rezoning required. No new open space subdivision
shall be created unless a request to rezone the property to open
space subdivision is recommended by the planning commission and
approved by the majority vote of the board of commissioners. In
the event that the planning commission does not recommend the
creation of an open space subdivision, then the board of
commissioners may approve the application, provided that such
application is approved by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the
board of commissioners.
(ii) Concept plan required. An applicant for an open space
subdivision shall submit to the planning commission a concept
plan in accordance with the form and procedures outlined in the
subdivision regulations.
(iii) Hearings by planning commission and board of
commissioners. The planning commission shall consider the open
space subdivision concept plan, preliminary plat, and final plat in
accordance with the procedures outlined in the subdivision
regulations. Once the planning commission has voted to approve,
approve with conditions, or disapprove the proposed open space
subdivision, the secretary of the planning commission will forward
the application to the board of commissioners for its consideration.
Because an application for rezoning represents a legislative
change, the board of commissioners will consider the application
as an ordinance, requiring two (2) affirmative public votes.
(c) Planning commission determination. In carrying out the
intent of this section, the planning commission shall consider the
following principles:
(i) It is the intent of this section that site and building
plans for an open space subdivision shall be prepared by a designer
or team of designers having professional competence in suburban
planning as proposed in the application. The commission shall be
permitted to require the applicant to engage such professional
expertise as a qualified designer or design team.
(ii) It is not the intent of this section that control of the
design of an open space subdivision by the planning commission be
so rigidly exercised that individual initiative be stifled and
substantial additional expense incurred; rather, it is the intent of
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-17
this section that the control exercised be the minimum necessary
to achieve the purpose of this section.
(iii) In an approval, the planning commission shall be
permitted to attach such conditions as it deems necessary to secure
compliance with the purposes set forth in this ordinance.
(iv) The planning commission, in making its
recommendation, shall consider whether the proposed open space
subdivision is consistent with, in the best interests of, and
promotes the public health, safety, morals, convenience, order,
prosperity, and general welfare of the city and the specific area in
which the open space subdivision would be located.
(d) Modification of standards. The board of zoning appeals
shall not have the power to grant a variance from the requirements of
this section 2.04, specifically including, but not limited to, the
requirements of section 2.04(a). The board of commissioners shall have
the power and authority to grant relief from the strict application of this
section 2.04, or to grant a modification of the standards herein, where, by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, exceptional
topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation
or condition of a specific piece of property, the strict application of this
section 2.04 would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties
to or exceptional or undue hardship upon the applicant for rezoning of the
property, provided further that such relief may be granted without
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the
intent and purpose of this section and this ordinance.
(e) Required contributions. The planning commission or
board of commissioners, as part of the approval of an open space
subdivision, shall be permitted to require an applicant to make
reasonable contributions to include, but not limited to any combination
of the following:
(i) Dedication of land for public road right-of-way
purposes.
(ii) Construction of, or addition to, roads serving the
proposed project when such construction or addition is reasonably
related to the traffic to be generated.
(iii) Installation of required traffic safety devices.
(iv) Preservation of areas containing significant natural,
environmental, historic, archeological or similar resources.
2.05. Floodplain Protection Overlay District (FP). There is hereby
established the municipal Floodplain Protection District ("FP District"), the
boundaries of which shall correspond to the areas of special flood hazard
identified on the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee, Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Flood Insurance Study and Flood Insurance Rate Map, as
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-18
defined in § 14-303(2) of the municipal code. The provisions of title 14, chapter
3, including all technical and development standards and requirements therein,
are made a part hereof and incorporated herein. As an "overlay" district, any
development or land disturbance within this area shall comply with the
technical and development standards in title 14, chapter 3 in addition to the
requirements associated with the primary zoning district. In cases where the
technical and development standards and requirements may conflict between
the primary and overlay district, the more stringent standards and
requirements shall apply.
2.06. Hillside Protection Overlay District (HP).
(a) Established. The Hillside Protection Overlay District (HP
District) is hereby established to more adequately meet the challenges of
development in the higher elevation areas of the city. The district shall include
(i) all areas within the corporate limits of the city with an elevation of eight
hundred feet (800') or greater, and (ii) all areas within the corporate limits of the
city with steep slopes. Where only a portion of a lot has an elevation in excess
of eight hundred feet (800') or contains steep slopes, only that portion of the lot
encumbered by steep slopes or existing over eight hundred feet (800') shall be
included within the HP district. The district shall generally be depicted on the
maps of the HP District maintained in the city offices; provided, however, that
the provisions set forth in this section shall apply to all areas with elevations
and grades identified in this section, and only to such areas, regardless of
whether such areas are correctly depicted on maps. As an "overlay" district, any
development or land disturbance within this area shall comply with the
technical and development standards in this section in addition to the
requirements associated with the primary zoning district. In cases where the
technical and development standards and requirements may conflict between
the primary and overlay district, the more stringent standards and
requirements shall apply.
(b) Intent. It is the intent of the HP district to encourage
prudent land disturbance and development activities that maintain the natural,
topographic character of the land. The technical and development standards
within the primary zoning district alone are inadequate to preserve and protect
the natural environment and scenic beauty of the citys steep hillside areas. The
additional standards set forth in this section serve to protect the health, safety,
quality of life and general welfare of the community. These standards are
directed at minimizing the impact of building construction and land disturbance
activities in steep hillside areas including, but not limited to, unsafe geologic
disturbance, soil erosion and surface water runoff from excessive removal of
trees and other vegetative cover, and severe cutting, physical scarring and
visual modification of the natural terrain.
(c) Applicability.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-19
(i) Generally. For all property located within the HP
District, the standards of this section shall apply to (a) the
approval of any new subdivision of land, (b) the construction or
erection of any new residential dwelling or any other new structure
that requires a building permit, and (c) any land disturbance
activity that requires a permit pursuant to the stormwater
management ordinance, unless exempted by the terms herein.
(ii) Exemptions. The following disturbances or actions
shall be permitted within the HP District without the necessity of
compliance with this section:
(1) Expansion of existing structures. Building
permits or grading permits issued for the expansion of an
existing structure, provided that such expansion is less than
twenty-five percent (25%) expansion in total impervious
surface area of one thousand five hundred (1,500) square
feet of finishable floor space, whichever is less;
(2) Accessory structures. Building permits issued
for the construction of new structures to be used as an
accessory to a principal dwelling, with the exception of
swimming pools, where said structure contains less than six
hundred fifty (650) square feet;
(3) Fences. Permits issued for construction of
fences or maintenance to any existing fence;
(4) Interior construction. Building permits issued
for interior construction or remodeling of a dwelling, or
building permits issued related to the enclosure of
previously unenclosed spaces, such as porches and patios,
where no new impervious surface will be added;
(5) Miscellaneous. Such other reasonable land
disturbances that result in an improvement in slope
stability.
(iii) Nonconforming lots and structures. Within the HP
District, any lot established on an unexpired, approved
preliminary plat or executed final plat and/or any existing
structure that was lawfully constructed prior to the controlling
date may be developed, improved or continued in use; provided,
however, when such property is developed or when an existing
structure is enlarged by more than a twenty-five percent (25%)
expansion in total impervious surface area or one thousand five
hundred (1,500) square feet of finishable floor space, whichever is
less, the lot shall be brought into conformance with the standards
of this section to the greatest extent feasible. Exceptions to the
standards may be approved by the board of zoning appeals if it
determines that the proposed plan will more adequately achieve
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-20
the intent of this section and/or full compliance will pose an undue
burden on the property owner.
(d) New subdivisions within the HP District. The following
standards shall apply to new subdivisions of land within the HP District:
(i) Minimum lot area. Any new lot created within the HP
District shall be comprised of not less than three (3) acres.
(ii) Maximum allowable area of disturbance. Not more
than ten percent (10%) of the total acreage of that portion of the lot
encumbered by steep slopes or slippage soils may be disturbed.
(iii) Location of buildings. No dwelling or other structure
shall be permitted in areas with steep slopes. In addition, the
building envelope shall be at least fifty feet (50') away from any
areas classified as steep slopes.
(iv) Streets and driveways. Streets and driveways shall
be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements
of the subdivision regulations and section 4.07, is applicable.
(e) Technical standards for construction. Where the
provisions of this section are applicable pursuant to section 2.06(c), the
construction standards contained in section 6.03 shall apply. (as added by
Ord. #2011-106, Jan. 2012, as replaced by Ord. #2013-210, Dec. 2013, and
amended by Ord. #2014-218, Dec. 2014)

related structures shall, to the extent possible, use
materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that
will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.
(3) If an antenna is installed on a structure other
than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and
mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is
identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related
equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible.
(iv) Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted,
unless required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If
lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen
must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views.
(v) State and federal requirements. All towers must meet
or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC,
and any other agency of the state or federal government with the
authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and
regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-30
antennas governed by this section shall bring such towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations within six (6) months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule
is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to
bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised
standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
(vi) Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the
structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure
that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in
applicable state and local building codes and the applicable
standards for towers that are published by the Electronic
Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon
inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with
such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or
property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the
tower, the owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower
into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower
into compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute
grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owners
expense.
(vii) Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be
regulated and permitted pursuant to this ordinance and shall not
be regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or
private utilities.
(viii) Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or
antennas shall certify that all franchises required by law for the
construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system
in the city have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required
franchises with the city manager.
(ix) Signs. No signs shall be allowed on an antenna or
tower.
(x) Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and
support equipment associated with antennas or towers shall
comply with the requirements of section 3.05(e).
(c) Administratively approved uses.

use complies with sections 3.05(b), and 3.05(d)(ii)(4).
(4) The City manager shall respond to each such
application within sixty (60) days after receiving it by either
approving or denying the application. If the city manager
fails to respond to the applicant within said sixty (60) days,
then the application shall be deemed to be approved.
(5) In connection with any such administrative
approval, the city manager may, in order to encourage
shared use, administratively waive any zoning district
setback requirements in section 3.05(d)(ii)(4) by up to fifty
percent (50%).
(6) In connection with any such administrative
approval, the city manager may, in order to encourage the
use of monopoles, administratively allow the reconstruction
of an existing tower to monopole construction.
(7) If an administrative approval is denied, the
applicant shall file an application for a special use permit
pursuant to section 3.05(d) prior to filing any appeal that
may be available under the zoning ordinance.
(ii) List of administratively approved uses. The following
uses may be approved by the city manager after conducting an
administrative review:
(1) City and property. Antennas or towers located
on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the
city provided a license or lease authorizing such antenna or
tower has been approved by the city.
(2) Collocation of antennas on existing towers. An
antenna which is attached to an existing tower may be
approved by the city manager and, to minimize adverse
visual impacts associated with the proliferation and
clustering of towers, collocation of antennas by more than
one (1) carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over
the construction of new towers, provided such collocation is
accomplished in a manner consistent with the following:
(a) A tower which is modified or
reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an
additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as
the existing tower, unless the city manager allows
reconstruction as a monopole.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-32

may remain on the site.
(3) Alternative structures. Locating any alternative
tower structure that in the judgment of the city manager is
in conformity with the goals set forth in section (a) of this
ordinance.
(4) Microcell. Installing a cable microcell network
through the use of multiple low-powered transmitters/
receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such as
conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology
that does not require the use of towers.
(d) Special use permits.
(i) Generally. The following provisions shall govern the
issuance of special use permits for towers or antennas by the
planning commission:
(1) If the tower or antenna is not permitted to be
approved administratively pursuant to section 3.05(c) of this
section, then a special use permit shall be required for the
construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all
zoning districts.
(2) In granting a special use permit, the planning
commission may impose conditions to the extent the
planning commission concludes such conditions are
necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed
tower on adjoining properties.
(3) Any information of an engineering nature that
the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or
electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional
engineer.
(4) An applicant for a special use permit shall
submit the information described in this section and a nonrefundable
fee as established by the fee resolution.

ordinance.
(b) Legal description of the parent tract and
leased parcel (if applicable).
(c) The setback distance between the
proposed tower and the nearest residential dwelling,
platted residentially zoned properties, and unplanted
residentially zoned properties.
(d) The separation distance from other
towers described in the inventory of existing sites
submitted pursuant to section 3.05(b)(ii) shall be
shown on a site plan or map. The applicant shall also
identify the type of construction of the existing
tower(s) and the owner/operator of the existing
tower(s), if known.
(e) A landscaping plan.
(f) Method of fencing, and finished color
and, if applicable, the method of camouflage and
illumination.
(g) A description of compliance with

through the use of the proposed new tower.
(k) A description of the feasible location(s)
of future towers or antennas within the city based
upon existing physical, engineering, technological or
geographical limitations in the event the proposed
tower is erected.
(2) Factors considered in granting special use
permits for towers. The planning commission shall consider
the following factors in determining whether to issue a
special use permit, although the planning commission may
waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one (1) or
more of these criteria if the planning commission concludes
that the goals of this section are better served thereby:
(a) Height of the proposed tower;
(b) Proximity of the tower to residential
structures and residential district boundaries;
(c) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby
properties;
(d) Surrounding topography;
(e) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(f) Design of the tower, with particular
reference to design characteristics that have the
effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness;
(g) Proposed ingress and egress; and
(h) Availability of suitable existing towers,
other structures, or alternative technologies not
requiring the use of towers or structures, as
discussed in 3.05(c)(ii)(3)-(4) of this section.
(3) Availability of suitable existing towers, other
structures, or alternative technology. No new tower shall be
permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the planning commission that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does
not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate
the applicants proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit
information requested by the planning commission related
to the availability of suitable existing towers, other
structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to
demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-35
technology can accommodate the applicants proposed
antenna may consist of any of the following:
(a) No existing towers or structures are
located within the geographic area that meets
applicant's engineering requirements.

sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
(c) Existing towers or structures do not
have sufficient structural strength to support
applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.
(d) The applicants proposed antenna would
cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna
on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna
on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicants proposed antenna.
(e) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions
required by the owner in order to share an existing
tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or
structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
(f) The applicant demonstrates that there
are other limiting factors that render existing towers
and structures unsuitable.
(g) The applicant demonstrates that an
alternative technology that does not require the use
of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system,
is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that
exceed new tower or antenna development shall not
be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback requirements
shall apply to all towers for which a special use permit is
required; provided, however, that the planning commission
may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals
of this section would be better served thereby:
(a) Towers must be set back a distance
equal to at least two hundred feet (200') or three
hundred percent (300%) of the height of the tower,
whichever is greater, from any adjoining lot line.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-36
(b) Guys and accessory buildings must
satisfy the minimum zoning district setback
requirements.
(5) Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by
security fencing not less than six feet (6') in height and shall
also be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device.
(6) Landscaping. The following requirements shall
govern the landscaping surrounding towers for which a
special use permit is required.
(a) Tower facilities shall be landscaped with
a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the
view of the tower compound from property used for
residences. The standard buffer shall consist of a
landscaped strip at least twenty-five feet (25') wide
outside the perimeter of the compound.
(b) In locations where the visual impact of
the tower would be minimal, the landscaping
requirement may be reduced or waived.
(c) Existing mature tree growth and
natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to
the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as
towers sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth
around the property perimeter may be sufficient
buffer.
(e) Buildings or other equipment storage. The equipment
cabinet or structure used in association with antennas shall comply with
the following:
(i) The cabinet or structure shall not contain more than
three hundred (300) square feet of gross floor area or be more than
twelve feet (12') in height, and shall be located in accordance with
the minimum yard requirements of the zoning district in which
located; provided, however, the requirements of this provision may
be modified by the city manager or by the planning commission to
encourage collocation.
(ii) Equipment storage buildings or cabinets shall comply
with all applicable building codes.
(f) Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. Any
antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve
(12) months shall be considered abandoned, and the owner of such
antenna or tower shall remove the same within ninety (90) days of receipt
of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment. Failure
to remove an abandoned antenna or tower within said ninety (90) day
shall be grounds to remove the tower or antenna at the owners expense.
If there are two (2) or more users of a single tower, then this provision
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-37
shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower. (as added
by Ord. #2011-196, Jan. 2012, replaced by Ord. #2013-210, Dec. 2013, and
amended by Ord. #2014-212, Feb. 2014)

ARTICLE V. LANDSCAPING
5.01. Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of this section to promote
and protect the public health, safety and general welfare by providing for the
planting, maintenance, and preservation of trees, shrubs and other plants
within the city. The intent of this section is to promote this purpose by:
(a) Ensuring the planting, proper installation, maintenance,
and survival of trees, shrubs, and other plants;
(b) Reducing storm water impacts and the costs associated
therewith while also mitigating against erosion and sedimentation
through the establishment of root systems and appropriate groundcovers
intended to protect and restore soils and land denuded as a result of
construction, grading, or other land disturbing activity;
(c) Enhancing the appearance and visual quality of the built
landscape through the use of an appropriate variety of plant types, sizes,
species, and placement, while also providing visual screening of service
areas; and
(d) Protect and enhance property values and quality of life,
softening of the built environment through plantings, and integration of
existing vegetation.
5.02. Applicability of landscaping standards. These provisions of
this Section shall apply to (i) all applications to the board of zoning appeals for
variances, special exceptions, conditional uses, or other relief from the zoning
ordinance, (ii) all tree replacement required by section 6.05 of this ordinance,
and (iii) any land disturbance activity that requires a permit pursuant to the
storm water management ordinance.
5.03. Landscaping plan requirements.
(a) Requests to the board of zoning appeals. All
applications to the board of zoning appeals for variances, special exceptions,
conditional uses, or other relief from the zoning ordinance shall be accompanied
by a landscaping plan to be reviewed and approved by the board of zoning
appeals. Said landscaping plan must minimize the loss of grasses, shrubbery,
and landscaping and provide screening of adjacent properties.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-55
(b) Tree replacement and grading permits. When a
property owner must replace trees pursuant to section 6.05 of this ordinance or
applies for a grading permit pursuant to the storm water management
ordinance, the applicant shall submit a landscaping plan together with all other
materials required for the applicable permit. The landscaping plan shall be
reviewed and approved by the city manager, or his designee, to ensure that the
proposed landscaping will minimize the loss of trees, grasses, shrubbery, and
landscaping pursuant to the grant of the permit.
5.04. Adoption of approved landscaping plan. Whenever a
landscaping plan has been required and approved hereunder, the terms of such
approved landscaping plan shall be incorporated into, and become a requirement

2012, and replaced by Ord. #2013-210, Dec. 2013)
ARTICLE VI. RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS
6.01. Purpose. The general purpose of this article is to establish
standards for the protection of natural and historical resources within Forest
Hills from the potential harmful effects associated with development.
Furthermore, it is also the general purpose of this article to implement the
resource protection recommendations of the comprehensive plan. In addition to
these general purposes, the following are specific purpose statements for the
protection of certain resources:
(a) Floodways and floodplains, surface waters, and wet
weather conveyance protection. Areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation that may result in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood prevention and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Furthermore, the city
and its neighbors benefit from ponds, streams, and creeks, all of which
provide scenic beauty which, if protected, enhance the quality of life and
the quality of the environment for all residents of the city. It is the
purpose and intent of this section to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare by regulating uses that are vulnerable to water or erosion
hazards, uses that increase the volume and quantity of storm water flow,
and uses that degrade water quality.
(b) Steep slope and slippage soils protection. The purpose
of the steep slope and slippage soils protection standards is to guide
development on hilltops, ridgetops, steep slopes and slippage soils to
protect natural areas and features and to locate development, where
possible, in areas that do not have severe environmental limitations. It
is the intent of these standards to (i) protect the hillsides and hilltops of
the city because development thereon increases runoff, erosion,
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-56
sedimentation, and the potential for slope destabilization; (ii) undertake
development in a manner that protects life and property from hazards
due to slope, unstable and erodible soils, earth movement, and other
geologic and hydrologic hazards; (iii) preserve the visual quality of steep
slope areas, which are valuable natural and economic resources; and (iv)
limit development on slippage soils where there is a possibility of
substantial property damage.
(c) Woodland and tree protection. The purpose of the
woodland and tree protection standards is to limit the destruction of and
ensure the survival of trees. The maintenance of existing trees and
replanting of new trees is necessary to promote the value of property and
the quality of life of its citizens; to ensure the stabilization of soil by
prevention of erosion; to reduce storm water runoff and the costs
associated with it; to replenish the groundwater supply; and to cleanse
the air of harmful pollutants.
(d) Historic and cultural resource protection. The purpose
of the historic and cultural resource protection standards is to protect the
historic and cultural resources of the city that are an integral part of the
city's character and charm.
6.02. Floodways and floodplains; surface waters; and wet weather
conveyances.
(a) Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to
all lots where floodways, floodplains, surface waters, and wet weather
conveyances exist.
(b) Technical standards.
(i) Water quality buffer areas. Wherever a water
quality buffer area is required by this section, the water quality
buffer area shall be established, protected, and maintained as
follows:
(1) The buffer shall measure twenty-five feet (25')
perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of a
floodway, floodplain, wet weather conveyance and any
surface water that serves as a channel or conduit of water;
and fifty feet (50') around the perimeter of a pond or lake.
(2) The water quality buffer area shall remain
undisturbed except for the following disturbances:
(a) Limited disturbances to remove and/or
plant trees or vegetation, as required to maintain the
overall health of vegetation in the buffer area,
including, but not limited to, routine mowing and
trimming of grass, weeds, and limbs.
(b) Removal of individual trees that are in
danger of falling, causing damage to dwellings or
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-57
other structures, are dead or diseased, or have been
heavily damaged by storms. The root wad or stump
should be left in place, where feasible, to maintain
soil stability.
(c) Removal of trees or plants listed in the
current edition of Invasive Exotic Pest Plants,
published by the Tennessee Exotic Pest Plant
Council.
(d) Disturbances necessary for the
construction of utility access areas and approved
stream crossings as long as the crossings are
perpendicular or as near to perpendicular as possible
to the channel.
(e) Disturbances as required to establish
and/or restore buffer areas.
(3) Any approved disturbance of a water quality
buffer area shall be revegetated in kind and/or enhanced
subject to the requirements of § 14-506(2)(a) of the
municipal code and approval of the city manager.
(ii) Floodways and floodplains.
(1) Generally. A water quality buffer area shall be
established, protected, and maintained along the edges of all
floodways and floodplains. The water quality buffer area
shall measure twenty-five feet (25') perpendicular from each
edge of the floodway or floodplain.
(2) Floodways. Construction within a floodway is
expressly prohibited.
(3) Floodplains. Construction of new dwellings or
other structures within a floodplain is generally prohibited.
If a floodplain covers a lot of record as of the controlling
date, to the extent that an existing structure cannot be
otherwise altered, expanded or replaced, then any
construction shall be performed in strict accordance with
the requirements of the FP District requirements in section
2.05 of this ordinance and title 14, chapter 3 of the
municipal code.
(iii) Surface waters and wet weather conveyances.
A water quality buffer area shall be established, protected, and
maintained along the edges of all surface waters and wet weather
conveyances. The water quality buffer area shall measure twentyfive
feet (25') perpendicular from the top of bank on each side of a
wet weather conveyance and any surface water that serves as a
channel or conduit of water; and fifty feet (50') around the
perimeter of a pond or lake.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-58
(c) Development standards.
(i) All construction, land disturbance, or grading on a lot
where floodways, floodplains, surface waters or wet weather
conveyances are located shall require a specific site plan prepared
by a duly licensed professional engineer. The site plan shall
demonstrate (i) full and complete compliance with the
requirements of the storm water management ordinance, and (ii)
that the planned construction, land disturbance, or grading will
not result in either filling of the floodplain or floodway, or the
degradation of surface waters or wet weather conveyances.
Notwithstanding any requirements of § 14-504(1) of the municipal
code to the contrary, if in the opinion of the city manager, or his
designee, the applicant has not provided reasonably sufficient
information to demonstrate compliance with the previous sentence,
the city manager may require additional information or studies
prior to issuance of a permit, including, but not limited to, a
stormwater management plan or an erosion prevention and
sediment control plan.
(ii) As a condition to receiving any permit (for building,
grading or otherwise) the applicant shall adopt the
recommendations of the professional engineer who provided the
site plan, which recommendations shall be incorporated into the
terms of the applicable permit.
6.03. Steep slopes, hillside protection and slippage soils.
(a) Applicability. Unless exempted from compliance pursuant
to section 2.06(c)(ii), construction within the HP District and on slippage
soils shall comply with the following standards.
(b) Technical standards. Where the provisions of this section
are applicable, the following technical standards shall apply:
(i) Maximum allowable area of disturbance. Not more
than ten percent (10%) of the total acreage of that portion of the lot
encumbered by steep slopes or slippage soils may be disturbed.
(ii) Footings. All buildings, dwellings, structures or walls,
whether for retention or diversion, shall have their foundations
installed with footings dug to bedrock or tied to bedrock with
appropriate piers if soils are greater than five feet (5') in depth.
(iii) Diversion walls; structural strength. The uphill side
of all buildings, dwellings or structures shall be protected from
slide damage by construction of diversion walls or increased
structural strength. The geotechnical study to be provided
pursuant to this section shall certify that the building, dwelling,
structure or diversion wall is designed to resist a slippage equal to
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-59
the depth of soil for a distance twenty feet (20') uphill of the
structure.
(iv) Drainage.
(1) On the uphill side of areas within the HP
District or with slippage soils, all runoff from roofs,
driveways and other impervious areas shall be run into a
drainage system that intercepts the stormwater around the
area and conveys them into property constructed channels.
(2) Any building, dwelling or structure, either
proposed or existing, within the HP District or with slippage
soils have drainage protection installed that does not
increase drainage to adjoining properties.
(v) Vegetation. Construction work shall minimize
removal of vegetation through industry standard construction
practices.
(c) Development standards.
(i) Geotecnical study. As part of the building permit
application, the applicant shall submit to the city a geotechnical
study that evaluates site characteristics and recommends design
and construction methods that ensure proper and structurally
sound soil conditions during and after construction. As a condition
to receiving a permit, the applicant shall be obligated to adopt the
recommendations of such geotechnical study. When a building or
land disturbance permit does not require issuance of a use and
occupancy permit upon completion of the project, the applicant
shall provide a performance agreement and performance bond to
secure such agreement, if so required by the city manager in his
reasonable discretion. The city manager or his designee may
require additional or special studies where warranted.
(ii) Supervision of work. Construction work shall be
supervised by a duly licensed geotechnical engineer to the extent
that he or she can issue a statement of compliance with the
approved plans at the conclusion of all construction work outlined
in the plan. No certificate of occupancy, if applicable, shall be
issued until this statement has been received by the city manager.
(iii) Board of zoning appeals approval. Board of zoning
appeals approval shall be required prior to (1) the construction or
erection of any new residential dwelling or any other new structure
that requires a building permit, and (2) any land disturbance
activity that requires a permit pursuant to the storm water
management ordinance, unless exempted by the terms therein. As
part of its application to the board of zoning appeals, the applicant
shall provide the geotechnical study required pursuant to section
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-60
6.03(c) and all other materials requested by the board of zoning
appeals pursuant to its adopted rules and regulations.
(iv) Certificate of occupancy. Prior to completion of a
structure within the HP District or with slippage soils and
issuance of a certificate of occupancy, an inspection shall be
conducted by the responsible city official(s), to determine if the
improvements have been completed according to the approved site
plan and/or geotechnical study. If at any time during construction
it is determined that the work being performed is not in
compliance with the requirements of this section and the approved
site plan, a stop work order shall be issued immediately. The order
shall remain in effect until the work is brought into compliance
with this zoning ordinance.
6.04. RESERVED.

ARTICLE VII. NON-CONFORMITIES
7.01. Purpose. All buildings, dwellings, structures, lots and uses
governed by other provisions of this zoning ordinance and the specific zoning
districts established herein shall continue to be governed by said provisions. A
building, dwelling, structure, lot or use for which a variance, permit or special
exception has been granted with respect to provisions of this zoning ordinance
not governed by this Article VI, shall not be deemed nonconforming and shall
continue to be governed by those other relevant provisions of this zoning
ordinance. All other buildings, dwellings, structures, lots and uses in existence
on the controlling date, which do not conform to the provisions of this zoning
ordinance and/or the provisions of the zoning district wherein the building,
dwelling, structure, lot or use is located, shall be deemed nonconforming and
shall be governed by the provisions of this article.
7.02. Nonconforming buildings, dwellings and structures.
(a) Any nonconforming building, dwelling or structure existing
on the controlling date may be continued in the form of its existence on
the controlling date.
(b) If any nonconforming building, dwelling or structure is
abandoned for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, then its use and
occupancy shall not be reestablished and the owner of the lot where the
abandoned building, dwelling or structure is located shall remove same
from said lot within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed six (6)
months after the date of the end of the continuous abandonment;
provided however, within said six (6) month period, said lot owner may
apply to the city for a new building permit, in accordance with Article
VIII hereof, to renovate and restore said abandoned building, dwelling or
structure, provided further however, said renovation and restoration
shall comply in all respects with the bulk standards, setbacks, building
size, height requirements, coverage requirements and all other standards
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-64
of the applicable zoning district. In the event the said lot owner applies
to the city for a new building permit, then the city manager shall refer
the building permit application to the board of zoning appeals for review
and approval.
(c) As a matter of right, the owner of any lot located anywhere
in the city, upon which a nonconforming building, dwelling or structure
is located and in use, may change, alter or expand the said building,
dwelling or structure, provided said building, dwelling or structure, after
such change, alteration or expansion, shall conform in every respect with
the bulk standards, setbacks, building size, height requirements,
coverage requirements and all other standards of the zoning district in
which it is located. Also, as a matter of right, a nonconforming building,
dwelling or structure may be altered within the confines of the outer
walls of the building, dwelling or structure by rearranging rooms, moving
interior walls and making other such physical alterations to the interior
of the building, dwelling or structure.
(d) Except as set forth in section 7.02(c) above, in the event the
owner of any lot wishes to alter, change or expand any nonconforming
building, dwelling or structure, said owner shall apply to the city for a
building permit for the alteration, change or expansion of same and the
city manager shall refer the building permit application to the board of
zoning appeals.
(e) Whenever a nonconforming building, dwelling or structure
has been changed to a conforming building, dwelling or structure, it shall
not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming building, dwelling or
structure.
(f) If a Nonconforming building, dwelling or structure is
damaged by fire, explosion, flood or act of God by two-thirds (2/3) or more
of its fair market value, a new building, dwelling or structure may be
built on the lot if built to meet all bulk standards and other requirements
of the zoning district in which the building, dwelling or structure is
located, provided however, that if such a damaged or destroyed building,
dwelling or structure is located in the floodplain it may only be rebuilt if
(i) it meets the minimum bulk standards of the district and (ii) it meets
all the resource protection standards set forth in Article VI. If the
dwelling is located in the floodway it can be rebuilt upon or within the
existing foundation limits provided the lowest floor elevation must be
three feet (3') above the base flood elevation.
(g) If a Nonconforming building, dwelling or structure is
damaged by fire, explosion, flood or act of God to the extent of less than
two-thirds (2/3) of its fair market value it may be reconstructed and used
as before any such calamity. Such reconstruction shall be commenced
within twelve (12) months of such calamity and shall be diligently
prosecuted to its completion.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-65
(h) In the event that there is a dispute as to the extent of the
damage to the fair value of the building, dwelling or structure, these
values shall be determined by the average of the estimates of damage and
valuation based upon the cost of restoration as furnished by three (3)
independent qualified contractors: one of whom shall be selected by the
owner; one of whom shall be selected by the board of zoning appeals; the
third shall be selected by the first two mentioned contractors. Such
estimates and valuations shall be independent of the value of the land on
which such nonconforming building, dwelling or structure is located.
7.03. Nonconforming lots.
(a) Any lot of record, by deed or plat, as of the controlling date
having less area than that required by the terms of this zoning ordinance,
may be used as a building lot.
(b) Lots of record as of the controlling date having a minimum
area of one (1) acre or those lots approved under the Residential A1 and
A1P zoning previously repealed on April 9, 1987 shall all be considered
conforming lots in terms of their area. Where the subdivision plats show
front, side, and rear yard lines, those lines shall regulate the development
of those lots rather than the standards set forth in Article IV of this
zoning ordinance. Where no yard lines are shown on the subdivision plat,
then the standards set forth on Table 4.02 for the NC1 and NC2
One-Family Dwelling uses shall control and the minimum front yard set

7.05. Specific limitations on the term "expand" and the power and
authority of the board of zoning appeals. The term "expand" as used in this
Article VIII shall never be interpreted by the board of zoning appeals or by any
applicant or owner (an "applicant") of any nonconforming building, dwelling,
structure or use (herein a "nonconformity") as vesting in any said applicant any
absolute right of any nature whatsoever. By filing an application to expand a
nonconformity, said applicant shall be deemed to have waived any such claim,
and the applicant shall at all times be subject to the final determination of the
board of zoning appeals, and the criteria and limitations set forth herein on
which the board of zoning appeals may in its sole and absolute discretion
approve or deny any application to expand any nonconformity. In addition, the
board of zoning appeals may condition its approval upon the applicant's
compliance with conditions reasonably necessary to screen adjacent lots and the
surrounding neighborhood from the nonconformity and to protect the public
health, safety, and general welfare. If the board of zoning appeals conditions its
approval upon certain conditions precedent, the board shall make a factual
finding in writing that there is a reasonable relationship between the required
conditions and the effects of the proposed expansion. The determination of the
board of zoning appeals to approve or deny any such application and any
conditions to any approval to expand a nonconformity shall be final.
7.06. Standards and considerations to be employed by board of
zoning appeals. Whenever the city manager shall refer a building permit
application to the board of zoning appeals for review and approval, the board of
zoning appeals which may, although it is not required to do so, the matter being
within the sole and exclusive discretion of the board of zoning appeals, grant or
deny the application or applications depending upon the board's analysis of the
application or applications, based upon the following standards and conditions
and in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures of the board of
zoning appeals, as such may be adopted from time to time:
(i) Size, topography and elevation of the lot;
(ii) Location of any building, dwelling, structure, parking area
or other use on the lot;
(iii) The height, bulk and composition of any building, dwelling,
structure, parking area or other use on the lot;
(iv) The proportionality of any building, dwelling, structure,
parking area or other use to any adjacent building, dwelling, structure,
parking area or other use on any adjoining lots in the immediate vicinity;
(v) The visual impact on adjoining lots or on lots in the
immediate vicinity; and
(vi) A determination that the altered, changed or expanded use
is in the best interest of, and promotes the public health, safety,
convenience, order, prosperity and general welfare of the city and of the
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-67
specific area in which the use is located. (as added by Ord. #2011-196,

thereof, by following the procedures set forth herein below:
(a) Applications.
(i) Applications for the change of any text, zoning map,
district boundaries or classification of property, as shown on the
zoning map, shall be submitted to the city manager, who shall
distribute such applications to the planning commission and the
board of commissioners. The city manager shall administer the
required public notice procedures.
(ii) Applications shall be on such forms, and shall be
accompanied by such data and information, as may be prescribed
for that purpose by the planning commission, so as to assure the
fullest practicable presentation of facts for the permanent record.
(b) Planning commission public hearing. Before submitting
its recommendations on a proposed amendment to the board of
commissioners, the planning commission shall hold at least one (1) public
hearing thereon. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing shall
be given at least ten (10) days prior to that date, and the notice shall be
given in one (1) publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the
city. If the application is for a zoning map amendment affecting one (1)
particular piece of property, notice of each hearing shall be given to all
adjacent property owners (taken from the most recent tax rolls) by
placing the notice in the United States mail at least ten (10) days before
the date of the hearing. Also, a sign, in a form required by the city
manager, providing notice of the time, place and subject of the proposed
amendment shall be posted on the property by the city in a location easily
visible from the road at least ten (10) days prior to the public hearing.
(c) Planning commission recommendation. The planning
commission shall recommend approval or disapproval of the proposed
amendment and shall report its recommendations to the board of
commissioners.
(d) Board of commissioners public hearing. Upon receiving
the planning commissions recommendations on a proposed amendment,
but before finally adopting or rejecting any ordinance concerning any
such amendment, the board of commissioners shall, in accord with its
procedures for the adoption of ordinances, hold a public hearing. Notice
of the time and place of the public hearing shall be given at least fifteen
(15) days prior to that date and the notice shall be given in one (1)
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. If a rezoning
of property is involved, notices shall be sent by the United States mail
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-72
and a sign, in a form required by the city manager pursuant to his
authority set forth in section 7.04 hereof, providing notice of the time,
place and subject of the proposed amendment shall be posted on the
property by the city at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing.
(e) Zoning ordinance text amendments. The approval of
zoning ordinance text amendments by the board of commissioners shall
be preceded by a finding that a change is needed for one (1) of the
following reasons:
(i) The use desired is not covered in the text of this
zoning ordinance but is acceptable because:
(1) The use proposed is in accordance with the
purpose and intent of the zoning district; and
(2) There are similar uses in the district; and
(3) The intensity of use proposed is consistent with
other uses in the district.
(ii) New conditions have arisen that have not been
addressed in this zoning ordinance. These new conditions must be
one (1) of the following:
(1) The city's comprehensive plan has been
amended, and the zoning ordinance needs to be brought into
conformity with the comprehensive plan.
(2) Changing conditions require new forms of
development or new procedures to meet these changing
needs.
(3) New methods of development or the provision
of infrastructure makes it necessary to alter the zoning
ordinance to meet these new conditions.
(4) Changing governmental finances requires
amending the text of this zoning ordinance to be in keeping
with the needs of government to provide and afford new
public services.
(iii) After experience with the zoning ordinance,
adjustments are needed, in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of
the board of commissioners pursuant to their legislative authority,
to achieve the desired objectives of the city.
(f) Zoning map amendments. The approval of zoning map
amendments by the board of commissioners shall be preceded by a
finding that a change is needed for one (1) of the following reasons:
(i) The comprehensive plan has been amended and the
zoning map needs to be brought into conformance with the revised
plan; or
(ii) A mistake was made on the original zoning map; or
(iii) Conditions have changed making the location sought
to be rezoned favorable for the proposed zoning change; or
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-73
(iv) After experience with the zoning map, adjustments
are needed, in the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the board of
commissioners pursuant to their legislative authority, to achieve
the desired objectives of the city.
(g) Decisions. After holding the public hearing, the board of
commissioners shall consider the recommendations of the planning
commission and vote to adopt or reject the proposed amendment. If
adopted, the ordinance concerning the proposed amendment shall become
effective on the date said ordinance receives a favorable vote of a majority
of the members of the board of commissioners.
(h) Failure to notify. The intention of this section 9.03 is to
provide due notice of proposed zoning map changes to all persons who
may be interested in or affected by the changes. However, failure to notify
property owners by United States mail due to an error in records or any
other circumstance shall not invalidate any recommendation of the
planning commission or action of the board of commissioners provided
that such failure was not intentional.
(i) Repeat applications. Whenever any application for an
amendment or change of the zoning map has been denied by the board of
commissioners or withdrawn, no new petition covering the same property,
the same property plus any additional property, or a portion of the same
property, can be filed with or considered by the board of commissioners
until one (1) year has elapsed from the date of the filing of a previous
petition. (as added by Ord. # 2011-196, Jan. 2012, and replaced by

14-302. Definitions.
14-303. General provisions.
14-304. Administration.
14-305. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
14-306. Variance procedures.
14-307. Legal status provisions.
14-301. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and
objectives. (1) Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of
Tennessee has in Tennessee Code Annotated, §§ 13-7-201 through 13-7-210,
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee, Board of
Commissioners does ordain as follows:
(2) Findings of fact. (a) The City of Forest Hills Board of
Commissioners wishes to establish eligibility in the National Flood
Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the requirements of
60.3 of the Federal Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44
CFR ch. 1 (10-1-04 edition).
(b) Areas of Forest Hills are subject to periodic inundation that
could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
(c) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or
construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This chapter is designed
to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to water or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;
14-86
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers that are involved in the
accommodation floodwaters;
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development
which may increase flood damage or erosion; and
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.
(4) Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
(a) To protect human life, health and property;
(b) To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood
control projects;
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated
with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(d) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodable areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize blight in flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a floodable area; and
(h) To establish eligibility for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program. (Ord. #07-174, April 2007)

Program for the state.
(51) "Structure," for purposes of this section, means a walled and roofed
building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid
storage tank, or other man-made facilities or infrastructures.
(52) "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
(53) "Substantial improvement" means any repairs, reconstruction's,
rehabilitations, additions, alterations or other improvements to a structure,
taking place during a five (5) year period, in which the cumulative cost equals
or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. The market value of the structure
should be (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial
repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure
prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed.
For the purpose of this definition, "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include
either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
have been pre-identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the
minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions and not solely triggered by
an improvement or repair project or; (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure,"
provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a "historic structure."
(54) "Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter
which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter
where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
14-93
(55) "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.
A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(56) "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where
specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of
riverine areas. (Ord. #07-174, April 2007)
14-303. General provisions. (1) Application. This chapter shall apply
to all areas within the incorporated area of Forest Hills, Tennessee.
(2) Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas
of special flood hazard identified on the Forest Hills, Tennessee, Federal
Emergency Management Agency, Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), Community Panel Numbers 47037C0317 F,
47037C0328 F, 47037C0329 F, 47037C0333 F, 47037C0336 F, and 47037C0337
F, dated, April 20, 2001, along with all supporting technical data, are adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
(3) District established as overlay. There is hereby established a flood
plain district within the City of Forest Hills. The boundaries of this district shall
correspond to the areas of special flood hazard identified on the City of Forest
Hills, Tennessee, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and Flood Insurance Rate Map, as defined in subsection (2), Basis
for establishing the areas of special flood hazard, above. The flood plain district
shall overlay other zoning districts within the boundaries of such district as
identified herein. Within the flood plain district, the provisions of section 502 of
the City of Forest Hills Zoning Ordinance shall apply in addition to provisions
established for the underlying district(s).
(4) Requirement for development permit. A development permit shall
be required in conformity with this chapter prior to the commencement of any
development activities.
(5) Compliance. No land, structure or use shall hereafter be located,
extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
(6) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter conflicts or overlaps with another
regulatory instrument, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall
prevail.
(7) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements; (2)
liberally construed in favor of the governing body, and; (3) deemed neither to
limit nor repeal any other powers granted under Tennessee statutes.
14-94
(8) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Forest
Hills, Tennessee or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that
result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
(9) Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance
shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as other misdemeanors as provided
by law. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense.
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee from
taking such other lawful actions to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. #07-174, April 2007)
14-304. Administration. (1) Designation of ordinance administrator.
The city manager is hereby appointed as the administrator to implement the
provisions of this chapter.
(2) Permit procedures. Application for a development permit shall be
made to the administrator on forms furnished by the community prior to any
development activities. The development permit may include, but is not limited
to the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale and showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, earthen fill placement, storage of materials or equipment, and
drainage facilities. Specifically, the following information is required:
(a) Application stage. (i) Elevation in relation to mean-sea-level
of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, of all buildings
where BFEs are available, or to the highest adjacent grade when
applicable under this chapter.
(ii) Elevation in relation to mean-sea-level to which any
non-residential building will be floodproofed where BFEs are
available, or to the highest adjacent grade when applicable under
this chapter.
(iii) Design certificate from a registered professional
engineer or architect that the proposed non-residential
floodproofed building will meet the floodproofing criteria in
§ 14-304(2).
(iv) Description of the extent to which any watercourse
will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development.
14-95
(b) Construction stage. Within unnumbered A Zones, where
flood elevation data are not available, the administrator shall record the
elevation of the lowest floor on the development permit. The elevation of
the lowest floor shall be determined as the measurement of the lowest
floor of the building relative to the highest adjacent grade.
For all new construction and substantial improvements, the permit
holder shall provide to the administrator an as-built certification of the
regulatory floor elevation or floodproofing level upon the completion of the
lowest floor or floodproofing. Within unnumbered A Zones, where flood
elevation data is not available, the elevation of the lowest floor shall be
determined as the measurement of the lowest floor of the building
relative to the highest adjacent grade.
Any lowest floor certification made relative to mean-sea-level shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land
surveyor and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a
non-residential building said certification shall be prepared by or under
the direct supervision of, a professional engineer or architect and certified
by same.
Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall
be at the permit holder's risk. The administrator shall review the
above-referenced certification data. Deficiencies detected by such review
shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further
work being allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or
failure to make said corrections required hereby, shall be cause to issue
a stop-work order for the project.
(3) Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the
administrator shall include, but not be limited to:
(a) Review of all development permits to assure that the permit
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, and that proposed
building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(b) Advice to permittee that additional federal or state permits
may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are
known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained
on file with the development permit. This shall include section 404 of the
Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 USC 1334.
(c) Notification to adjacent communities and the Tennessee
Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning
Assistance Office, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse,
and submission of evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(d) For any altered or relocated watercourse, submit
engineering data/analysis within six (6) months to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to ensure accuracy of community flood
maps through the letter of map revision process. Assure that the flood
14-96
carrying capacity within an altered or relocated portion of any
watercourse is maintained.
(e) Record the elevation, in relation to mean-sea-level or the
highest adjacent grade, where applicable of the lowest floor including
basement of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance
with § 14-304(2).
(f) Record the actual elevation; in relation to mean-sea-level or
the highest adjacent grade, where applicable to which the new or
substantially improved buildings have been floodproofed, in accordance
with § 14-304(2).
(g) When floodproofing is utilized for a structure, the
Administrator shall obtain certification of design criteria from a
registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with
§ 14-304(2).
(h) Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions) the administrator shall make the necessary interpretation.
Any person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this
chapter.
(i) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other
sources, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as
criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development in Zone A, on the community FIRM, meet the
requirements of this chapter.
Within unnumbered A Zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-302, of this chapter). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-304(2).
(j) All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall
be maintained in the office of the administrator and shall be open for
public inspection. Permits issued under the provisions of this chapter
shall be maintained in a separate file or marked for expedited retrieval
within combined files. (Ord. #07-174, April 2007)
14-305. Provisions for flood hazard reduction. (1) General
standards. In all flood prone areas the following provisions are required:
14-97
(a) New construction and substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral
movement of the structure;
(b) New construction and substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment
resistant to flood damage;
(c) New construction or substantial improvements to existing
buildings shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize
flood damage;
(d) All electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding;
(e) New and replacement water supply systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
system;
(f) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the
systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters;
(g) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and
constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them
during flooding;
(h) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this chapter;
and,
(i) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a
building that is not in compliance with the provision of this chapter, shall
be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not further extended or
replaced.
(2) Specific standards. These provisions shall apply to all areas of
special flood hazard as provided herein:
(a) Residential construction. Where base flood elevation data is
available, new construction or substantial improvement of any residential
building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated no lower than one foot (1') above the base flood
elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic
forces on both sides of exterior walls and to ensure unimpeded movement
of floodwater shall be provided in accordance with the standards of § 14-
305(2).
Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
Administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
14-98
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-302, of this chapter). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-304(2).
(b) Non-residential construction. New construction or
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or
non-residential building, when BFE data is available, shall have the
lowest floor, including basement, elevated or floodproofed no lower than
one foot (1') above the level of the base flood elevation.
Within unnumbered A Zones, where base flood elevations have not
been established and where alternative data is not available, the
administrator shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated
or floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest
adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in
§ 14-302, of this chapter). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-304(2).
Buildings located in all A Zones may be floodproofed, in lieu of
being elevated, provided that all areas of the building below the required
elevation are watertight, with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water, and are built with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects
of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall
provide such certification to the administrator as set forth in § 14-304(2).
(c) Elevated building. All new construction or substantial
improvements to existing buildings that include any fully enclosed areas
formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood
elevation, or required height above the highest adjacent grade, shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the
entry and exit of flood waters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls.
(i) Designs for complying with this requirement must
either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet
the following minimum criteria.
(A) Provide a minimum of two openings having a
total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every
square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
(B) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher
than one foot (1') above the finish grade; and
(C) Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they
permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions.
14-99
(ii) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the
premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the elevated living
area (stairway or elevator); and
(iii) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be
partitioned or finished into separate rooms in such a way as to
impede the movement of floodwaters and all such petitions shall
comply with the provisions of § 14-305(2) of this chapter.
(d) Standards for recreational vehicles. All recreational vehicles
placed on identified flood hazard sites must either:
(i) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred-eighty (180)
consecutive days;
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. (A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its
wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached structures or additions.
(iii) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and
elevation requirements of this section above if on the site for longer
than one hundred-eighty (180) consecutive days.
(e) Standards for subdivisions. Subdivisions and other proposed
new developments shall be reviewed to determine whether such proposals
will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a subdivision proposal or other
proposed new development is in a flood prone area, any such proposals
shall be reviewed to ensure that:
(i) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.
(ii) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
(iii) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate
drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(iv) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
fifty (50) lots and/or five (5) acres in area.
(3) Standards for areas of special flood hazard with established base
flood elevations and with floodways designated. Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in § 14-303(2), are areas designated as
floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity
of floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain
free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without
14-100
increased flood heights and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall
apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
developments within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not result in any increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood level, velocities or floodway widths during the occurrence
of a base flood discharge at any point within the community. A registered
professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and
certification thereof.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of
§ 14-305.
(4) Standards for areas of special flood hazard zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located
within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-303(2), where
streams exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated, (Zones AE) the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new structures
or substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special flood
hazard, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community. The
engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction or substantial improvements of buildings
shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance
with § 14-305(2).
(5) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations or
floodways (A Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established
in § 14-303, where streams exist, but no base flood data has been provided (A
Zones), or where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
shall apply:
(a) When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not
been provided in accordance with § 14-303, then the administrator shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other
source, in order to administer the provisions of § 14-305. Only if data is
14-101
not available from these sources, then the following provisions (b & c)
shall apply:
(b) No encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank,
unless certification by registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will
not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot (1') at any point within the community. The engineering certification
should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard
hydraulic engineering principles.
(c) In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation
data, new construction or substantial improvements of existing shall have
the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated
no less than three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade at the
building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements
of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards of
§ 14-305(2), and "elevated buildings."
(6) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-303(2), are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (l'-3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above the flood depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), in feet, above
the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated, at least three feet (3')
above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the
unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance
with standards of § 14-305(2), and "elevated buildings."
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at
least one foot (1') above the specified FIRM flood level, with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be floodproofed to at
least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A registered
14-102
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this ordinance and shall provide
such certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required
in § 14-304(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(d) The administrator shall certify the elevation or the highest
adjacent grade, where applicable, and the record shall become a
permanent part of the permit file.
(7) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in § 14-303,
are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but
where base flood elevations and flood hazard factors have not been determined.
Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 14-304, and 14-305(1), shall
apply.
(8) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the City of Forest
Hills, Tennessee are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are
neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams the following
provisions shall apply:
(a) In areas adjacent to such unmapped streams, no
encroachments including fill material or structures shall be located
within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream,
measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point
within the locality.
(b) When new elevation data is available, new construction or
substantial improvements of buildings shall be elevated or floodproofed
to elevations established in accordance with § 14-304. (Ord. #07-174,
April 2007)
14-306. Variance procedures. The provisions of this section shall apply
exclusively to areas of special flood hazard within the City of Forest Hills,
Tennessee.
(1) Board of zoning appeals.
(a) The City of Forest Hills Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of
this chapter.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures (see definition) upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
14-103
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the
minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
(c) In passing upon such applications, the board of zoning
appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(i) The danger that materials may be swept onto other
property to the injury of others;
(ii) The danger to life and property due to flooding or
erosion;
(iii) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage;
(iv) The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the community;
(v) The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location,
in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
(vi) The availability of alternative locations, not subject
to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
(vii) The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that
area;
(viii) The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(ix) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise
and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site, and;
(x) The costs of providing governmental services during
and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and
water systems, and streets and bridges.
(d) Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the
purposes of this chapter, the board of zoning appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to effectuate
the purposes of this chapter.
(e) Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building,
a determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary so as
not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
14-104
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
chapters.
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.
(d) The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency upon request. (Ord. #07-174, April 2007)
14-307. Legal status provisions. (1) Conflict with other ordinances. In
case of conflict between this chapter or any part thereof, and the whole or part
of any existing or future ordinance of the City of Forest Hills, Tennessee, the
most restrictive shall in all cases apply.
(2) Validity. If any section, clause, provision, or portion of this chapter
shall be held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any other section, clause, provision, or
portion of this chapter that is not of itself invalid or unconstitutional.

Forest Hills adopts as its stormwater design and best management
practices (BMP) manual the following publications, which are
incorporated by reference in this chapter as is fully set out herein (each
a "BMP Manual" and altogether the "BMP Manuals"):
(i) Tennessee Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook,
as published by TDEC.
(ii) TDEC Manual for Post Construction (also referred to
as "Guide to the Selection and Design of Stormwater Best
Management Practices (BMPS)").
(iii) Metro Nashville Stormwater Management Manual,
Volume 5--Low Impact Development, as published by the
Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-115
(b) These manuals include a list of acceptable BMPs including
the specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. These manuals may be
updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the City of
Forest Hills based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and
local maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will
be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
(2) General performance criteria for permanent stormwater quality
management. Unless granted a waiver or judged by the City of Forest Hills to
be exempt, the following performance criteria shall be addressed in the site
design for permanent stormwater management at all new and redevelopment
sites:
(a) The site design for all new and redevelopment sites shall
provide, in combination or alone, management measures (i.e., runoff
reduction measures of green infrastructure practices) that are designed,
build and maintain to infiltrate, evapotranspire, harvest and/or use, at a
minimum, the first inch of every rainfall event preceded by seventy-two
(72) hours of no measurable precipitation. This first inch of rainfall must
be one hundred percent (100%) managed onsite with no discharge to
streams or the city's drainage infrastructure.
(b) Pre-development soil types for the site and their infiltrative
capacity must be taken into account in the selection of RRM or GIP.
(c) The City of Forest Hills may approve alternative measures
to meet infiltration requirements in lieu of RRM or GIP to meet the
stated requirements, but shall be based on actual site limitations, which
may include, but are not limited to:
(i) Where a potential for introducing pollutants into the
groundwater exists, unless pretreatment is provided;
(ii) Where pre-existing soil contamination is present in
areas subject to contact with infiltrated runoff;
(iii) Where sinkholes or other karst features are shown to
exist;
(iv) Where there is a lack of land area availability onsite
to meet infiltration requirements.
(d) All site designs requiring a stormwater management plan
according to §14-504(1)(b)(i) of this chapter or as otherwise required by
the City of Forest Hills shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater
discharge associated with design storms specified in the City of Forest
Hills Subdivision Regulations and reduce the generation of post
construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels. These practices
should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking
lots, and landscaped areas to meet minimum performance criteria stated
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-116
in this section, and provide treatment for both water quality and
quantity.
(e) To protect stream channels from degradation, specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the BMP
manual.
(f) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive
resources (such as streams included on TDEC's 303(d) list) may be subject
to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict
certain stormwater management practices.
(g) Stormwater discharges into streams impaired by sediment
or into streams with an approved TMDL may be subject to additional
performance criteria.
(h) Stormwater discharges from "hot spots" may require the
application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention
practices.
(i) Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land
disturbance permits shall consult with the City of Forest Hills to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
(j) The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
BMP manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities. Other
hydrological methods of determining peak runoff may be substituted;
however, they will be subject to the City of Forest Hills' engineering
review for appropriateness.
(3) General performance criteria for permanent stormwater quality
management. (a) Stormwater designs shall meet the multi-stage storm
frequency storage requirements as identified in the subdivision
regulations unless the City of Forest Hills has granted the applicant a full
or partial waiver for particular BMP under § 14-506(6).
(b) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
City of Forest Hills may impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(4) Stormwater management plan requirements. The stormwater
management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the City of Forest
Hills to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the
potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and
future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the
measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. To
accomplish this goal the stormwater management plan shall include the
following:
(a) Topographic base map. Topographic base map of the site
which extends a minimum of one hundred feet (100') beyond the limits of

proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required;
(d) Calculations. Hydrologic and hydraulic design calculations
for the pre-development and post-development conditions for the design
storms specified in the subdivision regulations. These calculations must
show that the proposed stormwater management measures are capable
of controlling runoff from the site in compliance with this chapter, the
subdivision regulations, and the guidelines of the BMP Manual. The
stricter regulations shall govern. Such calculations shall include:
(i) A description of the design storm frequency, duration,
and intensity;
(ii) Time of concentration calculations;
(iii) Soil curve numbers or runoff coefficients including
assumed soil moisture conditions;
(iv) Peak runoff rates, method used along with basis for

based on on-site boring logs or soil pit profiles and soil survey reports.
The number and location of required soil borings or soil pits shall be
determined based on what is needed to determine the suitability and
distribution of soil types present at the location of the control measure.
(f) The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
City of Forest Hills that the proposed design will not lead to any of the
following conditions downstream:
(i) Deterioration of existing roadway or driveway
culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures;
(ii) Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
(iii) Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or
siltation;
(iv) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life
or property.
(g) Maintenance and repair plan. The design and planning of all
permanent stormwater management facilities shall include detailed
maintenance and repair procedures to ensure their continued

and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall be
included in the plan.
(5) Erosion prevention and sediment control plan requirements. The
Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control (EPSC) Plan shall accurately describe
the potential for soil erosion and sedimentation problems resulting from land
disturbing activity and shall explain and illustrate the measures that are to be
taken to control these problems. The length and complexity of the plan is to be
commensurate with the size of the project, severity of the site condition, and
potential for off-site damage. The plan shall be prepared by an individual who
has successfully completed the TDEC Level I training course or a Certified
Professional in Erosion and Sediment Control (CPESC). The plan shall address
all items on the EPSC Plan checklist. Failure to fully complete the EPSC
checklist could be considered an incomplete submittal and result in plan
disapproval. (as added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010, and amended by

14-506. Post-construction. (1) As-built plans. All applicants are
required to submit actual as-built plans for any structures located on-site after
final construction is completed. The plan must show the final design
specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be sealed by
a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in Tennessee. A final
inspection by the City of Forest Hills is required before any performance
security or performance bond will be released. The City of Forest Hills shall
have the discretion to adopt provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the
performance security or performance bond on the completion of various stages
of development. In addition, occupation permits shall not be granted until
corrections to all BMPs have been made and accepted by the City of Forest Hills.
(2) Landscaping and stabilization requirements. (a) Any area of land
from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or
wholly cleared by development activities shall be revegetated according
to a schedule approved by the City of Forest Hills.
(b) Stabilization measures shall be initiated as soon as possible
in portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or
permanently ceased. Temporary or permanent soil stabilization at the
construction site (or a phase of the project) must be completed no later
than fifteen (15) days after the construction activity in that portion of the
site has temporarily or permanently ceased. In the following situations,
temporary stabilization measures are not required:
(i) Where the initiation of stabilization measures is
precluded by snow cover or frozen ground conditions or adverse
soggy ground conditions, stabilization measures shall be initiated
as soon as practicable; or
(ii) Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth disturbing activities will be resumed
within fifteen (15) days.
(c) Permanent stabilization with perennial vegetation (using
native herbaceous and woody plants where practicable) or other
permanently stable, non-eroding surface shall replace any temporary
measures as soon as practicable. Unpacked gravel containing fines (silt
and clay sized particles) or crusher runs will not be considered a
non-eroding surface.
(d) The following minimum criteria shall apply to re-vegetation
efforts:
(i) Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial
cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its
equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time
as the cover crop is established over ninety percent (90%) of the
seeded area.
(ii) Replanting with native woody and herbaceous
vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-120
its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the
plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion.
(iii) Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a
minimum of seventy-five percent (75%) of the cover crop
throughout the year immediately following revegetation.
Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the
minimum seventy-five percent (75%) survival for one (1) year is
achieved.
(iv) Prior to releasing the performance bond, a permanent
ground cover must be established over the entire site.
(v) In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping
plan may be required to be submitted with the final design
describing the vegetative stabilization and management
techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This
plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after
construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of
vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to
ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved.
(3) Inspection of stormwater management facilities. Periodic
inspections of facilities shall be performed as provided for in § 14-504(7)(d).
(4) Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties
responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management
facility shall make records of the installation of the stormwater facility, and of
all maintenance and repairs to the facility, and shall retain the records for at
least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the City of Forest
Hills during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.
(5) Failure to meet or maintain design or maintenance standards. If
a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the design or maintenance standards
required for stormwater facilities under this chapter, the City of Forest Hills,
after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or
maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in
proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility
becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the City of Forest Hills shall
notify in writing the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater
management facility. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall
have ten (10) days to effect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved
manner. In the event that corrective action is not undertaken within that time,
the City of Forest Hills may take necessary corrective action. The cost of any
action by the City of Forest Hills under this section shall be charged to the
responsible party.
(6) Waivers. (a) General. Every applicant required to submit a
stormwater management plan as stated in § 14-504(1)(b)(i) or as

of Tennessee who will submit a sealed report of the inspection to
the City of Forest Hills, and that the cost of such inspections shall
be paid by the property owner. It shall also grant permission to the
city and its agents to enter the property at reasonable times and
to inspect the stormwater facility to ensure that it is being
properly maintained.
(iii) Provide that the minimum maintenance and repair
needs include, but are not limited to: the removal of silt, litter and
other debris, the cutting of grass, grass cuttings and vegetation
removal, and the replacement of landscape vegetation, in detention

property. (as added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010, and amended by
Ord. #2014-213, May 2014)
14-507. Adequate stormwater facilities. (1) Right of entry. The city
manager, or his designee, may enter upon any property which discharges or
contributes, or is believed to discharge or contribute, to stormwater runoff or the
stormwater system, stream(s), natural drainageway(s) or via any other private
or public stormwater management system during all reasonable hours to
monitor, remove foreign objects or blockages, and to inspect for compliance with
the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Inspection of stormwater facilities. The City of Forest Hills may,
to the extent authorized by state and federal law, establish inspection programs
to verify that all stormwater management facilities, including those built before
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-123
as well as after the adoption of this chapter, are functioning within design
limits. These inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations;
inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources
of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or
industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely
than the typical discharge to cause violations of the municipality's NPDES
stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other BMPs.
(3) Stormwater facilities. (a) Denuded areas must be vegetated or
covered under the standards and guidelines specified in the BMP manual
and on a schedule acceptable to the City of Forest Hills.
(i) Cuts and slopes must be properly covered with
appropriate vegetation and/or retaining walls constructed.
(ii) Drainage ways shall be properly covered in vegetation
or secured with rip-rap, channel lining, etc., to prevent erosion.
(iii) Trash, junk, rubbish, etc. shall be cleared from
drainage ways.

reasonable to prevent pollution of local waters.
(b) Requirements for existing problem locations. The City of
Forest Hills shall in writing notify the owners of existing locations and
developments of specific drainage, erosion or sediment problem affecting
such locations and developments, and the specific actions required to
correct those problems. The notice shall also specify a reasonable time for
compliance.
(c) Appeals. Corrective measures imposed by the city manager
under this section are subject to appeal under § 14-512 of this chapter. (as
added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010)
14-508. Illicit discharges. (1) Scope. This section shall apply to all
water generated on developed or undeveloped land entering the municipality's
separate storm sewer system.
(2) Prohibition of illicit discharges. No person shall introduce or cause
to be introduced into the municipal separate storm sewer system any discharge
that is not composed entirely of stormwater. The commencement, conduct or
continuance of any non-stormwater discharge to the municipal separate storm
sewer system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(a) Uncontaminated discharges from the following sources:
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-124
(i) Water line flushing or other potable water sources;
(ii) Landscape irrigation or lawn watering with potable

(b) Discharges specified in writing by the City of Forest Hills as
being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(c) Dye testing is an allowable discharge if the City of Forest
Hills has so specified in writing.
(3) Prohibition of illicit connections. (a) The construction, use,
maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the separate
municipal storm sewer system is prohibited.
(b) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
(4) Reduction of stormwater pollutants by the use of best management
practices. Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at the
person's expense, the BMPs necessary to prevent the further discharge of
pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all
terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of
stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall
be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section.
(5) Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law,
as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting in, or may result in, illicit
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the municipal separate
storm sewer system, the person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials the person shall immediately notify emergency
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-125
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the person shall notify the City
of Forest Hills in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the next
business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by
written notice addressed and mailed to the City of Forest Hills within three (3)
business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained
for at least three (3) years. (as added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010)
14-509. Water quality buffers. (1) Scope. A water quality buffer shall
be established, protected, and maintained along all community waters in areas
of new development and redevelopment for which a land disturbance permit, as
defined in § 14-504, is required. All water quality buffers shall be clearly marked
on site development plans, grading permit applications, plats, and/or concept
plans. "Community waters" means and includes:
(a) Intermittent and perennial streams (and their source
springs);
(b) Lakes and ponds with hydrologic connectivity (stream
leading into/out of the pond or obvious spring input;
(c) Wetlands that have been identified by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, TDEC, or City of Forest Hills or Metro staff; and
(d) Wet weather conveyances.
(2) Buffer widths. Widths shall be either

Stormwater Management Manual, Volume 1  Regulations, Section 6.9.2,
or
(b) The buffer shall measure twenty-five feet (25') perpendicular
from the top of bank on each side of the community water channel;
twenty-five feet (25') around the perimeter of a pond or lake identified as
a community water measured as perpendicular to the contour at which
normal pool is located around; and twenty-five feet (25') around the
perimeter of a wetland identified as a community water, whichever is
more restrictive.
(3) The water quality buffer is to remain undisturbed except for the
following disturbances which are allowed subject to approval of the city manager
including the approval of an erosion prevention and sediment control plan:
(a) Limited disturbances to remove and/or plant trees or
vegetation, as required to maintain the overall health of vegetation in the
buffer area.
(b) Removal of individual trees that are in danger of falling,
causing damage to dwellings or other structures, are dead or diseased, or
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-126
have been heavily damaged by storms. The root wad or stump should be
left in place, where feasible, to maintain soil stability.
(c) Disturbances necessary for the construction of utility access
areas and approved stream crossings as long as the crossings are
perpendicular or as near to perpendicular as possible to the channel.
(d) Disturbances as required to establish and/or restore buffer
areas in accordance with an approved buffer enhancement plan.
(4) Any approved disturbance of the water quality buffer shall be
revegetated in kind and/or enhanced subject to the requirements of
§ 14-506(2)(a) of this chapter and approval of the city manager. The vegetative
target for the inner zone is mature, moderately dense forest (i.e., trees) with
woody shrubs and understory vegetation. Where forest vegetation has the
potential to impact traffic safety or limit access, areas immediately surrounding
approved stream crossings and utility access areas may be vegetated with dense
grasses. (as added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010, and amended by
Ord. #2014-213, May 2014)
14-510. Enforcement. (1) Enforcement authority. The city manager or
his designees shall have the authority to issue notices of violation and citations,
to issue cease and desist orders, and to impose the civil penalties provided in
this section.
(2) Notification of violation. (a) Written notice. Whenever the city
manager finds that any permittee or any other person discharging
stormwater has violated or is violating this chapter or a permit or order
issued hereunder, the city manager may serve upon such person written
notice of the violation. Within ten (10) days of this notice, an explanation
of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the city
manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the discharger of
liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice
of violation.
(b) Consent orders. The city manager is empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
person to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified
by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders issued pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) below.
(c) Show cause hearing. The city manager may order any person
who violates this chapter or permit or order issued hereunder, to show
cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice
shall be served on the person specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such action,
and a request that the violator show cause why this proposed
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-127
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
(d) Compliance order. When the city manager finds that any
person has violated or continues to violate this chapter or a permit or
order issued there under, he may issue an order to the violator directing
that, following a specific time period, adequate structures, devices, be
installed or procedures implemented and properly operated. Orders may
also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary
and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the construction
of appropriate structures, installation of devices, self-monitoring, and
management practices.
(e) Cease and desist orders. When the city manager finds that
any person has violated or continues to violate this chapter or any permit
or order issued hereunder, the director may issue an order to cease and
desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:
(i) Comply forthwith; or
(ii) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action
as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and terminating the
discharge.
(3) Conflicting standards. Whenever there is a conflict between any
standard contained in this chapter and in the BMP manual adopted by the
municipality under this chapter, the strictest standard shall prevail. (as added
by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010)
14-511. Penalties. (1) Violations. Any person who shall commit any act
declared unlawful under this chapter, who violates any provision of this chapter,
who violates the provisions of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter, or
who fails or refuses to comply with any lawful communication or notice to abate
or take corrective action by the City of Forest Hills, shall be guilty of a civil
offense.
(2) Penalties. Under the authority provided in Tennessee Code
Annotated, § 68-221-1106, the municipality declares that any person violating
the provisions of this chapter may be assessed a civil penalty by the City of
Forest Hills of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) and not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or such lesser amount as may be allowed by law per
day for each day of violation. Each day of violation shall constitute a separate
violation.
(3) Measuring civil penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the city
manager may consider:
(a) The harm done to the public health or the environment;
(b) Whether the civil penalty imposed will be a substantial
economic deterrent to the illegal activity;
Change 3, June 19, 2015 14-128
(c) The economic benefit gained by the violator;
(d) The amount of effort put forth by the violator to remedy this
violation;
(e) Any unusual or extraordinary enforcement costs incurred by
the municipality;
(f) The amount of penalty established by chapter or resolution
for specific categories of violations; and
(g) Any equities of the situation which outweigh the benefit of
imposing any penalty or damage assessment.
(4) Recovery of damages and costs. In addition to the civil penalty in
subsection (2) above, the municipality may recover:
(a) All damages proximately caused by the violator to the
municipality, which may include any reasonable expenses incurred in
investigating violations of, and enforcing compliance with, this chapter,
or any other actual damages caused by the violation; and
(b) The costs of the municipality's maintenance of stormwater
facilities when the user of such facilities fails to maintain them as
required by this chapter.
(5) Other remedies. The municipality may bring legal action to enjoin
the continuing violation of this chapter, and the existence of any other remedy,
at law or equity, shall be no defense to any such actions.
(6) Remedies cumulative. The remedies set forth in this section shall
be cumulative, not exclusive, and it shall not be a defense to any action, civil or
criminal, that one (1) or more of the remedies set forth herein has been sought
or granted. (as added by Ord. #2010-189, June 2010)
14-512. Appeals. Pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 68-221-1106(d), any person aggrieved by the imposition of a civil penalty or
damage assessment as provided by this chapter may appeal said penalty or
damage assessment to the municipality's governing body.

16-101. Excavations.
16-102. Miscellaneous.
16-103. Parking.
16-104. Violation and penalty.
16-101. Excavations. (1) Permit required. It shall be unlawful for any
person, firm, corporation, association, or others, including utility districts, to
make any excavation in any street, alley, or public place, or to tunnel under any
street, alley, or public place without having first obtained a permit as herein
required, and without complying with the provisions of this chapter; and it shall
also be unlawful to violate, or vary from, the terms of any such permit; provided,
however, any person maintaining pipes, lines, or other underground facilities in
or under the surface of any street may proceed with an opening without a permit
when emergency circumstances demand the work to be done immediately and
a permit cannot reasonably and practicably be obtained beforehand. The person
shall thereafter apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which the
office of the city manager is open for business, and the permit shall be
retroactive to the date when the work was begun.
(2) Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to the
city manager, or such person as he may designate to receive such applications,
and shall state thereon the location of the intended excavation or tunnel, the
size thereof, the purpose thereof, the person, firm, corporation, association, or
others doing the actual excavating, the name of the person, firm, corporation,
association, or others for whom the work is being done, and shall contain an
agreement that the applicant will comply with all ordinances and laws relating
to the work to be done. Such application shall be rejected or approved by the city
manager within two (2) business days of its filing.
(3) Fee. The fee for such permits shall be as set forth in a resolution
adopted by the board of commissioners.
(4) Deposit or bond. (a) No such permit shall be issued unless and
until the applicant therefor has deposited with the city manager a cash
deposit. The deposit shall be in the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00)
Change 2, April 19, 2012 16-2
if no pavement is involved or one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) if the
excavation is in a paved area and shall insure the proper restoration of
the ground and laying of the pavement, if any. Where the amount of the
deposit is clearly inadequate to cover the cost of restoration, the city
manager may increase the amount of the deposit to an amount considered
by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From this deposit shall be
deducted the expense to the city of relaying the surface of the ground or
pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the city or at its
expense. The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest
after the tunnel or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or
pavement is restored.
(b) In lieu of a deposit the applicant may deposit with the city
manager a surety bond in such form and amount as the city manager
shall deem adequate to cover the costs to the city if the applicant fails to
make proper restoration; and an applicant may deposit with the city
manager an annual surety bond in the amount of two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500.00) (or such other sum as the city manager
deems reasonable and necessary) to cover more than one (1) permit.
(5) Safety restrictions on excavations. Any person, firm, corporation,
association, or others making any excavation or tunnel shall do so according to
the terms and conditions of the application and permit authorizing the work to
be done. Sufficient and proper barricades and lights shall be maintained to
protect persons and property from injury by or because of the excavation being
made. If any sidewalk is blocked by any such work, a temporary sidewalk shall

favorable for planting as determined by the city arborist. All replacement trees
shall be subject to inspection by the city arborist. The planning commission may
require that a bond be posted to insure compliance with this requirement when
approving a site plan for a nonresidential development or a final flat for a
subdivision. (Ord. #93-134, Aug. 1993)
20-108. Hazard trees. (1) Trees standing on public land or standing on
private land adjacent to any public land that are designated hazard trees by the
city arborist may be removed or repaired if the city manager determines the
removal or repair is necessary to protect the public health and safety. If the
hazard tree is on private land, the city manager may notify the owner of the
private land in writing of said risk and request the removal or repair of the
hazard tree within a prescribed period of time.
(2) If the owner of the private land does not remove or repair the
hazard tree within the prescribed time, then the city manager shall have the
authority to enter upon the private land and remove or repair the hazard tree.
The cost of removal or repair including stump removal to below ground level
may be charged against the owner. (Ord. #93-134, Aug. 1993)
20-109. Tree maintenance. (1) Tree topping is strongly discouraged as
a tree care practice for any trees in the city.
(2) The practice of tree topping is prohibited on all public trees unless
specifically approved by the city arborist.
(3) The standard tree pruning method for public trees will be branch
collar pruning or other approved pruning methods established by the National
Association of Arborists.
(4) Tree pruning in the vicinity of public utility lines shall be
undertaken by the utility responsible for maintaining those lines. The pruning
methods undertaken by the utility shall be consistent with those indicated
herein. The city manager shall be notified by the utility two (2) weeks in
advance of proposed scheduled maintenance and the city manager shall notify
the city arborist of the proposed maintenance. Where possible, under overhead
lines, the utility shall undertake a program of replacing canopy trees which have
undergone tree topping with understory trees which have a maturity height of
not more than twenty (20) feet or as approved by the city arborist.
20-7
(5) All individuals and/or firms conducting tree maintenance and
removal activities for public trees or hazard trees which affect public lands shall

compensation coverage. Additionally, those individuals and/or firms conducting
tree maintenance activities for public trees or hazard trees which affect public
land shall have received certification by the International Society of
Arboriculture by satisfactory completion of the national exam. (Ord. #93-134,
Aug. 1993)

spend more than $500, and candidates for other offices that pay at least $100 a
month are required to file campaign financial disclosure reports. Civil penalties
of $25 per day are authorized for late filings. Penalties up to the greater of
$10,000 or 15 percent of the amount in controversy may be levied for filings
more than 35 days late. It is a Class E felony for a multicandidate political
campaign committee with a prior assessment record to intentionally fail to file
a required campaign financial report. Further, the treasurer of such a committee
may be personally liable for any penalty levied by the Registry of Election
Finance (T.C.A. § 2-10-101118).
Contributions to political campaigns for municipal candidates are limited to:
a. $1,000 from any person (including corporations and other
organizations);
b. $5,000 from a multicandidate political campaign committee;
c. $20,000 from the candidate;
d. $20,000 from a political party; and
e. $75,000 from multicandidate political campaign committees.
The Registry of Election Finance may impose a maximum penalty of $10,000 or
115 percent of the amount of all contributions made or accepted in excess of
these limits, whichever is greater (T.C.A. § 2-10-301310).
Each candidate for local public office must prepare a report of contributions that
includes the receipt date of each contribution and a political campaign
committees statement indicating the date of each expenditure (T.C.A.
§ 2-10-105, 107).
Candidates are prohibited from converting leftover campaign funds to personal
use. The funds must be returned to contributors, put in the volunteer public
education trust fund, or transferred to another political campaign fund, a
political party, a charitable or civic organization, educational institution, or an
organization described in 26 U.S.C. 170(c) (T.C.A. § 2-10-114).
2. Conflicts of Interest.
Municipal officers and employees are permitted to have an indirect interest in
contracts with their municipality if the officers or employees publicly
APP-A-2
acknowledge their interest. An indirect interest is any interest that is not
direct, except it includes a direct interest if the officer is the only supplier of
goods or services in a municipality. A direct interest is any contract with the
official himself or with any business of which the official is the sole proprietor,
a partner, or owner of the largest number of outstanding shares held by any
individual or corporation. Except as noted, direct interests are absolutely
prohibited (T.C.A. § 6-2-402, T.C.A. § 6-20-205, T.C.A. § 6-54-107108,
T.C.A. § 12-4-101102).
3. Disclosure conflict of interests.
Conflict of interest disclosure reports by any candidate or appointee to a local
public office are required under T.C.A. §§ 8-50-501 et seq. Detailed financial
information is required, including the names of corporations or organizations in
which the official or one immediate family member has an investment of over
$10,000 or 5 percent of the total capital. This must be filed no later than 30 days
after the last day legally allowed for qualifying as a candidate. As long as an
elected official holds office, he or she must file an amended statement with the
Tennessee Ethics Commission or inform that office in writing that an amended
statement is not necessary because nothing has changed. The amended
statement must be filed no later than January 31 of each year
(T.C.A. § 8-50-504).
4. Consulting fee prohibition for elected municipal officials.
Any member or member-elect of a municipal governing body is prohibited under
T.C.A. § 2-10-124 from knowingly receiving any form of compensation for
consulting services other than compensation paid by the state, county, or
municipality. Violations are punishable as Class C felonies if the conduct
constitutes bribery under T.C.A. § 39-16-102. Other violations are prosecuted
as Class A misdemeanors. A conviction under either statute disqualifies the
offender from holding any office under the laws or Constitution of the State of
Tennessee.
Consulting services under T.C.A. § 2-10-122 means services to advise or assist
a person or entity in influencing legislative or administrative action, as that
term is defined in § 3-6-301, relative to the municipality or county represented
by that official. Consulting services also means services to advise or assist a
person or entity in maintaining, applying for, soliciting or entering into a
contract with the municipality represented by that official. "Consulting
services" does not mean the practice or business of law in connection with
representation of clients by a licensed attorney in a contested case action,
administrative proceeding or rule making procedure;
APP-A-3
"Compensation" does not include an honorarium under T.C.A. § 2-10-116, or
certain gifts under T.C.A. § 3-6-305(b), which are defined and prohibited under
those statutes.
The attorney general construes "Consulting services" to include advertising or
other informational services that directly promote specific legislation or
specifically target legislators or state executive officials. Advertising aimed at
the general public that does not promote or otherwise attempt to influence
specific legislative or administrative action is not prohibited. Op. Atty.Gen. No.
05-096, June 17, 2005.
5. Bribery offenses.
a. A person who is convicted of bribery of a public servant, as defined in
T.C.A. § 39-16-102, or a public servant who is convicted of accepting a bribe
under the statute, commits a Class B felony.
b. Under T.C.A. § 39-16-103, a person convicted of bribery is disqualified
from ever holding office again in the state. Conviction while in office will not
end the persons term of office under this statute, but a person may be removed
from office pursuant to any law providing for removal or expulsion existing prior
to the conviction.
c. A public servant who requests a pecuniary benefit for performing an
act the person would have had to perform without the benefit or for a lesser fee,
may be convicted of a Class E felony for solicitation of unlawful compensation
under T.C.A. § 39-16-104.
d. A public servant convicted of buying and selling in regard to offices
under T.C.A. § 39-16-105, may be found guilty of a Class C felony. Offenses
under this statute relevant to public officials are selling, resigning, vacating, or
refusing to qualify and enter upon the duties of the office for pecuniary gain, or
entering into any kind of borrowing or selling for anything of value with regard
to the office.
e. Exceptions to 1, 3, and 4, above include lawful contributions to political
campaigns, and a trivial benefit that is incidental to personal, professional,
or business contacts in which there is no danger of undermining an officials
impartiality.
6. Official misconduct. official oppression, misuse of official information.
a. Public misconduct offenses under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-
401 through § 39-16-404 apply to officers, elected officials, employees,
APP-A-4
candidates for nomination or election to public office, and persons performing a
governmental function under claim of right even though not qualified to do so.
b. Official misconduct under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-402
pertains to acts related to a public servants office or employment committed
with an intent to obtain a benefit or to harm another. Acts constituting an
offense include the unauthorized exercise of official power, acts exceeding ones
official power, failure to perform a duty required by law, and receiving a benefit
not authorized by law. Offenses under this section constitute a Class E felony.
c. Under Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-403, Official oppression,
a public servant acting in an official capacity who intentionally arrests, detains,
frisks, etc., or intentionally prevents another from enjoying a right or privilege
commits a Class E felony.
d. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-404 prohibits a public servants use
of information attained in an official capacity, to attain a benefit or aid another
which has not been made public. Offenses under the section are Class B
misdemeanors.
e. A public servant convicted for any of the offenses summarized in
sections 2-4 above shall be removed from office or discharged from a position of
employment, in addition to the criminal penalties provided for each offense.
Additionally, an elected or appointed official is prohibited from holding another
appointed or elected office for ten (10) years. At-will employees convicted will
be discharged, but are not prohibited from working in public service for any
specific period. Subsequent employment is left to the discretion of the hiring
entity for those employees. Tennessee Code Annotated § 39-16-406.
7. Ouster law.
Some Tennessee city charters include ouster provisions, but the only general law
procedure for removing elected officials from office is judicial ouster. Cities are
entitled to use their municipal charter ouster provisions, or they may proceed
under state law.
The judicial ouster procedure applies to all officers, including people holding any
municipal office of trust or profit. (Note that it must be an office filled by an
officer, distinguished from an employee holding a position that does not
have the attributes of an office.) The statute makes any officer subject to such
removal who shall knowingly or willfully misconduct himself in office, or who
shall knowingly or willfully neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon such
officer by any of the laws of the state, or who shall in any public place be in a
state of intoxication produced by strong drink voluntarily taken, or who shall
APP-A-5
engage in any form of illegal gambling, or who shall commit any act constituting
a violation of any penal statute involving moral turpitude (T.C.A. § 8-47-101).
T.C.A. § 8-47-122(b) allows the taxing of costs and attorney fees against the
complainant in an ouster suit if the complaint subsequently is withdrawn or
deemed meritless. Similarly, after a final judgment in an ouster suit,
governments may order reimbursement of attorney fees to the officer targeted
in a failed ouster attempt
(T.C.A. § 8-47-121).
The local attorney general or city attorney has a legal duty to investigate a
written allegation that an officer has been guilty of any of the mentioned
offenses. If he or she finds that there is reasonable cause for such complaint, he
shall forthwith institute proceedings in the Circuit, Chancery, or Criminal Court
of the proper county. However, with respect to the city attorney, there may be
an irreconcilable conflict between that duty and the city attorneys duties to the
city, the mayor, and the rules of professional responsibility governing attorneys.
Also, an attorney general or city attorney may act on his or her own initiative
without a formal complaint (T.C.A. § 8-47-101102). The officer must be
removed from office if found guilty (T.C.A. § 8-47-120).

1. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
1.1 Title. These provisions will hereafter be known and cited as the "Subdivision Regulations of the City of Forest Hills."
1.2 Authority.
(a) Authority. These rules and regulations are adopted pursuant Tennessee Code Annotated Section 13-4-301 et seq. and in accordance with the Charter of the City of Forest Hills.
(b) Planning Commission has Met State Law. In the adoption of these Subdivision Regulations, the Planning Commission acts pursuant to the authority and powers granted by Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-101 through 13-4-310, as amended. Having adopted a Major Street Plan for the jurisdiction, a copy of which is filed in Instrument Number 20131216-0126854, Registers Office of Davidson County, Tennessee pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-302, and having held a public hearing on these regulations, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-303, the Planning Commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in State law as prerequisites to the adoption of these regulations.
(c) Enforcing Officer. It will be the duty of the City Manager of the City or his/her designated appointee to enforce these regulations and to bring to the attention of the City Attorney any violations or lack of compliance herewith.
1.3 Purpose. These regulations are intended to "provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs, for the coordination of streets within subdivisions with other existing or planned streets or with the plan of the municipality or of the region in which the municipality is located, for adequate open spaces for traffic, recreation, light and air, and for a distribution of population and traffic which will tend to create conditions favorable to health, safety, convenience and prosperity." Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-303.
1.4 Jurisdiction. These rules and regulations governing the subdivision of land will apply to the division of lands within the incorporated boundaries of the City of Forest Hills.
1.5 Interpretation. These regulations are intended to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the persons within this jurisdiction, and toward that purpose, these regulations will be liberally construed.
1.6 Severability. If any part or provision of these regulations or application thereof to any person or circumstance is adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment will be confined in its operation to the part, provision, or application directly involved in the controversy in which such judgment will have been rendered and will not affect or impair the validity of the remainder of these regulations or the application thereof to other persons or circumstances, and for such purpose, the provisions or any portion of the provisions in these regulations are considered severable. The Planning Commission hereby declares that it would
2
Adopted November 16, 2017
have enacted the remainder of these regulations even without any such part, provision, or application.
1.7 Savings Clause. These regulations will not be construed as abating any action now pending under or by virtue of previous Subdivision Regulations, or as discontinuing, abating, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue, or as affecting the liability of any person, or as waiving any right of the city under any section or provision existing at the time of adoption of these regulations, or as vacating or annulling any rights obtained by any person by lawful action of the city, except as expressly will be provided otherwise in these regulations.
1.8 Effective Date. The effective date of the Subdivision Regulations, as amended, is November 16, 2017. Any concept plan submitted after the effective date hereof, will comply with these Subdivision Regulations.
1.9 Amendments.
(a) Enactment. Before the adoption of any amendment to these regulations, a public hearing thereon will be held by the Planning Commission. Notice of the time and place of the public hearing will be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction.
(b) Codification and Distribution. Subsequent to the adoption of any amendment to these regulations, the approved provisions of such amendment will be incorporated into the text of these regulations with the effective date of any such subsequent amendment being set forth on the face of these Regulations below the original effective date hereof.
(c) Any necessary corrections to the Table of Contents, cross references and/or numbering of sections of these regulations required as a result of an amendment to these regulations, but not specifically called out at the time of the adoption of the amendment, may be made at any time and will not require formal action by the Planning Commission.
1.10 Variances.
(a) Generally. If the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, a variance from these regulations may be granted, provided that such variance will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations. The Planning Commission will make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case that:
(i) The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.
(ii) The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable generally to other property.
3
Adopted November 16, 2017
(iii) Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations were carried out.
(iv) The variance will not in any manner vary from the provisions of the adopted Comprehensive Plan, including its constituent elements, the Major Street Plan, or the Zoning Code for the City of Forest Hills.
(b) Procedures. An application for any such variance will be submitted in writing by the applicant along with the initial filing of the concept plan. The petition will state fully the grounds for the application and all of the facts upon which the applicant is relying.
(c) Conditions. In approving variances, the Planning Commission may impose such conditions as in its judgment will secure substantially the objectives, standards, and requirements of these regulations.
(d) Additional Findings. Certain Sections of the regulations may require additional findings to be made by the Planning Commission in order to permit variances.
2. PROCEDURES
2.1 Review Procedures. Before any land is subdivided, the owner of the property proposed to be subdivided, or an authorized agent, will, upon payment of applicable fees as determined by the Board of Commissioners, apply for and secure approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following procedures:
(a) Pre-Application Conference. Before preparing a Concept Plan or other plat of subdivision, each applicant must schedule and participate in a pre-application conference with a member of the citys planning staff to determine the scope of the proposed subdivision and possible issues related to the development of the land. The pre-application conference may be conducted in person or via telephonic or electronic conferencing. In addition, before proceeding to the Concept Plan step described below, an applicant may appear before the Planning Commission for an informal informational session during which conceptual aspects and potential challenges of a desired project and non-binding comments from the Planning Commission may be discussed to assist in preparing the Concept Plan to be filed for formal consideration by the Planning Commission. Statements and any other suggested comments or recommendations made by the Planning Commission during any informal informational session shall be absolutely non-binding upon the Planning Commission at such time as the applicant files the Concept Plan commencing the formal subdivision process.
(b) Concept Plan. The Concept Plan is the first step in the subdivision process. The purpose of the concept plan is to provide a master plan of subdivision to show street, lot, and open space layouts, public dedications, and reservations, if any, and proposed
4
Adopted November 16, 2017
environmental changes for Planning Commission approval prior to the preparation of engineered construction drawings for the subdivision.
(c) Preliminary Plat and Construction Plans. The Preliminary Plat is the second step in the subdivision process. The purpose of the Preliminary Plat is to permit a coordinated review of the various plan documents, construction plans, and grading plans related to the subdivision. These include, but are not limited to, roadway and sidewalk construction plans, storm water drainage construction plans, water and sewer construction plans, utility plans, and landscaping plans. This is to ensure proper placement of infrastructure, utility lines and boxes and to allow for mitigation measures such as screening walls and landscaping to ensure that the Preliminary Plat conforms to the approved Concept Plan and conditions.
(d) Final Plat of Subdivision. The Final Plat is the third and final step in the subdivision process. The purpose of the final plat is to show the applicants plan of the subdivision, which, if approved, may be submitted to the Register of Deeds for recording.
(e) Vested Rights. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-310(b), a vested property right shall be established for the applicable vesting period with respect to any property upon the approval by the City of a Preliminary Plat (a/k/a preliminary development plan under Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-310(b)) or the issuance by the City of a building permit allowing construction of a building or other improvement where there was no need for prior approval of a subdivision or development plan for the property on which that building or improvement will be constructed. During the applicable vesting period described in subsections (c) and (d) of Tenn. Code Ann. § 13-4-310, the locally adopted development standards which are in effect on the date of approval of the Concept Plan or the date of issuance of a building permit, shall remain the development standards applicable to that property or building during the vesting period.
(f) Zoning Changes. It is the intent of these regulations that the review of a Concept Plan, Preliminary Plat, or Final Plat may be carried out simultaneously with the review of a zone change application made under the Zoning Code. In addition to the application required for the requested zone change, an application for subdivision may be submitted for a coordinated review.
(g) Reserve Parcels. Small parcels not conforming in size or shape with all regulations will not be platted, except to consolidate same with a contiguous parcel(s) resulting in conformity with applicable zoning and regulations. All land within a tract proposed for subdivision will be incorporated in lots, lands held in common or as Open Space, or public rights-of-way.
2.2 Meeting Schedule and Submittal Deadlines. Prior to the beginning of each calendar year, the Planning Commission will set an annual meeting and applicable submittal deadline schedule based upon the recommendations of the City Manager and City staff. The Planning Commission may, however, cancel or re-schedule meetings if such scheduling is in the public interest and provided that the City provides adequate public notice of the schedule change
5
Adopted November 16, 2017
pursuant to the requirements of Section 2.7. All meetings will be held in the Forest Hills City Hall, unless an alternate site is needed due to circumstances beyond the control of the City. All applicants bear the responsibility of adhering to the submittal schedule established by the Planning Commission.
2.3 Approval of Concept Plans.
(a) Application Procedure and Requirements. Following a pre-application conference pursuant to Section 2.1(a), the owner of the land, or an authorized representative, may file an application for approval of a Concept Plan with the City. Each application for Concept Plan approval will:
(i) Be made on forms available from the City Manager and be accompanied by a fee as determined by the Board of Commissioners.
(ii) Be accompanied by four printed copies and one electronic copy of the Concept Plan and include all information described in the then current and effective Concept Plan Requirements on file and available at the offices of the City. For clarity, on file within these Regulations means available to the public upon request of said document which shall bear the effective date of same of the face of such document.
(iii) Be delivered to the City Manager in accordance with the adopted review schedule.
(b) Staff Review. The City Manager will initiate a review of the Concept Plan and any exhibits submitted in conformance with these regulations. No application will be accepted or forwarded to the Planning Commission for review and approval until all requirements of Section 2.3(a) above are satisfied. After the application is reviewed and deemed to be in compliance with all applicable regulations it will be placed on the next available regular meeting agenda of the Planning Commission. Once placed on agenda, the applicant will deliver additional paper copies as requested by the City Manager, but in no event more than fifteen, and one electronic copy of the Concept Plan to the City for distribution to members of the Planning Commission.
(c) Planning Commission Action. The Planning Commission will approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the Concept Plan. Following the public meeting, the City will send a letter to the owner of the property describing the Planning Commissions action, including stating any conditions to the approval, or reasons for disapproval, as the case may be.
(d) Planning Commission Discretion. If an approved Concept Plan is limited to a division of land involving corrective plats or the changes are ministerial or minor in nature and in furtherance of the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and Comprehensive Plan for the City, then the Planning Commission will have the discretion to allow the applicant to prepare a Final Plat in accordance with the then current and effective Final Plat Requirements on file and available at the offices of the City, and authorize the applicant to
6
Adopted November 16, 2017
bypass the Preliminary Plat step in the approval process and proceed directly to Final Plat review before the Planning Commission.
2.4 Approval of Preliminary Plats.

(i) Drainage systems will be designed to avoid concentration of flow from each lot onto adjacent lots.
(ii) The applicant will insure that all artesian ground waters of a permanent or temporary nature discovered during the subdivision planning, development and construction process will be intercepted and carried away to primary drainage conduits by swale ditches or in underground pipes on property line easements. Regardless of the location of property lines, intercept will be allowed at the point of artesian surfacing. The applicant will be obligated to perform this work upon evidence of any artesian water discovered during the planning, development, and construction phase of the subdivision.
(iii) Any sinkhole or any natural channel serving as a means of moving ground water into the subterranean system will be identified on the Final Plat and will be protected as approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation. All sinkholes in residential subdivisions will be platted as open space with such buffer area as may be required by the Planning Commission.
(c) Storm Water Facilities. Drainage facilities will be located in the road right-of-way, where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements.
(i) Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other drainage facility will in each case be large enough to accommodate potential run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision. The City Engineer will determine the necessary size of the facility. The developer will be responsible for upsizing cross-drains under existing streets due to relocation of existing drainage channels or increased run-off resulting from the subdivision.
(ii) Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision will be determined. Where it is anticipated that the additional run-off incident to the development of the subdivision will overload existing downstream drainage facilities, provisions should be made for improvement of such drainage facilities or inclusion of detention or retention facilities within the proposed development as determined by the City Engineer. Generally, the developer's responsibility for downstream improvements will not extend beyond the second downstream structure.
18
Adopted November 16, 2017
(d) Dedication of Drainage Easements.
(i) General Requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainageway, channel, or stream either natural or manmade, there will be provided a storm water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines of such watercourse and of such width and construction as will be adequate for the purpose. Consideration will also be given to incorporation of sewer easements parallel to or overlaying drainage easements as both generally follow the same course.
(ii) Drainage Easements.
(1) Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within a road right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width for such facilities will be provided across property outside the road right-of-way but within satisfactory access from a road. Easements will be indicated on the Concept Plan, the subdivision plat, and the Final Plat for the Subdivision. Drainage easements will be carried from roads to natural watercourses or to other drainage facilities.
(2) When a new drainage system is to be constructed which will transport water across adjacent private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage easement(s) will be secured and indicated on the plat by notes referencing the easement recording.
(3) The applicant will dedicate, when required by the Planning Commission either in fee or by drainage or conservation easement, the land on both sides of existing watercourses to a distance to be determined by the City Engineer, but not less than ten feet each side.
