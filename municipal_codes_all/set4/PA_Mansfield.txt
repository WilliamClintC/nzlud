PREFACE
The Borough of Mansfield has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative
change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were
necessary at the time of the establishment of the Borough, subsequent growth of the
community, together with the complexity of modem life, has created the need for new
and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the Borough. The
recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops
and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light
of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important
step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological
enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged
for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these
in mind that the Borough Council ordered the following codification of the Borough's
legislation.
Contents of Code
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general
and permanent nature enacted by the Borough Council of the Borough of Mansfield, including
revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the Borough
Council in the course of the codification.
Division of Code
The Code is divided into parts. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all Borough
legislation of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of
government, that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers
and employees of the municipal government and its departments. Part II, General
Legislation, contains all other Borough legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation
in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions, whereas those
in Part I do not.
Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters
The various items of legislation are organized into chapters, their order being an alphabetical
progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more items of
legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus,
for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be
found in Part II, in the chapter entitled "Streets and Sidewalks." In such chapters, use of
article or Part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation.
1 02 - 01 - 2011
MANSFIELD CODE
Table of Contents
The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a
means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation
have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several articles or
Parts are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the individual
item of legislation.
Histories
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter.
This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived,
including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number,
resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters
containing Parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of
each Part or article is indicated in the History. Amendments to individual sections or subsections
are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.
General References; Editor's Notes
In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General
References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's
Notes are used in the text to provide supplementary information and crossreferences
to related provisions in other chapters.
Appendix
Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main
body of the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or
their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of
this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community
may wish to include.
Disposition List
The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication
of the Code, indicating its inclusion in the Code or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition
List will be updated with each supplement to the Code to include the legislation
reviewed with said supplement.
Index
The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this Code will be used by persons
without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons
11 02 - 01 - 2011
PREFACE
to locate a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The
Index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to
the Code.
Instructions for Amending the Code
All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or complete new additions,
should be adopted as amending the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not
being substantively altered should not be renumbered. Where new sections are to be
added to a chapter, they can be added at the end of the existing material (continuing the
numbering sequence) or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a
new section between §§ 45-5 and 45-6 should be designated § 45-5.1). New chapters
should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence in the appropriate division or part
(e.g., Part I, Administrative Legislation, or Part II, General Legislation), utilizing the reserved
chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical
listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles,
Abandoned" under "V" in the table of contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated
amusement devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, CoinOperated"
under "A" in the table of contents). Where a reserved number is not available,
an "A" chapter should be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 45
and 46 should be designated Chapter 45A). New articles may be inserted between existing
articles in a chapter (e.g., adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use
of "A" articles (e.g., a new article to be included between Articles XVI and XVII should
be designated Article XVIA). The section numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if
the new Article XVIA contains six sections and existing Article XVI ends with § 45-30
and Article XVII begins with § 45-31, Article XVIA should contain §§ 45-30.1 through
45-30.6).
Supplementation
Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation
or amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as
soon as possible after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are
received and old pages removed, in accordance with the Instruction Page which accompanies
each supplement.
Acknowledgment
The assistance of the Borough officials is gratefully acknowledged by the editor. The
codification of the legislation of the Borough of Mansfield reflects an appreciation of the
needs of a progressive and expanding community. As in many other municipalities, officials
are faced with fundamental changes involving nearly every facet of community life.

MANSFIELD CODE
Problems increase in number and complexity and range in importance from everyday details
to crucial areas of civic planning. It is the profound conviction of General Code that
this Code will contribute significantly to the efficient administration of local government.
As Samuel Johnson observed, "The law is the last result of human wisdom acting upon
human experience for the benefit of the public."

TABLE OF CONTENTS
Tools for Finding Information - In addition to the municipality's legislation, this pUblication
contains tools to help locate information: table of contents, index, chapter outlines (schemes), and
a disposition list.
Chapters - Chapters are generally discrete pieces of legislation but can also be made up of several
individual pieces on a related topic. In that case, the individual pieces are arranged into articles
or parts within the chapter. If you are familiar with a former number or title, look for it
chronologically in the disposition list.
Reserved Chapters - In the numbering of chapters, space has been provided for the convenient
insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. Help in selecting an appropriate number for a new
chapter is available from the editor. See also the "Instructions for Amending the Code" in the
Preface.
Section Nnmbering - A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed. Each section of
every item of legislation is assigned a number, which indicates both the number of the chapter in
which the item of legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus,
the fourth section of Chapter 6 is § 6-4.
Scheme - The scheme is the list of section titles that precedes the text of each chapter. These titles
are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content
of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease
and precision of reference, the scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.
Page Nnmbers - A unique page-numbering system has been used in which each chapter forms
an autonomous unit. The first page of each chapter is the number of that chapter followed by a
colon and the numeral "1." Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 6: 1. By the use of this system, it is
possible to add or to change pages in any chapter, or add new chapters, without affecting the sequence
of subsequent pages.

and supplements thereto.

A. Metered service.
§ 128-25
(1) Except upon special written permission granted by this Borough and upon good
cause shown, each billing unit shall be required to have installed a water meter or
water meters to measure the quantity of water used by such billing unit for the
purpose of computing sewer rentals or charges hereunder.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this article, sewer rentals or charges for sanitary
sewage and industrial wastes discharged into the sewer system from any improved
property shall be based upon volume of water usage, adjusted, if appropriate, as
provided in this article, where the volume of water usage shall be metered, whether
in connection with the water system or otherwise.
(3) Sewer rentals or charges for sanitary sewage and industrial wastes discharged into
the sewer system from any improved property may be based upon actual metered
volume of discharge as permitted in this article.
(4) In either of the foregoing cases, such sewer rentals or charges shall be computed in
accordance with the following Metered Rate Schedule, subject, however, to the
minimum sewer rentals or charges provided in this article: [Last amended
12-8-2010 by Ord. No. 452]

o
$3.95
B. Nonmetered service. Sewer rentals or charges for sanitary sewage and industrial wastes
discharged into the sewer system from any improved property or any billing unit located
therein, when the volume of water usage shall not be metered in connection with the
water system and when the actual volume of discharge shall not be metered as permitted
in this article, shall be based upon an estimate by this Borough of the water consumption
of such improved property or billing unit and shall be computed on the basis of such
estimate in accordance with the Metered Rate Schedule set forth under Subsection A of
this section, subject, however, to the minimum sewer rentals or charges provided in this
article.
C. Multiple users.
(1) Each billing unit located in a multiple unit shall be billed as a separate entity, and
the above Metered Rate Schedule and minimum sewer rental or charge shall be
used in computing the sewer rentals or charges applicable to each such billing unit.

§ 128-25 SEWERS § 128-26
(2) In any case where this Borough grants written permission for more than one billing
unit to be served through a common water meter or through a common sewage
discharge meter for the purpose of computing sewer rentals or charges hereunder, a
multiple rental or charge per month shall be imposed, which rental or charge shall
be calculated in the following manner: [Amended 12-20-1995 by Ord. No. 377]
(a) The total consumption of water through such common water meter or the
total discharge through such common sewage discharge meter shall be
divided by the number of billing units served thereby.
(b) The Metered Rate Schedule for computing sewer rentals or charges

or charges shall be computed in whole or in part upon the basis of water volume
usage metered in connection with the water system, bills shall be rendered for each
month covered by the meter reading promptly after the meters are read.
(3) In the case of an owner of improved property whose monthly bill for sewer rentals
or charges shall be computed on any basis completely independent of water
volume usage metered in connection with the water system, the monthly billing
dates shall be the first business day of the month and, to the extent practicable,
shall cover services furnished during the month immediately preceding the billing
date.
B. Payment of rentals.
128:11 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 128-26 MANSFIELD CODE § 128-28
(1) Sewer rentals or charges shall be due and payable one day after mailing or delivery

sewer rentals or charges are not paid within 15 calendar days after the same
become due and payable, an additional sum of 1 112% of the outstanding balance
shall be added to such net bill, which net bill, plus such additional sum, shall
constitute the gross bill. Payment made or mailed and postmarked on or before the
last day of such fifteen- calendar-day period shall constitute payments within such
period. If the end of such fifteen-calendar-day period shall fall on a legal holiday
or a Sunday, payment made on or mailed and postmarked on the next succeeding
business day which is not a legal holiday shall constitute payment within such
period. [Amended 6-2-1982 by Ord. No. 309; 5-8-1996 by Ord. No. 380]
(2) Whenever service to any improved property shall begin after the first day or shall
terminate before the last day of any building period, sewer rentals or charges for
such period shall be prorated equitably, if appropriate, for that portion of the
monthly billing period during which such improved property was served by the

C. Every owner of an improved property which is connected to the sewer system initially
shall provide the Borough with and thereafter shall keep the Borough advised of his
correct address. Failure of any person to receive quarterly bills for sewer rentals or
charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such failure result in
an extension of the period of time during which the net bill shall be payable.
§ 128-27. Liens for sewer rentals.
Sewer rentals or charges imposed by this article shall be a lien on the improved property
connected to and served by the sewer system, and any such sewer rentals or charges which are
not paid within 30 days after each quarterly billing date, at the discretion of this Borough,
shall be filed as a lien against the improved property so connected to and served by the sewer
system, which lien shall be filed in the office of the Prothonotary of Tioga County,
Pennsylvania, and shall be collected in the manner provided by law for the filing and
collecting of municipal claims.
§ 128-28. Measuring volume of sewage.
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever the entire water supply of an improved property or, if applicable, of a
billing unit or billing units located therein, discharging sanitary sewage and/or
industrial wastes into the sewer system, is supplied by the water system, the
volume of water furnished, as determined from meter readings of the water system,
shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial
wastes in computing sewer rentals of charges, subject to adjustment, if appropriate,
as provided in this article.
(2) Whenever an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or billing units
located therein, discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes into the sewer
128:12 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 128-28 SEWERS § 128-28
system, shall have a source or sources of water supply in addition to or other than
the water system, the owner of such improved property shall provide a meter or
meters on such additional or other source or sources of water supply. The total
volume of water consumed, as determined from the meter readings of the water
system and/or the meter readings of the meter or meters on such additional or other
source or sources of water supply, shall be used as the measure of discharge of
sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing the sewer rentals or charges,
subject to adjustment, if appropriate, as provided in this article.
(3) If an improved property or, if applicable, a billing unit or billing units located
therein, shall use water from the water system and/or water from a source or
sources of supply in addition to or other than the water system for cooling or
unpolluted commercial or industrial purposes, the Borough may require the
exclusion of such water from the sewer system or the owner of such improved
property may elect to exclude such water from the sewer system. Whenever all or
part of the water so used shall not be discharged into the sewer system, the volume
used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in
computing sewer rentals or charges may be adjusted by one of the following
methods:
(a) By installing a meter or other measuring device on the connection to the
sewer system. The readings from such meter or measuring device shall be
used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes
in computing sewer rentals or charges.
(b) By installing a meter or other measuring device to measure the volume not
being discharged into the sewer system. The readings from such meter or
measuring device shall be deducted from the total water meter readings and
the remainder shall be used as the measure of discharge of sanitary sewage
and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer rentals or charges.
( c) If it is not practical, in the opinion of this Borough, to install a meter or other
measuring device to determine continuously the volume not discharged into
the sewer system, this Borough shall determine, in such manner and by such
method as it may prescribe, the percentage of metered water which is being
discharged into the sewer system. The quantity of water used as the measure
of discharges of sanitary sewage and/or industrial wastes in computing sewer
rentals or charges shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity
measured by the water meter or meters. Any dispute as to such estimated
percentage shall be submitted to this Borough, after notice of such estimate.
The decision of this Borough with respect to the matter shall be final for the
then-current calendar year.
B. Measuring devices. Meters or other measuring devices which shall not be owned by the
Authority or this Borough in connection with the water system, but which shall be
required or permitted under provisions of this article, shall be furnished and installed by
the owner of the improved property at his expense and shall be under the control of this
Borough and may be tested, inspected or repaired by this Borough whenever necessary.
The owner of the improved property upon which such meter or other measuring device
128:13 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 128-28 MANSFIELD CODE § 128-29
shall be installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping; and all repairs
thereto shall be made at the expense of the owner, whether such repairs shall be made
necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Bills for such repairs, if made by
this Borough, shall be due and payable immediately upon completion of such repairs and
shall be collected in the same manner as quarterly bills for sewer rentals or charges.
§ 128-29. Prohibited wastes.
A. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged any stormwater, surface water,
springwater, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, building foundation drainage,
cellar drainage or drainage from roof leader connections into any sewer.
B. This Borough reserves the right to refuse permission to connect to the sewer system, to
compel discontinuance of use of the sewer system or to compel pretreatment of industrial
wastes by any industrial establishment in order to prevent discharges deemed harmful or
to have a deleterious effect upon any sewer or the sewer system.
C. No sanitary sewage or industrial wastes shall be discharged to the sewer system:
(1) Having a temperature higher than 100$ F.

§ 135-1. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the Borough finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development
within the Borough increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly
increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines

accordance with the following standards. For purposes of this article, a "street number" is an
address number established in accordance with the countywide 911 public safety system with
reference to the adjacent road or street, assigned and given to a particular building or
structure/property by Tioga County 911 and the United States Postal Service. For specific
sections of roadways with an existing addressing system that is approved by Tioga County
911, the "street number" is the retained street number in the existing addressing system that is
established in conjunction with the county addressing project.
A. Each building to which a street number has been assigned shall have a street number
displayed upon the building except for buildings which are located a distance greater
than 200 feet from the nearest edge of the cartway of the public roadway or upon which
signage cannot be attached which would be readable from the nearest public roadway by
reason of natural or man-made obstructions. The owner of said structure/property shall be
required to provide posted street number signage at least 20 feet and not more than 30
feet from the nearest edge of the cartway of the public or private roadway, which post
shall have affixed thereon the street number which has been assigned to the building.
B. The assigned street numbers shall be either affixed directly to the building or post or
displayed on a sign affixed to the building or post. The street number shall be displayed
in such a manner that the numbers will contrast in color with the background and will be
observed and readable from the nearest public or private roadway. All numbers shall be
in standard Arabic numerals, not less than four inches in height and not less than
one-half inch in width. It is recommended that the numbers be reflective for greater
nighttime visibility.
C. If for any reason the street number of a particular building is not readily identifiable by
posted signage along the roadway, whether due to the proximity of multiple buildings
with different street numbers or some other reason, the street number should be affixed
to the building as well as posted by the road. Similarly, if a single building has multiple
street numbers or apartment numbers, such as professional buildings or apartments, a
building directory should be posted at the main entrance of the building.

§ 141-13 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-14
the day the application has been filed. Failure of the Borough Council to render a
decision and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner
required herein shall be deemed an approval of the application in terms as
presented unless the applicant has agreed, in writing, to an extension of time or
change in the prescribed manner of presentation of communication of the decision,
in which case, failure to meet the extended time or change in manner of
presentation of communication shall have like effect.
(4) The decision of the Borough Council shall be in wrItIng and shall be
communicated to the applicant personally or mailed by certified mail to him at his
last known address not later than 15 days following the decision. If delivered
personally, the applicant shall give the Borough a receipt indicating he has

§ 141-14. Completion and guarantee of improvements.
A. Subdivision improvements agreement. No final plan shall be endorsed by the Borough
Council unless an improvements agreement in a form acceptable to the Borough Council
and Borough Solicitor is executed. A unit breakdown of all improvements required by
this chapter shall be included within such agreement.
B. Completion and guarantee of improvements.
(1) No final plan shall be endorsed by the Borough Council unless all the
improvements required by this chapter and the improvements agreement have been
installed, inspected and approved in accordance with this chapter and said
agreement.
(2) In lieu of the completion of any improvements as stated in Subsection B(1) above,
prior to endorsement of the record plan, the subdivider shall deposit with the
Borough a financial security in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of all
improvements or common amenities required by this chapter and the improvements
agreement and the cost of preparing as-built drawings of those improvements. The
financial security may be in the form of an irrevocable letter of credit or restrictive
or escrow account in a federal- or commonwealth-chartered lending institution or
other type of financial security which the Borough Council approves. The financial
security shall guarantee the completion of all required improvements on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying improvements
agreement for completion of the improvements.
141:24 02 - 01 - 20tl
§ 141-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-14
(3) The subdivider shall also submit a cash deposit to the Borough to cover the cost
established by the Borough for improvement materials and labor to be provided by
the Borough pursuant to the improvements agreement.
(4) When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing, the Borough
Council shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of a resolution indicating
approval of the final plan contingent upon the developer obtaining a satisfactory
financial security. The record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the
improvements agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent
approval shall expire and be deemed to be revoked if the improvements agreement
is not executed within 90 days unless a written extension is granted by the
Borough Council; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and shall be
placed in writing at the request of the developer.
(5) The amount of the financial security to be posted for the completion of the
required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of completion estimated
as of 90 days following the date scheduled for completion by the developer.
Annually the Borough may adjust the amount of the financial security by
comparing the actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the
estimated cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the
expiration of the 90th day after either the original date scheduled for completion or
a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said adjustment, the Borough may
require the developer to post additional security in order to assure that the financial
security equals said 110%. Any additional security shall be posted by the
developer in accordance with this subsection.
(6) The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an estimate of the
cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted by an applicant and
prepared by an engineer and certified by such engineer to be a fair and reasonable
estimate of such cost. Such estimate shall be submitted to the Borough no less than
14 days prior to the meeting of the Borough Council at which such estimate is to
be considered. The Borough Council, upon the recommendation of the Borough
Engineer, may refuse to accept such estimate for good cause shown. If the
applicant and the Borough Council are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another engineer chosen mutually
by the Borough and the applicant. The estimate certified by the third engineer shall
be presumed fair and reasonable and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a
third engineer is so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid
equally by the Borough and the applicant.
(7) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date
of posting of the financial security to complete the required improvements, the
amount of the financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each
one-year period beyond the first anniversary date of posting of financial security or
to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of completing the required
improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the initial one-year
period.
141:25 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-14 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-14
(8) The party posting the financial security may request the Borough Council to
release or authorize release, from time to time, such portions of the financial
security necessary for payment to the contractors performing the work. Any such
requests shall be in writing addressed to the Borough Council, and the Council
shall have 45 days from receipt of such requests within which to allow the
Borough Engineer to certify, in writing, to the Borough Council that such portion
of the work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the
approved subdivision or land development plan. Upon such certification, the
Borough Council shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending
institution of an amount as estimated by the Borough Engineer fairly representing
the value of the improvements completed. If the Borough Council fails to act
within said forty-five-day period, the Council shall be deemed to have approved
the release of funds as requested. The Borough Council may, prior to final release
at the time of completion and certification by the Borough Engineer, reqUIre
retention of 10% of the estimated cost of the aforesaid improvements.
(9) In the case where development is projected over a period of years, the Borough
may authorize submission of final plans by sections or stages of development,
subject to such requirements or improvement guaranties in the future sections or
stages of development as it finds essential for the protection and proper
development of any finally approved section of the development.
C. Remedies to effect completion of improvements. In the event that any improvements
which are required by this chapter have not been installed as provided in this chapter or
in accord with the approved final plan, the Borough may enforce any improvements
agreement by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds of such
improvements guaranty are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by said financial security, the Borough may,
at its option, install part of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land
development and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the
moneys necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the proceeds,
whether resulting from the improvements guaranty or from any legal or equitable action
brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the installation of the
improvements covered by such financial security.
D. Release of improvements guaranty.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and appropriate
improvements, the developer shall notify the Borough Council, by certified or
registered mail, of the completion of the improvements and shall send a copy of
the notice to the Borough Engineer.
(2) The Borough Council shall within 10 days after receipt of notice of completion of
improvements direct and authorize the Borough Engineer to inspect the
improvements. The Borough Engineer shall then submit a written report regarding
the improvements to the Council and promptly mail a copy of the report to the
developer by certified or registered mail.
141:26 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-14 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-14
(3) The report shall be made and mailed by the Borough Engineer within 30 days after
receipt of authorization from the Borough Council. The report shall be detailed and
shall indicate approval or rejection of the improvements, either in whole or in part.

rejected by the Borough Engineer, the report shall contain a statement of reasons
for such non-approval or rejection.
(4) The Borough Council shall notify the developer within 15 days of receipt of the
Engineer's report, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of its action.
(5) If any portion of the improvements shall not be approved or shall be rejected by
the Borough Council, the developer shall proceed to complete the improvements,
and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification as outlined above shall
be followed.
(6) When completed improvements have been approved by the Borough, the
improvements guaranty shall be reduced by no more than the amount which was
estimated in the improvements agreement for the approved improvements.
E. Preparation of as-built plans.
(1) As-built plans for all improvements within the subdivision or land development
listed in the subdivision improvements agreement shall be submitted to the
Borough within 30 days after inspection and approval of the improvements by the
Borough and prior to the release of the improvements guaranty and acceptance of
. any such improvements by the Borough. Plans shall be in accordance with the
requirements of § 141-19 of this chapter, shall be Mylars in reproducible form and
shall be certified by the developer's engineer to be in accordance with actual
construction. The location and elevation of all sewer laterals and water services
shall also be indicated. The developer shall be responsible for the preparation of
such plans.
(2) If any information relating to potential lot owners shown on the recorded plan shall
have been changed, such as lot boundaries, easements and maintenance
responsibilities, a revised subdivision and/or land development plan shall be filed
with the Borough in accordance with the procedures of this chapter.
F. Maintenance guaranty. Where the Borough Council accepts dedication of all or some of
the required improvements within a subdivision or land development following
completion, the Borough Council may require the posting of a maintenance guaranty to
secure structural integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design specifications as depicted on the final plan
for a term not to exceed 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication. The
maintenance guaranty shall be of the same type as permitted for installation of
improvements, and the amount of the maintenance guaranty shall not exceed 15% of the
actual cost of installation of the improvements.
141:27 02 - 01 - 2011

shall be by a separate action of the Council and shall not be effected by approval
of a subdivision or land development plan.
(5) The developer shall agree with the Borough to tender, if requested, a deed of
dedication for any and all public improvements, including easements. Upon
completion of any public improvements shown on an approved subdivision or land
development plan and within 90 days after approval of such public improvements,
as herein provided, the Borough may require that the developer offer such public
improvements for dedication. In such a case, the developer shall prepare a deed of
dedication and forward same to the Borough for review by the Borough Solicitor.
The Borough may require that the developer supply a title insurance certificate
from a reputable title insurance company before any property is accepted by the
Borough.
B. Filing with recorder of deeds.
(1) Upon approval of a final plan or sketch plan of record by the Borough Council or
the acceptance of the conditions of a conditional approval by the applicant in case
of a plan approved subject to conditions, the developer shall, within 90 days of
such final approval or acceptance of conditions, complete all conditions of
approval and comply with all requirements of § 141-14. After the applicant's
completion of all conditions of approval and compliance with all requirements of
§ 141-14, the Borough Council may endorse the record plan. The developer shall
within 90 days of such endorsement record the plan in the office of the Recorder
of Deeds. The Recorder of Deeds shall not accept any plan for recording unless the
plan contains the endorsement of the Borough Council and official notification of
review by the County Planning Commission. Endorsement of the Borough Council
shall consist of the signatures of the President of the Council and the Borough
Secretary and the Borough Seal on the plan. The developer should contact the
141:28 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-15 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-16
County Recorder of Deeds Office to determine all applicable requirements for
recording. If the subdivider fails to record the plan within such period, the
approval action of the Borough Council shall be null and void. If the approval
action becomes null and void, then a preliminary plan must be submitted, unless
Borough Council for cause shown allows a final plan to be submitted.
(2) All final plan sheets which contain restrictive notes, lot boundaries, easements,
maintenance responsibilities, other lot owner responsibilities and such other
information relating to potential lot owners shall be recorded.
§ 141-16. Plans exempted from standard procedures.
A. Minor subdivision: final plan. In the case of any minor subdivision as defined in this
chapter, the Borough Planning Commission may at its discretion permit the developer to
submit only a final plan to the Borough, rather than both preliminary and final plans. The
final plan shall contain all information required by § 141-19 of this chapter and shall be
submitted and reviewed in accordance with §§ 141-4 and 141-13. The final plan shall be
submitted to the County Planning Commission for review. The Borough Planning
Commission may also require submission to and review from the County Conservation
District when recommended by the Borough Engineer. Submission to and review by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) may be required if there is
frontage on a state street. Further subdivision from a tract subdivided under this section
or subdivision of a lot or tract created under this section will require a review of plans in
accordance with the standard procedures of this chapter, and this shall be noted on the
final plan.
B. Resubdivision: revised final plan.
(1) Any resubdivision of land, including changes to recorded plans, shall be
considered a subdivision and shall comply with all requirements of this chapter;
however, in those instances where only lot lines shown on a recorded plan will be
changed, all resultant lots will conform to Chapter 162, Zoning, and this chapter,
easements will not be changed, street horizontal and vertical alignment will not be
changed, block sizes will not be changed, utility sizes and locations will not be
changed, open space and recreation areas will not be changed and the number of
lots will. not be increased, the Borough Council may at its discretion permit the
developer to submit only a revised final plan to the Borough for review.
(2) In addition to all items specified in § 141-19 of this chapter, the plan shall
graphically show the lot line changes being made. The revised final plan shall be
reviewed in accordance with § 141-13 and shall be submitted to the County
Planning Commission for review.
(3) If the revision of lot lines would result in the relocation of driveway access points
previously approved by PennDOT, the Borough Council shall require submission
of the revised final plan to PennDOT for approval.
C. Auction sale. In the case of the proposed subdivision of land by process of auction sale,
the following procedure may be used by the developer:
141:29 02 - 01 - 2011

(2) The preliminary plan shall comply with the requirements of this chapter and in
addition contain the following notation:
This property is intended to be sold by auction on or about __ 19 __ , in
whole or in part according to this plan. Sale of lots at such auction shall be in the
form of agreement to purchase, and no actual transfer of ownership or interest in
such lots shall occur until a final plan showing such subdivision of property is
approved by the Borough Council in accordance with the Borough Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance and recorded in the office of the County
Recorder of Deeds.
(3) After approval of the preliminary plan by the Borough Council, the auction sale
may proceed. After the auction sale, the developer shall prepare and submit a final
plan in accordance with this chapter.
D. Lot annexations: sketch plan for record. Where the conveyance, sale or transfer of land
from one parcel to an adjacent parcel is proposed for the sole purpose of increasing lot
size, and not for the purpose of creating a separate new lot or a land development, the
developer may submit only a sketch plan for record to the Borough. The sketch plan
shall contain all information required by § 141-17 of this chapter and be submitted and
reviewed in accordance with § 141-11. Precise bearings and distances from field survey
shall be shown for the parcel being transferred, and evidence shall be submitted that the
parcel from which a parcel is being transferred will not violate or further violate, as the
case may be, any requirement of Chapter 162, Zoning, or other Borough regulations. If
development is subsequently proposed for the parcel which has been increased in size, no
building or zoning permit shall be issued unless all applicable requirements of Borough
regulations are complied with. The subdivision plan shall contain a notation that the
parcel being transferred is not to be considered a separate building lot.
E. Exempted land developments: final plan. In the case of a minor land development as
defined in this chapter or two single-unit detached dwellings on a lot or lots, the
developer may submit only a final plan to the Borough. The final plan shall contain all
information required by § 141-19 of this chapter and shall be submitted and reviewed in
accordance with § 141-13. The final plan shall be submitted to the County Planning
Commission for review. Submission to and review from the County Conservation
District shall be required when recommended by the Borough Engineer. Submission to
and review by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation may be required if there is
frontage on a state street.

ARTICLE VI
Design Standards
§ 141-20. Application and general standards.
§ 141-21
A. The standards and requirements contained in Articles VI and VII are intended as the
minimum for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare and shall be
applied as such by the Borough Planning Commission and Borough Council in reviewing
all subdivision and land development plans.
B. Whenever other Borough regulations impose more restrictive standards and requirements
than those contained herein, such other regulations shall prevail; otherwise, the standards
and requirements of this chapter shall apply.
C. The layout or arrangement of the subdivision or land development shall conform to the
Comprehensive Plan, any regulations or maps adopted in furtherance thereof and any
other official plans of the Borough which have been adopted.
D. The plan of the proposed subdivision or land development shall be coordinated with
existing adjacent development in order to provide for harmonious development of the
area as a whole.
E. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or developed. Lands
subject to hazards to life, health or property such as may result from fire, flood, disease
or other causes shall either be made safe for the purpose for which such land is proposed
to be used, or such land shall be set aside for uses which shall not endanger life or
property or further aggravate or increase the existing menace.
F. All subdivisions and land developments shall be reviewed to assure that all such
proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, that all utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems are located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage and that adequate drainage is provided so as to
reduce exposure to flood hazards.
§ 141-21. Streets.
A. General standards.
(1) All design elements of all streets, including horizontal and vertical alignment, sight
distance and superelevation, are subject to review and approval by the Borough
Council. When reviewing the design of streets, in addition to the standards in this
chapter, the rural design criteria in the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
Design Manual Part 2, Highway Design, January 1990 Edition, and A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, AASHTO, 1990 Edition, as from time
to time amended and supplemented, shall be consulted to assure that the road
design is in accordance with acceptable engineering practice.
(2) For certain aspects of vertical and horizontal alignment discussed below, standards
are determined by design speed of the street involved. For all proposed streets, the
developer shall indicate the proposed design speed. The designated design speed is
141:49 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-21 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-21
subject to the approval of the Borough Council. In general, the design speed on
arterial streets shall be considered as 55 miles per hour (mph) (to be determined in
each individual case), on collector streets a minimum of 35 mph (to be deternrined
in each individual case) and on minor streets 35 mph unless a lesser design speed
is permitted by the Borough Council.
(3) The speed limit proposed to be posted for streets shall not exceed the design speed.
(4) Streets in and bordering a subdivision or land development shall be coordinated
and be of such widths and grades and in such locations as deemed necessary to
accommodate prospective traffic and facilitate fIre protection.
(5) The location and width of all proposed streets shall conform to the offIcial plans
which have been adopted by the Borough and shall be properly related to all
existing streets, recorded streets and official plans which have been adopted or
approved by the Borough, county or state.
(6) Streets within the subdivision or land development and adjacent roads which will
receive traffic from and distribute traffIc to the subdivision or land development
shall be adequate in construction, grade, width and capacity to accommodate traffIc
generated by the subdivision or land development.
(7) The proposed street system shall extend existing or recorded streets at the same
width as the existing or recorded streets if these streets meet or exceed the
standards of § 141-21 C( 1). If the existing or recorded streets do not meet or exceed
the standards of § 141-21 C(1), the proposed street extensions shall meet the
standards of § 141-21C(1).
(8) Where, in the opinion of the Borough Council, it is desirable to provide for street
access to adjoining property, streets shall be extended by dedication to the
boundary of such property. The location and number of access points to adjoining
properties are subject to Borough Council approval.
(9) When streets will be extended to the boundaries of the subdivision or land
development to provide for access to potenti&lly developable tracts and sanitary
sewer and/or waterlines will be constructed in the streets within the developer's
tract, the Borough Council may require extension of the sanitary sewer and/or
waterlines to the tract boundary in order to facilitate future extensions to abutting
land.
(10) If a subdivision proposes lots, all of which front on existing public streets, the
Borough Council may require the developer to reserve land adequate to provide for
future street access from the public streets on which the lots front to the land to the
rear of the proposed lots. Such reserved areas shall be of such dimensions to
permit the construction of streets meeting the standards of this chapter.
(a) When reservations for future streets will adjoin lots to be developed prior to
the construction of the streets, the developer shall establish the proposed
grades of the future streets and the extent of the area necessary for the
construction of those streets. If the area necessary for the construction of the
141:50 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-21 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-21
streets extends beyond the proposed street right-of-way lines, all excavation
and grading necessary for the streets beyond the right-of-way lines shall be
done as required improvements in conjunction with the subdivision which
contains the adjoining lots, or else construction easements shall be provided
on the adjoining lots, sufficient to permit construction of the future street.
(b) Where reservations for future streets intersect existing streets, radii shall be
provided for the reservations such that the requirements of § 141-21H(6) and
(7) of this chapter could be met for a street to be constructed in the future.
(11) If lots or parcels in the subdivision are large enough for resubdivision, or if a
portion of the developer's property is not proposed to be subdivided but could be
subdivided in the future, the Borough Council may require the reservation of land
adequate to provide for future street access to land which could be resubdivided or
subdivided in the future and require that the location of land reserved for future
streets be coordinated with the street system shown on the subdivision plan.
(12) Connections shall be provided between streets within the subdivision or land
development to provide adequate access for emergency vehicles, other vehicles and
pedestrians.
(13) New minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic, but the
developer shall provide for the extension and continuation of arterial and collector
streets into and from adjoining properties when required by the Borough Council.
Minor streets shall be extended and continued into and from adjoining properties
when necessary for the proper development of and traffic circulation in the
Borough.
(14) Where a subdivision or land development abuts an existing street that does not
meet the standards of this chapter, the Borough Council may require the dedication
of land sufficient to widen the street to meet the standards of this chapter.
(15) Where a subdivision or land development fronts on and will provide for vehicular
access to and from an existing Borough street which does not meet the minimum
cartway width requirements of this chapter, the Borough Council may require the
developer to improve at his expense the Borough street cartway to meet those
requirements. Pavement shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements
of this chapter. In addition, provision shall be made for adequate drainage along
the sides of the streets. Such drainage provisions shall be approved by the Borough
Council.
(16) Private streets (streets not to be offered for dedication) shall be designed and
constructed in accordance with the requirements of this chapter and other Borough
regulations and/or specifications which may be amended from time to time.
(a) Private streets need not conform in width to the requirements of
§ 141-21 C( 1) of this chapter; provided, however, that private streets shall
have a cartway of not less than 24 feet unless a greater width is required by
Chapter 162, Zoning; and provided further that no parking shall be permitted
141:51 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-21 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-21
on any private street that does not contain the width requirements of
§ 141-21C(1) of this chapter.
(b) Private streets shall only be permitted in those subdivisions or land
developments intended to remain under single ownership.
(17) Where streets and other public improvements continue into adjoining
municipalities, evidence of compatibility of design, particularly with regard to
street widths, shall be submitted. The applicant shall coordinate such design with
both municipalities to avoid abrupt changes in cartway width or in improvements
provided.
(18) The street system shall be designed with regard to:
(a) Consideration of existing topographical considerations.
(b) Providing buildable lots or, in the case of a mobile home park, lots on which
a mobile home can be placed in accordance with all applicable requirements
of Chapter 162, Zoning.
(c) Minimizing the number of street intersections, through encouraging the use
of three-way rather than four-way intersections when intersections of minor
streets are involved.
( d) Avoiding excessive linear footage of street.
(19) All drives within multiunit and nonresidential developments which are intended for
circulation within the development shall be designed to the horizontal and vertical
alignment standards for streets contained within this chapter.
B. Partial and half streets. New half or partial streets will not be permitted, but wherever a
tract to be subdivided borders an existing recorded half or partial street, the Borough
Council may require the developer to provide adjacent to such half or partial street a
reservation of land adequate to allow the construction of a street meeting the standards of
this chapter.
C. Street widths.
(1) Minimum street right-of-way and cartway (pavement) widths shall be as follows:

Borough Council approval. The Borough Council may prohibit parking along
collector streets.
D. Restriction of access.
(1) Whenever a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an existing or
proposed arterial or collector street, the Borough Council may require restriction of
access to the street by:
(a) Provision of reverse frontage lots;
(b) Provision of service streets along the rear of the abutting lots,. together with
prohibition of private driveways intersecting the arterial or collector street;
( c) Provision of marginal access streets, provided that the reserve strips
establishing such marginal access streets shall be placed within the

exceeds 1 %, vertical curves shall be provided. Minimum stopping and headlight sight
distance shall be provided in accordance with A Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets, AASHTO, 1990, and PennDOT Design Manual Part 2, Highway
Design, 1990.
H. Intersections.
(1) Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and no street shall
intersect another at an angle of less than 75° (measured at the intersection of the
street center lines) nor more than 105°. The angle of intersection with an arterial
street shall be 90°.
(2) No more than two streets geometrically shall intersect at the same point.
(3) Streets intersecting another street shall either intersect directly opposite to each
other or be separated by at least 150 feet between center lines, measured along the
center line of the street being intersected.
(4) Intersections shall be approached on all sides by a straight area at least 50 feet in
length, the grade of which shall not exceed 5% within 50 feet of the intersection of
the nearest right-of-way lines.

J. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Dead-end streets are prohibited unless designed as cul-de-sac streets, provided that
in the case of streets which are planned for future extension into adjoining tracts
and will not be the primary means of access to any lot or dwelling unit, a
turnaround is not required.
(2) Except as provided in Subsection J(1), any street dead-ended for access to an
adjoining property or because of authorized stage development shall be provided
with a turnaround within the subdivision or land development, and the use of such
turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public until such time as the street is
extended.
(a) If a cul-de-sac turnaround is offset, it shall not be offset to the right.
, (b) Should a temporary cul-de-sac be proposed, arrangements satisfactory to the
Borough Council and Borough Solicitor shall be made for construction and
installation responsibilities of all improvements when the temporary
cul-de-sac is abandoned and the street is extended.
(c) In the event that the Borough Council shall not consider development of
adjoining property to be imminent, the Council may require that a permanent
curbed cul-de-sac be constructed.
(3) Cul-de-sac streets shall be at least 250 feet from the right-of-way of the street
intersected to the end of the turnaround. Cul-de-sac streets shall not exceed 500
feet in length as defined in this chapter and shall not furnish access to more than
20 dwelling units. The Borough Council may permit temporary culs-de-sac longer
than 500 feet at its discretion if future extension of the cul-de-sac is likely in the
opinion of the Council. At its discretion, the Council may permit culs-de-sac to
serve more than 20 dwelling units when it believes adequate provision will be
made for vehicular circulation and parking.
(4) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround
right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with sufficient
141:56 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-21 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-21
additional right-of-way width provided along the boundary line to permit extension
of the street at full width.
(5) All cul-de-sac streets, whether permanently or temporarily designed as such, shall
be provided at the closed end with a fully paved turnaround. Minimum radius to
the pavement edge or curb line shall be 50 feet, and minimum radius to the
right-of-way line shall be 60 feet.

the Borough, irrespective of the use of the suffix street, road, avenue, boulevard,
drive, way, place, court, lane, etc.
(3) All street names shall be subject to the approval of the Borough Council.
L. Service street (alleys).
(1) Service streets are prohibited in residential subdivisions except where required by
the Borough Council to avoid direct driveway access to arterial or collector streets.
(2) Service streets may be permitted by the Borough Council in other types of
development, provided that the developer produces evidence satisfactory to the
Council of the need for such service streets and provided that the service streets
are not the primary means of access.
(3) Dead-end service streets are prohibited unless permitted at the discretion of the
Borough Council. Dead-end service streets shall be terminated with a paved
circular turnaround with a minimum radius to the outer pavement edge (curbline)
of 50 feet.
(4) Parking is prohibited along service streets.
M. Street construction. Pavement shall be designed in accordance with PennDOT Publication
242, Roadway Management Manual, except that no street shall have less than a

§ 141-22 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-24
§ 141-22. Guide rail.
A. Streets shall be designed to preclude or minimize the need for guide rail. The Borough
Council may require guide rail to be placed for protection on embankments when a
barrier is required in Design Manual Part 2, Highway Design, by the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation, January 1990 Edition.
B. Fixed obstructions along streets which would require guide rail shall be precluded or
minimized. The Borough Council may require guide rail to be placed when a barrier is
required for fixed objects in Design Manual Part 2, Highway Design, by the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, January 1990 Edition.
C. The design and selection of guide rail shall be in accordance with the standards in
Design Manual Part 2, Highway Design, January 1990 Edition; however, the Borough
Council shall approve all guide rail systems.
§ 141-23. Blocks.
A. Layout. The length, width and shape of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the
provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed, zoning requirements,
topography and requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, including the reduction of intersections with arterial and collector streets.
B. Length.
(1) Blocks shall have a maximum length of 1,600 feet and a minimum length of 500
feet. The Borough Council may decrease the permitted maximum and/or minimum
lengths of blocks if the topography of land, proposed lot sizes or surface water
drainage conditions warrant such a decrease.
(2) Blocks along arterial streets shall not be less than 1,000 feet.
C. Depth. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two tiers of lots,
except where reverse frontage lots are required or where prevented by the size,
topographical conditions or other inherent conditions of the property.
D. Nonresidential blocks. Blocks in nonresidential areas may vary from the elements of
design detailed above if required by the nature of the use. In all cases, however, adequate
provisions shall be made for off-street parking and loading areas and pedestrian and
vehicular circulation.
E. Crosswalks. Crosswalks may be required by the Borough Council whenever necessary to
facilitate pedestrian circulation and to give access to community facilities. Such
crosswalks shall have a minimum width of 10 feet and contain a walkway, constructed of
a material approved by the Borough Council, with a minimum width of four feet.
§ 141-24. Lots and parcels.
A. General standards.
141:58 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-24 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-24
(1) The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the type of
development and use contemplated and be in accordance with the provisions of
Chapter 162, Zoning. Lots shall be capable of being built upon, or in the case of a
mobile home park, on which a mobile home can be placed, in accordance with all
applicable requirements of Chapter 162, Zoning.
(2) Side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street lines and radial to curved
street lines. Lot lines shall follow municipal boundaries rather than cross them.
(3) The depth of lots for single-family detached dwellings shall not be less than one
nor more than three times their width at the street line.
(4) Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall be adequate for
the use proposed and sufficient to provide satisfactory space for on-site parking,
loading and unloading, setbacks, buffer yards and landscaping, etc.
(5) Subdivisions shall be designed to avoid the creation of remnants of land. If
remnants of land would result after subdividing, adequate provision, which shall be
approved by the Borough, shall be made for the disposition and maintenance of
those remnants.
(6) Flag lots are prohibited, unless permission is granted by the Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Borough Planning Commission. The Council may grant
permission to utilize flag lots when it deems flag lots appropriate because of
topographical or other conditions unique to the site. The access strip portions of a
flag lot must be wide enough to permit the construction of a street with a
right-of-way meeting the requirements of this chapter and shall not be used for
building purposes. In granting permission to use flag lots, the Borough Council
shall find:
(a) That the use of flag lots will not result in conditions that will cause increased
interruptions to traffic flow, accident hazards and sedimentation and runoff
problems onto public streets.
(b) That the use of an internal street system or marginal access streets on which
lots would front will not be more appropriate for deVelopment of the tract
than the use of flag lots.
( c) That the use of flag lots is necessary to permit utilization of a tract of ground
otherwise not feasible to utilize under the applicable standards for lots found
in this chapter.
(d) No more than one flag lot shall be created from the original tract of land for
each 10 lots created from the original tract of land which meet the
requirements of this chapter for lot configuration.
(e) Should a flag lot be divided into two or more lots, the access strip shall be
constructed into a street complying with the specifications of this chapter.
(f) All structures shall be located on the flag lot so as to provide the required
setback should the access strip be used for construction of a street.
141:59 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-24 MANSFIELD CODE § 141-24
(7) Where an ultimate right-of-way line has been provided, all setbacks and lot areas
shall be measured from such ultimate right-of-way line.
(8) Wherever feasible, lots shall be designed so that buildings can be constructed
above street grade. Where this is not possible, the developer shall indicate what
measures are to be taken to assure proper drainage away from the buildings.
(9) When only a portion of a tract is designed at a time and there exists the potential
for development of the remainder of the tract, lots shall be designed such that they
do not restrict access to the remainder of the tract, do not unduly restrict the
potential development of the remainder of the tract, nor result in the creation of
awkward of difficult-to-develop parcels in the remainder of the tract.
(10) The maximum slope utilized when grading lots or streets along an adjoining tract
of land not owned by the developer shall be a three to one slope ratio of horizontal
distance to vertical distance.
B. Lot frontage and access.
(1) All lots shall abut and have direct driveway access to an existing or proposed
public street or private street meeting the requirements of this chapter.
(2) Reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where required by the Borough
Council to restrict access to existing streets or to overcome specific disadvan~ages
of topography or orientation. All residential reverse frontage lots shall contain a
landscape screen, fence, earth mounding or similar screening device and barrier to
vehicular access subject to Borough Council approval within the rear yard.
(3) Where access to land within a subdivision or land development will be solely by
proposed roads within an adjoining municipality, the Borough Council may require
assurance from the adjoining municipality that adequate provisions have been
made to ensure construction of the proposed access roads.
(4) When the rear wall of a building will face a public street, the Borough Council
may require a landscape screen, fence, earth mounding or similar screening device
subject to Borough Council approval between the building and the public street.
(5) After consideration of street speeds, traffic volumes, projected traffic generated at
a proposed land use and the location and arrangement of existing and proposed
driveways and intersections, the Borough Council may require the developer to
install at his expense an acceleration or deceleration lane, or both, to serve a
proposed driveway or street. If additional street right-of-way is required to
construct the acceleration or deceleration lane, the additional right-of-way shall be
provided by the developer. When required by the Borough Council, the developer
shall furnish a study to the Borough which will provide the information necessary
to permit the determination as to whether an acceleration or deceleration lane is
required.
C. Lot size. The minimum lot size and width requirements set forth in Chapter 162, Zoning,
shall be met.
141:60 02 - 0] - 2011
§ 141-24 SUBDMSION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-24
D. Off-street parking.
(1) Each proposed dwelling unit in a subdivision or land development shall meet the
off-street parking requirements of Chapter 162, Zoning.
(a) In the case of single-unit or two-unit dwellings and townhouses with on-lot
parking, such off-street parking spaces shall be provided behind the street
right-of-way line and may be provided in an attached or separate garage,
carport or driveway. The spaces shall not be located within any clear sight
triangle required by this chapter.

adequate stormwater drainage and erosion and sediment contro1. The Borough
Council may require subdivision and land development plans to show a typical
treatment of the construction of driveways and handling of storm drainage where
the driveways intersect a street. The Council may require as a condition to
approval of a plan that prior to the issuance of zoning or building permits the
specific proposals for the construction of a driveway and treatment of storm
drainage and erosion and sediment control for that driveway be submitted to the
Borough for approva1.
(4) Driveways shall be placed at locations at which sight distance is adequate to safely
allow each permitted movement to be made into or out of the driveways; such that
the free movement of normal street traffic is not impaired; such that the driveways
will not create a hazard; and such that the driveways will not create an area of
undue traffic congestion on streets. Applicable safe sight distance as established in
141:61 02 - 01 - 2011

(6) The angle of a driveway as it intersects a street shall be such that a vehicle
entering the driveway may do so in an orderly and safe manner with a minimum of
interference to through street traffic and such that a vehicle leaving the driveway
may enter safely into the lane of traffic moving in the desired direction. Driveways
shall intersect streets as nearly as possible at right angles, and in no case at an
141:62 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 141-24 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 141-26
angle of less than 75° or more than 105°; provided, however, that the Borough
Council may permit the use of one-way driveways on a property, and such
one-way driveways may intersect streets at an angle of not less than 45°.
(7) Private driveways shall have such grades as to furnish safe and convenient parking
spaces and to provide a safe and convenient means of access. The grades and
construction materials of driveways shall be such that the materials of the driveway
will not wash onto public streets. The maximum permissible grade shall be 7% on
all driveways, except that driveway grades shall not exceed 5% within 20 feet of

is permanent rather than transitory. "Domicile" is the place in which a man has voluntarily
fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere special or limited purpose but
with the present intention of making a permanent home until some event occurs to induce him
to adopt some other permanent home. In the case of businesses or associations, the "domicile"
is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the place where its functions are
discharged.

States Army Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax shall annually
file an exemption certificate with the Borough and with the person's employer
affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net
profits from all sources within the Borough of less than $12,000 in the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Borough utilizes a
tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all the
employee's last pay stubs or W -2 forms from employment within the Borough for
the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate, and· until
otherwise instructed by the Borough or except as required by Subsection B(2), the
employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or the
remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a form at the
time of hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given year from the tax,
upon notification to an employer by the person or by the Borough that the person
has received earned income and net profits from all sources within the Borough
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an
employer's payment to the person of earned income within the Borough in an
amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the tax
becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under Subsection B(2), the
employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year. The
employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of
145:13 02 - 0] - 20]]
§ 145-17 MANSFIELD CODE § 145-18
the notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount of tax that
was not withheld from the person due to the exemption claimed by the person
under this subsection, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period.
The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in
that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. In the
event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the tax under this
subsection is subsequently severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable
for any outstanding balance of tax due, and the Borough may pursue collection
under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this subsection that
employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates,
monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from a local
services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough Manager, and/or his designee, in consultation with the Collector
and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims for any tax
paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which procedures shall be in accord
with provisions of the general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and
interest on overpayments. (NOTE: With respect to refunds, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8425;
with respect to interest, see 53 Pa.C.S.A. § 8426.) Refunds made within 75 days of a
refund request or 75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest.
No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do not exceed $1.
The Borough Manager, and/or his designee, or the Collector shall determine eligibility
for refunds to exempt persons and provide refunds.
§ 145-18. Duty of employers to collect.
A. Each employer within the Borough of Mansfield, as well as those employers situated
outside the Borough of Mansfield but who engage in business within the Borough of
Mansfield, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the tax from each of his
employees engaged by him or performing for him within the Borough of Mansfield and
making a return and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax from each employee in his or her employ, whether said
employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not all such services are
performed within the Borough of Mansfield.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata share of the tax
for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The pro rata
share of the tax assessed on the person for a payroll period shall be determined by
dividing the combined rate of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of
payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the amount of the tax
collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall
be made on a payroll period basis for each payroll provided in Subsection D of this
section. For purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual
rate of the tax levied by the school district and the Borough.
145:14 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 145-18 TAXATION § 145-21
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by more than one
political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the tax
if the employee provides a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes
the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax
withheld and a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other employers of a change
in principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence. The employee's
statement shall be provided on the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar year, irrespective of
the number of political subdivisions within which a person may be employed. The
Borough shall provide a taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the payment of the
withheld tax money to the Borough if the failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect
information submitted by the employee as to the employee's place or places of
employment, the employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the local services tax
in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the employer complies
with the provisions of Subsection B of § 138-17 of this article and this section and remits
the amount so withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days after the end of
each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 145-19. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the tax on forms to be
supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer fails to file the return and pay the
tax, whether or not the employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or
commissions paid by him or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article,
the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 145-20. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to determine the
number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted and paid over to the Collector
on or before the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 145-21. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind or engages in any
occupation or profession within a primary place of employment within the Borough of
Mansfield shall be required to comply with this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax
due to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
145:15 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 145-22 MANSFIELD CODE § 145-24
§ 145-22. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or employed in more than
one political subdivision.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the fIrst day the person becomes
subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the event a person is engaged in more
than one occupation, that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires the
person working in more than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the
priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her principal
offIce or is principally employed;
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works if the tax
is levied by the political subdivision;
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which imposes
the tax nearest in miles to the person's home.
B. In case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year declaring
that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima facie certifIcation of payment
to all other political subdivisions.
§ 145-23. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places of business
outside of the Borough of MansfIeld but who perform services of any type or kind or engage
in any occupation or profession within the Borough of MansfIeld do, by virtue thereof, agree
to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations
promulgated under this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the Borough of MansfIeld. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within the
Borough of MansfIeld and an employee of a nonresidential employer may, for the purpose of
this article, be considered a self-employed person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid,
the Borough shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 145-24. Administration of tax.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the Borough Council. It shall be the
duty of the Collector to accept and receive payment of this tax and to keep a record
thereof showing the amount received by him from each employer or self-employed
person, together with the date the tax was received.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this article
and is hereby charged and empowered, subject to Borough Council approval, to
prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to
the administration and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article, the examination
and correction of any return made in compliance with this article and any payment
alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have
145:16 02 - 01 - 2011
§ 145-24 TAXATION § 145-27
occurred. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Tioga County as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records of any
employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer or, if no
return was made, to ascertain the tax due. Each employer is hereby directed and required
to give the Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
§ 145-25. Suits for collection.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30 days after the due
dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the recovery of any such tax due or
unpaid under this article, together with interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% on the amount of
such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date of the tax and a penalty of 5%
shall be added to the flat rate of such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought
for the recovery of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection.
§ 145-26. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this article, or
whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts in his or her custody and control
setting forth the number of employees subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or
whoever fails or refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 and costs
of prosecution, and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for not
more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted
against any person in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refused to file a return required by this article.
§ 145-27. Interpretation of provisions.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the Borough of
Mansfield to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any occupation not within the
taxing power of the Borough under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be held by any court
of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of
the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the
court shall not affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.
