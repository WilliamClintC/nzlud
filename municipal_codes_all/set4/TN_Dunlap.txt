SECTION 
 
03.20. STANDARDS FOR BED AND BREAKFAST INNS 
 
For the purpose of this Ordinance there shall be certain general provisions which shall apply to the city as a whole as follows. 
 
03.01 ZONING AFFECTS EVERY BUILDING AND USE. 
 
No building or land shall hereafter be used and no building or part thereof shall be erected, moved, or altered unless for a use expressly permitted by and in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located, whether operated for or without compensation. 
 
3.02 NON-CONFORMITIES (Amended 1/6/2011) 
 
It is the intent of this ordinance to recognize that the elimination, as expeditiously as is reasonable, of the existing buildings and structures or uses that are not in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance is as much a subject of health, safety, and welfare as is the prevention of the establishment of new uses that would violate the provisions of this ordinance.  It is also the intent of this ordinance to so administer the elimination of nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures as to avoid an unreasonable invasion of established private property rights.  Lawful nonconforming uses, buildings, and structures existing at the time of the passage of this ordinance or any amendment thereto, shall be allowed to remain subject to the following provisions: 
 
1. A nonconforming use of land shall be restricted to the area occupied by such use as of the effective date of this ordinance.  A nonconforming use of a building or buildings shall not be enlarged to either additional land or buildings after the effective date of this ordinance. 
 
2. The lawful use of land existing at the time of passage of this Ordinance, although such use may not conform to the provisions hereof, may be continued, but if such nonconforming use is discontinued for a period exceeding six (6) months, the future use of said land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.   
 
 Any nonconforming mobile home shall be removed and not subject to replacement in compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance under any of the following conditions: 
 
a. A mobile home is not occupied for residential use for a period of six (6) months. 
 
b. The mobile home deteriorates to an unsafe or uninhabitable condition as determined by the Zoning or Building Official, in which case, the mobile home must either be removed from the property thus requiring any new structure to be in compliance with the zoning ordinance in an R-1 and R-2 zoning district, or it can be replaced with a newer mobile home that is structurally, physically, and visually sound in any zoning district except  R-1 and R-2. 
 
c. If a mobile home is damaged by fire, flood, wind, or other act of God or man, it can be replaced with a newer mobile home that is structurally, physically, and visually sound within the original footprint or building setback lines in any zoning district except R-1 and R-2. 
 
 If any mobile home loses its legal nonconforming status, it shall be moved within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Zoning or Building Official or his agent. 
 
3. Any nonconforming building or nonconforming use, which is damaged by fire, flood, wind, or other act of God or man, may be reconstructed and used as before, provided a building permit has been obtained from the Dunlap Building Inspector within six (6) months of such damage.  After obtaining a building permit, the owner is entitled to no more than one-year (1) to complete any repairs or rebuilding, after which time a lack of progress shall require the use of land to be in conformance with the current zoning district.  Any structure that will be replaced in its entirety, with the exception of mobile homes as stated above, shall be of a similar use to the proceeding structure, and it shall maintain the same building footprint as the previous structure.  The replaced structure shall only be enlarged if portions of the structure that are outside of the original footprint can meet current building setbacks as prescribed by the zoning district where it is located.  If property of a non-conforming use is subdivided, then any subsequent lot and use shall be in conformity with the current zoning requirements of the specified zoning district. 
 
4. A nonconforming building or building which houses a nonconforming use shall not be structurally altered except in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.  This provision shall not be construed to prevent normal maintenance 
and repairs of alterations that are required for structural safety or to enhance the appearance of the building. 
 
5. An existing nonconforming use shall meet the requirements of the Dunlap Municipal Floodplain Zoning Ordinance if it is located in an area designated as a floodplain or floodway on the National Flood Insurance Rate Maps. 
 
6. Industrial, commercial, or business establishments that are considered to be non-conforming uses under the current zoning ordinance shall be governed by the requirements of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 13-7-208. 
 
 
03.03 ERECTION OF ONE (1) PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE ON A LOT. 
 
Only one (1) principal building and its customary accessory building(s) may hereafter be erected on any one (1) lot.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant a special exception to this requirement in a residential zone provided the following criteria can be met. 
 
1. Both principal structures must have access from a public road 


 
2. Each principal structure must meet the minimum square footage requirements independently from each other 


 
3. Both structures must meet the minimum setback requirements of this Ordinance 


 
 
03.04 REDUCTION IN LOT AREA PROHIBITED. 
 
No lot, even though it may consist of one (1) or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in area so that yards, lot area per family, lot width, building area, or other requirements of this Ordinance are not maintained.  This section shall not apply when a portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose. 
 
03.05 REQUIRED YARD CANNOT BE USED BY ANOTHER BUILDING.

03.07 REAR YARD ABUTTING A PUBLIC STREET. 
 
When the rear yard of a lot abuts a public street, all structures built in that rear yard shall observe the same setback from the street line, center line of the street, or property line as required for adjacent properties which front on that street.  In addition, any structure located within twenty-five (25) feet of that setback line shall be no closer to any side property line than the distance required for side yards on adjoining properties fronting on that street.   
 
03.08 OBSTRUCTION OF VISION AT STREET INTERSECTION PROHIBITED. 
 
On a corner lot not in a C-2 Central Business District, within the area formed by the center lines of the intersecting or intercepting streets and a line joining points on such center lines at a distance of twenty (20) feet from their intersection, there shall be no obstruction to vision between a height of three (3) feet and a height of fifteen (15) feet above the average grade of each street at the center line thereof.  The requirements of this section shall not be construed to prohibit any necessary temporary retaining wall. 
 
Any plans to build a permanent retaining wall that does not meet the requirements of this section shall be submitted to the BZA for approval, prior to the start of construction of said structure.   
 
03.09 OFF-STREET AUTOMOBILE PARKING.  (amended 1/5/06)

03.18.  RESIDENTIAL TOWNHOUSE AND PATIO HOME (RT-PH) REGULATIONS.  (added 3/6/08) 
 
A. Purpose: 
 
In Dunlap’s residential zoning districts, fee-simple townhouses and patio homes are allowed to increase the variety of available housing choices.  Within these districts townhouse units and patio homes can be developed and sold as individually-deeded lots in fee-simple to those who desire this type of low-maintenance home, provided the developer follows the specific regulations established in this section for "zero lot line" townhouse units or patio homes. 
 
B. Definitions: 
 
1. RESIDENTIAL TOWNHOUSES:  A "townhouse" is defined as a single-family residential dwelling of one or more floors, having or appearing to have a common wall or adjoining roof line with an adjacent similar unit or units. 
 
2. PATIO HOMES:  A "patio home" for the purposes of the Dunlap Municipal Zoning Ordinance shall be defined as a single-family residential dwelling of one or more floors, which does not have any common walls shared with an adjacent unit or units, but which is located to one side of a less than standard width lot.  That is, these homes have a "zero foot" setback on one side to maximize the amount of usable outdoor lot area on the other side for a patio, landscaped garden, or other outdoor living area. 
 
C. Regulations for Townhouses: 
 
All townhouse complexes shall incorporate the following features which have proved to provide the most attractive developments: 
 
1. They shall contain between two (2) and six (6) units in each building; 
 
2. Each townhouse shall have an architectural character that is individual yet compatible with its neighbors; 
 
3. The front facades shall be off-set horizontally and the roof lines shall be off-set vertically from one another to avoid the appearance of an apartment building; 
 
4. One story units, when used, shall be placed on the end of a building. 
 
 Since a townhouse complex involves common walls unlike the patio home, some separate requirements are necessary to each type of development.  (Note:  The regulations in Section E also apply to townhouses.) 
 
5. Subdivision Plat Approval Procedure for Townhouse Construction: 
 (Amended 4/1/10) 
 
 Since it is intended that the land in a townhouse development be used for owner-occupied townhouses, each townhouse shall occupy a separate subdivision lot.  Since the townhouses are joined or appear to be joined, they shall be built as entire units. 
 
Therefore, to prevent the sale of individual unbuilt lots, individual lots and/or townhouse units can neither be sold nor can a deed be transferred except in accordance with the following subdivision and development process: 
 
a. Prepare a site plan and a preliminary major subdivision plat for the proposed townhouse development.  The site plan and preliminary plat may be combined into one drawing, but it must show all proposed lot lines, building footprints, roadways and right-of-ways, waterlines and fire hydrants, sewer lines, and all other requirements as are customary with the preliminary plat requirements found in the Dunlap Subdivision Regulations and the Site Plan requirements found in Section 3.17 of the Dunlap Zoning Ordinance (Major lots are those which shall each contain a row of several townhouses.) 


 
b. Present the site plan and the preliminary subdivision plat to the Dunlap Municipal Planning Commission and obtain approval of both.  (The site plan shall be accompanied by a statement showing that no contract for rental subsidy exists with any governmental agency nor will be added in the future.) 
 
c. Proceed to construct the required streets, etc., and the building units according to the approved preliminary plat and site plan after obtaining all necessary building permits.  The Building Inspector may issue a building permit after being presented a site plan and an approved preliminary plat.  (This may be done for the entire development or may be done in two or more phases.)  If a building permit is issued prior to the recording of a final plat, then a final plat shall not be approved by the Planning Commission for any lot(s) or unit(s) until a surveyor can certify that the common lot line is indeed the dividing or common wall of the townhouse structure.   
 
 Alternative #2 
 
 The developer may seek the Planning Commission’s approval of a final plat prior to the completion of the townhouse units, provided the developer submits an additional construction 
drawing (site plan) for each phase once a common wall has been established.  The final plat under this method is subject to all of the standard requirements of subdividing property in the City of Dunlap (including the acceptance by the City of a bond or letter of credit for all incomplete infrastructure). The construction drawing must show the building(s) and the property lines, and it shall be certified by a registered land surveyor stating that the common walls were built exactly on the property line(s).  The construction drawings should be submitted to the Dunlap Building Inspector for review and approval, and the construction drawing shall be recorded with the final plat in the Sequatchie County Register of Deed’s Office.  Should the common wall(s) not be built exactly on the property line(s), then a corrective final plat shall be resubmitted to the Planning Commission for approval.  It should be noted that in no case shall a building setback variance be granted if the end units of the townhouse building will violate exterior building setbacks (including setbacks from other townhouse buildings).  It is the developer’s responsibility in coordinating the location of the buildings with a registered land surveyor.  The developer should be cognizant in designing the lots so that the exterior townhouse units will not border on the building setback limits.  This will allow the developer some flexibility in altering the lot lines that divide the townhouse units. 
 
d. Present final plat of the built-up phases to city staff for inspection and verification and then to the Dunlap Municipal Planning Commission for final subdivision approval.  (The final plat shall show the individual lot lines exactly where the side walls of the individual units were built.) 
 
e. If all the final subdivision requirements of the Dunlap Subdivision Regulations have been met or adequate bonds posted, the planning commission shall grant final subdivision approval for the phases that have been constructed with townhouses. 
 
  f. The developer records this final plat and can then    sell these townhouse units.

D. Height Regulations 
 
The height restrictions of the C-1 zoning district shall apply within Planned Unit Developments. 
 
E. Access 
 
Lots may be served by a properly dedicated public street or a private easement built to the City’s Standards for the construction of streets as specified in the Subdivision Regulations of the City of Dunlap.  In no case shall the dedicated right-of-way of the public or private street be less than fifty (50) feet. 
 
Each building lot within the development shall front upon a public street or private easement for at least fifty (50) feet.  All other Access Control requirements found in Section 03.11 of the Dunlap Zoning Ordinance shall apply

B. Final Plat: 


 
Within one year after approval of the preliminary plat (plan), the owner or lessee shall present a final plat (plan) to the Planning Commission.  The final plat (plan) shall substantially conform to the preliminary plat (plan).  If a final plat (plan) is disapproved by the Planning Commission, the applicant may resubmit a final plat (plan) which substantially conforms to the approved preliminary plat (plan), or the applicant may request an amendment to the approved preliminary plat (plan) from the Planning Commission.  
 
The final plat submitted must be in substantial conformance with the preliminary plat.  Plats containing minor changes from the approved preliminary plat may be found to be in substantial conformity and approved for further processing and final action.  Any increase in density or intensity of use, any decrease in common areas, or shifting of structures within the development shall be deemed to be a substantial deviation and shall require an amendment of the preliminary plat prior to further action by the Planning Commission.

03.21. STANDARDS FOR FENCES AND RETAINING WALLS (Added 10-6-2011) 
For the purposes of this Ordinance, this section shall apply to all properties in all zoning districts of the City of Dunlap, Tennessee.  The purpose of these regulations are to allow for the construction of fences and retaining walls along property lines of private property while not encroaching on neighboring properties, thus resulting in boundary line disputes. 
 
1.  For any fence or retaining wall that is to be constructed on or along property lines, that crosses multiple parcels of property, and/or is located outside of the building setbacks, approval of the Dunlap Building Official shall be required.  A permit shall be obtained from the City, and the proposed design shall be in compliance with the standards herein. 
 
2.  A survey, prepared by a professional land surveyor, shall be submitted along with the Fence and Retaining Wall Permit Application.  The survey shall show the exact location of the property lines as well as the proposed location of the fence and/or retaining wall.  The surveyor will also be able to assist the property owner in determining the exact location of the fence and/or retaining wall so as not to encroach on neighboring properties.  A survey may not be required if all property owners adjoining the property line where the fence and/or retaining wall is to be constructed agree to its location.  If a survey is not required, then all affected property owners shall submit a letter to the Building Official stating that they agree to the location of the fence and/or retaining wall, and they shall also be required to sign the permit application. 
 
3.  The “good side” or the “attractive side” of the fence and/or retaining wall shall face the neighboring properties. 
 
03.22 Self-Service Storage Facilities (Mini-Warehouses) (Added 4-22-2016)

13.01. DISTRICT DESCRIPTION 
For the purposes of this Ordinance, the Sequatchie River Recreational Zoning Overlay District is an area that serves the combined purposes of recreation, open space preservation, floodplain management, wildlife protection and scenic resource preservation in special flood hazard areas that are designated on the National Flood Insurance Rate Maps for Sequatchie County, Tennessee.  This district is intended to protect environmentally sensitive areas along the Sequatchie River and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Dunlap, Tennessee, by allowing flexibility in permitted land uses, while adhering to the general lot requirements of the underlying zoning district as well as the restrictions placed on development in special flood hazard areas.  The overlay district is not meant to replace the zoning designation or requirements of the underlying district, but rather its purpose is to add additional land use options for property that is located in special flood hazard areas.  All dimensional and building setback requirements are determined by the underlying zoning district.   
 
13.02. USES PERMITTED 
The following uses are permitted provided the conditions of Section 13.03 are met: 
 
1. Camping  
 
2. Parking & Using a Recreational Vehicle (RV) as a Temporary Dwelling

1. Application.  An application shall be filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals for review.  Said application shall show the location and intended use of the site, the names of the property owners, and existing land uses 


within two hundred (200) feet, and any other material pertinent to the request which the Board of Zoning Appeals may require.

15.08. CUSTOMARY HOME OCCUPATIONS. (Amended 4-22-2016) 
 
A home occupation is a gainful occupation or profession conducted by members of a family residing on the premises and conducted within the principal dwelling unit or in an approved accessory building.  In connection with a home occupation, no stock or trade shall be displayed outside the dwelling, and no alteration shall be made to the exterior of the structure that would indicate a use other than as a residential dwelling; this shall also include accessory buildings.   
 
Those wishing to establish a customary home occupation must first complete a zoning compliance application.  If the use complies with the following standards then the Dunlap Codes Enforcement and/or the BZA will make a determination as to whether or not the use is acceptable for the zoning district in which the home occupation will be located.   
 
A business license may not be issued for a customary home occupation operating in a residential district until a zoning compliance form has been approved by the City of Dunlap.  The customary home occupation must comply with the following standards: 
 
1.  NO more than one person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in such occupation. 
 
2.   The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential purposes by its occupants.  Not more than twenty-five (25) percent of the floor area of the dwelling unit shall be used in the conduct of the home occupation. 
 
3. There shall be no change in the outside appearance of the building or premises, no outdoor storage of any type, and no other visible evidence of the conduct of such home occupation. 
 
4. No traffic shall be generated by such home occupation in greater volume than would normally be expected in a residential neighborhood, and any need for parking generated by the conduct of such home occupation shall be off-street 
in areas other than the front yard.  This paragraph is not intended to prohibit home occupations that would generate minor amounts of traffic that would not be out of character with a residential neighborhood such as: a one-chair hair salon, in-home teaching of piano lessons, in-home photography, book keeping, typing, or similar services where customers or clients may come to the home in small numbers throughout the workday. 
 
5. No equipment or process shall be used in such home occupation which increases noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or electrical interference detectable to the normal senses on neighboring properties.   
 
6. The home occupation shall not increase the type or volume of solid waste for curb-side disposal beyond what a typical household would produce. 
 
7. Vehicles used in a resident’s line of work such as buses, heavy trucks, machinery, etc. shall be parked on the lot of the customary home occupation and not on a city street.  The vehicle(s) shall be parked on a paved or graveled surface to the side or rear of the principal residential structure.  The owner shall be limited in the number of vehicles and/or equipment that can be parked on the property, and if questions arise over what is considered reasonable then the Dunlap BZA shall make a ruling on a case by case basis.  Determining a reasonable number of vehicles and/or equipment allowed on the property of a customary home occupation should at least be based on the following: 1.) the lot must be suitable to accommodate said vehicles and/or equipment within the bounds of the lot, 2.) parking of vehicles and/or equipment shall not impose any undue nuisances on neighboring property owners, 3.) the use for parking shall not create smells, odors, or any liquid runoff onto neighboring properties, and 4.) the size of the property and proximity to neighboring properties may be taken into consideration in determining the maximum number of vehicles and/or equipment.  This section does not permit the storage of junk vehicles, repossessed or impounded vehicles, vehicles offered for sale by a licensed dealer, or vehicles that are inoperable. 
 
8. A change in ownership or rental status on the property of an approved customary home occupation does not permit future owners or tenants to continue the use as a customary home occupation.  New owners or tenants must complete a zoning compliance application. 
 
Any seemingly compliant customary home occupation may be issued a compliance permit by the Dunlap Codes Enforcement Officer for businesses that do not generate any traffic or involve customers coming to the home.  For home occupations that do generate customer traffic or when questions arise regarding the legality of specific home occupations, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall determine whether said home occupation is in compliance with the above restrictions and is compatible with the district in which said home occupation is located. However, activities such as dancing instruction, band instrument instruction (except piano instruction), tea rooms, tourist homes, real estate offices, convalescent homes, mortuaries, animal clinics, retail sales businesses, automotive or small engine repair shops, daycares for more than four (4) children or adults, or any other activity deemed by the BZA to be incompatible with the district or a potential nuisance to the surrounding area shall not constitute an acceptable home occupation. 
 
 
15.09. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR CEMETERIES.   
 
1. Development Standards.  The following standards shall be imposed upon the development and construction of cemeteries in the City of Dunlap.   


 
a. The site proposed for a cemetery shall not interfere with the development of a system of collector and larger streets in the vicinity of such site.  In addition, such site shall have direct access to a thoroughfare.   


 
b. Any new cemetery shall be located on a site containing not less than twenty (20) acres. 


 
c. All structures, including, but not limited to, mausoleums, permanent monuments, or maintenance buildings shall be set back not less than twenty-five (25) feet from any property line or street right-of-way line.   


 
d. All graves or burial lots shall be set back not less than twenty-five (25) feet from any property line or street right-of-way line.   


 
2. Application for Cemetery Permit.  No person shall develop, construct, or maintain a cemetery in the City of Dunlap until he has secured a permit from the Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals.  An application for said permit shall be filed in accordance with Section 15.07 of this Ordinance and shall be accompanied by a detailed site plan, a schedule for construction, and other information herein required.  Said application shall be processed in the following manner.   


 
a. The written application, plans, schedules, and other information as herein required shall be submitted to the Dunlap Municipal Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall duly review the materials and submit its recommendation to the Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals. 


 
b. The Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant final approval or disapproval of the permit after reviewing the Planning Commission’s recommendations.  If the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals is contrary to the recommendations of the Dunlap Planning Commission, then a favorable vote of a majority of the entire Board membership shall be required before a permit may be granted or refused.   


 
 
 
15.10. PROCEDURE FOR PERMITTING A SECONDARY RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURE.  (Amended 6/1/06) 
 
The requirements in the following sections must be met in order for an applicant to obtain a temporary permit to use a manufactured home as a temporary second residential structure on a lot.   
 
1. Eligibility.  Eligibility will be determined by the Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) based on the following. 


 
a. The immediate family member of the owner-occupant that is to be housed in this temporary structure must be physically or mentally incapacitated to the point that twenty-four (24) hour supervision and care are required. 


 
b. The immediate family member requiring care must provide medical documentation to his/her present physical or mental condition and show proof that his/her condition requires twenty-four (24) hour supervision and care.  The family member’s name should be listed on the application.

2. Permit Procedure. 


 
a. Owner-occupant must file an application with the Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals for review.  Said application must show applicant’s name, applicant’s parcel and how it is zoned; the location of the temporary mobile home on the lot; the names of the adjoining property owners, and the surrounding land uses.  Adjoining property owners will be notified by mail of the BZA hearing by the City of Dunlap.  The application should be completely filled out and turned in to the Building Inspector, along with a $25 fee to cover cost of mail and administration.   


 
b. Applications reviewed by the Dunlap Board of Zoning Appeals shall be decided within thirty (30) days of the date of the application, and the applicant shall be provided with a written notice of approval or denial. 


 
c. The owner should provide a sketch plan of the property showing all structures with setbacks, and the temporary mobile home must meet all setback requirements.  The setback between structures 


must be twice the side setback of the zoning district where the property is located.  Setback requirements will vary depending upon which residential district the applicant is located in. 


 
d. The temporary mobile home must meet all the requirements of the Sequatchie County Health Department concerning septic tank and field lines for the temporary structure, or have access to municipal wastewater (sewer). 


 
e. If granted, the length of the permit shall be one (1) year and can be renewed annually upon review by the board of Zoning Appeals.  


 
f. The Building Inspector can at any time review the property to verify that the property owner and/or temporary resident has not changed and the situation remains the same as what the BZA approved.  Upon request of the Building Inspector, the BZA should hold a hearing within 30 days of the request to review a temporary structure.  The Building Inspector upon a ruling to terminate by the BZA can terminate the temporary structure permit. 


 
g. When a decision to terminate has been made or the original situation no longer exists to require the temporary structure and it becomes necessary for the City of Dunlap to initiate proceedings to force removal of any non-conforming structures, the property owner will be responsible for and will reimburse the City of Dunlap for any cost for enforcement, removal of structure, and legal fees.  Such shall apply even if the property owner has transferred the subject property during the period of the approved exemption if the non-conforming use extends past the approved time period.  


 
h. When the original situation no longer exists as stated on the application or the BZA rules to terminate a permit, the property owner will have a maximum of three months to remove the temporary structure.   16.01. BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED

16.07. VARIANCES. 
 
The purpose of this subsection is to modify the strict application of the specific requirements of this Ordinance in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow, or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship which would deprive an owner of the reasonable use of his land.  The variance shall be used only where necessary to overcome some obstacle which is preventing an owner from using his property under this Ordinance.   
 
1. Application.  After written denial of a permit, a property owner may make application for a variance using the standard form made available by the Board of Zoning Appeals.   


 
2. Hearings.  Upon receipt of an application and a ten dollar ($10.00) fee, the BZA shall hold a hearing to decide whether a variance to the Ordinance provisions is, in fact, necessary to relieve unnecessary hardships which act to deprive the property owner of the reasonable use of his land.  The Board shall consider and decide all applications for variances within thirty (30) days of such hearing and in accordance with the standards provided Section 16.07 as set forth below.   


 
3. Standards for Variances.  In granting a variance, the BZA shall ascertain that the following criteria are met.   


 
a. Variances shall be granted only where special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the findings of the BZA, do not apply generally in the district 


 
b. Variances shall not be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded from the particular district in which requested  


 
c. For reasons set fully forth in the findings of the BZA, the aforesaid circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of any reasonable use of his land; mere loss in value shall not justify a variance—there must be a deprivation of beneficial use of land 


 
d. The granting of any variance shall be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this Ordinance and shall not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to the public welfare, or in conflict with the comprehensive plan for development 


 
e. In reviewing an application for a variance, the burden of showing that the variance should be granted shall be upon the person applying therefore 17.01. AMENDMENTS 

17.02. ENACTMENT

2. Areas of the City of Dunlap, Tennessee are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
 
3. Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
 
 
Section C. Statement of Purpose 
 
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas.  This Ordinance is designed to: 
 
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities; 
 
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
 
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; 
 
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion;  
 
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
 
 
Section D. Objectives 
 
The objectives of this Ordinance are: 
 
1. To protect human life, health, safety and property; 
 
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects; 
 
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
 
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
 
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodprone areas; 
 
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in flood areas; 
 
7. To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a floodprone area; 
 
8. To maintain eligibility for participation in the NFIP.

The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles. 
 
5. New construction and substantial improvements of buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V, Sections A and B.  Within approximate A Zones, require that those subsections of Article V Section B dealing with the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as required.   
 
 
Section F. Standards For Areas of Shallow Flooding (AO and AH Zones) 
 
Located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas established in Article III, Section B, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas.  These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition to those set forth in Article V, Sections A and B, apply: 
 
1. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to at least one (1) foot above as many feet as the depth number specified on the FIRM’s, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade.  If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.  Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article V, Section B. 
 
2. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation.  The structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at least one (1) foot above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade.  A Tennessee registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for 
meeting the provisions of this Ordinance and shall provide such certification to the Administrator as set forth above and as required in accordance with Article IV, Section B. 
 
3. Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
 
 
 
 
Section G. Standards For Areas Protected by Flood Protection System (A-99 Zones) 
 
Located within the Areas of Special Flood Hazard established in Article III, Section B, are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection system but where Base Flood Elevations have not been determined.  Within these areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of Article IV and Article V shall apply. 
 
 
Section H. Standards for Unmapped Streams 
 
Located within the City of Dunlap, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood hazard are neither indicated nor identified.  Adjacent to such streams, the following provisions shall apply: 
 
1. No encroachments including fill material or other development including structures shall be located within an area of at least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point within the locality. 
 
2. When a new flood hazard risk zone, and Base Flood Elevation and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the standards  established in accordance with Articles IV and V.

PURSUANT TO THE AUTHORITY SET FORTH IN SECTION 13-4-301 THROUGH SECTION 13-4-309, TENNESSEE CODE ANNOTATED, AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROMOTING THE HEALTH, SAFETY, MORALS, CONVENIENCE, ORDER, PROSPERITY, AND GENERAL WELFARE OF THE CITY; TO ENCOURAGE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND STABLE LAND DEVELOPMENT; TO ASSURE THE PROVISION OF REQUIRED STREETS, UTILITIES, AND OTHER FACILITIES AND SERVICES TO LAND DEVELOPMENTS; TO ASSURE THE ADEQUATE PROVISION OF SAFE AND CONVENIENT TRAFFIC ACCESS AND CIRCULATION, BOTH VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN, IN LAND DEVELOPMENT; TO ASSURE THE PROVISION OF NEEDED PUBLIC OPEN SPACES AND BUILDING SITES IN LAND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE DEDICATION OR RESERVATION OF LAND FOR RECREATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL, AND OTHER PUBLIC PURPOSES; AND TO ASSURE THAT LAND IS DEVELOPED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN OF DUNLAP, TENNESSEE, THE MUNICIPAL PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF DUNLAP, TENNESSEE, DOES ORDAIN AND ENACT THE FOLLOWING CHAPTERS AND SECTIONS. 
 
01.01. Purpose. 
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community development.  Once land has been divided into streets, lots and blocks and publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.  Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that roads and streets must be maintained and various public services must be provided.  It is therefore in the interest of the public, the developer and the future owner that subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with sound rules and proper minimum standards. 
 
01.02. Enactment Clause. 
In pursuance of the authority set forth in Section 13-4-301 through 13-4-309, of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and for the purpose of promoting the health, safety, morals, convenience, order, prosperity, and general welfare of the municipality; to encourage economically sound and stable land development; to assure the provision of required streets, utilities and other facilities and services to land developments; to assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in land development; to assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building sites in land developments through the dedication or reservation of land for recreational, educational and other public purposes; and to assure that land is developer in conformity with Comprehensive Plan of Dunlap, the Municipal Planning Commission of Dunlap Tennessee ordain and enact the following Chapters and Sections: 
 
01.03. Short Title. 
This document shall be known and may be cited as the Subdivision Regulations of Dunlap, Tennessee. 
CHAPTER 2

Section: 
04.00. Suitability of Land 
04.01. Name of Subdivision 
04.02. Access 
04.03. Public Use Areas 
04.04. Block Lengths and Widths

04.00. Suitability of Land. 
The planning commission shall not approve the subdivision of land if from adequate investigations is deemed unsuitable for platting and development purposes of the kind proposed. 
 
Land within the floodways shall not be platted for residential occupancy or building sites, but may be used in calculating overall lot size.  Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not be endangered by periodic or occasional inundation and extreme water velocities. 
 
Land located in floodway fringe areas may be platted for residential occupancy or for such other uses which will not increase the flood hazard, endanger health, life, or property, or aggravate erosion provided a notation of the flood hazard is shown on the plat and provided the lot has a flood-free building site.  In applying this provision, land below the elevation of the 100-year flood shall be considered subject to periodic flooding. 
 
The elevation of these controls shall be determined from the "Flood Insurance Study" and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Maps (effective 9-6-88), and any subsequent revisions thereto developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are made part of these regulations. 
 
Fill may not be used to raise land within the floodway area.  In other areas subject to flood, fill may be used provided the proposed fill does not restrict the flow of water or increase flood heights. 
 
04.01. Name of Subdivision. 
The name of the subdivision must have the approval of the planning commission.  The name shall not duplicate or closely approximate the name of an existing subdivision. 
 
04.02. Access. (Amended 6/24/2013) 
Access to every subdivision shall be provided over a public road.  Access may also be provided over a private road or private vehicular access easement according to Section 05.07 and Section 05.07.01 of these regulations. 
 
 
 
04.03. Public Use Areas. 
When public use features or other plans adopted by the planning commission are located in whole or in part in a subdivision, land for such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within one (1) year by the appropriate public agency. 
 
The planning commission shall refuse to approve the plat and shall notify the governing body of the reasons for such action whenever it finds a dedication of land to public uses is not required or suitable for such use. 
 
Where public use is to be made of the property and the residents of the subdivision will receive benefit, the dedication of the property should be encouraged.  Where the public use is for the public as a whole, the community should pay proportionately for the acquisition of reserved areas within a reasonable time.  A reasonable time is to be determined according to the circumstance--the subdivider should not be required to hold his land idle for a lengthy, indefinite period. 
 
04.04. Block Lengths and Widths. 
Block lengths and widths shall be as follows: 
 
1. Blocks shall be no shorter than two hundred (200) feet nor longer than twelve hundred (1,200) feet in length, except in unusual circumstances. 
 
2. Blocks shall be wide enough to provide two (2) tiers of lots of minimum depth, except where abutting upon major streets or where other situations make this requirement impractical. 
 
04.05. Flood Protection Elevation. 
Each lot in a subdivision shall contain a flood-free building site outside the limits of any existing easement or the building setback lines as required by these regulations.  The finished floor elevation for a concrete slab on-grade type of structure or the bottom of the floor joist for a crawl-space type of structure shall be a minimum of one (1) foot above the 100-year flood elevation. 
 
04.06. Lot Sizes. 
Residential lots shall not be less than seventy-five (75) feet wide at the building setback line.  Other lot size requirements follow. 
 
1. Residential lots shall have a depth of not less than one hundred (100) feet and not greater than three (3) times the width of the lot at the building line, unless unusual circumstances make these limitations impractical. 
 
2. Lots not served public water or sewer systems shall be at least fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet in area or of a size specified by the county health authority; the minimum distance between the septic tank and well shall be one hundred (100) feet. 
 
3. Where lots are served by public sewer and public water system, minimum lot size shall be seven thousand five hundred (7,500) square feet. 
 
4. Corner lots shall have adequate width to meet building setback requirements for both abutting streets. 
 
5. Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate in size to provide service areas and off-street parking suitable for the type of use and development contemplated. 
 
6. Land shall not be platted for commercial or industrial purposes unless the subdivider can demonstrate that each lot provides: 
 
(A) A site that does not unduly interfere with through traffic,

(C) Insulation against any adverse effect on any present or future adjacent residences, 
 
(D) A parcel size sufficient in area to allow future expansions. 
 
04.07. Lot Lines. 
All lot lines shall be perpendicular or radial to the street lines, unless impractical because of topographic or other features. 
 
04.08. Building Setback Lines. 
All building setback lines shall be measured from the property line.  Minimum building setback lines shall be as follows: 
 
1. Front yard setback: 
 (A) Major Thoroughfares .......................................................30 feet

In cases where a drainage or other easement is required on the plat, setbacks may be increased. 
 
04.09. Lot Abutting Public Streets. 
Each lot shall abut for at least fifty (50) feet upon a dedicated public street. 
 
04.10. Double Frontage Lots. 
Double frontage lots should be avoided, except to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. 
 
04.11. Reverse Frontage Lots. 
Reverse frontage lots should be encouraged where essential to provide separate residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.  Reverse frontage lots shall have a depth of not less than one hundred fifty (150) feet.  A planted evergreen buffer strip, at least ten (10) feet wide, shall be provided along the lot lines which abut the traffic artery of highest classification.  (An earthen berm or opaque fence may be used in lieu of an evergreen buffer strip.) 
 
04.12. Flag Lots. 
Flag lots may be allowed and shall meet the following criteria: 
 
1. For flag lots of one (1) acre or less, the access strip shall be a maximum of 200 feet in length and a minimum of 20 feet in width; 
 
2. For flag lots of more than one (1) acre, the access strip shall be a maximum of 500 feet in length and a minimum of 50 feet in width.  (This additional width will allow for the construction of a public street if the flag lot is ever re-subdivided.); 
 
3. The overall subdivision shall be designed so that the point where the access strip of the flag lot abuts the public street shall be safe for vehicular ingress and egress as far a visibility and grade are concerned since, unlike the purchaser of a conventional lot, the owner of a flag lot will have no other choice as to driveway location.  (The safety of this location is even more important if the flag lot is ever made into a subdivision, containing several lots.); 
 
4. Whenever a fifty (50) foot wide access strip is required, the developer shall locate it in a position where: 
 
 (A) the grade could meet the specifications of section 05.12.; 
 
 (B) the intersection for of ingress and egress is safe for vehicular traffic; 
 
5. Within the portion of the flag lot which does not include the access strip the various building setbacks for front, side and rear shall still apply and be measured from the boundaries of the portion excluding the access strip; 
 
6. Minimum lot sizes shall be calculated, excluding the access strip.

Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for multi-family, commercial, or industrial developments, but shall not be provided in one- and two-family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence satisfactory to the planning commission of the need for alleys. 
 
05.07. Private Streets and Reserve Strips. (Amended 6/24/2013) 
There shall be no private streets or private vehicular access easements platted in any subdivision or deeded to any property owner unless it meets the standards contained herein and has been approved by the Dunlap Municipal Planning Commission.  Depending on the number of lots that will be served by a private right-of-way, there are several options that will allow access to property that otherwise does not front upon a public street.  In all cases, the right-of-way whether it be for a private road or private vehicular access easement shall be no less than fifty (50) feet in width. 
 
1.  Access Serving 1-2 Lots 
In cases where proposed lots will not front upon a public street, a private vehicular access easement of at least fifty (50) feet in width may be platted to serve the newly created lots.  The deeds must reference the easement, which shall allow for access and the extension of utilities.  The deeds must also state that access will be granted in perpetuity until such time as access can be provided by a public street or by an extension of real property that would connect each individual subdivided lot to a public street. 
 
2.  Access Serving 3-4 Lots 
In cases where proposed lots will not front upon a public street, a private road may be constructed to serve the proposed lots.  A right-of-way or easement of at least fifty (50) feet shall be provided.  A road surface of at least two (2) inches of compacted crusher run gravel that is at least sixteen (16) feet wide shall also be provided.  The deeds must reference the private road, which shall allow for access and the extension of utilities.  The deeds must also sate that access will be granted in perpetuity until such time as access can be provided by a public street or by an extension of real property that would connect each individual subdivided lot to a public street.   
 
3.  Access Serving 5 or More Lots 
In cases where proposed lots will not front upon a public street, a private road may be constructed to serve the proposed lots.  A right-of-way or easement of at least fifty (50) feet shall be provided.  The surface of the road shall be the same as required for newly constructed streets in the City of Dunlap, which are contained in these regulations.  The deeds must reference the private road, which shall allow for access and the extension of utilities.  The deeds must also sate that access will be granted in perpetuity until such time as access can be provided by a public street or by an extension of real property that would connect each individual subdivided lot to a public street.   
 
05.07.01. Additional Requirements for Private Roads and Private Vehicular Access Easements. 
(Amended 6/24/2013) 
a. Private road and private vehicular access easement improvements shall be maintained either by the owner, a legally established home-owner’s 
association, or other similar group approved by the Planning Commission, and not by the Government of the City of Dunlap. The legal documents establishing the private right-of-way shall be submitted with the final plat for review and approval and shall be recorded with the final plat and deed for each property. 
 
b. All desired utilities are the responsibility of the owner, a legally established home-owner’s association, or other similar group approved by the Planning Commission. The Government of the City of Dunlap is not responsible for providing services beyond the limits of a public road. 
c. If, at any future date, a private road or private vehicular access easement is submitted for acceptance as a public street, it shall first be submitted to the Planning Commission for review.  In considering the easement for approval as a public street, the Planning Commission shall require the improvements to the easements to meet the minimum street construction standards in effect at the time the request for public acceptance is made.  Once the street has been built to the appropriate standard it shall be inspected by the Dunlap Field Superintendent prior to a request being made to the Dunlap Board of Mayor and Commissioners for acceptance into the City’s street system. 
 
d. The private road or private vehicular access easement must have access to a public street, but shall not connect between two (2) or more public roads. 
 
e. No lot shall be bought or sold, or deed transferred, until all private road or private vehicular access easement requirements have been met. 
 
05.08. Easements. 
Easements having a minimum width of ten (10) feet shall be provided where deemed necessary for utility lines and underground mains and cables.  Easements of the same or greater width shall be required along the lines of, or across, lots where necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities. 
 
Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage-way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm water or drainage easement of adequate width. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
05.09. Street Right-of Way Widths. 
The right-of-way width shall be the distance across a street from property line to property line.  Minimum street right-of-way widths shall be as follows:

7. Temporary Cul-de-sacs .......................................................... 50 feet 
 
Where the opinion of the planning commission it is desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property, proposed streets shall be extended by dedicating to the boundary of such property.  Such dead-end streets shall be provided with a temporary turn-around approved by the planning commission.  Adequate rights-of-way shall be dedicated to connect with any temporary dead-end street adjoining the subdivision. 
 
05.10. Additional Width on Existing Streets. 
Subdivisions that abut existing streets shall dedicate additional right-of-way to meet the minimum street requirements as follows: 
 
1. The entire right-of-way shall be dedicated where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street. 
 
2. Where the subdivision is located on one side of an existing street, the amount of dedicated right-of-way shall be dedicated: 
 
(A) If the land across the roadway from the proposed subdivision has not been subdivided or developed, the subdivider is only required to dedicate one-half of the required right-of-way, measured from the centerline of the existing roadway. 
 
(B) If the land across the roadway has been subdivided or developed, the subdivider is required to provide enough additional right-of-way on his side of the roadway to bring the total right-of-way to the required width in no case shall the right-of-way be less than forty (40) feet. 
 
3. In cases where the rights-of-way in excess of fifty (50) feet are required, additional widths shall be reserved, and when used, just compensation therefore shall be paid by the condemning authority. 
 
05.11. Minimum Pavement Widths.

4. Cul-de-sacs…same as local, with 40 foot pavement width  


 for turn around 
*Greater widths may be required by the DMPC. 
Each subdivision plat will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  The planning commission reserves the right to increase the minimum surface width if through its plat review the planning commission finds the type of development proposed warrants a larger minimum surface width. 
 
05.12. Street Grades. 
Streets shall be planned to conform to existing topographic conditions.  Grade may exceed twelve (12) percent for a distance up to four hundred (400) feet, but may not exceed fourteen (14) percent.  Minimum street grade shall be 0.5 percent (this includes the lateral grade across the pavement to allow for an adequate 'crown' for drainage purposes). 
05.13. Horizontal Curves. 
Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in the alignment of a street occurs, the street shall have a centerline radius of not less than the following. 
 
1. Arterials .................................................................................. 300 feet 
 
2. Collectors ............................................................................... 200 feet

07.01. Monuments. 
 
Concrete monuments four (4) inches in diameter or four (4) inches square, three (3) feet long, with a flat top, shall be set at all road corners and at all points where the road lines intersect the exterior boundaries of the subdivision.  The top of the monument shall have an indented cross to properly  identify the location and shall be set one (1) inch above the finished grade. 
 
Concrete monuments shall be set with reference to section lines, recognized geological marks, or other acceptable surveying techniques. 
 
All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pin not less than three-fourth (3/4) inch in diameter and twenty-four (24) inches long and driven so as to be one (1) inch above the finished grade.  Lot corners fronting on public roads shall be marked with numbered wooden lot stakes. 
 
07.02. Grading. 
All streets, roads, and alleys shall be graded to the required cross section.  Where roads are constructed under or adjacent to existing electric transmission lines, the fifteen (15) foot easement from any transmission line structure and all grading for the road shall be done in a manner which will not disturb the structure or result in erosion endangering the structure.  In the case of electric transmission lines, the clearance from the road to the nearest conductor shall meet the requirements of the National Safety Code. 
 
1. Preparation.  The entire right-of-way areas shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, brush, and other objectionable materials. 
 
2. Cuts.  All tree stumps, boulders, and other obstructions shall be removed to a depth of two (2) feet below the sub-grade.  Rock, when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of twelve (12) inches below the sub-grade.  This provision applies to the roadway and not necessarily to the entire right-of-way width. 
 
3. Fill.  All suitable material from roadway cuts may be used in the construction of fills, approaches, or at other places as needed.  Excess materials, including organic materials, soft clays, etc., shall be removed 
from the development site.  The fill shall be spread in layers not to exceed twelve (12) inches loose and compacted by a sheep's foot roller.  Utility trenches and other places not accessible to a roller shall be mechanically tamped. 
 
4. Specifications.  Cut and fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) foot vertical for every two (2) feet horizontal unless extra measures are taken to assure that the slope is stabilized to prevent soil erosion. 
 
07.03. Installation of Utilities. 
After grading is completed and approved and before any base is applied, all utilities shall be installed completely and approved throughout the subdivision. 
 
For a subdivision identified in a flood hazard area, the utilities must be constructed to minimize flood damage. 
 
07.04. Street or Road Base. 
After preparation of the sub-grade, the roadbed shall be surfaced with material of no lower classification than crushed rock, stone, or gravel.  The size of the crushed rock or stone shall be that generally known as "crusher run stone" from two and one-half (2 1/2) inches down, including dust.  Spreading of the stone shall be done uniformly over the area to be covered by means of appropriate spreading devices and shall not be dumped in piles.  After spreading the stone shall be rolled until thoroughly compacted.  The compacted thickness of the stone roadway shall be no less than six (6) inches. 
 
07.05. Pavement. 
All streets shall be paved using asphalt concrete (hot mix). 
 
1. Asphaltic concrete surface shall be constructed with asphaltic concrete binder compacted to two (2) inches with not less than an average weight of two hundred twenty (220) pounds per square yard and should also include a one (1) inch surface topping.  See typical tangent section and curb design alternatives.(Amended 4/28/03) 
 
07.06. Storm Drainage. 
An adequate drainage system including open ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water.  All storm drainage contained in pipes or culverts under roadway shall have endwalls, headwalls, or rip rap with concrete apron wall where necessary to prevent erosion.  Where open trench or swales are used, the grades exceeding eight (8) percent up and two (2) percent down shall be paved with three thousand (3,000) p.s.i. Portland cement concrete. 
 
Cross drains should be provided to accommodate all natural water flow and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway and the required slopes.  The size openings to case shall be built on straight line and grade and shall be determined by any acceptable engineering formula, and shall be laid on a firm base, but not in rock.  Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert.  They shall be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than (1) foot below the roadbed. 
 
07.07. Water Service.  (Amended 6/24/2013) 
A public water system shall be provided to all major subdivisions, as defined by these regulations, when the proposed subdivision is within 1,000 feet of an existing public water system, or when the Planning Commission determines that the lack of public water system will negatively impact the safety and wellbeing of Dunlap’s citizens.  The Planning Commission may decide not to require the extension of water when the elevation of the line to be extended is above the 800’ contour line.  The appropriate size of the water mains shall be recommended by the Planning Commission, and determined by the applicable utility provider. 
 
Developments determined by the County Health Department or the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation to be unsuitable for fresh water wells shall agree to provide a public water system before a final plat is approved by the Planning Commission. 
 
Fire hydrants of a type approved by the City shall be installed in all major subdivisions (as defined by these regulations) whenever adequate water flow is available, or as determined by the Dunlap Water System in coordination with the Dunlap Planning Commission (DPC).  Additional hydrants may be required by the Dunlap Water System or the Planning Commission.  All fire hydrants shall have a base coat of chrome yellow.  The top of the hydrants shall be color coded to show flow capabilities as follows:  Red – 0 to 499 gpm, Orange – 500 to 999 gpm, Green - 1000 to 1499 gpm, Blue – 1500+, and Black – Signifies Out of Service.  Hydrants without fire flow capability shall also be tagged so that pumper trucks will not connect directly to the hydrant and collapse the water line; however, water from the hydrant can still be used to fill reservoirs. 
 
When necessary, the developer shall have an agreement with the local utility for the installation and/or service of fire hydrants. 
 
The following requirements shall govern the placement of fire hydrants within or in proximity to all subdivisions of property requiring the installation of hydrants: 
 
1.   Fire hydrants shall be located at a place that is clearly visible from the road and can be easily accessed by firefighters and other fire equipment used to connect to the hydrant. 
 
2.  No lot shall be more than one-thousand (1,000) feet (measured along the road) from a fire hydrant.  Fire hydrants should not be more than one thousand (1,000) feet apart in order to maintain a good fire insurance rating and safety level.  However, the distance between fire 
hydrants may exceed one-thousand (1,000) feet provided lots abutting the roadway are still within one-thousand (1,000) feet of a fire hydrant. 
   
3.  The Dunlap Planning Commission (DPC) can require additional fire hydrants in cases where topography and/or larger lots make it more difficult for adequate fire protection.  Prior to making a decision the DPC should consult with the Dunlap Fire Department and Dunlap Water Department. 
 
The location and types of valves and fire hydrants, the amount of soil cover over the pipes and other features of the installation shall conform to accepted standards of good practice for water systems and must meet the approval of the Dunlap Water System, Fire Department, and the Dunlap Planning Commission. 
 
07.08. Sewage Disposal. 
When a proposed subdivision utilizes a public sanitary sewer main, sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve all the lots within the subdivision.  The specifications of all materials and the manner in which all lines and appurtenances are laid shall meet the inspection and approval of the public sewerage system involved. 
 
Where a subdivision is located beyond the service limits of a public sewage disposal system, the lots shall be served by individual sewage disposal systems.  Lot sizes shall be adequate for the installation of the proposed individual systems.  All such systems shall have the approval, in writing, of the Sequatchie County Health Department. 
 
07.09. Guarantee In Lieu of Completed Improvements.  (Amended 6/24/2013) 
No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission or accepted for recording by the county register of deeds until one of the following conditions have been met. 
 
1. All required improvements have been constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the various authorities for which certificates are required.  These improvements include the extension of water and/or sewer lines and the construction of a road and storm drainage. 
 
OR 
 
2. The Dunlap Planning Commission and City Attorney have accepted a letter of credit or performance bond that is for a period of twelve (12) months or less in an equal amount to one-hundred-ten (110%) percent of the estimated cost of installation of the required improvements, whereby improvements may be made and roads and/or utilities installed without cost to the City or other utility providers in the event of default by the developer/subdivider.  The City Attorney will be responsible for the execution of the surety instrument, which will be held in a secure location at Dunlap City Hall.  At the end of the twelve (12) month period (or the time specified in the surety instrument approved by the Planning Commission) the Planning Commission shall have issued a written decision specifying what should be done with the letter of credit or performance bond based on the status of the improvements for which it was issued.  Upon a ruling by the Planning Commission, the City Attorney will be charged with the responsibility of either releasing or collecting the surety instrument on behalf of the City.  
 
The Planning Commission shall set the amount of the letter of credit or performance bond based upon the cost of improvements estimated by the Dunlap Field Superintendent, utility official, or other authority designated by the Planning Commission. 
 
07.10. Procedure for Executing and Enforcing Letters of Credit & Performance Bonds. 
(Amended 6/24/2013) 
Once a final subdivision plat is submitted to the Planning Commission for approval, the developer/subdivider shall have also submitted a letter of credit or a performance bond in an amount equal to one-hundred-ten (110%) percent of the estimated cost of installing and constructing the required improvements. The developer/subdivider then has up to twelve (12) months to complete the required improvements.  The appropriate signed certificates on the plat should recognize that a letter of credit or performance bond has been secured, it must state the amount that it will cover, and it must give a description of what it will cover.  The letter of credit or performance bond serves as a contract between the developer/subdivider and the City, thus ensuring that the required improvements will be completed in a timely manner and at no cost to taxpayers. 
 
A. Procedure for Completed Improvements 
1.   If the required improvements are completed within twelve (12) months (or the time specified by the surety instrument), then the developer/subdivider shall formally request in writing that the Planning Commission release the surety instrument.   
 
2.   A letter must also be obtained from the appropriate utility or city official stating that the required improvements have been completed in an acceptable manner and that no further or immediate costs are anticipated as a result of the completion of a particular project.   
 
3.   The Planning Commission may require a letter from a certified engineer if there is question about operation or design of the completed infrastructure.     
 
4.   The Planning Commission shall certify that all of the required improvements have been installed or constructed in an acceptable manner based on good engineering principles and adherence to state and local regulations.  Once satisfied, the Planning Commission shall instruct the City Attorney in writing to release the surety instrument. 
 
5.   In the case of roads, the developer/subdivider shall request that the Dunlap Board of Mayor and Alderman accept the road as a City street if it is intended to be public.  Otherwise, the future maintenance of the road falls to the developer/subdivider. 
 
B. Procedure for Calling in a Surety Instrument for Incomplete Improvements 
1. During the month which represents the midpoint for the period of time specified in the surety instrument, the developer/subdivider shall submit a progress report to the Planning Commission noting the work that has been done to fulfill the terms of the surety instrument for incomplete infrastructure.  No communication within thirty (30) days of being notified to present a progress report shall be deemed as an abandonment of the project, and shall cause the surety instrument to be collected early. 
 
2. Ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of a letter of credit or performance bond, the Planning Commission shall send a certified letter to the developer/subdivider and the issuer of the surety instrument notifying them of the deadline for completing the required improvements.  If the required improvements are not completed, then the Planning Commission shall begin the process of collecting payment guaranteed in the approved surety instrument beginning thirty (30) days prior to the end of the twelve (12) month period.  It should be noted that the end of the twelve (12) month period does not make the 
letter of credit or performance bond invalid; rather it allows the Planning Commission to collect it to fund the completion of the required improvements.  The Planning Commission may call in the surety instrument at anytime following the twelve (12) month period (or time specified in the surety instrument).  An extension of the specified period may, in some cases, be granted by the Planning Commission, but a renewed letter of credit or performance bond shall be of a sufficient amount to cover the remaining improvements.  The renewed letter of credit or performance bond must also specify the extended timeframe granted by the Planning Commission.  
 
3. The developer/subdivider and the issuer of the letter of credit or performance bond shall be notified at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing in which the Planning Commission will vote to call in the surety instrument. 
 
4. Within thirty (30) days prior to the end of the twelve (12) month period, the Planning Commission shall conduct a hearing either at a special called meeting or a regularly scheduled meeting to vote on calling in the letter of credit if the required improvements are incomplete.  A certified letter shall be sent to the developer/subdivider and the issuer of the surety instrument with notification of the Planning Commission’s decision. 
 
5. The Planning Commission shall send a letter to the City Attorney requesting that the letter of credit or performance bond be dispensed to the City to cover the cost of completing the required improvements.   
 
If the surety instrument is for a period of less than twelve (12) months, then the Planning Commission shall adhere to the procedures listed above for calling in surety instruments, except in cases where the timeframe specified in the surety instrument does not allow for the two notifications listed above.  In which case, the Planning Commission shall only adhere to the 7 day notice to the developer/subdivider notifying them of the hearing that will be held within the 30 days prior to the surety instrument’s expiration.
