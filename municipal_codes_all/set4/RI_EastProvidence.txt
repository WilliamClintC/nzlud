PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of East Providence, Rhode Island. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1987 Revised Ordinances, as supplemented through April 15, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1987 Revised Ordinances, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor, and Bill Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Valerie A. Perry, City Clerk, and William J. Conley, Jr., City Solicitor for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
CHAPTER NO. 20 
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of East Providence, Rhode Island; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
The Council of the City of East Providence Hereby Ordains: 
Section 1. The Code entitled "Revised Ordinances, City of East Providence, Rhode Island," consisting of Chapters 1 through 19, each inclusive, is adopted. 
Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before November 4, 1997, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
Section 3. The repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
Section 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment not exceeding 30 days and/or restitution in cases involving property damage or personal injury in an amount up to $2,500.00 and/or voluntary community service for a city agency for not more than 10 days for any one offense. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code, when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the city council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
Section 6. Ordinances adopted after November 4, 1997, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code.

ARTICLE IV. - SPAY AND NEUTER PROGRAM 
 
Sec. 3-60. - Findings, purpose and intent. 
(a)  The city council finds and determines that:

(2)  Stray and abandoned pets, specifically cats, create numerous public health and safety problems, including transmission of disease and traffic hazards created by cats running loose on public streets. 
(3)  A permit system for breeding of cats owned or harbored in the city combined with a program for spaying/neutering is a reasonable and effective means of reducing the population of abandoned or stray cats, and for eliminating the practice of euthanizing homeless cats except those for whom euthanasia is an escape from suffering or necessary to protect people and/or other animals from vicious behavior. 
(b)  Declaration of intent. The city council hereby finds and declares that it intends to provide for the public health, safety and welfare through a program requiring spaying and neutering cats unless appropriate permits are acquired.

An "intact" permit may be issued by the ACO to an individual who refuses to spay or neuter their cat. The fee for such a permit shall be $100.00 per year. All funds from "intact" permits shall be deposited in the city's spay/neuter account. 
(c)  Any person, who keeps, has custody, owns, maintains, harbors, provides care or sustenance for, has control or charge of or responsibility for a cat or who permits a cat to habitually be or remain on or be lodged or fed within such person's property or premises, and any refusal to permit any animal control officer to impound such cat shall be deemed evidence of ownership unless ownership of the cat by another party is established pursuant to Rhode Island General Law § 4-22-2. 
(d)  Subsection (c) above shall not be interpreted to apply to a person caring for a colony of feral cats if such person: 
(1)  Registers (at no charge) with the city as a caretaker for feral cats; 
(2)  Regularly feeds or arranges for the feeding of the colony, including on weekends and holidays; 
(3)  Traps all feral cats over the age of eight weeks in his/her care, and has them spayed or neutered or identifies to animal control those cats deemed unable to be trapped; 
(4)  Has all trapped cats tested for feline aids and leukemia and has those who test positive humanely euthanized or isolated indoors; 
(5)  Identifies feral cats that have been spayed or neutered by means of ear notching, ear tipping, or ear tagging;

(2)  No offspring may be sold or adopted until immunized against common diseases. 
(3)  If within one year of placement a new owner becomes unable or unwilling to continue ownership and responsibility for an animal, the permit holder shall assist in placement of the animal.

(5)  The permittee has transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of the cat for which the permit was issued.

Said notice shall specify the grounds of possible revocation of the permit and shall specify a date and time for an informal hearing to be held before an animal control officer. Said date shall be not less than five days subsequent to the date the notice is mailed.

At the end of 30 days, the building inspector shall reinspect the building or structure described in the notice. If upon reinspection the violations alleged are determined by the building inspector not to have been corrected, he shall issue a second notice of violation on which shall constitute an order requiring that the then existing failures to meet the requirements of any provision of this Code or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, shall be corrected within 30 days after the date of the reinspection, if the person served with the second notice does not petition for a hearing on the matter in the manner hereinafter provided.

(b)  It shall be unlawful for the owner of any building or structure upon whom a notice of violation/compliance order has been served to sell, transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose thereof to another until the provisions of the notice of violation/compliance order have been complied with or until such owner shall first furnish to the grantee, lessee or mortgagee prior to such transfer, lease or mortgage a true copy of any notice of violation/compliance order issued by the building inspector and at the same time notify the building inspector in writing of the intent to transfer, lease or mortgage either by delivering such notice of intent to the building inspector and receiving a receipt therefor or by certified mail, return receipt requested, giving the name and address of the person to whom the transfer, lease or mortgage is proposed.

TABLE 2 
Building validation. The following building validation data represents average valuations of most buildings. In conjunction with the International Code Council, this data is offered as an aid for the building official to determine if the permit valuation is underestimated. Again, it should be noted that, when using this data, these are "averages" with cost based on typical construction methods for each occupancy group and type of construction. The average costs include foundation work, structural and nonstructural building components, interior finish material and includes the issuance of certificate of occupancies (C of O). The data is a Rhode Island average and is subject to the local building official's further review. The building valuation data is not intended to apply to alterations or repairs to existing buildings because the scope of alterations or repairs to an existing building varies so greatly. However, building validation data can be used to determine the cost of an addition that is basically a standalone building which happens to be attached to an existing building.

(4)  Loan/mortgage conciliation conference shall mean the formal discussion and negotiation taking place at the call of the loan/mortgage conciliation conference coordinator between the homeowner/mortgagor and the lender/mortgagee.

(6)  Lender shall mean an entity which has advanced funds secured by a mortgage on residential premises, and recorded in the land evidence records of the city. 
(7)  The parties shall mean the homeowner/mortgagor and the lender/mortgagee. 
(8)  Rules and regulations shall mean any rules adopted by the city necessary for the proper enforcement of this article to interpret and secure its intent. 
(b)  Statement of policy. It is hereby declared that residential mortgage foreclosure actions, caused in part by so-called sub-prime mortgage lending and predatory lending practices as well as unemployment and underemployment, have negatively impacted a substantial number of homeowners in the city. Increasing numbers of foreclosures lead to increases in unoccupied and unattended buildings in the city and cause the unnecessary and unwanted displacement of homeowners and tenants who desire to live in the City of East Providence. 
(c)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to protect the public by providing early, HUD-approved independent counseling agency supervised intervention in residential owner-occupied mortgage foreclosure cases which will assure timely determination of eligibility under various federal, state and local programs established to facilitate loan work-out and other solutions to permit residential homeowners, where possible, to retain their properties and permit lenders to move forward to auction/sale of the properties and recordation of a foreclosure deed upon conclusion of the process. 
(d)  Notice of foreclosure to the city. From and after the effective date of this article, a lender/mortgagee shall provide written notice to the city of its intent to foreclose on the subject residential property at the same time it issues notice to the homeowner/mortgagor of the foreclosure action. Such notice must include plat and lot information, and said notice shall be filed by the lender/mortgagee with the city clerk. 
(e)  Conciliation conference between the parties. Following the filing of such notice, the parties shall participate in a mandatory loan/mortgage conciliation conference at a location mutually convenient to the parties, the following manner, and provided that telephone participation by the lender/mortgagee is acceptable. 
(1)  Said conciliation conference shall be scheduled at a time and place to be determined by the conciliation conference coordinator, but not later than 21 days following the mailing of the notice of intent to foreclose. The parties will be noticed by certified and first class mail. 
(2)  Prior to the scheduled conciliation conference, the homeowner/mortgagor will be assigned a loan counselor to be provided by a HUD-approved independent counseling agency. 
(3)  The homeowner/mortgagor shall cooperate in all respects with the housing counseling agency, providing all necessary financial and employment information. The homeowner/mortgagor shall complete any and all loan resolution proposals and applications as appropriate. 
(4)  The conciliation conference will require the exchange of information provided as required by subsection (6) to the representative of the lender/mortgagee. 
(5)  If after two attempts by the conciliation conference coordinator to contact the homeowner/mortgagor, the homeowner/mortgagor fails to respond to the conference coordinator's request to appear for the conciliation conference, or the homeowners/mortgagor fails to cooperate in any respect with the requirements outlined in this article, the requirements of the ordinance will be deemed to be satisfied upon verification by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency that the required notice was sent; and if so, a certificate will be issued immediately by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency authorizing the lender/mortgagee to proceed with the foreclosure action including recording the foreclosure deed. 
(6)  If it is determined after a good faith effort made by the lender/mortgagee at the conciliation conference with the homeowner/mortgagor that the parties cannot come to an agreement to renegotiate the terms of the loan in an effort to avoid foreclosure, such good faith effort on behalf of the lender/mortgagee shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this article. A certificate certifying such good faith effort will be issued immediately by the HUD-approved independent counseling agency authorizing the lender/mortgagee to proceed with the foreclosure action to include recording the deed. Such a certification will be in the form of a document to be filed along with all other relevant documents with the city clerk. 
(7)  The parties shall complete the process required by this article within a period of 45 days from the initial notice provided in (1). 
(8)  Cases involving premises which are not owner-occupied or which are not residential are not subject to the mandatory loan/mortgagee conciliation conference and may proceed directly to foreclosure and recordation of the deed concerning such property, presuming compliance with section 4-432. 
(9)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any lender/mortgagee which is headquartered within the State of Rhode Island and which services its own mortgages shall be deemed in compliance with the requirements of this section of: 
a.  The lender/mortgagee provides homeowners forbearance relief requirements applicable to FHA-Insured Mortgages, as set forth in Chapter 8 of the HUD Handbook 4.330.1 Rev. 5, Administration of Insured Home Mortgages, as the same may be amended from time to time; and 
b.  The deed offered by a lender/mortgagee to be filed with the city clerk as a result of a mortgage foreclosure action contains a certification that the provisions of this subsection have been satisfied. 
(e)  Penalties. A deed offered by a lender/mortgagee to be filed with the city clerk shall contain a statement that the requirements of this article have been met by the lender/mortgagee.

Sec. 10-33. - Auctions. 
(a)  If an abandoned motor vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided for in section 10-32, the police department shall sell the abandoned motor vehicle at a public auction. The purchaser of the motor vehicle shall take title to the motor vehicle free and clear of all liens and claims of ownership, shall receive a sales receipt and bill of sale from the police department and shall be entitled to register the purchased vehicle. The sales receipt at such a sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring the vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking, or dismantling, and in such case no further registration of the vehicle shall be necessary. 
(b)  From the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle the police department shall reimburse itself for the expenses of the auction, the costs of towing, preserving and storing the vehicle which resulted from placing the abandoned motor vehicle in custody, and all notices and publication costs incurred pursuant to section 10-32. Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale shall be held for the owner of the vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall be deposited in a special abandoned motor vehicle fund which shall remain available for the payment of auction, towing, preserving, storage, and all notice and publication costs which result from placing other abandoned motor vehicles in custody, whenever the proceeds from a sale of such other abandoned motor vehicles are insufficient to meet these expenses and costs. Whenever the treasurer of the city finds the moneys in the abandoned motor vehicle fund are in excess of reserves likely to be needed for the purposes thereof he may transfer the excess to the general fund, but if due to claims against the abandoned motor vehicle fund the fund is temporarily exhausted claims shall be met from the general fund to the limit of any transfers previously made thereto pursuant to this section.

Sec. 10-53. - Decibel provisions. 
(a)  Definitions. For the purpose of this section, certain words and phrases used in this chapter are defined as follows: 
A band level is the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using the A weighing network. The unit of measurement is the dB(A). 
Ambient noise is the all-encompassing noise associated with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many sources, near and far. 
Band pressure level of sound for a specified frequency band is the sound pressure level for the sound contained within the restricted band. The reference pressure must be specified. 
Bel is a unit of level when the base of logarithm is ten. Use of the bel is restricted to levels of quantities proportional to power. 
Cycle is the complete sequence of values of a periodic quantity that occur during a period. 
Decibel is one-tenth of a bel and is a unit of level when the base of the logarithm is the tenth root of ten, and the quantities concerned are proportional to power. 
Emergency work is work made necessary to restore property to a safe condition following a public calamity or work required to protect persons or property from an imminent exposure to danger. 
Frequency of a function periodic in time is the reciprocal of the primitive period. The unit is the cycle per unit and must be specified. 
Microbar is a unit of pressure commonly used in acoustics and is equal to one dyne per square centimeter. 
Period of a periodic quantity is the smallest increment of time for which the function repeats itself. 
Periodic quantity is an oscillating quantity, the values of which recur for equal increments of time. 
Person is any person or a person's firm, association, copartnership, joint venture, corporation or any entity public or private in nature. 
Sound analyzer is a device for measuring the band pressure level or pressure spectrum level of a sound as a function of frequency. 
Sound-level meter is an instrument including a microphone, an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specified manner. 
Sound pressure level in decibels of sound, is 20 times the logarithm to the base ten of the ratio of the pressure of this sound to the reference pressure, which reference pressure must be explicitly stated. 
Spectrum is a function of time and is a description of its resolution into components, each of different frequency and usually of different amplitude and phase. It is also used to signify continuous range of components each of different frequency and usually of different amplitude and phase, and it is also used to signify continuous range of components usually wide in extent within which waves have some specified characteristics such as audio-frequency spectrum. It is also applied to functions of variables other than time. 
All technical definitions are in accordance with American Standards S1.1-1960 entitled Acoustical Terminology. 
(b)  General provision: Tests for unlawful noise. The standards which shall be considered in determining whether a violation of section 10-51 exists shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  The volume of the noise; 
(2)  The intensity of the noise; 
(3)  Whether the nature of the noise is usual or unusual; 
(4)  Whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural; 
(5)  The volume and intensity of the background noise, if any; 
(6)  The proximity of the noise to residential sleeping facilities; 
(7)  The nature and zoning of the area within which the noise emanates; 
(8)  The density of inhabitation of the area within which the noise emanates; 
(9)  The time of the day or night the noise occurs; 
(10)  The duration of the noise; 
(11)  Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent or constant; 
(12)  Whether the noise is produced by a commercial or noncommercial activity. 
(c)  Classification of use districts: Residential, manufacturing, commercial. It is unlawful to directly or indirectly cause a sound or noise, excluding noise emanating from cars, trucks or motorcycles, from one property into another, generated within and/or projected into the boundary of a use district which exceeds either the limiting noise spectra set forth in Table I below, or exceeds the ambient noise level by more than three decibels. 
(1)  Sound or noise projecting from one use district into another use district with a different noise level limit shall not exceed the limits of the district into which the noise is projected. 
(2)  Measurement of noise: 
a.  The measurement of sound or noise shall be made with a sound level meter and octave band analyzer meeting the standards prescribed by the American Standards Association. The instruments shall be maintained in calibration and good working order. Octave band corrections may be employed in meeting the response specification. A calibration check shall be made of the system at the time of any noise measurement. Measurements recorded shall be taken so as to provide a proper representation of the noise source. The microphone during measurement shall be positioned so as not to create any unnatural enhancement or diminution of the measured noise. A windscreen for the microphone shall be used when required. Traffic, aircraft and other transportation noise sources and other background noises shall not be considered in taking measurements except where such background noise interferes with the primary noise being measured. 
b.  The slow meter response of the noise level meter shall be used in order to best determine that the average amplitude or any intermittent or repeated action including but not limited to loading and machinery operation has not exceeded the limiting noise spectra set forth in Table 1. 
c.  The measurement shall be made at the property line of the property on which such noise is generated, or perceived, as appropriate five feet above ground. 
d.  In the case of an elevated or directional sound or noise source, compliance with the noise limits is to be maintained at any elevation at the boundary.

The director of personnel shall also place advertisements on the city's website. The bulletins and advertisements shall specify the title and pay range of the class position, a description of the work to be performed, the minimum qualifications required, the time, place and manner of filing applications, the minimum score required on the written examination and any other pertinent information. If a minimum score is not announced, then the director will determine the passing score prior to the opening of applicants' identification envelopes. 
(b)  Application forms. Applications shall be made on forms provided by the director of personnel. Such forms shall require information concerning experience, training and other pertinent information and may include fingerprinting. All applications must be signed by the person applying. Whenever an application is rejected, notice of such rejection with a statement of reason shall be mailed to the applicant. A defective application may be returned to the applicant with notice to amend the application. 
(c)  Residency. No residency requirement shall be required with respect to applicants. All appointees to the city service shall be required upon completion of their probationary period to be residents of the state, or residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts residing in the area within a ten-mile radius of the city hall of this city, unless an extension of such period is granted by the city council. 
(d)  Disqualifications. The director of personnel shall reject any application that indicates on its face that the applicant does not possess the minimum qualifications established for the class of position, is physically unfit for the performance of the duties of the class, is addicted to the habitual use of drugs or intoxicating liquors, has been recently convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, has wilfully made any false statement of any material fact or has practiced or attempted to practice any deception or fraud in his application. 
(e)  Examinations generally. Examinations may consist of written, oral, performance or physical tests or any combination thereof or any other forms which will test fairly the qualifications of applicants. The following may be included: 
(1)  A written test may be used to measure the knowledge, ability, judgment, aptitude or alertness of candidates insofar as such traits are related to the work in a class or career service. 
(2)  An oral test may be used to evaluate the personal fitness, experience and training, knowledge, capacity and judgment of candidates. In considering personal fitness it will be appropriate to evaluate personality traits, but the evaluation shall be done on a basis that is as competitive as possible. 
(3)  A performance test may consist of candidates actually doing samples of work or the class and then rating their work results, speed and accuracy. 
(4)  A physical test may consist of competitive exercises or events designed to measure agility, strength, coordination or fitness. Such a test is in addition to the medical examination by a physician which may also be required. 
(5)  The competitive evaluation of the candidates shall be based upon the above enumerated tests. Additionally such competitive evaluation may consider the relevance, level, recency, progression and quality of experience and education offered by candidates as well as reports of superiors, former employers and educational institutions; however, consideration of these factors may not be used in lieu of, or as a substitute for, the above-enumerated testing procedures. 
(f)  Conduct of examinations. Examinations for entrance into or promotion within the classified service shall be conducted in as many places in the city as the director may find necessary. The director may designate monitors to take charge of examinations under instructions. The identity of persons taking competitive written tests shall be concealed by the use of identification numbers instead of names on all test papers. 
(g)  Rating examinations. The final score of a candidate shall be based upon all tests and evaluations in the examination. Failure in one part or test of the examination may be grounds for declaring candidates as failing in the entire examination or as disqualified for subsequent parts of an examination. In addition, in rating examinations for entrance into the classified service, except for police and fire candidates, the director shall increase the score of a candidate, one point for each consecutive year that such current resident-candidate has been a resident of the city up to a maximum of ten points. In rating examinations for police and fire candidates for entrance into the classified service, the director shall increase the score of a current resident-candidate one point for each consecutive year that such candidate has been a resident of the city up to a maximum of five points. Furthermore, in rating examinations for entrance into the classified service, the director shall increase the score of a veteran-candidate four points or five points for a post-9/11 veteran-candidate, up to a maximum of five points. However, the maximum amount of incentive points that a candidate may receive is to be capped at five points. For the purposes of this section, the terms "veteran" and "post-9/11 veteran" are as defined in the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) To Hire Heroes Act of 2011, 5 U.S.C. § 2108, as may be amended from time to time. Seventy percent shall be the lowest score on an examination to be acceptable as qualifying and the maximum score shall be 100 percent. 
(h)  Domicile; established. For purposes of this section only, a person's residence is his fixed or established domicile. The determinant of one's domicile is that person's factual physical presence in the city on a regular basis incorporating an intention to reside for an indefinite period.

(j)  Notice of examination results. As soon as possible after the conclusion of an examination, the director shall rate such tests and shall notify each competitor by mail of his relative position on such list or his failure to obtain a place on such employment or promotion list. After the eligible list has been established, the markings and test papers of each competitor shall be open to his personal inspection during business hours, provided that such inspection shall be limited to within 15 days after notices were mailed. Any marking error discovered during this time shall be corrected by the director, provided that such correction shall not invalidate any certification or appointment previously made. 
(k)  Promotional examinations. As the needs of the service may require, promotional tests may be conducted from time to time and may include, in addition to the types of tests listed in this chapter, evaluations of performance for the city and accomplishments in special training courses. All candidates for promotion must be regular employees in the classified service and must possess the minimum qualifications for the class to which promotion is sought. Employees hired under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, who have successfully completed six months of service and who possess the minimum qualifications for the class shall also be admitted to such an examination, and a separate Comprehensive Employment and Training Act promotional list shall be establishment. In the filling of any classified vacancy on a promotional basis, the promotional list of regular classified employees shall be used first. Upon exhaustion of that list, the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act promotional list shall be utilized, except that if insufficient eligibles remain on the regular promotional list to constitute a full certification, eligibles shall be certified from the comprehensive employment and training act promotional list to complete the certification. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-64; Ch. 73, § I, 6-1-99; Ch. 564, § I, 9-4-12; Ch. 647, § I, 4-5-16; Ch. 666, § I, 3-21-17)  
Sec. 11-65. - Eligible or promotional list. 
(a)  Generally. As soon as possible after the conclusion of an examination, the director of personnel shall prepare and keep available an appropriate eligible list for employment in or promotion within the classified service consisting of the names of persons successfully passing the examination, which names shall be arranged in order of final ratings received from the highest score down to the lowest acceptable passing score. The final rating shall be determined by the total of the scores received by each applicant for each part of the examination based upon the relative value assigned to each part of the examination previously established in the official announcement of the examination. Whenever identical final ratings are received, names shall be arranged in the order of the scores on the part or parts of the examination which were assigned the heaviest relative values, provided that when such arrangements fail to resolve a tie, the certification of eligibles shall be in accordance with subsection 11-66(c). 
(b)  Effective date. Employment and promotional lists shall become effective upon approval by the hearing board, shall remain in effect for one year, and may be extended by action of the board for additional six-month periods, provided that such eligible or promotional list shall not remain in effect for a period longer than two years. Two or more employment lists for the same class of positions may be consolidated by the board in a manner fair to eligibles on both lists. 
(c)  Reemployment. Permanent classified employees with a satisfactory employment record who are separated from service through no fault of their own shall be placed on appropriate employment lists in the order to be determined by the board. Permanent classified employees with a satisfactory record of service who resign their positions in good standing may, on their written request, withdraw such resignation within one year from the effective date thereof and be placed on appropriate employment lists in the same or comparable class to the one resigned. The order in which such names appear on employment lists shall be determined by the board after considering efficiency, length of service in the classified service and the circumstances involving their current separation from the city service. The eligibility of all candidates for reemployment shall expire two years from the date on which their names were placed on appropriate lists. 
(d)  Removal from employment list. The name of any person appearing on an employment list may be removed by the board if the eligible person requests in writing that his name be removed or if he cannot be located by postal authorities or other means of ordinary communication or does not respond within five days following the date of notification or does not report for scheduled interviews, exams, etc. The name of any eligible person may also be removed if the eligible person has waived appointment once in the same class or position. The name of any eligible person may also be removed if the name has been certified for appointment once, has not been appointed and has been recommended in writing for removal by the appointing authority (city manager), the prospective department head, the human resources director and the affirmative action officer. The names of qualified candidates not recommended for removal would remain on the list for future consideration. Any cause specified in this division for the rejection of applications may likewise be cause for removal of the name of an eligible person from the list on which it appears. 
(e)  Three plus three. The purpose of this subsection is to eliminate the overall adverse impact that sections 11-65 and 11-66 may have on the employment of minorities. It is intended to provide the appointing authority the necessary flexibility to achieve the goals of the city's affirmative action plan. It does not guarantee employment of minorities, however, it guarantees the appointing authority increased opportunity to appoint qualified minorities from an eligibility list. 
(1)  This subsection may be called for and applied to any civil service classification in the city. Such action may be taken whenever the affirmative action officer and the personnel director have determined the particular classification in question has had an adverse impact on the hiring of minorities. In such cases the use of this subsection would modify the usual selection procedure to eliminate adverse impact. The use of this subsection will be in accordance and consistent with personnel utilization analyses and numerical hiring goals. The use of this subsection will provide the appointing authority safe measures to ensure affirmative action throughout the city. 
(2)  When the affirmative action officer wishes to call for this subsection, the request must be submitted to the personnel hearing board as a formal request to certify an additional list of eligibles (three plus three). The request must be signed by the personnel director before being submitted to the personnel hearing board. The request will contain the following: 
a.  The request that certification be made under subsection 11-65(e); 
b.  The minorities that will be certified; 
c.  Assurance that there is an absence of minorities located in the portion of the eligibility list that would usually be certified (adverse impact has been determined); 
d.  The current affirmative action profile of the classification in question, which will include statistical data to show evidence of underutilization of minorities; 
e.  The names and rank of the eligible minority candidates; 
f.  The number of such positions that are authorized and funded. 
(3)  This procedure will not be called for: 
a.  In the absence of statistical data or reasonable evidence to show significant underutilization or adverse impact against minorities; 
b.  In the presence of sufficient minority members ranked at a reachable level in the classification that is in question; 
c.  When no members of the minority class are on the eligibility list; 
d.  When any department or division is subject to court-ordered remedies; 
e.  On promotional lists. 
(4)  The responsibilities of the affirmative action officer and personnel director are as follows: 
a.  The affirmative action officer is to review the city's affirmative action plan, specifically the portion relating to statistical data and numerical goals;

(a)  Generally. All vacancies in the classified service shall be filled by transfer, demotion or selection of eligibles certified from an appropriate employment or promotional list. In the absence of persons eligible for appointment by any of these methods, provisional appointments may be permitted in accordance with this division. 
(b)  Notice of vacancy. When a vacancy occurs, the head of the department or agency shall so advise the director stating the pertinent facts relative to the duties, responsibilities and qualification requirements of the position which is to be filled. The appointing authority shall indicate whether the vacancy is to be filled by transfer, demotion or selection of eligibles from an employment or promotional list.

In the filling of all vacancies (with the exception of transfers and demotions), the board shall certify to the appointing authority the names of the three persons standing highest on the appropriate list. In the event of ties for the third name, the tied names shall also be certified. If there is more than one vacancy, the board shall certify two names more than the number of existing vacancies, plus ties for the last name to be certified. 
(d)  Appointment. After interview and investigation, the appointing authority shall make an appointment from among those certified. 
(e)  Provisional appointment. If the appointing authority considers it necessary to fill a position in a class for which an eligible list has not been established, he may make a provisional appointment of a person meeting the minimum qualifications established for the class, provided that a provisional appointment shall have a maximum duration of six months and may not continue beyond one pay period after the establishment of any appropriate eligible list. 
(f)  Emergency appointments. The appointing authority or any legally competent officer may, in any emergency condition which threatens public life or property, employ such persons as may be needed for the duration of the emergency without regard to the provisions of this division governing appointments, provided that such emergency appointments shall continue no longer than two weeks, unless approval is received from the council. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-66)  
Sec. 11-67. - Probationary period. 
(a)  Objective. The probationary or working test period shall be regarded as an integral part of the examination process and shall be utilized by the appointing authority and supervisors for closely observing the employee's work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his position and for rejecting or separating from the city service any employee whose performance does not meet the required work standards. 
(b)  Duration. All appointments of eligibles from employment or promotional lists shall be tentative and subject to a probationary period of six months, with the exception of members of the police department and fire department who shall be subject to a probationary period of one year. The director shall notify the appointing authority two weeks prior to the termination of any probationary period. If the service of the probationary employee has been satisfactory, the appointing authority shall file with the director a statement in writing to such effect, stating that the retention of such employee in the service is desired. If such a statement is not filed, the performance of the employee will be deemed unsatisfactory and his employment terminated at the expiration of the probationary period. 
(c)  Dismissal. At any time during the probationary period, the appointing authority may dismiss an employee if in his opinion the working test indicates that such employee is unable or unwilling to perform the duties of the position satisfactorily or that his habits and dependability do not merit his continuance in the service. A probationary employee so removed has no right of appeal from this action. An employee appointed from a promotional list who does not successfully complete his probationary period shall be reinstated in a position in the class occupied by the employee immediately prior to his promotion. If no vacancy in that class exists at that time, then section 11-69(c) governing layoff shall be applied.

If the transfer involves a change from the jurisdiction of one supervising official to another, both must consent thereto, unless the city manager orders the transfer for purposes of economy and efficiency. Transfer shall not be used to promote, to demote or to increase or decrease the salary of a classified employee. No person shall be transferred to a position for which he does not possess the required minimum qualifications. 
(b)  Promotion. Vacancies occurring in the classified service shall be filled, insofar as practicable and consistent with the best interests of the service, by promotion, provided that the appointing authority may order an open competitive test if in his opinion the position could be better filled. 
(c)  Acting supervisory status. Any employee officially assuming the duties and responsibilities of a supervisory position higher than that which the employee holds for a period of 30 or more days shall receive the pay commensurate with the increased duties and responsibilities from the 31st day forward until relieved of such additional responsibilities. 
(d)  Demotion. The appointing authority may demote an employee whose ability to perform his required duties falls below standard or for disciplinary purposes. Upon request of the employee and with the consent of the supervising official, demotion may be made to a vacant position for which he possesses the required minimum qualifications. Written notice of the demotion shall be given the employee no later than three days before the effective date of the demotion, and a copy shall be filed with the director.

Sec. 11-69. - Separation from service. 
(a)  Tenure. The tenure of every employee holding a position in the classified service shall be during good behavior and demonstrated fitness for the position he holds. Any such employee may be removed or disciplined as provided in this division. 
(b)  Suspension. The appointing power may suspend with or without pay an employee from his position at any time for the good of the service, for disciplinary purposes or for other just cause. A department head, with the approval of the city manager, may for disciplinary purposes suspend without pay, with written notice, any classified employee in his department. Such suspensions shall be reported immediately to the director by the department head. 
(c)  Layoff. The appointing authority may lay off an employee in the classified service when he deems it necessary by reason of shortage of work or funds, the abolition of the position, material change in the departmental organization or for other related reasons which are outside the employee's control and which do not reflect discredit upon the service of the employee. No temporary or permanent separation of an employee from the city service as a penalty or disciplinary action shall be considered as a layoff. The name of the employee laid off shall be placed on the appropriate list as provided by the division. 
(d)  Discharge. An employee may be discharged by the appointing authority for activities prohibited in the Charter and for insubordination, inefficiency, abuse of sick leave, misconduct, disloyalty or other similar just cause. No discharge of a permanent classified employee shall take effect, unless five days prior to the effective date thereof the appointing authority shall give to such employee a written statement setting forth in detail the reasons therefor and shall file a copy of such statement with the director. Any permanent classified employee shall have the right to appeal to the city manager and further appeal to the hearing board in accordance with provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Resignation. To resign in good standing an employee in the classified service must give the appointing authority at least 14 calendar days prior notice, unless the appointing authority, due to extenuating circumstances, agrees to permit a shorter period of notice. A written notice shall be supplied by the employee to the appointing authority giving reasons for leaving.

The additional vacation leave granted to these personnel shall be considered compensatory time for services rendered beyond normal working hours in emergencies throughout the year.

It is the intent of this section that each permanent full-time employee in the city service appointed on or before January 1, 1960, shall earn two calendar weeks' paid vacation to be granted during the following 12 months and to be taken in units of not less than one week.

Such sick leave must be earned before it can be granted and shall not be considered a right but shall be a privilege and granted under authority of this chapter. Upon retirement an employee shall be paid 50 percent of the total amount of sick pay credited to him as of the date of his retirement, up to a limit to be determined by their respective agreements for all employees covered by collective bargaining. Employees not covered by collective bargaining agreement and who are eligible to receive such benefit shall be treated comparably. 
(b)  It is the intent of this provision that each permanent full-time employee in the city service appointed on or before January 1, 1960, shall have accrued to his credit, sick leave which may be granted at any time during the following 12 or succeeding months as follows:

Sick leave may not be granted unless such report has been made. 
(d)  In all cases where sick leave exceeds two working days the department head may require the employee to file a physician's certificate indicating the nature and probable duration of the disability. 
(e)  Holidays and regular days off shall not be counted in computing sick leave taken. On-the-job injuries shall not be chargeable against accrued sick leave, and no loss of pay shall result from time lost due to such injury, except that in cases where the injured employee is a participating member in the municipal employees retirement system of the state and by reason of such membership is entitled to and qualifies for an accidental disability allowance in accordance with the provisions of G.L. 1956, §§ 45-21-21 and 45-21-22, the obligation of the city shall cease on the effective date of such retirement for accidental disability, provided that no employee injured in the course of his employment as the result of the fault or negligence of a third party shall receive his pay as aforesaid unless state law otherwise provides, including the payment of medical bills by the city during incapacity, unless such employee so injured executes a subrogation agreement in favor of the city to repay the city as provided by such subrogation agreement.

If such deceased employee has failed to designate a beneficiary for such payment, then such sum of money shall be paid first to the surviving widow or husband and, if there is no surviving widow or husband, then to the surviving children in equal shares, provided that if such deceased employee has not designated a beneficiary and leaves no widow, husband or child, then such accrued benefits shall be paid to his next of kin. 
(g)  All employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement shall receive sick leave in accordance with their respective agreements. Employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and who are eligible to receive sick leave shall receive comparable treatment.

Upon completion of the six months' of service, and upon the recommendation of the department head, an employee shall be eligible for an increase to step B or the next higher salary rate, whichever is applicable in the appropriate salary schedule. The granting of an increase during the probationary period of police officers and firefighters in no way terminates their probationary period which continues up to the completion of 12 months. The city manager shall have the authority to start a new employee at a higher step if it is impossible to recruit at the first step or if a person of unusual experience and qualifications is employed who would upon commencing work be as proficient as those already employed, in which case all employees in the class should be paid at least as much as the newcomer. 
(5)  Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the probationary period and upon completion of six additional months of service the employee shall be eligible for an increase to step C salary rate in the appropriate salary schedule. 
(6)  Thereafter an employee shall be eligible for an increase to the next higher step at the conclusion of each succeeding year of satisfactory service in his position until he has reached the maximum rate of the salary schedule established for his class. Exceptional and outstanding employee performance may be further rewarded on a limited basis by advancement in step increases in shorter periods of time on recommendation of the department head and approval of the city manager, provided that the director of finance shall certify that sufficient finds are available in the salary budget of the department affected. Similarly, salary advancements may be withheld for disciplinary purposes or where the employee's performance does not justify the scheduled salary advancement. 
(7)  All step rate increases shall be effective at the beginning of the first pay period following completion of the required period of service. 
(8)  In the event of promotion, the employee shall be paid at the lowest step in the higher salary schedule that will result in a minimum of four percent increase over the salary received immediately prior to such promotion. Such employee shall be eligible for step increases in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(9)  Any employee in the city service who is assigned to a position carrying a minimum and maximum range and who on October 31, 1959, is receiving a salary which is in excess of the minimum but less than the maximum rate as established for such class of position shall on November 1, 1959, receive the step salary rate equal to the salary he was receiving on October 31, 1959. However, any employee whose salary on October 31, 1959, falls between steps of the appropriate salary range shall receive the next higher step rate in the appropriate salary range. 
(10)  An employee in the city service who is assigned to a position carrying a minimum and maximum range and who on October 31, 1959, is receiving a salary which is in excess of the maximum for the class to which he is assigned shall continue to receive such salary until such time as he vacates his position or until such time as sections 11-111 through 11-118 are amended to place the salary schedule for his class in a higher range, provided, however, that incumbent city employees having more than 15 years of service with the city on the effective date of this section shall not be prevented from receiving future pay increases at such times as blanket pay increases may be granted for all classes of employees. 
(11)  Service requirements for the advancement of employees to higher step rates shall mean continuous employment in the city service without break or interruption, provided that authorized leaves of absence without pay shall not affect continuity of service, and further provided that all authorized leaves of absence without pay in excess of 30 days and all unauthorized leaves of absence shall be deducted in computing total service.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 11-136. - Policy statement. 
(a)  In conformance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, it is the policy of the city to foster and actively promote equal opportunity in employment on the basis of ability to perform work, and to eliminate and prevent discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex, age, handicap and national origin within the city service and the jurisdiction of the city. 
(b)  One of the most complex and tragic problems confronting the nation today is the absence of true equal opportunity for all people. While there have been civil rights laws enacted during the past to ensure such equality, many individuals and institutions have been negligent in meeting the requirements of these laws, to the extent that equal opportunity for all people, in fact, is not a reality. 
(c)  The denial of equal access to opportunities for development and growth has permitted discrimination to continue in a variety of forms. Therefore, proposed remedies must go beyond the mere announcement of an equal opportunity policy. We recognize and accept the responsibility to design and implement programs which strike at the total problem rather than simple overt manifestations. We must strive aggressively to ensure the entry and growth of minorities and women in our work force until it is emphatically clear that equality of opportunity in the city is a reality. 
(d)  To achieve ultimate effectiveness in affirmative action, our efforts toward equal opportunity for all people must extend above and beyond the letter of the law; that is, total commitment to this goal on the part of every city employee. The city shall further move to solicit free and equal access by minorities and women to all of its services, including participation in its activities and representation on its boards and commissions. Your cooperation and support in affirmative action program efforts is essential in assuring equal opportunity in the city. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-136)  
Sec. 11-137. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this affirmative action plan is to ensure equitable employment opportunities in municipal departments for all minority groups and women. This plan would further enhance the city's effort to voluntarily comply with title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 11246, as amended, and all state and local laws pertaining to equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. 
(b)  This plan is also intended to ensure equitable participation of all minorities and females in all occupational classifications. The provisions of this plan would further ensure that contractors engaged in municipal work are nondiscriminatory.

Such officer shall design, implement and monitor internal audit reporting systems to measure the affirmative action plan effectiveness and progress, and shall also be in frequent communication with the city manager to report the progress of each department. The affirmative action officer shall be knowledgeable about current legal information affecting affirmative action and equal employment opportunity. Such officer shall disseminate this information to responsible officials and the community at large. 
(d)  The affirmative action officer shall cooperate with minority and women's organizations, community-based groups and all other civil rights agencies, in order to establish a workable reciprocal relationship which would lead to a broader understanding of the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action among the citizens of the city. 
(e)  The affirmative action officer in conjunction with the personnel director shall oversee all hiring done by the city and shall move to ensure that all hiring will be conducted through the personnel department and in accordance with the provisions of this plan. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-152)  
Sec. 11-153. - The affirmative action committee. 
(a)  Acting under the authority of subsections 11-31(3) through (5) of this Revision which gives the personnel hearing board the authority to "advise … on matters of personnel administration" and to "represent the public interest in the improvement of personnel administration in the city service," the personnel hearing board shall be an integral part of the affirmative action committee. 
(b)  The committee shall consist of the three members of the personnel hearing board, as well as nine appointed members of the citizenry, among whom shall be at least one woman and representatives of minority groups. These citizens shall serve after appointment by the city council for a period of two years. A member may be removed for cause upon a vote of the city council. The affirmative action committee shall elect two officers, a chair and vice-chair who shall serve in these positions for one year. The director of personnel and the affirmative action officer shall be ex officio members of this committee. 
(c)  The affirmative action committee in cooperation with the affirmative action officer shall have the following responsibilities: 
(1)  To review and recommend annual goals and timetables to the city manager. The goals and timetables are to be forwarded to the city manager by June 1, so funds needed for programs necessary to achieve them may be included in the manager's proposed budget. 
(2)  To review and recommend to the city manager and the city council such rules and regulations necessary to promulgate the city's affirmative action program. 
(3)  To advise affected or underrepresented groups of their rights under the affirmative action plan.

Sec. 11-166. - Underutilization of minorities and women in municipal government. 
(a)  The procedures outlined in this section are designed in part to remedy the disparate staffing and recruitment patterns that have negatively affected the employment opportunities of minorities and females with the city. According to the equal employment opportunity commission, report number four for 1974, there was little progress in terms of the utilization of minorities and women employed by city government. 
(b)  Minorities and women were not equitably represented in certain municipal functions within the municipal structure, as indicated in the three charts below:

_____
(c)  The United States Census Survey statistics of 1970 reveal that of the 48,151 residents in the East Providence area, some 25,274 are women and over 1,682 are classified as nonwhite (classification data pertaining to Cape Verdeans and Portuguese have greatly effected these figures). In view of these statistics, the municipal work force does not reflect the numbers of minorities and women that would reasonably be expected by their availability. Minorities are conspicuously underutilized in administrative, professional, paraprofessional, office and clerical and skilled craft job classifications. Women in city government hold most of the office and clerical positions, but very few are found in the administrative and professional classification. Therefore, the city is legally required to address itself to the elimination of the inequities exemplified above. Through the utilization of affirmative action, the city would also provide a role model for other employers operating in the area, whose equal employment opportunity performance has been lax. 
(d)  Heretofore, the stated policy of the city has been one of nondiscrimination. However, this statement of policy did not address itself to the specific problems of minority and women underutilization or concentration in municipal government. Equal employment opportunity for persons seeking employment with the city, regardless of race, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin or age, requires special affirmative action procedures that would effect all employment practices, including but not limited to, recruiting, hiring, transfer, promotion, training, compensation, benefits, layoff and termination. 
(e)  In view of these considerations, the city has developed this affirmative action plan to create an equitable system and eliminate the effects of the nonprogressive employment practices that have impeded equal employment opportunity in the municipal government of this city.

Secs. 11-167—11-180. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 4. - GOALS 
 
Sec. 11-181. - Underutilization areas; corrective measures by certain departments. 
(a)  According to the statistics of the 1974 Equal Employment Opportunity Report #4, minorities are underrepresented in the following areas: police protection (0.9 percent), fire protection (0.8 percent), community development (0 percent), finance (0 percent) and public works (2.4 percent). 
Minorities are underutilized in several job classifications. Underutilization can be found in the following classifications: administrative, professional, paraprofessional, office and clerical and skilled crafts. 
Women are concentrated within the office and clerical positions in the city government (90 percent). Specific measures are necessary to increase the representation of women in all classifications, particularly administrative, professional and protective service positions. 
(b)  The departments of city government which fall under the functional areas that reflect underutilization of minorities shall, in conjunction with the personnel director and affirmative action officer, immediately institute basic analytic and corrective measures which shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  A review shall be made of all personnel policies, practices and procedures, with particular emphasis on recruitment and training capabilities, in order to identify those procedures that have an adverse effect on minorities or women. 
(2)  Action shall be taken to ensure that salaries and benefits are the same for all employees in similar job classifications. 
(3)  All job classifications shall be analyzed to ensure that sex, race, religion, national origin or age are not factors in placing employees in jobs with different opportunities for advancement, except where such factors are bona fide occupational qualifications. 
(4)  The city shall seek to fill a minimum of 15 percent of all openings with qualified minority applicants for the next three years, or until the city employee labor force reflects the proper percentage of minorities in the city as a whole. 
(5)  Departments shall survey present layoff, recall, termination, demotion, discharge and all disciplinary actions to ensure that they do not adversely affect minorities and women. 
(6)  Union contract provisions affecting the above procedures shall also be reviewed and, where needed, corrections will be recommended. 
(7)  Trade unions are specifically subject to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Union cooperation shall be sought to remove discriminatory factors revealed from our analysis of employment practices. 
(8)  All tests shall be reviewed for job-relatedness. In many cases the use of intelligence, aptitude and other tests developed to provide objective evaluation of applicants has had major disproportionate effect in rejection of minorities and women, without having any proven relation to predicting successful job performance. Testing is a major area for immediate review and action. 
(9)  In an effort to promote uniform personnel procedures and to allow for one focal affirmative action monitoring point, the personnel department shall process all hiring for the city's full-time and part-time, summer and winter employees. 
(10)  The coordinator of our federal employment program shall also submit projected goals for the employment of minorities and women at the beginning of each fiscal period. 
These basic measures shall be the first steps toward the long range goal of this affirmative action plan, that goal being the representation of each underutilized group in all job classifications within the identified target functional area as well as municipal government as a whole. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-181)  
Sec. 11-182. - Timetables. 
The following tables shall set numerical goals and set forth timetables in which the city shall make every good faith effort toward achieving these goals within the context of employment opportunities. Minority utilization goals, by functional area, include the following areas: 
(1)  Functional area—City manager. .....

(4)  Functional area—Parks/recreation. ..... 
As of 1/1/75 .....10% 
The present percentage shall be maintained as the lowest acceptable level. The goals in this department shall be set for summer and winter part-time help as stated earlier. 
(5)  Functional area—Community development. ..... 
As of 1/1/75 .....0% 
From 1/1/76 until 12/31/76 .....0% to 3% 
From 1/1/77 until 12/31/77 .....3% to 4.5% 
From 1/1/78 until 12/31/78 .....4.5% to 7% 
(6)  Functional area—Library. ..... 
As of 1/1/75 .....13% 
From 1/1/76 until 12/31/76, the present percentage shall be maintained as lowest acceptable percentage for this department. Goals for the employment of summer and winter part-time workers shall be set. 
(7)  Functional area—Public works. ..... 
As of 1/1/75 .....2.4% 
From 1/1/76 until 12/31/76 .....0.76% to 4% 
From 1/1/77 until 1/31/77 .....7% to 10% 
(8)  Functional area—Finance. ..... 
As of 1/1/75 .....0% 
From 1/1/76 until 12/31/76 .....0% to 3% 
From 1/1/77 until 1/31/77 .....3% to 6% 
From 1/1/78 until 1/31/78 .....6% to 9% 
Women utilization shall be increased for minority percentages. However, major consideration will be in the upward mobility of those women currently employed in these areas. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-182)  
Sec. 11-183. - Measures to facilitate reaching goals. 
In order to facilitate the efforts of the city in reaching the goals set out in section 11-182, the following measures shall be initiated: 
(1)  Local minority and women's rights organizations shall be made aware of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action plan commitments of the city. These organizations shall receive recruitment notifications for vacancies in any of the municipal divisions or departments. These groups should also be involved in the planning stages of all programs and committees designed to enhance the progressive development of the local community. 
(2)  In view of the low percentage of minorities and women employed in administrative and professional levels within the city, more recruitment in this area is necessary. Therefore, the city's relationship with local institutions of higher learning should be strengthened. Minority and women graduates of such institutions shall be identified and informed of professional employment opportunities with the city. Recruitment notifications shall be made available to the placement offices of respective institutions, emphasizing the city's equal employment opportunity and affirmative action plan commitments. 
(3)  More sensitive interview procedures shall be adopted within city government. Any municipal selection standards that have a desperate effect on minorities or women shall be revised or eliminated. Interview monitoring methods and the resultant corrective recommendations will be handled by both the affirmative action officer and the affirmative action committee. 
(4)  The affirmative action officer shall investigate the employment procedures of departments, scrutinizing the upward mobility (assignments, job progressions, promotions, seniority, transfers, and training), the wage and salary structure, benefits, conditions of employment, maternity leave, layoff, terminations, recall and the entire disciplinary system. The city shall identify problem areas that have contributed to the underutilization and concentration of minority or women resources and develop specific remedies for each department. 
(5)  The personnel department shall submit to the affirmative action officer regular flow sheets that would identify all employees by job classification, race, sex and salary. Specific forms shall be used to designate separately full-time, part-time, federally funded and newly hired personnel. This information shall be reviewed by the affirmative action officer and the affirmative action committee in order to pinpoint areas in need of corrective measures. The forms to be used are available in the office of the affirmative action officer.

A prime contractor, subcontractor or firm awarded a contract to construct a municipal, federally-assisted or state-assisted construction project for the city or who provides services to the city assumes the obligation to take whatever affirmative action is necessary to assure the city that there will be equal employment opportunity during the performance of this project. All contractors and subcontractors shall carry out equal employment opportunity contract provisions as expeditiously as any of the other elements of the stipulated contractual agreements. The following procedures and practices shall be instituted by the city to ensure nondiscrimination on city construction projects: 
(1)  Within two working days of an advertisement for bids, the municipal contracting agency shall notify the affirmative action officer in writing that such an announcement has been made. The contracting agency shall provide the affirmative action officer with the names of all contractors or firms who submit the lowest responsible bid, the proposed initiation date of the project and copies of the contractor-signed affirmative action bid certifications. 
(2)  The contracting agency, the contractor and the affirmative action officer shall schedule a preaward conference to discuss the existing or proposed affirmative action procedures to be utilized by the contractor to ensure significant minority and women representation at all skilled levels in all categories of its work force. 
(3)  The contractor will send to each union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice advising the labor union of the contractors' commitments to the city regarding equal employment opportunity. 
(4)  The municipal agency shall require that the contractor engaged in municipal projects provide to the agency and the affirmative action officer copies of the department of labor monthly manpower utilization reports. The contracting agency shall confer with the affirmative action officer for the purpose of evaluation and review of these reports. 
(5)  The affirmative action officer shall conduct site visits in order to inspect the equal employment and affirmative action plan performance of the contractor and subcontractors engaged on the project. 
(6)  During this physical tour, the affirmative action officer shall determine whether equal employment posters are displayed in conspicuous locations and that the statistics submitted by the contractor are in fact accurate. The affirmative action officer of the city shall be afforded access to all company records pertaining to employment.

(a)  Any member withdrawing from service prior to retirement shall be entitled to a refund, in a single sum, of the amount of his contributions to the system, without interest. The payment of a refund under the provisions hereof shall automatically effect a waiver and forfeiture of all accrued rights and benefits in the system on the part of any member. The board may, in its discretion and regardless of cause, withhold payment of a refund for a period not to exceed one year after receipt of an application therefor. 
(b)  Any member who has received a refund shall be considered a new member upon subsequent reemployment, provided that if such member shall render at least three years of service following his latest reentry into service, he shall be entitled to regain his previously forfeited service credits upon repayment of all amounts received as refunds, including regular interest from dates of refunds to date of repayment. The time and manner of making such repayments shall be fixed by the board. 
(c)  Upon death of a member leaving no survivors eligible for annuity from the system, his accumulated contributions in the system, without interest, shall be paid in a single sum to such person as he shall have nominated by written designation duly executed and filed with the board. If no such designation shall have been made, payment shall be made to the legal representative. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-243)  
Sec. 11-243. - Method of funding. 
The system shall be financed in accordance with an annual determination to be made of the actuarial service requirements for the several annuities and benefits prescribed in this section for the members and their beneficiaries for services rendered and to be rendered. In addition to interest income and other income accruing to the system, these requirements shall be financed by contributions by the members and the city, as follows: 
(1)  Beginning as of the effective date, each member shall contribute, as his share of the cost of the several annuities and benefits prescribed in this article, seven percent of salary earned and accruing after such date. These contributions shall be made in the form of a deduction from salary notwithstanding that the salary paid in cash to such member shall be reduced thereby below the minimum prescribed by law. Each member shall be deemed to consent to such deductions, and payment to a member of salary less deductions shall constitute a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such member during the period covered by the payment, except as to the benefits provided in this article. 
(2)  For service rendered after the effective date, the city shall make contributions concurrently with the contributions by the members in an amount which, if paid during the total period of such service and added to the members' contributions for such service, will be sufficient to provide actuarial reserves for the annuities and benefits earned during such service. The rate of contribution by the city for the first fiscal year shall be seven percent of members' salaries, which shall be increased for each fiscal year thereafter ten percent thereof for a period of five fiscal years. At the end of such period, an actuarial survey shall be made and a new rate determined for future years in accordance with the prescribed method of funding. 
(3)  To provide for the accrued liability for that part of the annuities and benefits arising from service of members rendered prior to the effective date, the city shall contribute a sum sufficient to amortize the liability over a period of forty years from the effective date, assuming an interest rate of 3½ percent per annum. The rate of contribution by the city for the first fiscal year shall be three percent of members' salaries, which shall be increased for each fiscal year thereafter ten percent thereof for a period of five fiscal years. At the end of such period, an actuarial survey shall be made and a new rate determined for future years to meet the requirements of the system in accordance with the prescribed method of funding. 
(4)  The amount of each city contribution provided in this section shall be determined by applying the percentage rates stated to the salaries paid to the members during each payroll period, and the resulting amounts shall be remitted by the city to the system concurrently with the payment of salaries to the members. 
(5)  Effective January 1, 1988, pursuant to the provisions of section 414(h)(2) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, the city shall pick up and pay the contributions which would be payable by the members under subsection 11-243(1). The contributions so picked up shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the United States Internal Revenue Code. Member contributions which are picked up pursuant to this subsection shall be treated and identified as member contributions for all purposes of the system except as specifically provided to the contrary in this subsection. 
Member contributions made pursuant to this subsection shall be credited to a separate fund within a member's individual account so that the amounts contributed prior to the effective date for the pick up of a member contributions may be distinguished from the amount contributed on or after such date. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-244)  
Sec. 11-244. - Accounting generally. 
(a)  The assets of the system shall be held for the express purposes set forth in the provisions of this article subject to the conditions prescribed in this section. An adequate system of accounts and records shall be established and maintained that will give effect to the requirements of this article. All assets of the system shall be credited to designated reserve accounts according to the purposes for which they are held, as follows: 
(1)  Members' contribution reserve. 
a.  That portion of the amounts contributed by members to this system on or after the effective date, representing seven percent of salary, shall be credited to this reserve. An individual account shall be maintained for each member to which shall be credited the amount of such contributions. 
b.  Upon retirement for service or disability, the accumulated contributions to the credit of the member shall be transferred from this reserve to the retirement reserve. Refunds of member contributions paid upon separation or death of a member shall be charged to this reserve. 
c.  Member contributions picked up by the city shall be paid from the same source of funds used for the payment of compensation to a member. A deduction shall be made from a member's compensation equal to the amount of his contributions picked up by the city. This deduction, however, shall not reduce his compensation for purposes of computing benefits under the system pursuant to this section. Picked up contributions shall be transmitted to the system in accordance with the provisions of subsection 11-243(4). 
(2)  City contribution reserve. All amounts contributed by the city in accordance with the provisions hereof, except contributions for administrative expense, shall be credited to this reserve. 
a.  All income from investments, including gains from investment transactions, shall be credited to this reserve. All losses on investments and amounts required for interest on the other reserves shall be charged hereto. 
b.  Upon the granting of any annuity for service, disability or death, an amount representing the excess of the actuarial value of the annuity over the accumulated contributions of the member shall be transferred from this reserve to the retirement reserve. 
c.  If at the close of any year it shall be determined by actuarial valuation that the balance in the retirement reserve is insufficient to meet the liability for the annuities chargeable thereto, an amount equal to such deficiency shall be transferred from this reserve to the retirement reserve. 
(3)  Retirement reserve. Upon the granting of any annuity for service, disability or death, the accumulated contributions of the member in his individual account and an amount representing the actuarial value of the member over such accumulated contributions shall be transferred from the members' contribution reserve and city contribution reserve, respectively. Hereafter, all payments by the system on account of any annuity shall be charged to this reserve. 
(4)  Administrative expense reserve. Amounts contributed by the system for administrative expense shall be credited to this reserve. All expenses of administration of the system shall be charged to this reserve. The board shall certify to the city annually the amount of its requirements for administrative expenses. To provide for the initial expenses incident to the organization and establishment of the system, the city shall contribute, upon the adoption of this article, a sum estimated by the board as being necessary for that purpose. 
(5)  Actuarial studies. An actuarial survey of the operating experience of the system, as a check of the mortality, turnover, disability, interest and other actuarial factors assumed in calculations of liabilities and costs shall be made at least once every five years by an actuary engaged by the board. An annual actuarial valuation shall be completed as of the close of each fiscal year for the purpose of establishing the financial condition of the system and as a check on the adequacy of the reserves of the system. 
(b)  Any excess balance in the retirement reserve as determined by actuarial valuation shall be applied to reduce the city's contributions in the succeeding year, and deficiency in the retirement reserve, which shall be charged to the city contribution reserve, shall be removed by an increase in the city's contribution rate for the succeeding fiscal year. Such adjustments as may be required in this or any other reserve shall be made upon recommendation of the actuary. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 11-245 )

If a vacancy occurs in the office of an appointive trustee, such vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as the office was previously filled. 
(c)  Each trustee shall take an oath that, so far as it devolves upon him, he will diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the board and that he will not knowingly or wilfully permit to be violated any of the provisions of this article applicable to the system. Such oath shall be subscribed by the member making it, certified by the officer before whom it is taken and immediately filed with the city clerk. A trustee shall be deemed to have qualified for membership on the board when such oath shall have been filed. 
(d)  Subject to the limitations prescribed in this section, the board shall from time to time establish rules and regulations for the administration of the system and to implement the provisions of this article as may be required. It shall hold regular meetings at least quarterly in each year and such special meetings as may be deemed necessary. The annual meeting shall be held in the month of January of each year.

If the board of trustees determines that the police officer or firefighter whose retirement or other benefits or payments have been revoked or reduced under article V of this chapter has failed to satisfy any outstanding judgment or order of restitution rendered by any court of competent jurisdiction, it may order that any funds otherwise due to the police officer or firefighter as a return of contribution, or any portion thereof, be paid in satisfaction of the judgment or order.

(c)  Permits. It is the responsibility of the permit holder to apply for a permit by February 28 of each year. As a courtesy, application forms will be mailed by the harbormaster each year to those persons who held valid mooring permits at the end of the previous calendar year by January 15 and returned to the city hall by February 28. Applicants wishing to change the permitted vessel must submit an original permit application along with a copy of the Rhode Island boat registration and fee. A change in the vessel size or draft may cause the renewal to be considered under section 13-116(d) of this article. Nonrespondents shall be sent a letter on or about March 1, assessing them a $150.00 late fee and giving the permit holder until March 15 to apply. Failure to submit an application, mooring permit fee, and late fee by March 15 will result in the loss of the permit. It shall be the responsibility of the mooring permit holder to notify the harbormaster of any change in address. The harbormaster shall approve or reject mooring permit applications by March 15. 
(d)  Relocation of existing permitted mooring. All requests for relocation of existing permitted moorings must be submitted to the harbormaster [and] must meet the requirements listed for a mooring permit application. The reasons for a mooring relocation must also accompany the request. Based upon availability of space, the requirements of this chapter, and the type and size characteristics of vessel, action will be taken on the request. Any incomplete request shall be returned to the applicant and no action will be taken on the request. Relocation of a mooring is at the sole expense of the mooring permit holder. 
(e)  Failure to apply for a mooring permit. Failure to apply for a mooring permit in accordance with the provision of this chapter by March 15 of any given year will result in the permitted owner's abandonment of all his privileges and interest in the previously issued permit. The harbormaster will remove or dispose of the now abandoned mooring at the permitted owner's expense. Such expense may in turn be recovered by the city, in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(f)  Forfeiture of mooring permit. Any owner of a mooring located in the coastal waters and harbor areas of the city shall be deemed to have forfeited his mooring permit by reason of the following: 
(1)  Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Removal of mooring and mooring tackle by mooring owner and notification to the harbormaster and/or harbor management commission that the mooring has been removed. 
(3)  Failure to respond to the harbormaster's and/or harbor management commission's notice that the mooring does not comply with the mooring tackle standards set forth in this article, or that the mooring has been displaced or moved from its permitted location. 
(4)  Failure to resurface or replace mooring within 15 days after being advised by the harbormaster that the mooring is down. 
(5)  Knowingly providing false information to the harbormaster in the mooring permit application process. 
(6)  Failure to occupy the mooring by July 1 the year after being granted a year-of grace. 
(7)  Sale of a permitted vessel and not notifying the harbormaster or allowing the new owner to occupy the mooring. 
(g)  Available spaces. Each year, the harbor management commission shall determine the number of mooring spaces available for mooring placement within each designated field A—G. This determination shall be based on an assessment of the density of moored vessels in each field in order to ensure safe and proper clearance. This number may be less than the number of currently permitted spaces within a designated mooring field although no valid renewal permit application shall be denied. Available mooring spaces shall be made available to those persons whose names appear on the waiting lists. 
(h)  Waiting list. The harbormaster shall maintain two waiting lists (ref. section 13-79, exhibits 9 and 10); one list for new mooring applications (NMWL) and one list for requests for mooring location changes (MLCL) for all applications for mooring permit requests when no mooring space is available within the coastal waters and harbor areas of the city. Placement of applications on such waiting lists will be recorded from complete mooring permit applications as they are received at the city clerk's office. The harbormaster shall update the waiting lists at least twice a year and make the waiting lists available for public review at the city clerk's office. When a mooring location becomes available, the harbormaster shall assign the space on a seniority basis to persons on the new mooring applications or requests for mooring location changes. Persons on the MLCL shall take priority over persons on the NMWL. The harbormaster shall offer newly available mooring locations to the first person on the MLCL with a suitable boat. Should this person decline the spot, the person next in seniority with a suitable boat shall be offered the spot. This process will continue until all of the appropriate persons on the MLCL have had the opportunity to move up to the available spot. Persons declining a spot from either list shall maintain their relative position on the list. Persons who accept a new spot shall be removed from the list. 
(i)  Processing of applications. All new permit applications and requests for mooring changes shall be sent directly to the city clerk's office, time and date stamped. A copy of the request will be forwarded to the harbormaster for further processing and the original application shall remain on file at the city clerk's office. The harbormaster shall not be able to consider any applications that have not been first processed by the city clerk's office. 
(j)  Occupancy of mooring. 
(1)  No vessel shall occupy a mooring other than the one for which it has been permitted. The harbormaster shall have the authority to move any vessel violating the provisions of this section, with such movement at the expense and risk of the vessel owner. 
(2)  If a mooring should remain unoccupied by its permit holder for a period of one season, the harbormaster may choose not to renew the permit holder's permit. The permit holder shall have the right to appeal such a decision to the harbor management commission as stipulated in subsection 13-82(5). 
(3)  The harbormaster may permit the temporary use of a mooring by another vessel after receiving written consent by the permitted mooring owner.

(1)  The city forecasts or experiences a loss in total non-property tax revenues and the loss is certified by the director of finance. 
(2)  The city experiences or anticipates an emergency situation, which causes or will cause the levy to exceed this percentage increase specified in subsection (a).

(3)  The city forecasts or experiences debt services expenditures which exceed the prior year's debt service expenditures by an amount greater than the percentage increase as specified in subsection (a) of this section and which are the result of bonded debt issued in a manner consistent with general law or a special act. 
(4)  The city experiences substantial growth in its tax base as the result of major new construction which necessitates either significant infrastructure or school housing expenditures by the city or a significant increase in the need for essential municipal services and such increase in expenditures or demand for services is certified by the director of finance.

Further, the City of East Providence City Council may not exceed the maximum levy provided for in G.L. 1956, § 44-5-2 et seq. unless it is approved by resolution passed by a four-fifths vote of the city council. Said resolutions must specify the reasons the city council is seeking the waiver of the maximum tax levy and contain the specific amount by which the city council exceeds the maximum tax levy. 
(d)  Said resolutions provided for in subsection (c) of this ordinance must be passed at a public hearing of the city council.

Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing permit. 
(c)  Reporting requirements for permittee. 
(1)  Baseline monitoring reports. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4) whichever is later, existing categorical user currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the superintendent a report which contains the information listed in subsections (b)(2)a through i of this section. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the superintendent a report which contains the information listed in subsections (b)(2)a through i of this section. A new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged. 
(2)  Periodic compliance reports: 
a.  Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard or in the case of a new source after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the superintendent, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a report of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in subsection (b)(4) of this section. At the discretion of the superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the superintendent may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
b.  The superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection (c)(2)a of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. 
(Comment: Where 40 CFR, part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator.) 
(d)  Monitoring facilities. 
(1)  The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(2)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(3)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(e)  Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination, or in the performance of any of his duties. The city, EPA, and DEM shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(f)  Pretreatment. 
(1)  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(2)  The city shall annually publish in the Providence Journal newspaper a list of the users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification may also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user and during the same 12 months. 
(3)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. 
(g)  Confidential information. 
(1)  Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. 
(2)  When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the national pollutant discharge elimination (NPDES) permit, state disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

(1)  The owner is to install and bear the associated costs of a deduct meter; 
(2)  The deduct meter is to meet customary minimum standards as established by the city department of public works; 
(3)  The deduct meter is to be installed by a licensed plumber; 
(4)  The owner is to submit a certification by a licensed plumber to the city department of public works covering the date of meter installation; the type and specifications of the installed meter; location of the installed meter; and that the meter reads solely extraneous water use; 
(5)  The owner is to submit a certification, permission and acknowledgment document to the city department of public works: 
a.  Guaranteeing access of unscheduled random meter inspections by authorized agents of the city department of public works; and 
b.  Agreement and understanding that sewer use credits will be granted only if all stated owner requirements for deduct meters are met and owner uses city department of public works provided reading cards in reading the deduct meter and submitting the readings to the city department of public works by a prescribed deadline. 
(6)  The owner is to submit a certification by a licensed plumber at the ten-year anniversary date of deduct meter installation (and at ten-year intervals thereafter) that either: 
a.  A new meter has been installed; or 
b.  The meter has received major maintenance and recalibration. 
(7)  For filling swimming pools, a property owner may be eligible for a one-time reduction of the sewer charge in the amount of $100.00. The owner is to submit a certification to the city department of public works which states the following: 
a.  Date of new pool installation (including submission of the approved building permit), or proof of pool repair (i.e., receipt from repair contractor) which necessitated the draining and refilling of the pool. 
b.  Pool must contain a minimum of 7,480 gallons (1,000 cubic feet) which is comparable to an 18-foot diameter above-ground pool, or greater.

(4)  If the property was billed for water that did not enter the sewer system during a specific time period, the customer shall provide documentation from a licensed plumber supporting the occurrence and repair of the leak, along with a copy of the paid repair receipt. The customer may also provide additional documentation to prove that water did not enter the sewer system to the satisfaction of the director of public works. The average usage for the property will be determined by meter readings. This average will be compared to the period in question, to establish whether or not an adjustment is warranted. 
(5)  If the customer is unable to provide documentation as noted in the section above, the adjustment to the sewer consumption charge will be computed in accordance with the following formula: 
Total billed consumption, minus prior year same period consumption, equals excessive consumption. Excessive consumption divided by two, plus normal consumption, equals the total adjusted consumption upon which the adjusted sewer consumption charge will be calculated. The calculation will be made using the sewer charges in effect for the billing period in question. 
(6)  The adjusted amount will be deducted from the amount owed if the bill is unpaid or credited to the account if the bill has been paid. There will be no adjustment of interest charges unless the written request had been received prior to the due date of the bill. 
(7)  The property owner shall not be more than 30 days delinquent on their water or sewer bill at the time of a request for a sewer charge abatement.

ARTICLE XIII. - MOTORCYCLES AND OFF-HIGHWAY MOTOR VEHICLES 
 
Sec. 18-401. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds that the driving, riding, and use of motorcycles, motor-driven cycles, or off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the limits of the city is and can be the cause of noise and dust and of the destruction of plants, landscaping, and other personal and real property, which conduct adversely affects the comfort and privacy of occupants and residents of the city. Additionally, the increased use of motorized play vehicles including but not limited to miniature motorcycles, motorized scooters and mini bikes on city property constitutes a safety hazard. Because this conduct may be intermittent, fleeting, moving, or caused by persons who are minors, the other provisions of this revision, as well as other legal remedies are inadequate to control this conduct and its adverse effects. The provisions of this article relating to the regulation of motorcycles, motor-driven cycles, or off-highway motor vehicles are therefore necessary for the public welfare. 
(b)  The city council declares that the purpose of this section is to exercise the general police power in order to promote public safety, protect the enjoyment and use of public and private property, to protect the right of privacy, to preserve property and personal values, and to promote peace and quiet within the city by regulating the use of motorcycles, motor-driven cycles, or off-highway motor vehicles on public and private property within the city. 
(c)  This section shall not apply to the driving, riding, and use of motorcycles, motor-driven cycles, or off-highway vehicles on streets and highways or in other areas which are specifically governed or preempted by the motor vehicle code or any other statutes of the state.

(1)  Where such vehicle is being driven, ridden, or used upon property by the owner, resident or tenant of such property, or by an authorized visitor when such visitor is accompanied by or has a written authorization in his possession from the owner, resident or tenant of such property; 
(2)  Where such use is permitted pursuant to a use permit or otherwise in accordance with the zoning regulations of the city. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 18-402)  
Sec. 18-403. - Mufflers. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to drive, ride or use a motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, or off-highway motor vehicle, as such vehicles are defined in G.L. 1956, §§ 31-1-3 and 31-3.2-1 respectively of the motor vehicle code of the state, including but not limited to motor scooters, motorbikes and minibikes, upon any public or private property which is not an improved public street or highway, or an improved private street constructed in accordance with the city standards and approved by the city, unless the motorcycle, motor-driven cycle, or off-highway motor vehicle is at all times equipped with an adequate muffler in constant operation and properly maintained so as to meet the requirements of G.L. 1956, §§ 31-23-13 and 31-3.2-8 of the motor vehicle code of the state, as the state statute now exists or may hereafter be amended, and no muffler or exhaust system shall be equipped with a cutout, bypass, or similar device. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 18-403)  
Sec. 18-404. - Other regulations. 
The regulations contained in this chapter do not supersede or preclude the enforcement of the zoning regulations or any other regulations contained in this Revision which are applicable to any conduct regulated hereby. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 18-404)  
Sec. 18-405. - Motorized mini-bikes. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to operate a motorized device, including but not limited to miniature motorcycles, motorized scooters, or mini-bikes: 
(1)  Upon any public property including, but not limited to public streets, sidewalks, school property, playgrounds and parks; 
(2)  Upon private property of another without express written permission of the owner or occupant of such property; or 
(3)  Upon private property at such times to create unusual noise or danger, which may be a public nuisance or hazard, endangering the quiet, peace, or safety of persons inhabiting nearby residential buildings. 
This section specifically excludes registered motorized scooters designed for seated operation, electric personal assistive mobility devices including Segways, motorized wheelchairs and motorized scooters designed for individuals with disabilities, or any other vehicle utilized by a disabled person as his or her only predictable means of transportation. 
When a minor operates a motorized device, the minor's legal guardian is liable and legally responsible for all injuries and damages caused by the minor's operation of the motorized device, and for the minor's violation of this section. 
Any person convicted of willfully violating this section shall be guilty of an infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $100.00 and/or a requirement to perform community service for a total time not to exceed 20 hours over a period not to exceed 30 days during times other than his or her hour of school attendance and employment. Each violation shall be a separate infraction.

(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-44)

(a)  In granting a variance, the zoning board of review shall require that evidence to the satisfaction of the following standards be entered into the record of the proceedings that: 
(1)  The hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not to the general characteristics of the surrounding area, and not due to a physical or economic disability of the applicant excepting those physical disabilities addressed in Rhode Island General Laws 45-24-30(16) (personal hardship shall not be considered grounds for a variance, since the variance will continue to affect the character of the neighborhood after title to the property has passed); 
(2)  Such hardship is not the result of any prior action of the applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the applicant to realize greater financial gain; 
(3)  The granting of the requested variance will not alter the general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or purpose of this chapter or the city comprehensive plan upon which this chapter is based; and 
(4)  The relief to be granted is the least relief necessary. 
(b)  The zoning board of review shall, in addition to the above standards, require that evidence be entered into the record of the proceedings showing that: 
(1)  In granting a use variance the subject land or structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming use of neighboring land or structures in the same district and permitted use of lands or structures in an adjacent district shall not be considered in granting a use variance; and 
(2)  In granting a dimensional variance, that the hardship that will be suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional variance is not granted shall amount to more than a mere inconvenience, which shall mean that there is no other reasonable alternative to enjoy a legally permitted beneficial use of one's property. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted shall not be grounds for relief. 
(c)  Modifications permitted by zoning officer. The zoning officer shall have authority to administratively approve modifications from the literal dimensional requirements of section 19-145 in the instance of the construction, alteration, or structural modification of a structure, except for maximum height of building (story and feet), provided the deviation is no more ten percent. Within ten days of the receipt of a request for a modification, the zoning officer shall make a decision as to the suitability of the requested modification based on the following determinations: 
(1)  The modification requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the permitted use; 
(2)  If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured nor its appropriate use substantially impaired; 
(3)  The modification requested is in harmony with the purposes and intent of the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance; and 
(4)  The modification does not require a variance of a flood hazard requirement. 
Upon an affirmative determination, the zoning officer shall notify, by registered or certified mail, all property owners abutting the property which is the subject of the modification request and shall indicate the street address of the subject property in the notice, and shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town that the modification will be granted unless written objection is received within 30 days of the public notice. If written objection is received within 30 days, the request for a modification shall be denied and shall be considered a variance request, which may only be granted by the zoning board of review through the standard procedures for variances in Chapter 19, Zoning. The zoning officer shall keep public records of all requests for modifications, and of findings, determinations, and any objections received. Costs of any notice required under this subsection shall be borne by the applicant requesting the modification. 
(d)  In granting a variance the zoning board of review may apply special conditions as provided for in section 19-13.

Sec. 19-46. - Same—Intent and eligibility. 
Any person, group, agency or corporation may apply for relief from the literal requirements of this chapter, which is not contrary to the public interest, in instances where owing to special conditions of the parcel, a strict application of this chapter results in unnecessary and undue hardship. Two types of variances are allowed: Dimensional variance and use variance. Both variance applications follow the same procedure, while the standards of findings differ as noted in section 19-45.

Sec. 19-99. - Floating zone districts; purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. This section establishes the mechanism for the review and creation of four types of floating zone districts, which upon approval by the city council shall amend the existing zoning map. The purpose of floating zone districts is to permit high intensity or mixed use character development and to promote flexible design upon parcels deemed appropriate for such development. Floating zone districts are unmapped zoning districts which are established on the zoning map only when an application for development meeting the requirements is approved. A petitioner must establish that the site proposed is appropriate for the floating zone district, and petition, in accordance with article II, division 4, to amend the city zoning map. Except where otherwise provided for in this chapter, the floating zone district regulations are derived from the regulations of the underlying zoning district. Floating zone districts may impose supplementary requirements but do not in any manner supersede or replace any requirements of the underlying district, except where specifically provided for in this article or otherwise in this chapter. In all cases, floating zone district map amendments are conditional upon site plan approval through land development project review as provided for in article V of this chapter. 
(b)  Objectives. Decisions to approve a floating zone district shall be consistent with the following objectives where applicable: 
(1)  To promote diverse land uses which are consistent with the goals of the city comprehensive plan; 
(2)  To allow for mixed use developments where the site provides adequate safeguards to adjacent districts; 
(3)  To promote greater flexibility and consequently more creative and imaginative design for the development of residential and mixed use areas than generally is possible under conventional zoning regulations; and 
(4)  [Reserved.] 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-99; Ch. 457, § IV, 10-7-97; Ch. 453, § IV, 7-15-08)  
Sec. 19-100. - Types of floating zone districts. 
The following floating zone districts may by action of the city council amend the city zoning map for sites determined to be appropriate. 
(1)  Mixed use floating zone district. A mixed use floating zone district permits planned development of mixed residential/commercial uses; see further definition in section 19-364. 
(2)  Cluster floating zone district. A cluster floating zone district may amend any residential zone and permits clustering of residential units with the goal of preserving open space; see further definition in section 19-364. 
(3)  Business/technology floating zone district. The business/technology floating zone district permits business/technology uses; see further definition in section 19-364. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-100; Ch. 457, § V, 10-7-97; Ch. 453, § V, 7-15-08)  
Sec. 19-101. - Application process and unified review. 
(a)  A petition for a floating zone district shall be filed with the city clerk in accordance with the requirements and procedures of article II, division 4, to amend the zoning map, including those for fees, notification and application requirements. 
(b)  The city council may consider a petition for a floating zone district map amendment simultaneously with rezoning to the underlying district, as one rezoning petition. 
(c)  All projects requiring floating zone district amendments must also be reviewed according to the land development project process of article V of this chapter. The applicant shall first obtain an advisory recommendation on the zoning change from the planning board, as well as, conditional planning board approval for the first approval stage for the proposed project, which may be simultaneous, then obtain a conditional zoning change from the council and then return to the planning board for subsequent required approval. 
(d)  The petition for a floating zone district amendment shall be filed concurrently with the application requirements of article V of this chapter for land development project review. The key map of the land development project application may be used as the map required under section 19-72. Notification requirements shall be in accordance with the requirements of each action as specified in section 19-74 and article V of this chapter. 
(e)  All floating zone district map amendments shall be approved as conditional upon land development project approval of a site plan. The floating zone district map amendment shall not become finalized until final land development project approval is received. 
(f)  Conditional approval of a floating zoning district map amendment shall not bind the planning board to approving a land development project. 
(g)  The filing of a floating zone district map amendment petition does not imply its acceptance in whole or part by the city council. The approval of a floating zone district map amendment including any modifications, conditions or restrictions thereto, represents a legally binding commitment by an applicant to carry out the development as approved. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-101)  
Sec. 19-102. - Phased development or expanded development. 
(a)  If the proposed land development project for which the floating zone map amendment is proposed is to be phased, the floating zone district map amendment petition shall include the area of all proposed phases. 
(b)  Amendments to increase the size of a floating zone district as it appears on the zoning map, shall be treated as a new application and shall follow all of the procedures of this article. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-102)  
Sec. 19-103. - Temporary use permit. 
(a)  A temporary use permit that confers a temporary privilege to operate beyond the defined permissible uses in any zoning district. Temporary use permits are subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Temporary use permits shall automatically expire on January 1 of each year. 
(2)  The fee for a temporary use permit shall be set by the zoning officer. 
(3)  A temporary use permit may be revoked at any time by the zoning officer. 
(4)  Applications for temporary use permits shall be submitted to the zoning officer. Temporary use permits shall only issue if: 
i.  Unless expressly allowed by this section, the temporary use or structure complies with the yard and bulk requirements of the district in which it is located. 
ii.  The temporary use does not cause, or threaten to cause, an on-site or off-site threat to the public health, safety, and welfare. 
iii.  The temporary use is operated in accordance with such restrictions and conditions as the police and fire department may require. If required as a condition of approval, the operator of the temporary use shall employ appropriate security personnel. 
iv.  The temporary use does not conflict with another previously authorized temporary use. 
v.  The Applicant shows proof of ownership in the relevant property. 
vi.  If the relevant property contains public property, the applicant shall acquire written permission from the director of the department of public works for use of said property, subject to any conditions set by the city. 
(b)  Short-term rental. The offering of or occupancy or use of, all or portions of a dwelling unit by anyone other than the owner for a fee for a period of fewer than 28 consecutive calendar days. 
(1)  A dwelling unit in a single-family, two-family, three-family, semi-detached, or multi-family dwelling may be used as a short-term rental, subject to the following standards: 
i.  Properties used as short-term rentals in residential districts must be owner-occupied.

DIVISION 2. - LOT, AREA, SETBACK AND YARD REGULATIONS 
 
Sec. 19-131. - General requirements. 
The requirements and regulations in this division are intended only as minimal standards for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare and should be exceeded wherever practical or desirable. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-131)  
Sec. 19-132. - Substandard lots of record. 
Except as required in section 19-133, a lot or group of contiguous lots having dimensions and/or area of lesser amounts than required in section 19-145 for the district in which such lot is located may be considered as coming within the minimum lot requirements of section 19-145, provided that such lot or group of contiguous lots was shown on a recorded plat or on a recorded deed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived (November 29, 1966). These are also referred to as prior recorded lots. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-132)  
Sec. 19-133. - Contiguous lots under common ownership. 
It is the intent of this chapter to require merger of contiguous unimproved or improved substandard lots of record in the same ownership in order to create dimensionally conforming lots or to reduce the extent of dimensional conformance. 
If two or more contiguous lots are under common ownership at any time after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived and one or more of these lots fails to meet the requirements of section 19-145 with regard to minimum lot area or minimum lot width, or lot building coverage, or minimum setbacks as required by sections 19-144 and 19-145 of this chapter, or the off-street parking requirements of section 19-284 of this chapter, such lots shall be considered to be an individual lot of land for the purpose of this chapter. Contiguous lots or parcels shall share common and abutting boundary lines and not be separated by a street or other property. Contiguous parcels under separate ownership shall be considered to make up a single lot if joint application for a building permit is made by all owners of such parcels. No single lot shall be used in violation of the requirements of section 19-145 with regard to minimum lot area or minimum lot width, except as provided in this chapter. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-133; Ch. 184, § I, 11-6-01; Ch. 194, § I, 12-18-01)  
Sec. 19-134. - Dimensional regulations generally. 
(a)  Except as hereinafter provided, a dwelling, building or structure hereafter erected in any district shall not be located on a lot or parcel of land having less than the minimum dimensional and setback requirements of this chapter and shall not exceed the maximum height and percentage of lot building coverage. 
(b)  No lot, parcel or tract of land shall be reduced in dimension or area such as to be in violation of section 19-145, except as hereinafter provided. A lot created after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this chapter for the district in which such lot is located, except as provided in section 19-133. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-134)  
Sec. 19-135. - Use of required yards. 
Yard regulations shall apply to that open area on the same lot with a principal building or structure and accessory structure located between the lot lines and the minimum setback lines which shall be unobstructed by buildings or structures from the ground to the sky, except as hereinafter provided. 
(1)  In any district, the front yard as established in section 19-145 and hereinafter provided shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by buildings or structures other than signs, poles, ornamental and similar structures and shall not be used to fulfill the off-street parking, loading or unloading requirements of this chapter or for outdoor storage or display, except that a driveway and walkways may be located in any required front yard. Parking in the front yard setback shall not exceed one-third of the overall lot width for one and two-family dwellings only. For residential structures only, a handicapped access ramp may be located within the required front yard. No fence or similar screen of solid appearance in a residential district shall exceed four feet in height where located in the required front yard or along property boundaries contiguous to the required front yard. 
(2)  In any district, the side and rear yards as established by the minimum required setback in section 19-145 and hereinafter provided shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by buildings or structures except as hereinafter provided. For residential structures only, a handicapped access ramp may be located within the required side and rear yard setback. (See section 19-144 for regulations pertaining to accessory uses and structures. 
(3)  Off-street parking, loading or unloading area in conformance with sections 19-276 through 19-284 or 19-285 through 19-290 and accessory to a permitted use located on the premises may be located within the required side or rear yard, except where such yard is located in a commercial or industrial district and abuts a residential or open space district, only if necessary to meet the minimum requirements of such sections as determined and approved by the zoning officer and city traffic engineer. 
(4)  In any district, any portion of a required yard not developed for a use expressly permitted under the terms of this chapter shall be landscaped and maintained to enhance the premises and to be attractive and acceptable to the neighborhood. 
(5)  No fence or similar screen of solid appearance in a residential district shall exceed six feet in height where located in the required rear yard or side yard or along property boundaries contiguous to the required rear yard or side yard when said boundary abuts another residential use. For a boundary between a residential and commercial or industrial use no fence or similar screen of solid appearance shall be less than six feet nor more than ten feet in height. These restrictions shall not apply to plantings such as arborvitae or other similar trees or shrubs. Said height shall be measured from the existing grade at the rear and side lot lines.

Sec. 19-136. - Minimum setback measurements. 
(a)  The minimum front setback requirements of section 19-145 shall be measured along a line parallel to the lot line at the minimum distance of the required setback. If 75 percent or more of the block frontage of the same street is improved with buildings, the front setback shall extend to the average alignment of such buildings. 
(b)  The minimum side and rear setback measurement of section 19-145 shall be measured parallel to the lot line at the minimum distance of the required setback. Where no minimum side setback is required by section 19-145 but where a side setback is actually provided, such side setback shall not be less than five feet. 
(c)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, for any building or structure, the minimum front, side and read setback as required in section 19-145 shall be increased by three feet for each full floor level over the first two floor levels. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-136; Ch. 194, § II, 12-18-01)  
Sec. 19-137. - Front, side and rear yards on abutting lots in adjacent districts. 
(a)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this division wherever a lot or parcel of land in a commercial or industrial district abuts a lot or parcel of land in a residential district fronting on the same street, the lot or parcel of land in the commercial or industrial district shall have at least one-half of the front setback as required in the adjoining residential district but not less than that required in the commercial or industrial district. 
(b)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter wherever a lot or parcel of land in an R-5 district, any commercial district or an I-1 district abuts a lot or parcel of land in a residential district, the side and rear yard setback on the lot or parcel in the R-5, commercial, or I-1 districts shall be measured at least 30 feet from the property line along that portion of the lot or parcel that abuts the residential district. 
(c)  Wherever a lot or parcel of land in an I-2 general manufacturing or an I-3 heavy manufacturing district abuts a residential district, the principal building or structure on the lot or parcel in the I-2 or I-3 district shall be set back at least 50 feet from the property line along that portion of the lot or parcel that abuts the residential district. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-137)  
Sec. 19-138. - Side yards. 
(a)  Side lot line. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no side lot line shall be less than 80 feet. In the case of corner lots, which meet all other dimensional requirements and have a side lot line serving in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and section 19-141(c) as a rear lot line, this side lot line may be less than 80 feet but not less than 50 feet. 
(b)  Use of side yard as rear yard. Where under the definition a rear yard is not possible as in the case of a corner lot, one side yard shall be designated as a rear yard and shall conform to all regulations of this chapter pertaining to rear yards. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-138)  
Sec. 19-139. - Number of structures. 
Not more than one structure used for residential purposes shall be built upon any single lot in any R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5 or R-6 district. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-139; Ch. 184, § II, 11-6-01)  
Sec. 19-140. - Measurements. 
(a)  Lot frontage. Lot frontage shall be measured along the street right-of-way line between the side lot lines and shall be not less than 40 feet. Where all frontage is not contiguous, then only the largest single frontage will be considered with regard to minimum frontage requirements; in cases of equivalent noncontiguous frontage, minimum frontage will be determined by the zoning officer. 
(b)  Lot depth. Lot depth shall be measured from the front lot line to the rear lot line; this distance shall be the shortest distance. For lots where the front and rear lot lines are not parallel the lot depth is an average of the depth. Average shall be measured from the midpoint of the front lot line to the midpoint of the rear lot line. Lot depth for corner and through lots shall be as determined under section 19-141. 
(c)  Lot width. Lot width shall be measured as the horizontal distance between the side lines of a lot measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the minimum front setback line. For lots where the front and rear lot lines are not parallel or the front lot line is curved, width shall be measured as the distance between lot lines along a line at right angles to the depth which intersects the depth at the minimum front setback line. Width for corner and through lots shall be as determined under section 19-141. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-140)  
Sec. 19-141. - Corner lots and through lots. 
(a)  Corner lots—Setbacks. For corner lots, those lots which abut on and at the intersection of two or more streets and/or road rights-of-way, lot frontage shall be considered for the purposes of determining setbacks to be two or more front lot lines which shall all meet the minimum front setback requirements of section 19-145. 
(b)  Corner lots—Lot depth and width. Lot depth for corner lots may be measured from any front lot line measuring as indicated in lot depth, to a side lot line considered under this measurement to be a rear lot line. Lot width for corner lots shall be measured as indicated under lot width. 
(c)  Use of side yard as rear yard. Where in the case of a corner lot there is no apparent rear lot line, one side lot line shall be designated as a rear lot line and shall conform to all regulations of this chapter pertaining to rear yard setbacks. 
(d)  Through lots—Setbacks. For through lots, those lots which front upon two parallel streets or which front upon two streets which do not intersect at the boundaries of the lot, the lot shall be considered for the purposes of determining setbacks to have two front lot lines which shall both meet the minimum front setback requirements of section 19-145. 
(e)  Through lots—Depth. For through lots, those lots which front upon two parallel streets or which front upon two streets which do not intersect at the boundaries of the lot, depth shall be measured for lots with parallel front lot lines, as the distance measured from the front lot line to front lot line, the distance shall be the shortest distance. For lots where the front lot lines are not parallel, the lot depth is an average which shall be measured from midpoint to midpoint of the front lot lines. 
(f)  Through lots—Width. Width shall be measured as indicated under lot width at the minimum front setback from either front lot line. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-141)  
Sec. 19-142. - Determination of uncertain locations. 
Where the location of a lot width or lot depth line or a front, side or rear lot line is otherwise uncertain, the zoning officer shall determine their position in a manner complying as closely as possible with the requirements of this chapter. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-142)  
Sec. 19-143. - Obstructing vision at corner lots. 
On a corner lot in any district, nothing shall be erected, placed, planted or allowed to grow in such a manner as to materially impede vision between a height of 2½ and ten feet above the centerline grades of the intersecting streets in the area bounded by the street lines of such corner lots and a line joining points along the street lines 30 feet from the point of the intersection. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-143)  
Sec. 19-144. - Accessory buildings and structures. 
(a)  All residentially used or zoned lots shall contain no more than three accessory sheds and one accessory garage. No accessory building or structure shall be located nearer than five feet from a principal building unless such accessory building or structure is attached to the principal building. 
(b)  An accessory building, structure or use conforming to section 19-171 may be located within the required side yard setback and rear yard setback, provided it shall not be nearer than five feet from any lot line. A garden or tool shed used only for the storage of garden implements and light home maintenance tools and swimming pools including pertinent structures such as dressing and shower rooms and equipment houses as regulated by this chapter and other city ordinances are permitted when such uses are accessory to a nonconforming residential use. In-ground and above-ground swimming pools, however, shall not be located nearer than six feet from a lot line per section 421.4 (locations) of the BOCA Code. 
(c)  An accessory building, structure or use conforming to section 19-171 shall be limited to no more than 20 feet in height, except as provided as follows: 
An accessory structure which is attached to a principal structure may be treated as a principal structure in terms of height requirements provided the setback requirements applicable to a principal structure are met.

Sec. 19-277. - Continuation of requirements. 
The off-street parking spaces associated with permitted uses as provided for and required by this chapter shall be a continuing obligation of the present or future owner of any premises and shall not be reduced, changed, encroached upon in any manner or discontinued unless a change in the parking requirements of such associated permitted uses occurs to permit a corresponding change in the size of the required off-street parking area. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-277)  
Sec. 19-278. - Location and street access. 
Each off-street parking space required by this chapter shall have vehicular access to a street and shall be on the same lot or premises as the building, structure or use it is intended to serve, on a lot adjoining the premises or on a lot directly across an adjoining street from the premises. When practical difficulties as determined by the zoning board of review prevent the location of off-street parking space as required in this division, such space shall be located within 400 feet of the premises. In such instances, appropriate deed restrictions and/or easements shall be placed in the land evidence records for both the property on which the use is located and the property on which the parking is located. Such legal documents shall be subject to the review and approval of the city solicitor. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, off-street parking for commercial or industrial uses as required in this section shall not be permitted in any residential or open space zone.

Sec. 19-280. - Mixed uses on a premises. 
In the case of mixed uses on a premises, the total requirements for off-street parking space shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately as hereinafter required, and the off-street parking space for one use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking space for any other use. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-280; Ch. 146, § XIII, 10-23-00)  
Sec. 19-281. - Methods of determining off-street parking requirements. 
(a)  When the schedule requires the on-site number of spaces to be calculated per employee and employees are on the site in shifts, the number to be used is the number of employees present during the largest shift (most employees). It shall mean the total number of employees on the site who will use the site for parking at any one time. 
(b)  A garage or carport may be used to meet the requirements of this section. A driveway may only be used to meet the requirements of this section where it serves a one-family or two-family dwelling. Parking spaces may be stacked or in tandem, for no more than two cars deep, one and two-family dwellings only. Parking in the front yard setback shall not exceed one-third of the overall lot width. 
(c)  Industrial uses. Where it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the zoning officer and/or the planning board or the department of planning and urban development, that employment projections indicate less parking would be needed than that required by section 19-284 and adequate land is available should future use(s) warrant additional parking, then fewer parking spaces will be allowed. 
(d)  If a use is not specifically listed in the off-street parking schedule, the requirements shall be the same as for the most similar use listed as determined by the zoning officer in consultation with the department of planning and urban development referencing the Institute of Traffic Engineers Parking Generation Report.

Sec. 19-282. - Parking space design requirements. 
(a)  Minimum size. Each parking space shall contain an area of not less than 162 square feet for the parking of one vehicle, exclusive of necessary drives or aisles. In allocating space for off-street parking, each parking space shall measure no less than nine feet by 18 feet. Minimum aisle widths shall be as follows: 
90 degree angle 
parking 	24 feet (one-way and two-way traffic) 
60 degree angle 
parking 	23 feet (two-way traffic) 
	18 feet (one-way traffic) 
45 degree angle 
parking 	21 feet (two-way traffic) 
	13 feet (one-way traffic) 
30 degree angle

Sec. 19-283. - Plans, construction and maintenance of off-street parking areas. 
(a)  The following requirements establish minimum acceptable standards for alleviating the visual and environmental effects associated with parking facilities. The application of these standards will serve to improve the compatibility and attractiveness of such facilities, provide relief from un-shaded paved areas, and minimize noise and glare from lights associated with off-street parking facilities. In addition, these requirements will improve pedestrian safety, and optimize traffic circulation patterns with better-defined space. For those developments subject to the development plan review provisions of article VIII of this chapter, additional landscaping requirements apply. 
(b)  Plans. For the purpose of converting spaces into the required parking area, plans for parking areas containing five vehicles or more shall be submitted to the zoning officer to show how the required parking space shall be arranged in the area supplied for such purposes and to indicate sufficient space for parking maneuvers as well as adequate ingress and egress to the parking area. 
(1)  Such plan(s) shall be prepared at a reasonable scale and shall show: property lines; building location(s) and use; the dimensions and lot area of the property; the size and arrangement of all parking and any required loading spaces; the means of ingress and egress to such parking and loading spaces from the street system and interior circulation with the property; the location and design of required landscaping; the area of the parcel available for winter snow storage (this shall not be within the public right-of-way and shall not damage required landscaped buffering); the extent of any change required in existing site conditions to provide required parking and loading spaces; and such other conditions as may be necessary to permit review and approval of the proposed parking and any required loading spaces. 
(2)  Such plan(s) may be referred to other agencies and city departments as may be necessary to review the proposed parking area. 
(c)  Construction standards. Every parcel of land which after the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived is changed to a parking area for five vehicles or more, shall be developed as follows, subject to the review and approval of the required plans by the city engineer/deputy director of public works and subject to the approval of the zoning officer and building official: 
(1)  Such area where subject to wheeled traffic shall be paved, drained, lighted and arranged and marked for convenient access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles;

Base flood: The flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
Base flood elevation (BFE): The elevation of the crest of the base flood or 100-year flood. The height, as established in relation to the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 (or other datum where specified), in relation to mean sea level expected to be reached by the waters of the base flood at pertinent points in the floodplains of coastal and riverine areas. 
Basement: Any area of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Building: See definition for "Structure". 
Coastal A Zone: Area within a special flood hazard area, landward of a V zone or landward of an open coast without mapped V zones. The principal source of flooding must be astronomical tides, storm surges, seiches, or tsunamis, not riverine flooding. During the base flood conditions, the potential for breaking wave heights shall be greater than or equal to 1.5 feet. 
Cost: As related to substantial improvements, the cost of any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, alteration, repair or other improvement of a structure shall be established by a detailed written contractor's estimate. The estimate shall include, but not be limited to: the cost of materials (interior finishing elements, structural elements, utility and service equipment); sales tax on materials, building equipment and fixtures, including heating and air conditioning and utility meters; labor; built-in appliances; demolition and site preparation; repairs made to damaged parts of the building worked on at the same time; contractor's overhead; contractor's profit; and grand total. Items to be excluded include: cost of plans and specifications, survey costs, permit fees, costs to correct code violations subsequent to a violation notice, outside improvements such as septic systems, water supply wells, landscaping, sidewalks, fences, yard lights, irrigation systems, and detached structures such as garages, sheds, and gazebos. 
Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, the construction of buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
Existing manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision: A manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured home are to be affixed (including, as a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision: The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufacturing homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. For the purposes of these regulations, the term "regulatory floodway" is synonymous in meaning with the term "floodway". 
Freeboard: A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. "Freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
Functionally dependent use or facility: A use that cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities.

Limit of moderate wave action (LiMWA): An advisory line indicating the limit of the one and one-half-foot wave height during the base flood. 
Lowest floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of § 60.3 [sic]. 
Manufactured home: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
Manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision: A parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
Market value: Market value is the price of a structure that a willing buyer and seller agree upon. This can be determined by an independent appraisal by a professional appraiser; the property's tax assessment, minus land value; the replacement cost minus depreciation of the structure; the structure's actual cash value. 
New construction: Structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.

Sheet flow area (for community with AO, AH, or VO zones only): See definition for "area of shallow flooding". 
Special flood hazard area (SFHA): The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AO, AR/AH, AR/A, VO, or V1-30, VE or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term "special flood hazard area" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard". 
Start of construction: For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement, substantial improvement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erections of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
For insurance purposes, means: 
(1)  A building with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; 
(2)  A manufactured home ("a manufactured home," also known as a mobile home, is a structure; built on permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or 
(3)  A travel trailer, without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community's floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. 
For the latter purpose, "structure" does not mean recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as described in paragraph (3) of this definition, or a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure, whereby the cost of restoring the structure to before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvements to a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include: 
(1)  Any project to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of the "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
Variance: A grant of relief by a community from the terms of the floodplain management ordinance that allows construction in a manner otherwise prohibited and where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. 
Violation: Failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management ordinance. Construction or other development without required permits, lowest floor elevation documentation, floodproofing certificates or required floodway encroachment calculations is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 19-309. - Permit required. 
All proposed construction or other development within a special flood hazard area shall require a permit. The National Flood Insurance Program Special Flood Hazard Area requires permits for all projects that meet the definition of development, not just "building" projects. Development projects include any filling, grading, excavation, mining, drilling, storage of materials, temporary stream crossings. If the construction or other development within a special flood hazard area is not covered by a building permit, all other nonstructural activities shall be permitted by either the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council and/or the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management as applicable. Therefore if another state agency issues a permit, the local building official must have the opportunity for input and keep a copy of the respective permit in their files. 
Prior to the issuance of a building or development permit, the applicant shall submit evidence that all necessary permits and approvals have been received from all government agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law. 
(Ch. 580, § I, 8-20-13)  
Sec. 19-310. - Permit fee. 
A permit fee (based on the cost of the construction) may be required to be paid to the City of East Providence and a copy of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An additional fee may be charged if the code enforcement officer and/or board of appeals need the assistance of a professional engineer. 
(Ch. 580, § I, 8-20-13)  
Sec. 19-311. - Notification of watercourse alteration.

(7)  Queens. All colonies shall be maintained with marked queens. In any instance in which a colony exhibits unusual aggressive characteristics by stinging or attempting to sting without provocation or exhibits an unusual disposition toward swarming, it shall be the duty of the beekeeper to promptly requeen the colony with another marked queen. Queens shall be selected from stock bred for gentleness and nonswarming characteristics. 
(8)  Flyway Zone. In each instance in which any colony is situated within ten feet of a developed public or private property line on the lot upon which the apiary is situated, as measured from the nearest point of the hive to the property line, the beekeeper shall establish and maintain a flyway barrier at least six feet in height consisting of a solid wall or fence parallel to the property line and extending five feet beyond the hive in each direction so that all bees upon leaving the hive are forced to fly at an elevation of at least six feet above ground level over the flyway structure. 
(9)  General maintenance. Each beekeeper shall ensure that no bee comb or other materials are left upon the grounds of the apiary site. Upon their removal from the hive, all such materials shall promptly be disposed of in a sealed container or placed within a building or other bee-proof enclosure. 
(10)  Prohibited. The keeping by any person of honeybee colonies in the city not in strict compliance with this chapter is prohibited. Any bee colony not residing in a hive structure intended for beekeeping, or any swarm of bees, or any colony not residing in a standard or homemade hive structure which, by virtue of its condition, has obviously been abandoned by the beekeeper, is unlawful and may be summarily destroyed or removed from the city by the city manager or designee. Unless such bees present an imminent threat to public safety, the Department of Environmental Management, Division of Agriculture, and the city's animal control officer shall first be contacted to assess the possibility of collecting and relocating the bees by a person or company possessing the means to safely remove said bees.

The Main Street designation is land that has, or is planned to have commercial and/or mixed use development with a storefront character using a typical Main Street build-to-line* with buildings at the sidewalk and front (Taunton Avenue) property line. Main Street uses primarily provide convenience retail sales and services to the surrounding residential neighborhood, and gives priority to the access and convenience of pedestrians. Building types are small commercial structures, multi-story mixed use and some residential structures. Non-residential uses typically occupy the street front. These uses may include, but are not limited to, a combination of commercial use(s), offices, retail, residential, personal convenience service businesses, cultural activity* and public and civic uses. Land uses may be mixed by floor (vertically within a building) or horizontally on a parcel of land. Pedestrian linkages from mixed commercial/residential, retail, personal service and recreational land uses to existing areas of neighborhood residential land use shall be encouraged. The scale of mixed use may range from a single stand-alone retail use with office or residential use on the upper stories, to a larger scale development, such as a neighborhood center*, that integrates commercial, retail, offices, housing, and public spaces. 
(2)  Neighborhood center* may only be developed on a lot consisting of not less than a minimum of 50,000 square feet. A neighborhood center* means a development consisting of a building or buildings used for mixed land use, that has a community or civic space that is open to the public. A neighborhood center development shall include a location for a public transit stop, provide pedestrian linkages to surrounding neighborhoods, while also providing a buffered edge between the center and abutting residentially used or zoned land. A neighborhood center* should be adjacent to a residential district(s) they are intended to serve. A neighborhood center should be oriented to streets with pedestrian amenities. The mixed land use in a neighborhood center* may include multi-family dwelling* provided that the commercial, retail, office, and/or personal convenience use(s) comprises more than 50 percent of the gross leasable area of the total building(s) area either of an existing or proposed building(s) on the parcel. Neighborhood centers* and mixed uses are destinations for people and draw the public to a space. A public feature such as a gazebo, garden, art, etc., that provides consumers with an attractive amenity is encouraged. 
(3)  Development proposals shall comply with all applicable sections of chapter 19, zoning, and shall be consistent with all city rules, standards, regulations and ordinances (including adopted plans). For all the parcels within this district, development may alternatively occur as is currently allowed within the zoning district in which parcel(s) is located and not under the provisions of section 19-322, Main Street and neighborhood center Overlay District. 
(c)  Uses. 
(1)  Mixed use is permitted subject to the following: Any use permitted by right in either an a C-1, a C-2, C-3 and/or TA zoning district, as well as any other accessory or special uses as may be permitted generally by chapter 19, zoning, and under section 19-98, schedule of use regulations and section 19-171, accessory uses, shall be allowed, except that the following shall be prohibited uses: 
Self-storage, mini-storage; auto body, or soldering or welding shop; limited manufacturing*; motel*, and retail uses with across the board maximum pricing or "everything under" pricing and surplus goods. 
(2)  In addition to those uses permitted under section 19-98, chapter 19, zoning in the underlying zoning districts other uses are permitted, and may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
a.  Mixed use; 
b.  Incubator*; 
c.  Photography studio; 
d.  Black box theatre*; 
e.  Café*; 
f.  Cultural activity*;

m.  Yoga or pilates studio (not a commercial full-service gym); 
n.  Live/work space*; 
o.  Small fabricating shops not to include industrial trade schools, and further provided that the activity does not include a use that is prohibited in the C-4, C-5, I-1, I-2 and/or I-3 zoning districts; 
p.  Cigar lounge; 
q.  Tattoo parlors; 
r.  Previously owned goods and merchandise including antiques, collectibles, coins, consignment and stamps, excluding pawn shops; 
s.  Transit shelters, drop off-points, bicycle rack(s) and/or corrals, and informational or retail kiosks. Layover locations for buses shall be prohibited; 
t.  Public structure or public use including, but not limited to, public and private park, community or civic space, museum, gallery, or community center; 
u.  Bicycle paths and/or road bike lanes and pedestrian paths, bicycle racks or corrals. 
(3)  Multi-family dwelling* in Mixed Use Development "Main Street" parcels. 
a.  Multi-family dwelling* in "Main Street" configuration. Multi-family dwelling* is permitted (in the areas of the overlay district with the underlying zoning districts of C-1 and C-2) and when mixed with a commercial, retail, and/or office use in a Main Street configuration at a density that is proportional to the ability to provide fifty percent (50%) of the total off-street parking spaces required if the uses were calculated separately based upon section 19-284, off-street parking. (See section 19-322.) 
b.  Multi-family dwelling* in a neighborhood center*. Multi-family dwelling* use may be included in a neighborhood center* provided that the other commercial, retail, office, and/or personal convenience use comprises more than 50 percent of the gross leasable area of the total building(s) area either of an existing or proposed building(s) on a parcel. 
c.  A neighborhood center* shall be permitted on lots of not less than 50,000 square feet and such a development shall consist of a building or buildings used for mixed land use. The mixed land use in a neighborhood center* may include multi-family dwelling* provided that the other commercial, retail, office, and/or personal convenience uses comprises more than 50 percent of the gross leasable area of the total building(s) area either of an existing or proposed building(s) on the parcel. The neighborhood center* provides a location for a public transit stop, linkages to surrounding neighborhoods and properties, while also providing a buffered edge between the center and abutting residentially used or zoned land. Neighborhood centers* are destinations for people. The mixed use draws the public to the space and a public feature such as a gazebo, garden, art, etc. provides consumers with an attractive amenity. 
d.  Other uses shall be permitted in the Main Street and Neighborhood Center Overlay District when provided as an integral part of the overall development and such use(s) are consistent with the stated purposes of chapter 19, zoning, and which are intended to serve the commercial and residential users of a mixed use development. Other uses shall be suitable to the proposed development, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and compatible with the surrounding land uses. Said determination shall be made by the zoning officer in consultation with the director of planning. 
(d)  Off-street parking and off-street loading. 
(1)  For those properties proposing development in the Main Street Overlay, and not "neighborhood center" scale development, off-street parking shall be provided at no less than 50 percent of the total off-street parking spaces required if the uses were calculated separately based upon section 19-284, off-street parking, provided that the proposal meets the intent of the overlay district of subsection 19-322(b). Additionally, required employee parking that is stacked or in tandem shall be permitted and counted towards the total number of off-street parking spaces required provided there is a written agreement among the individual tenants of a building provided to the zoning officer. The zoning officer shall have the authority to monitor such an arrangement and require modified parking or a petition to the zoning board of review regarding the off-street parking if it is apparent that the stacked employee parking arrangement is unfeasible and/or there are unforeseeable impact to adjoining streets with overflow parking, particularly local residential streets. 
(2)  A neighborhood center development shall provide off-street parking as required by section 19-284. However, this amount may be reduced by ten percent provided that the applicant/owner shall submit a valet parking plan, including certification that a valet is on-duty during business hours, and documenting authorized use of a satellite parking area to the Zoning Officer such that a modification may be granted. An applicant or developer of a neighborhood center* may further reduce parking subject to the provisions of section 19-279, joint use and shared use, where the applicant and/or owner are able to provide a shared parking study and plan to the zoning officer, and provided that the procedures of section 19-279 regarding joint and shared and parking shall be followed. 
(3)  Bonus height structured parking incentive. An additional one (12 foot) building story shall be permitted for every story of structured parking provided in a building, with the overall height not to exceed five stories or 60 feet. 
(e)  Purposes. Consistent with the City of East Providence Comprehensive Plan, the purposes of the Main Street and Neighborhood Center Overlay District are to: 
(1)  Promote flexibility in the siting and design of new development to allow a mixture of complimentary land uses on a parcel(s) that may include, but is not limited to, commercial, housing, retail, offices, and personal convenience services to create economic and social vitality that otherwise might not be possible under conventional zoning regulations that separate land uses. 
(2)  To provide a desirable mix of land uses, including commercial and residential, that will serve the community interest in job creation, housing, and economic development, including uses related to the arts and culture. 
(3)  Encourage efficient use of land by facilitating centers and minimizing the amount of land that is needed for surface parking. 
(4)  Encourage quality development that facilitates utilization of public transportation, where applicable. 
(5)  Provide opportunities to businesses within the district for coordinated mixed use development, pedestrian and bicycle connections, and innovative site design. 
(6)  Provide safe, comfortable and attractive pedestrian connections from existing areas such as residential and open space to currently predominantly commercial roadways and to public transportation, and to new areas of land use and new neighborhood centers*. 
(7)  Reinforce public rights-of-way, shoulder sides of roadways and sidewalks, as public places that encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel. 
(8)  Enhance linkages and pedestrian connections to residential areas, schools, and recreational space in the vicinity of the overlay district for the convenience of the public. 
(9)  Encourage the use of sidewalks for outdoor cafes, sitting, and shop displays where possible, and when new development or redevelopment is proposed, look for opportunities to widen the sidewalk/pedestrian area in front of the building(s) for outdoor café seating, sitting, restaurant and shop displays, and trees for shade. 
(f)  General standards. All applicants whose proposals require permits from other agencies, e.g., a state agency such as the Department of Transportation, shall obtain any and all such applicable permits, including city building permits and licenses. As with all other proposed development reviewed under this chapter, the proposal shall meet the general purposes of section 19-2, chapter 19, zoning, and the following: 
(1)  The design of the proposed development will be consistent with the goals of the city comprehensive plan, and will implement the purposes of the Main Street and Neighborhood Center Overlay District. 
(2)  Erosion will be adequately controlled during and after construction and will not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring property or public facilities and services; provisions have been made for storm water and drainage facilities, and that increased runoff due to development on the site will not be injurious to any nearby property owners or cause hazardous conditions on any streets. 
(3)  The movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the site and in relation to access streets will be safe and convenient and adequate provision has been made for snow removal. 
(4)  All utilities, infrastructure, streets, roadways, sidewalks, walkways and parking are improvements will be provided for the development in a manner meeting the applicable requirements and standards of the city. Construction standards for utilities and improvements serving the public shall meet city standards. 
(5)  The location, arrangement, appearance, and sufficiency of off-street parking and loading comply in all respects with chapter 19, zoning and/or the provisions of subsection 19-322(d) as applicable, and are adequate to serve the proposed development. 
(6)  The proposed development and all uses and structures therein, shall comply in all respects with chapter 19, zoning. Nothing in this article shall prevent an applicant from seeking a variance from the zoning board of review.

(1)  Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; 
(2)  Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas; 
(3)  Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
(4)  Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
(5)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
(6)  Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(7)  Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
(8)  Consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and 
(9)  Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
(b)  In furtherance of these goals set out in subsection (a), the city shall give due consideration to the comprehensive plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.

(4)  Reinforce streets as public places that encourage pedestrian and bicycle travel; 
(5)  Provide roadway and pedestrian connections to residential areas; 
(6)  Encourage efficient land use by facilitating compact, high-density development and minimizing the amount of land that is needed for surface parking; and 
(7)  Facilitate development (land use mix, density and design) that utilizes public transit, where applicable; 
(b)  Review process. The Development Plan Review Committee shall review and approve proposals within the Riverside Square Mixed Use/Downtown Overlay District following the process for development plan review identified in section 19-453, Procedure. The DPR Committee may apply such special conditions, restrictions or stipulations as it may deem necessary to maintain consistency with the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, and subdivision and land development regulations to maintain harmony with neighboring uses. 
(c)  Design intention and functioning. 
(1)  [Reserved.] 
(2)  Maximize the building floor area on each lot. 
(3)  Locate parking off the street frontage to the rear of parcels so that businesses can move close to the sidewalk and more readily attract pedestrians. 
(4)  Place buildings at a minimal front setback line, close behind a sidewalk of adequate width. 
(5)  Encourage construction of at least two-story buildings. 
(6)  Locate retail uses on the ground-floor street frontage, preferably adjacent to other retail uses. 
(7)  Develop sidewalks and building features (e.g. entrances, weather protection) so as to maximize safety, comfort, ease of movement, and convenience for pedestrians. 
(8)  Encourage building heights of two and one-half stories (maximum height of 35 feet), with first floor commercial use and second floor residential use. Residential use may also be provided on the first floor but the main entrance of such first floor residential use shall be limited to the rear or side of the structure. 
(9)  Floors above ground level shall have independent, separate access to the street. 
(10)  Driveway and parking lot surfaces are encouraged to be permeable, using such materials as brick, concrete pavers, "grass-crete" and other similar permeable materials, but not gravel. Vegetative buffers shall be planted to treat runoff as it percolates into the soil. Use of low impact development (LID) techniques is encouraged. 
(11)  Walk-up windows to retail uses may be permitted provided that such windows shall be located on the front lot line facing a street, with no curb cut or allowance of any motorized vehicular access. 
(Ch. 453, § XXIII, 7-15-08)  
Sec. 19-360. - Standards for development. 
(a)  No development plan shall be approved unless it is determined that the following standards are reached to the maximum extent feasible, or to the extent feasible given the circumstances of the property, in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. 
(1)  Build-to line requirement. In no case shall the front setback specified for the underlying zoning district take precedence. All building front setback requirements shall be zero, except under the following circumstances: 
a.  Where other site requirements such as utility or access easements preclude such building placement. 
b.  Where it is determined that the use of existing buildings on adjacent parcels would be significantly adversely affected by setbacks from front or side property lines that are smaller than those on the adjoining parcels (e.g., light would be blocked from existing windows on the side of a building). 
c.  Where minimum required clearance from an overhead electric power line, based on the National Electric Code, must be maintained, especially for buildings of more than one story. 
(2)  Setbacks. For a particular development plan, a determination shall be required that proposed setbacks are consistent with the purposes and design intention of this overlay district. 
(3)  Ground floor facade. At least 50 percent of the ground floor facade of non-residential use shall be constructed of transparent material or otherwise designed to allow pedestrians to view activities inside the building. The ground floor facade shall be composed of windows opening into the interior, display windows (which need not be open into the interior), or entrances, which openings are determined to be well-distributed along the face of the building or addition so as to minimize the lengths of blank wall areas. 
(4)  Building width. A new building or addition to an existing building shall occupy the full width of the lot, except in the following circumstances: 
a.  A pedestrian passageway to parking or other businesses to the rear of the building is provided. 
b.  A side yard is used as an outside seating area for a cafe or a public courtyard. 
c.  A driveway to parking spaces in the rear is allowed alongside the building because there is no other access to the parking spaces. 
d.  A utility easement precludes use of the full width, in which case one of the above uses shall be placed over the easement. 
(5)  Outdoor patron seating areas. Administrative review and issuance of an outdoor use area permit is required for designation of proposed outdoor seating areas, to ensure that the standards in this Chapter are met and that public safety and access for pedestrians, persons with disabilities, and emergency response personnel will not be compromised. 
(6)  Signage. The signage requirements of article VII. Signs shall be met, except as provided below: 
a.  Wall sign. Wall signs shall be externally illuminated by incandescent, metal halide or halogen light and shall be made of metal, painted wood or similar material (no plastic). Signs shall be placed on the building so as not to obscure architectural features and details. Internally illuminated neon signs are permitted. 
b.  Free standing sign. A freestanding sign shall be externally illuminated by incandescent, metal halide or halogen light and shall be made of metal, painted wood or similar material (no plastic). 
(7)  Parking. Each development in this district shall be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the DPR Committee that the location, arrangement, appearance, and sufficiency of off-street parking and loading shall be adequate to serve the development. No parking, driveway, or other area for vehicles shall be placed between the building and the street. 
a.  Parking ratios. The number of parking spaces provided for a site shall be considered as a base from which to adjust, as applicable and appropriate, to an adequate number and location of spaces. In no case shall the number of off-street parking spaces exceed the number calculated from the parking ratios required by the zoning ordinance.

Sec. 19-370. - Reserve parking area for business/technology development. 
(a)  For a business/technology development as defined in section 19-1, up to 15 percent of the total parking spaces required under section 19-284 may be held in reserve only upon review and approval under the provisions of this article. Such reserve parking area shall be maintained as a landscaped area until such time as the zoning officer and/or the property owner, in consultation with the director of planning, deems that construction of the reserve parking spaces is required. 
(b)  The applicant for such a parking reduction shall provide a parking management plan (PMP), which shall provide justification that the number of parking spaces to be supplied will exceed peak parking demand. The PMP shall be based upon nationally accepted methodology and standards for estimating parking demand and shall provide an estimate of peak parking generation based upon square footage, proposed uses, number of employees and all other applicable factors. The PMP should describe any factors which the applicant is utilizing to justify lowering of parking generation figures, such as: Any alternative modes of transportation, including carpools or vanpool; varied work shifts; use of company operated buses; and availability of public transit. 
(c)  The developer/applicant, and the property owner, where different, shall be required to sign a binding covenant, with the city a party thereto, to construct the reserve spaces when they are deemed required. Such covenant shall run with the land and be binding upon future landowners and shall be recorded in the city's land evidence records. Such covenant shall be subject to review and approval as to form by the city solicitor. The covenant will detail the conditions under which the city may require construction of the reserve parking spaces, including, but not limited to, on-going parking in unauthorized areas of the site, such as in aisles, driveways and in landscaped areas of a site, and unauthorized off-site parking. 
(d)  A request for approval of a reserve parking area shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with the provisions of this article. A site plan meeting the requirements of article VIII shall be submitted which shall show the layout of all required parking spaces, aisles, landscaping and other applicable standards, and further shall show the reserve parking spaces in relation to the buildings which these spaces will serve. The reserve parking area, when constructed, shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter. 
(e)  Drainage and erosion control plans and drainage calculations prepared by a professional engineer shall be submitted for the entire site and shall address how the stormwater runoff from the reserve parking area will be accommodated at such time as the reserve parking spaces are constructed. Since the reserve parking may be constructed when deemed necessary, this landscaped area shall be considered an interim use and shall be counted as impervious area for purposes of calculating the maximum impermeable surface permitted for the site as detailed in section 19-455, pertaining to drainage/erosion standards.

ARTICLE VI. - NONCONFORMING DEVELOPMENT 
 
Sec. 19-411. - Purpose. 
Buildings, structures or land nonconforming by use and/or nonconforming by dimension as defined in section 19-1, are incompatible with and detrimental to permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located, cause disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the city, inhibit present and future development of nearby properties and confer upon their owners and users a position of unfair advantage. It is a fundamental principle of this chapter that nonconformities may be continued but shall not be increased, except in circumstances where the findings of section 19-39 can be met, and should be eventually abolished or reduced to conformity according to the fair interests of the parties involved. It is also intended that existing nonconformities shall not cause further departures from this chapter for any properties. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-411)  
Sec. 19-412. - Continuation. 
The lawful uses of any building, structure, premises or land existing on November 29, 1966, the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived, or as of any subsequent amendment of this chapter may be continued although such use or structure does not conform with the provisions of this chapter. This shall not be interpreted to prevent the regulation of nuisances. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-412)  
Sec. 19-413. - Alteration of nonconforming use. 
(a)  No addition, enlargement, expansion or intensification in the extent of the nonconforming use of premises or land shall be made, unless a special use permit is authorized in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The conversion of an accessory porch to living space shall be permitted by right. 
(b)  A use established by variance or special use permit shall not acquire the rights of this section. 
(c)  Except as provided in this article, a nonconforming use shall be changed to a permitted use and once changed to a permitted use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure shall not otherwise be changed to another nonconforming use that is substantially different in nature and purpose unless a variance is granted by the zoning board of review, with the additional finding that the proposed use will have a lesser undesirable impact on the surrounding area than the preceding nonconforming use. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-413)  
Sec. 19-414. - Alteration of structure nonconforming by dimension. 
No addition, enlargement or expansion to a structure or building nonconforming by dimension shall be made except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter or unless a special use permit is authorized in with the provisions of this chapter. This shall not apply to the conversion of an accessory porch to living space or to second story additions, providing that there is no projection beyond the existing structure. A conforming use within a building or structure which is nonconforming by dimension may be changed to any other conforming use. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-414)  
Sec. 19-415. - Moving. 
A building or structure nonconforming by use or dimension shall not be moved in whole or in part unless such building or structure is made to conform to all of the regulations of the zone in which it is to be located. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-415)  
Sec. 19-416. - Restoration of damaged structures. 
A structure nonconforming by dimension which is involuntarily destroyed or damaged in any manner or from any cause may be repaired or rebuilt within the limits of the original dimensions and upon the original location of such structure without conforming to the provisions of this chapter, provided that a reasonable attempt has been made to comply with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-416)  
Sec. 19-417. - Abandonment. 
If a nonconforming use is abandoned, it may not be reestablished. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall consist of some overt act, or failure to act, which would lead one to believe that the owner of the nonconforming use neither claims nor retains any interest in continuing the nonconforming use unless such owner can demonstrate an intent not to abandon the use. An involuntary interruption of nonconforming use, such as by fire and natural catastrophe does not establish the intent to abandon the nonconforming use. However, if any nonconforming use is halted for a period of one year, the owner of such nonconforming use will be presumed to have abandoned such nonconforming use, unless such presumption is rebutted by presentation of sufficient evidence of intent not to abandon the use. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-417)  
Sec. 19-418. - Demolition. 
If a building or structure nonconforming by dimension or a building or structure housing a nonconforming use, is demolished at the direction of the owner or other authorized parties, except as provided elsewhere in this section, the building or structure or nonconforming use shall not be reestablished, and any future building, structure or use of the lot or premises shall conform to the provisions of this chapter. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-418)  
Sec. 19-419. - Prior illegal establishment. 
Any nonconforming use or structure nonconforming by dimension illegally established prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived shall not become legally established by virtue of such enactment or subsequent amendment. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-419)  
Sec. 19-420. - Prior building permits. 
Any building permit legally issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter was derived or any subsequent amendment of this chapter shall be activated within six months from the date of issuance. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-420)  
Sec. 19-421. - Maintenance and repair. 
A structure nonconforming by dimension or a building or structure containing a nonconforming use shall be properly maintained in good repair as may be required by any other ordinance or statute, provided that any such work does not enlarge or extend any nonconforming use or otherwise increase any nonconformity. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-421)  
Sec. 19-422. - Nonconforming by use and dimension. 
A building, structure or land nonconforming by both use and dimension shall comply with all regulations of this section. Where the regulations conflict, the most restrictive regulations shall apply. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-422)  
Sec. 19-423. - Governmental uses. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, structures, buildings and land may be erected or used by the city, or any agency or department thereof for governmental purposes in any zoning district; and such structures, buildings and land so erected or used shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter.

ARTICLE VIII. - DEVELOPMENT PLAN REVIEW 
 
Sec. 19-448. - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to establish procedures pursuant to the permitting process which will enable the city to perform a comprehensive review of certain proposed developments. The development plan review (DPR) procedure, formerly referred to as site plan review (SPR), shall not be used to deny applicant a permitted use of the property as established by the zoning ordinance. The particular uses requiring development plan review are outlined. The development plan review requirements of this article are designed to assure safe, orderly and harmonious development of property in a manner that shall: 
(1)  Provide suitable safeguard and consideration for land use and site and architectural design that is compatible with adjacent districts and uses; 
(2)  Permit development to an extent commensurate with the availability and capacity of public facilities and services and promote the safe circulation of traffic throughout the city; 
(3)  Preserve and protect natural resources and features and encourage consideration of environmental impacts and mitigative measures; 
(4)  Encourage the provision of open space and public access and give due consideration to the quality and design of landscaping; 
(5)  Encourage adequate consideration for the proper control of erosion, surface and subsurface drainage and pollution; 
(6)  Facilitate orderly and harmonious site development including safe and convenient provision and design of egress and ingress, off-street parking, truck loading, internal circulation, emergency access, refuse disposal, outdoor storage, signage and lighting; 
(7)  Give developers reasonable assurance of ultimate approval before incurring the cost of final design and engineering while providing assurances to the city and the general public that the approved project will meet with approved objectives and standards; 
(8)  Preserve natural, historical and cultural resources to the maximum extent feasible; 
(9)  Protect appropriate vistas and environmental qualities of the city; 
(10)  Assure consideration of the various elements of the comprehensive plan of the city. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-448; Ch. 453, § XVIII, 7-15-08)  
Sec. 19-449. - Applicability. 
(a)  No permit to build, alter or expand any of the uses requiring development plan review as outlined below shall be issued by the building inspector, until a written statement of final approval in accordance with this article has been received. The applicant is responsible for obtaining a building permit through the department of public works, building inspection division as is required by city ordinances. The petitioner must submit all plans and documents normally required for a building permit. The approved final plan shall be part of this submission. The development plan review process will not preclude the need to meet other city requirements as they may apply to a particular development. No alteration to any city ordinance requirements, or any necessity to gain approval by another legal jurisdiction shall be deemed to be authority by virtue of the development plan approval under this article. 
(b)  Where a project meets the threshold for development plan review, as defined in section 19-451, and constitutes a subdivision, as defined in the land development and subdivision review regulations adopted by the city planning board, the two processes shall proceed concurrently. In the event that the development plan review decision must be made prior to a final decision on the subdivision associated with the development, this decision shall be conditional on the subdivision approval. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-449)  
Sec. 19-450. - Coordination with zoning board of review. 
(a)  The development plan review process (if otherwise applicable) must take place prior to consideration of a variance, or appeal to the zoning board of review. The zoning board of review shall not consider an application for a special use permit until the applicant has received a certificate of completeness as provided for in subsection 19-453(c). In the event a special use permit is granted by the zoning board of review, its decision shall be binding upon the development plan review committee only to the extent that such decision does not impinge upon the ability of the development plan review committee to establish and enforce all standards and objectives of the development plan review ordinance. The findings of the DPR committee shall be considered by the zoning board of review in its decision of the matter before it. In the event of a variance, the decision and findings of the DPR committee are provided as information to the zoning board of review. 
(b)  The development plan review process is intended to complement information to the zoning board of review in its deliberations, and should not require further plan preparation therewith, except as necessary to meet legal requirements set forth under state statute or the city zoning ordinance for the consideration of any special use permit, variance or appeal. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-450)  
Sec. 19-451. - Uses requiring development plan approval. 
(a)  The following activities require development plan approval: 
(1)  Any exterior additions or changes to buildings or changes of use which require the addition [sic] or deletion of 25 or more parking spaces. 
(2)  Parking areas for 25 or more motor vehicles. 
(3)  Any new development with a total building square footage of 15,000 square feet or greater. 
(4)  Proposed developments in the Riverside Square Mixed Use Downtown Overlay District. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-451; Ch. 146, § XVI, 10-23-00; Ch. 453, § XIX, 7-15-08; Ch. 506, § XVII, 7-20-10)  
Sec. 19-452. - Development plan review committee. 
(a)  All development plans submitted under the provisions of this article shall be reviewed by a development plan review committee (DPR committee) which shall consist of the planning director, public works director and fire chief or their authorized representatives. The planning director shall serve as the chair of the committee and the planning department shall coordinate the review process. The DPR committee's review shall cover conformity with this article and other applicable ordinances and regulations of the city. Each member of the DPR committee shall rely upon information and review of appropriate members of their staff. Review by each member shall be limited to their area of jurisdiction. Development plan approval shall be by approval of all of the members of the DPR committee. No alteration to any city ordinance requirements, or any necessity to gain approval by another legal jurisdiction shall be deemed to be authorized by virtue of development plan approval under this article. 
(b)  The DPR committee may not grant variances from the provisions of this chapter. The DPR committee has the right to waive any submission requirements of this article or make further requirements as needed to render a decision. Where the DPR committee recognizes the design standards of this article cannot be fully met, the DPR committee has the authority to approve site plans incorporating a balance of the design standards in a manner which maximizes the achievement of the stated objectives of this article. Compensating amenities and features exceeding standards and objectives must be identified within such a site plan. The DPR committee shall address these offsetting features in writing as part of its statement of final decision. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-452)  
Sec. 19-453. - Procedure. 
(a)  Project concept review conference. At the request of the applicant, the DPR committee shall grant an informal review conference to provide the applicant the opportunity to present alternative development concepts or sketches for a development which the applicant intends to submit for development plan review approval. The purpose of the project concept review conference is to provide DPR committee input in the formative stages of the development process. The applicant shall not be bound by the determination of the project concept review conference, nor shall the DPR committee be bound by any such review. 
(b)  Preapplication conference. Before submitting a development plan, the applicant shall meet with the DPR committee, or their designated representatives, to review the proposal and determine the information the applicant must submit for consideration by the DPR committee. The purpose of the preapplication conference is to allow the DPR committee to: 
(1)  Inform the applicant of the content of the comprehensive plan and any specific plans that apply to the parcel; explain provisions of this chapter and other city ordinances that affect the proposed development; 
(2)  Suggest improvements to the proposed design on the basis of review of available sketch plan; 
(3)  Advise the applicant to consult appropriate authorities on the character and placement of public utility services; and 
(4)  Assist the applicant in understanding the procedures as required by this chapter. 
The DPR committee may waive certain development plan review submission requirements as outlined below if it finds that the information will not be necessary for the DPR committee to render its decision or the cost of preparing such information would represent an unreasonable burden to the applicant. The DPR committee shall as soon as practicable provide a list of the submission requirements for a particular project. The DPR committee review at the preapplication conference stage is preliminary and further comment may result from substantive review of complete applications. The applicant shall not be obligated to resubmit supporting site plans and documentation which have previously been submitted and reviewed by the DPR committee as part of an approved land development project application to the extent that the same information was previously submitted. 
(c)  Preliminary development plan filing. The applicant must then file with the planning department ten copies each of a preliminary development plan and application along with other supporting documentation and the required filing fee. Such application and development plan shall include the elements upon which the DPR committee is to make a decision as provided in this article, as determined by the preapplication conference. In subsequent applications concerning the same subject matter, the DPR committee may waive the filing of plans and documents to the extent they duplicate those previously filed. The DPR committee has the right to waive any submission requirements of this article or make further requirements as needed to render a decision. 
A development plan, which shall also be referred to as a site plan for the purposes of this chapter, shall be prepared by a registered engineer, landscape architect or architect except where waived by the planning department. For topographical and boundary survey information, the site plan shall be signed and sealed by a licensed land surveyor. All elements or engineering design shall be signed and sealed by a registered professional engineer. 
(d)  Certification of completeness. Upon filing a complete application for development plan review, the applicant shall receive a certificate of completeness indicating the date of receipt of the application by the planning department and the date by which the DPR committee shall take final action. 
(e)  Referrals. Within one week of the issuance of a certificate of completeness, the DPR committee shall transmit copies of the complete development plan application to the city council and other city departments, committees, commissions and boards for review and comment as it may deem necessary. Notice of the receipt of the complete development plan application shall be sent by the department of planning and urban development by registered or certified mail within seven days after the issuance of the certificate of completeness, to all owners of real property within 200 feet of the perimeter of the real property which is the subject of the development plan review application (for the purposes of this section, such property owners are hereinafter referred to as "abutters"). 
(f)  Review conference. The DPR committee shall hold meetings with the applicant to review the preliminary site plan. The applicant shall be provided the opportunity to supply corrections and/or additions on development proposal particulars, especially those which contain or reveal violations of this article or other applicable municipal regulations. 
(g)  General standards for approval. The DPR committee shall review preliminary site plans and supporting documentation and shall issue development plan approval (including appropriate revisions and conditions) provided that the applicant has proved to the committee that the following standards will be met: 
(1)  The design of the proposed development will be consistent with the goals of the city comprehensive plan, and will implement the purposes of development plan review; 
(2)  Erosion will be adequately controlled during and after construction and will not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring property or public facilities and services; 
(3)  Provisions have been made for stormwater and drainage facilities, and that increased runoff due to development on the site will not be injurious to any nearby property owners or cause hazardous conditions on any streets; 
(4)  The movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic within the site and in relation to access streets will be safe and convenient and adequate provision has been made for snow removal; 
(5)  All utilities, infrastructure, streets, roadways, sidewalks, walkways and parking area improvements will be provided for the development in a manner meeting the applicable requirements and standards of the city. Construction standards for utilities and improvements serving the public, as applicable to a subdivision under chapter 15, shall be applicable to a development under this article; 
(6)  The regulation standards as set forth in sections 19-336 through 19-345 be complied with in all respects; 
(7)  The location, arrangement, appearance, and sufficiency of off-street parking and loading comply in all respects with the zoning ordinance and are adequate to serve the development; 
(8)  The provisions of section 19-175 on open storage be complied with in all respects; 
(9)  The proposed development and all uses and structures therein, shall comply in all respects with this chapter. Nothing in this article shall prevent an applicant from seeking a variance or special use permit from the zoning board of review. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-453; Ch. 198, § VII, 2-19-02)  
Sec. 19-454. - Development and landscaping design standards. 
(a)  Purpose and objectives. The purpose of this section is to promote and protect public health, safety, general welfare and amenity. Effective site planning, development design, and landscaping can accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  Promote the most desirable use of land and arrangement of development in the city and thus to conserve the value of land and buildings, and thereby protect the city's tax revenues; 
(2)  Improve the physical environment through the provision of amenities such as open space, street trees, and live vegetation; 
(3)  Preserve the character and scale of existing development and control new development in conformity with the existing character of the area; 
(4)  Provide a transition between and a reduction in the environmental, aesthetic, and other impacts of one type of land use upon another; 
(5)  Promote safe and efficient pedestrian and traffic circulation patterns; 
(6)  Lessen the transmission of noise, dust, pollution and glare from one lot to another; 
(7)  Improve air quality through production of oxygen and reduction of dangerous carbon monoxide; 
(8)  Through shading, provide cooling of air and land to offset radiational heating; 
(9)  Minimize the negative impacts of stormwater runoff to enhance and protect surface and groundwater quality; and promote effective flood management; 
(10)  Control damaging impacts of sheet runoff and resultant surface water contamination; 
(11)  Through vegetative root systems, stabilize groundwater tables and play an important and effective part in soil conservation, erosion control, flood control, and absorption of pollutants. 
(b)  Development standards. 
(1)  Compatibility. Applicants are encouraged to design developments the basic design of which (including proposed style and materials, the relationship between any proposed buildings and the site, and the over all physical appearance), will be consistent with the goals of the city comprehensive plan. 
(2)  General residential building design. Applicants are encouraged to design buildings with varied setbacks and/or varied siting to prevent parallel rows of identical buildings. Principal front or rear walls of a building shall be at least 40 feet from any wall of another building. Any side wall of any building may not be less than 25 feet from any side wall of another building. This requirement shall not apply to accessory buildings. For the purposes of this section, the front, rear or side walls shall be considered the building walls facing or principally facing the front, rear, or side yards respectively. In the case of development in which more than one attached or detached unit is accessible only by a private way or private street, for the purpose of this section only, the front, rear or side yards shall be defined by their relationship to the private street or way irrespective of the definitions and requirements of section 19-1. 
(3)  Townhouse development design. Not more than four contiguous townhouses shall be built in a row with the same or approximately the same front line, and not more than eight townhouses shall be contiguous. Each townhouse should have its own yard containing not less than 400 square feet, reasonably secluded from view from the street or from neighboring property. Such yards may occur in required setbacks, but shall not be used for off-street parking, garages, driveways, trash units, or for any accessory building. 
(4)  Infill development design. Any residential, commercial or industrial developments on lots with less than 200 feet of street frontage, shall be considered infill developments. The design of such developments shall take into consideration the prevailing street setbacks and facade heights of abutting developments. 
(c)  Landscaping standards. 
(1)  General requirements. 
a.  Landscaping shall be provided as part of site plan design. It shall be conceived in a total pattern throughout the site, integrating the various elements of site design, preserving and enhancing the particular identity of the site where appropriate. 
b.  Landscaping may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs, ground covers, perennials, and annuals, and other materials such as rocks, water, sculpture, art, walls, fences, and street furniture. 
(2)  Site protection and general planting requirements. 
a.  Topsoil preservation. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be retained and redistributed within the site in accordance with the approved landscape plan. To the maximum extent practicable, the developer shall minimize the areas of the site to be re-graded or disturbed. All disturbed areas of the development site shall be immediately stabilized by seeding or planting landscaping materials. 
b.  Removal of debris. All organic material, rubbish, deleterious materials or debris shall be removed from the site in a timely fashion. Disposal of cleared, grubbed and stripped materials shall be the responsibility of the developer. All roots, stumps, bush, foliage and other vegetation shall be removed and disposed of by the developer off the project site. This requirement may be modified by the DPR committee for the disposal of organic materials only, where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the committee that such materials will be disposed of on the site in such a manner that there will be no potential for subsidence to occur on the site in the future, and that such organic material does not harbor disease or pests which may adversely effect plantings or buildings on the site. 
c.  Protection of existing plantings. Maximum effort should be made to save tree or other plant specimens which are large for their species, rare to the area, or of special horticultural or landscape value. In the event that any such tree or plant specimens are to be removed, they are to be replaced elsewhere on the project site with specimens of a comparable size and type. Such requirement may be waived by the DPR committee where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that special site and design conditions so warrant. No material or temporary soil deposits shall be placed within the drip line of shrubs or trees designated on the landscape plan to be retained. Protective barriers are to be installed around each plant and/or group of plants that are to remain on the site. Barriers shall not be supported by the plants they are protecting, but shall be self-supporting. They shall be a minimum of four feet in height and constructed of a durable material that will last until construction is completed. Snow fences and silt fences are examples of acceptable barriers. 
d.  Slope plantings. Landscaping of all cuts and fills and/or terraces shall be sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper than one foot vertically to three feet horizontally shall be planted with vegetative ground cover appropriate for the purpose and for soil conditions and environment. 
e.  Additional landscaping. In residential developments, besides the screening and street trees required, additional plantings or landscaping elements may be required throughout the development to mitigate climatic extremes, to promote effective drainage control, to mitigate water and air quality impacts, provide privacy and enhance the appropriate use of adjacent properties, in accordance with the landscape plan as approved by the DPR committee. In nonresidential developments, all areas of the site not occupied by buildings and required improvements shall be landscaped by the planting of grass or other vegetative ground cover, shrubs, and trees as part of the approved landscape plan. 
f.  Planting specifications. Deciduous trees shall have at least a 2½-inch caliper at the time of planting. Such requirement may be modified by the DPR committee where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that the type and groupings of the trees require a smaller caliper at the time of planting. Size of evergreens and shrubs shall be allowed to vary depending on setting and type of shrub. Only nursery-grown plant materials shall be acceptable, and all trees, shrubs and ground covers shall be planted according to accepted horticultural standards. Dead and diseased plants and trees shall be removed and replaced by the owner on at least an annual basis. Failure to properly maintain trees shall result in such work being performed by the city at the owner's expense. 
g.  Plant species. The plant species selected should be hardy for the particular climatic zone in which the development is located and appropriate in terms of function and size. The applicant is encouraged to select plant species which have minimal requirements for watering and fertilization. In selection of plant species reference shall be made to the plant types recommended in the land development and subdivision review regulations or of a variety approved by the superintendent of parks. 
(3)  Shade trees. 
a.  Location. Shade trees shall be either planted or maintained at intervals of no more than 35 feet along both sides of all new or existing streets abutting a development site in accordance with the approved landscape plan. The DPR committee may permit spacing of trees at greater intervals where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that such a spacing is necessary for the preservation of large existing trees or other planting of large tree specimens. 
b.  Tree type. Tree type may vary depending on overall effect desired, but as a general rule, all trees on a street shall be the same kind except to achieve special effects. In selection of tree types reference should be made to tree types recommended in the land development and subdivision review regulations or of a variety approved by the superintendent of parks. 
c.  Planting specifications. Street trees shall have a minimum caliper of 2½ inches at time of planting, and be nursery grown, of substantially uniform size and shape and have straight trunks. Street trees with the exception of ornamental trees, shall have or will have, when fully mature, a minimum caliper of 12 inches. Trees shall be properly planted and staked and provision made by the developer for regular watering and maintenance until they are established. Dead and diseased trees shall be removed and replaced by the owner on at least an annual basis. Failure to properly maintain street trees shall result in such work being performed by the city at the owner's expense. 
(4)  Buffering. 
a.  Function and materials. Buffering shall provide a year-round visual screen in order to minimize adverse impacts. The buffer may contain fencing, evergreens, berms, rocks, boulders, mounds, or combinations thereof to achieve the objectives. 
b.  When required. Every development shall provide sufficient buffering when topographical or other barriers do not provide reasonable screening and when the DPR committee determines that there is a need (1) to shield neighboring properties from any adverse external effects of a development; or (2) to shield the development from negative impacts of adjacent uses; or (3) to minimize stormwater impacts on flood management and water quality. In high-density developments, when building design and siting do not provide privacy, the DPR committee may require landscaping, fences, or walls to screen dwelling units for privacy. Buffers shall be measured from side and rear property lines, excluding driveways. 
c.  Minimum amount required. 
1.  A five-foot buffer strip of grass or other vegetation is required around the entire perimeter of the site, except for any curb cuts. 
2.  Where more-intensive land uses abut less-intensive uses (including situations where a street or right-of-way separates the uses), a buffer strip (25 feet) in width shall be required between such uses. 
3.  Parking lots, garbage collection and utility areas, and loading and unloading areas should be screened around their perimeters by a buffer strip a minimum of (five feet) wide. 
4.  Where residential developments abut both higher-order streets (collectors or arterials) and lower-order streets, lots shall front on lower-order streets, and a landscaped buffer area shall be provided along the property line abutting the higher-order street. The buffer strip shall be a minimum of (25 feet wide) or wider where necessary for the health and safety of the residents. It shall include both trees and shrubs. 
d.  Design. Arrangement of plantings in buffers shall provide maximum protection to contiguous properties and avoid damage to existing plant material. Earthen berms may be used in the buffer design, provided side slopes are adequately stabilized by plant materials. Such berms may be used to calculate effective buffer height. 
e.  Planting specifications. Plant materials shall be sufficiently large and planted in such a fashion that a year-round effective buffer height at least eight feet in height shall be produced within three growing seasons. All plantings shall be installed according to accepted horticultural standards. 
f.  Maintenance. Plantings shall be watered regularly and in a manner appropriate for the specific plant species through the first growing season, and dead and dying plants shall be replaced by the applicant during the next planting season. No buildings, structures, storage of materials or parking shall be permitted within the buffer area. Buffer areas shall be maintained in a manner commensurate with the approved landscaped plan and kept free of all debris, rubbish, weeds, and tall grass. 
(5)  Parking area landscaping requirements. 
a.  Trees shall be planted within the planting strip or in sidewalk areas as may be appropriate, at intervals of no more than 35 feet, and shall have a minimum caliper at time of planting of 2½ inches. The DPR committee may permit spacing of trees at greater intervals where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that such a spacing is necessary for the preservation of large existing trees or the planting of large tree specimens. 
b.  The interior of parking areas shall be suitably landscaped with trees, shrubs, plants or other live vegetation. In addition to the required buffer strip a minimum of ten square feet of landscaping for each parking space shall be provided within the interior of any off-street parking area. Each row of parking spaces shall be terminated by landscaped islands which measure not less than five feet in width and not less than 18 feet in length. The interior of the parking area shall incorporate landscaped areas in appropriate locations in order to prevent long, uninterrupted rows of parking spaces. Such landscaped islands may be included in calculating the required landscaped area. Mandatory terminal islands shall be surrounded with continuous raised curbing. Interior islands and divider medians shall be protected from encroachment of motor vehicles in a manner approved by the DPR committee. Pedestrian paths may be incorporated within the landscaped area provided a minimum dimension of four feet, exclusive of paved areas, is maintained for all landscaped areas. 
c.  The interior of parking areas shall be shaded by deciduous trees (either retained or planted by the developer) that have or will have when fully mature a trunk at least 12 inches in diameter. The minimum caliper of new trees at time of planting shall be at least 2½ inches. At maturity, each tree shall be presumed to shade a circular area having a radius of 15 feet with the trunk as the center, and there must be sufficient trees so that, using this standard, 20 percent of the parking area will be shaded. Trees shall be located so that they are surrounded by at least 180 square feet of unpaved area, which may be counted towards calculating the required landscaped area. Parking areas shall be laid out and detailed to prevent vehicles from striking trees and to provide for the healthy growth of the selected tree species. Vehicles will be presumed to have a body overhang of three feet six inches. 
d.  The owner shall be responsible for maintaining the landscaping of a parking area in a neat and attractive manner. Only nursery-grown plant materials shall be acceptable, and all plantings shall be installed according to accepted horticultural standards. The owner shall be responsible for watering plantings regularly and shall be responsible for removing and replacing all dead or diseased plantings on at least an annual basis. Failure to adequately maintain required plantings may result in the city performing required maintenance at the expense of the landowner. 
e.  [Reserved.] 
(6)  Parking area design standards. 
a.  All parking areas shall provide the minimum required widths for traffic aisles and driveways as described in the table below. At the discretion of the city traffic engineer, the width of the aisles and driveways may be required to be greater than the minimum, should traffic and safety considerations so warrant.

Sec. 19-455. - Drainage/erosion standards. 
(a)  Purpose and objectives. The purpose of this section is to promote the design of developments which effectively control the impacts of erosion, inadequate drainage and stormwater runoff. Effective drainage, site design techniques and erosion control can accomplish the following: 
(1)  Reduce nonpoint source pollutants generated from erosion of sediments and stormwater runoff; 
(2)  Prevent damage to private and public property from flooding caused by poor drainage system design; 
(3)  Improve surface water and groundwater quality by minimizing runoff volumes and peak discharge rates, and by promoting the overland flow and infiltration of uncontaminated runoff; 
(4)  Minimize the negative impacts of stormwater runoff to enhance and protect surface and groundwater quality, and promote effective flood management; 
(5)  Through vegetative root systems, stabilize groundwater tables and play an important part in soil conservation, erosion control and flood control. 
(b)  Soil erosion and sedimentation. Soil erosion and sediment runoff shall be adequately controlled during and after construction and shall not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring properties, surface water and groundwater, or public facilities and services. 
(c)  Drainage standards. 
(1)  Drainage system. All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site. Surface water shall not be regarded as unduly retained if: 
a.  The retention results from a technique, practice or device installed as part of an approved sedimentation or stormwater runoff control plan; or 
b.  The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that experienced by the development site in its predevelopment stage, unless such retention presents a danger to health or safety. 
(2)  No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer. 
(3)  To the maximum extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural contours of the land and natural and preexisting manmade drainageways shall remain undisturbed. 
(4)  Whenever practicable, the drainage system of development shall coordinate with and connect to the drainage system or drainageways on surrounding properties or streets. 
(5)  In areas where a comprehensive watershed drainage study has been performed, the DPR committee may require, based on preliminary review of plans, that a proposed drainage system be subject to an independent engineering evaluation, performed by a qualified engineering consultant. Such evaluation shall be performed by the developer and results of the evaluation shall be provided to the DPR committee to establish that soil drainage conditions can support the proposed drainage system. The costs of such an evaluation shall be borne by the developer. A written report of such evaluation shall be provided to the developer. The consultant shall be selected upon consultation with the developer and upon the joint review and approval of the proposed scope of work and cost estimate. 
(6)  Drainage systems shall be designed so that there will be no increase in the rate of runoff from the post-development site as compared to the predevelopment site based on an assumption of a predevelopment site condition of vacant land. The DPR committee may modify the requirement for an assumption of a predevelopment site condition of vacant land, provided that the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that special site and drainage conditions so warrant, and that there will be no adverse impacts on off-site drainage or water quality. 
(7)  Drainage retention and treatment as required by the State of Rhode Island best management practices and further required by the revised ordinances of the City of East Providence shall be required and subject to the approval of the department of public works and city engineer, and may include above-ground or below ground storm water management, and/or a combination of both. Aboveground drainage retention or detention systems shall be permitted where the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that special site and drainage conditions so warrant, and provided the standards and conditions of the DPR committee regarding such aboveground drainage retention or detention systems are fully met. Such retention or detention systems shall be appropriately landscaped or buffered and maintenance shall be the perpetual responsibility of the property owner. Below-ground storm water structures shall also be the perpetual responsibility of the property owner. 
(8)  Underground or aboveground detention or retention basins shall be designed to accommodate a minimum 25-year storm. For any detention or retention systems proposed to be located within special flood hazard zones (as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood insurance rate map and flood boundary and floodway map, as may be amended), such systems shall be designed to accommodate a minimum 100-year storm. 
For all retention or detention basins, whether aboveground or underground, percolation tests and test pits shall be performed at the proposed site of the basin in accordance with the requirements of the city engineer. This information will determine the suitability of the subsurface to accommodate the designed basin. The maximum high groundwater (HGW) level shall also be determined at the location of any proposed detention or retention basins. The HGW level shall be determined between January and April. If the HGW level is not determined between January and April a registered professional engineer shall estimate and certify the maximum HGW. 
(9)  When retention or detention basins, oil and water separators, or drainage swales are proposed to be incorporated in the drainage system with the approval of the DPR committee, such facilities shall be maintained by the developer or successor property owners in accordance with maintenance guidelines established by the DPR committee upon final approval. Failure to properly maintain such facilities shall result in an expense imposed by the city to be legally established as a lien against the property. If the city agrees to accept maintenance, the developer shall deposit funds with the city in sufficient amount to cover projected maintenance needs for a 20-year period. 
(10)  Stormwater management. All developments shall be constructed and maintained such that adjacent or neighboring properties are not unreasonably burdened with surface waters as a result of such developments. More specifically: 
a.  No development may be constructed or maintained such that development unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent or neighboring properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to such higher adjacent or neighboring properties; 
b.  No development may be constructed or maintained such that surface waters from the development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent or neighboring properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial damage to such properties. The drainage plan shall address potential impacts on downstream property based on a 25-year storm. Off-site analysis shall be included in the drainage plan when required by the DPR committee; and 
c.  Storm drains shall be designed based on a ten-year storm design. 
(11)  Impermeable surface coverage. 
a.  Impermeable surfaces. For the purposes of calculating the amount of impermeable surface coverage, impermeable surfaces shall include all roads, driveways, parking areas, buildings, decking, rooftop landscapes and other impermeable construction covering the natural landscape. Swimming pool surface water areas for pools which discharge to the storm drainage system shall also be included. Water quality and detention basins, swales, and conveyances for drainage purposes only shall be calculated as impervious cover. 
b.  Amount permitted. The maximum amount of the site that may be covered by an impermeable surface shall be determined by adding 20 percent of the site area to the maximum percent of lot building coverage established in schedules in sections 19-145 and 19-146, as applicable, of the zoning ordinance. For developments located near (within 200 feet of surface waters which are sensitive to runoff impacts, or for any developments from which runoff is discharged into any wetland or coastal feature, as defined by the state department of environmental management or the RI CRMC, the DPR committee may require a reduction of up to ten percent of the maximum allowable area of impermeable surface in order to mitigate the potential impact to the surface waters or wetland system. For developments located near wetlands or coastal features, compliance with requirements imposed by the DPR committee shall not remove the need to obtain appropriate state or federal approvals and to comply with any associated conditions. 
c.  Design. Applicants shall integrate the location of permeable surfaces with the overall drainage plan for the site. Natural buffer strips should be maintained adjacent to surface waters. Where this is not possible, vegetative filter strips, using seed mixtures recommended for this purpose and which require minimal or no fertilization should be used. 
d.  Parking areas. For developments located near surface waters, or for any developments from which runoff is discharged into any wetland, the DPR committee may permit the use of permeable paving materials for surfacing parking areas, provided adequate provisions have been made for delineation of parking spaces and for maintenance. It is the intent of this section that permeable surface areas shall be landscaped, and use of permeable paving materials for parking areas shall be permitted only where warranted by water quality and drainage enhancement considerations. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-455; Ch. 642, § XVIII, 3-15-16)  
Sec. 19-456. - Affordable housing. 
(a)  Purpose and objectives. The purpose of this section is to increase the supply of affordably priced housing by providing incentives for developers to provide affordable units within market-rate residential or mixed-use developments. 
(b)  Standards. An increase in maximum development density of up to ten percent may be permitted commensurate to the number of affordable housing units provided such units meet the definition of "affordable housing" over time as referenced in the city housing action plan. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-456)  
Sec. 19-457. - Final action. 
(a)  Generally. The DPR committee shall take final action within 30 days of issuance of a certificate of completeness. Such final action shall be one of the following: 
(1)  A written statement of approval indicating that the DPR committee has determined that the applicant has demonstrated or proved to the satisfaction of the DPR committee that each of the standards of development plan review have been met, and that any other applicable requirements and standards of the city have been met; 
a.  Modifications. An applicant may request modification(s) from the following minimum requirements of chapter 19, zoning and DPR: the dimensional requirements of section 19-145, off-street loading, trash storage areas, open storage, and off-street parking (up to a 25 percent reduction permitted if findings can be met and parking provided is shown to be adequate for the proposed use(s)). Approval of a requested reduction in off-street parking shall be shown in a parking study provided the DPR committee by the applicant. 
Such waiver shall be reviewed by the zoning officer in conjunction with the other members of the DPR committee. Findings for granting a requested waiver or waivers shall be made in writing by the zoning officer with the concurrence of the DPR committee and positive findings shall be made in accordance with the following: 
1.  The modification(s) requested is reasonably necessary for the full enjoyment of the permitted use; 
2.  If the modification is granted, neighboring property will neither be substantially injured nor its appropriate use substantially impaired; 
3.  The modification(s) requested is in full harmony with the purposes and intent of the comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance; and 
4.  The modification does not require a variance of a flood plain requirement. 
(2)  A written statement of conditional approval, subject to such reasonable conditions, modifications and restrictions as the DPR committee may deem necessary so that the proposed activities meet each of the standards of development plan review and any other applicable requirements and standards of the city; 
(3)  A written statement of denial of the application. 
In the event of a denial of an application or an approval where conditions, modifications or restrictions are imposed, the DPR committee shall issue written findings of fact, and, where applicable, conclusions of law, explaining the reason why any standard or standards have not been met and setting forth the basis for either the denial of the application or the imposition of any condition, modification or restriction. 
(b)  Final site plan filing. Following approval by the DPR committee, and subject to the satisfaction of any conditions of approval, the applicant must submit to the DPR committee a reproducible mylar and three blueprint copies of a final site plan for endorsement by the committee. Digitized map data on computer storage mediums (if available) may be submitted in addition to the final site plan. Such final site plan shall be revised to show any minor changes approved by the building inspector or planning director. The planning department shall file a record of approval with the city clerk on behalf of the DPR committee. 
(c)  Revisions to plan. All construction, alteration or expansion shall be carried out only in conformity with any conditions, modifications and restrictions set by the DPR committee, and only in conformity with the application and site plan upon which the committee based its decision. Minor changes to the site plan must be approved by the building inspector in consultation with the planning director. Changes deemed to be significant or major by the building inspector or planning director shall be resubmitted to the DPR committee in the form of a new or revised site plan. Any work carried out in violation of this provision shall be ordered halted and fully removed. The building inspector shall enforce the fulfillment of any conditions or revisions which the DPR committee may impose. 
(d)  Time limit on approval. The approval of a site plan, or modification or amendment thereof, shall remain effective for a period of one year only from the date of such approval (either directly or by inaction) unless, prior to the expiration of such one-year period, the applicant makes substantial efforts to build in accordance with the approved development plan, or unless the DPR committee approves an extension the time for a period not to exceed one additional year. The initial period of one year shall not begin to run until the applicant has received all approvals from local, state, and federal agencies for the construction of the project envisioned by the approved site plan, provided the applicant demonstrates to the DPR committee that due diligence is being exercised in obtaining such approvals. The applicant shall provide letters of status to the DPR committee at intervals of no more than six months, commencing at the date of development plan approval. 
In the event of any appeal from development plan approval by the DPR committee, and final development plan approval shall be deemed effective and the applicable time limit on approval shall commence, only after all appellate rights are exhausted and a final determination is made to grant approval. 
(e)  Appeals. Appeals to the zoning board of review may be taken by a person aggrieved by any final action of the DPR committee pursuant to the provisions of this section. Such appeal shall be taken within 20 days of such final action by filing with the zoning board of review a written notice of appeal specifying the grounds for appeal and the specific finding or findings of the DPR committee in its final action which are challenged, if any. The lack of particularity of specific grounds for an appeal shall constitute cause for dismissal of any appeal. Only the grounds for appeal so specified will be reviewed by the zoning board of review on appeal. Such appeal shall be accompanied by copies of the original site plans submission and the written findings of the DPR committee with respect to the final action appealed from. Copies of the site plan and the findings of the DPR committee shall be made available by the planning department for review by any party. 
On such review, the zoning board of review shall not substitute its judgment for that of the DPR committee as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The zoning board of review may affirm the decision of the DPR committee or remand the case for further proceedings, or may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because of findings, interferences, conclusions or decisions which are: In violation of statutory or ordinance provisions; in excess of the authority granted to the DPR committee by ordinance; made upon unlawful procedure; affected by other error of law; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, and substantial evidence; or arbitrary, or capricious, or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. The zoning board of review decision on appeal shall be rendered within 45 days of the date of appeal. The decision by the zoning board of review on appeal shall be by a majority vote. 
Judicial review of any determination by the zoning board of review on such appeal may be sought by any person aggrieved by the zoning board of review's decision pursuant to G.L. 1956, § 45-24-1 et seq.

Sec. 19-459. - Supporting documentation. 
(a)  Impact assessment. An impact assessment shall be prepared in support of all applications for development plan review, except that the DPR committee, as part of a preapplication review, may decide that the project is not of a size or nature requiring an impact assessment or may scope an impact assessment focusing on one or more significant impacts. Such a decision regarding the scope of the impact assessment shall be rendered within one week of the preapplication conference. The DPR committee shall provide the applicant with written justification as to why each element of the impact assessment is being required. 
The impact assessment must be prepared by recognized professionals; the names, education, disciplines and experience of whom shall be included in the report. 
The assessment will include an evaluation of all influences, both positive and negative, which can be expected to affect the natural and manmade environment in the vicinity of the proposed project, or will demonstrate the lack of any such impact. Both direct and indirect impacts shall be evaluated. A traffic impact study, as described below, must be included as part of the impact assessment. Other impact which shall be considered as part of the impact assessment are environmental scenic, use-compatibility, noise and similar such items. 
Methods designed to mitigate, and where appropriate, monitor the impacts shall be proposed; the party responsible for implementing the mitigation and monitoring shall be identified. The DPR committee may require the applicant to pay the reasonable costs of such consultants as the DPR committee may deem reasonably necessary to assist it in the evaluation of the impact assessment. The consultant shall be selected only after consultation with the applicant, and only upon the joint review and approval of the experience and qualification of the consultant, and joint review and approval of the proposed scope of work and cost estimate. A written report of such consultant review shall be provided to the DPR committee and the applicant. 
To provide assurances that performance standards pursuant to article IV, division 14 of this chapter are not to be exceeded, the DPR committee may require, as a condition of the development plan approval, that independent environmental monitoring be conducted periodically; the DPR committee shall approve the monitoring firm and such monitoring will be supervised by the DPR committee and carried out at the expense of the applicant for development plan approval. The applicant, as part of its application, shall propose appropriate monitoring activities consistent with the foregoing. 
It is suggested that an outline of the impact assessment be submitted for review during the preapplication meeting. 
(b)  Traffic impact study. A traffic impact study analyzing both on-site and off-site conditions as they affect surrounding areas. The traffic impact study should include, but not be limited to: 
(1)  Analyses of the roadways which may be influenced by the project; including adjacent roads and major intersections. 
(2)  Safety (accident data, sight distance, roadway conditions, etc.) 
(3)  Capacity analysis utilizing Transportation Research Board Special Report 209 or other document as specified by the city traffic engineer. 
(4)  Existing volumes (traffic counting). 
(5)  Site-generated and future traffic. 
(6)  Planned transportation improvements, if any. 
(c)  Open space. The location and size of any common or public open space and the form of organization proposed to own and maintain any common or public open space. The proposed organization shall include provisions which recognize the right of the city to enforce the maintenance of common open space in reasonable order and condition and to assess the property owners for the cost of such maintenance in the event of the failure of the organization to maintain the common open space. Such assessment shall become a lien on the properties. 
A copy of any covenants, deed restrictions or exceptions that are intended to cover all or any part of the tract. 
(d)  All proposed easements. A survey by a licensed surveyor of the state shall accompany the site plan and shall show the boundaries of the parcel and the limits of all proposed streets, recreation areas, and other property to be dedicated to public use. Appropriate assurances shall be provided by the applicant to the DPR committee indicating that all private roads and other applicable facilities will be maintained, and other supplementary services will be provided by the applicant or successors and assigns. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-459)  
Sec. 19-460. - Special provisions for phased developments. 
(a)  In the case of plans which call for development over a period of years, a schedule shall be prepared showing the proposed time frames within each section of the development may be started. The proponents of a phased development shall include suitable provisions for assurance that each phase could be brought to completion in a manner which would not result in an adverse effect upon the city as a result of the termination at that point. 
(b)  All preliminary site plans and general site plans previously approved by the DPR committee shall be submitted each time a new part or section is submitted for approval. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-460)  
Sec. 19-461. - Interpretation, conflict, and severability. 
(a)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements. More stringent provisions may be required if it is demonstrated that different standards are necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare. 
(b)  Where the DPR committee recognizes the design standards of this article cannot be fully met, the DPR committee has the authority to approve site plans incorporating a balance of the design standards in a manner which maximizes the achievement of the stated objectives of this article. Compensating amenities and features exceeding standards and objectives must be identified within such a site plan. The DPR committee shall address these offsetting features in writing as part of its statement of final decision. 
(c)  Where the conditions imposed by any provisions of this article are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provisions of this article or of any other applicable law, ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
(d)  The provisions of this article are severable. If a section, sentence, clause, or phrase of this article is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this article. 
(Rev. Ords. 1987, § 19-461)  
Sec. 19-462. - Drive-through facilities. 
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the regulations and design standards in this division shall apply to all drive-through facilities as defined in section 19-1. Such uses may include drive-through facilities that are ancillary to a principal building where business is conducted indoors, or businesses that operate principally by means of drive-through facilities. For those developments also coming under article VIII, Development Plan Review, the site standards of sections 19-463—19-469, shall apply, but a separate review and application process will not be required. The development plan review committee shall incorporate its decision on the drive-through facility within its action on the DPR application.

(d)  Supporting documentation. 
(1)  An impact assessment shall be prepared in support of all applications, except that the commission, as part of a preapplication review, may decide that the project is not of a size or nature requiring an impact assessment or may scope an impact assessment focusing on one or more significant impacts. Where the project will involve obtaining a CRMC assent, the applicant will be encouraged to integrate documentation. Such a decision regarding the scope of the impact assessment shall be rendered within one week of the preapplication conference. The commission shall provide the applicant with written justification as to why each element of the impact assessment is being required and will coordinate with the CRMC to consolidate information requirements to the greatest practicable extent. 
The impact assessment must be prepared by recognized professionals; the names, education, disciplines and experience of whom shall be included in the report. 
The assessment will include an evaluation of all influences, both positive and negative, which can be expected to affect the natural and manmade environment in the vicinity of the proposed project, or will demonstrate the lack of any such impact. Both direct and indirect impacts shall be evaluated. A traffic impact study, as described below, must be included as part of the impact assessment. Other impacts which shall be considered as part of the impact assessment are environmental, waterfront protection and access, scenic, view corridor protection, use-compatibility, noise, air quality and similar such items. 
Methods designed to mitigate, and where appropriate, monitor the impacts shall be proposed; the party responsible for implementing the mitigation and monitoring shall be identified. The commission may require the applicant to pay the reasonable costs of such consultants as the commission may deem reasonably necessary to assist in the evaluation of the impact assessment. The consultant shall be selected only after consultation with the applicant, and only upon the joint review and approval of the experience and qualification of the consultant, and joint review and approval of the proposed scope of work and cost estimate. A written report of such consultant review shall be provided to the commission and the applicant. 
To provide assurances that performance standards are not to be exceeded, the commission may require, as a condition of the plan approval, that independent environmental monitoring be conducted periodically; the commission shall approve the monitoring firm and such monitoring will be supervised by the commission and carried out at the expense of the applicant. The applicant, as part of its application, shall propose appropriate monitoring activities consistent with the foregoing. 
It is suggested that an outline of the impact assessment be submitted for review during the preapplication meeting. 
(2)  A traffic impact study (TIS) analyzing both on-site and off-site conditions as they affect surrounding areas. The TIS shall be prepared by a firm that is licensed to do work as an engineer in the state. The purpose of a TIS is to review impacts of the proposed development on the local and state highways system. The evaluation should consider traffic capacity, signalization and safety issues. This report will be used to determine the needed improvements in the vicinity of the site access and provide data to the commission, the city and RIDOT on what off-site improvements need to be considered. 
The following are intended as guidelines for preparing a traffic impact report for developments within the waterfront development districts. 
A TIS may be required for any development that generates more than 50 peak hour trips. For any TIS prepared as a requirement of these guidelines, with a lower threshold, the report will conform to these guidelines. 
Once it is determined that an impact study is required, a scoping meeting may be held with the developer or his consultant and the appropriate representatives of the city and or commission. It will be the responsibility of the consultant to initiate this meeting, working through these development requirements. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss site specific information concerning the development. All interested parties should receive copies of the minutes from this meeting. 
The study area should generally be in accordance with generally accepted practices for traffic impact studies; however, in all cases the network should be analyzed to the nearest signalized public street intersection in all directions from each access point; generally not greater than one mile from the access point(s). 
An impact study report should include the following information: 
a.  Table of contents. 
b.  Introduction with and explanation of the project, purpose of the report, and an area map showing site location. 
c.  A description of existing conditions, including traffic counts and analysis, and sketches of existing roadway configurations. 
d.  Background conditions without site development, including annual growth in traffic to build year, if appropriate, Traffic generated by other approved developments, and a background analysis (with background traffic equal to existing traffic plus growth in existing traffic and that of other approved developments in the area), and background analysis with approved/funded highway projects. 
e.  Projected conditions, with development of the site, including: traffic generated by the proposed development (i.e. site generated traffic) at build out, and/or at any significant stage of development, total traffic analysis (where total traffic is equal to existing traffic plus background growth plus additional approved development in the area and proposed site generated traffic; and, an analysis of total traffic with improvements. 
f.  Conclusions/Recommendations that explain the results of analysis, and consultant/developer or RIDOT suggestions for reasonable improvements to mitigate the site traffic impacts (The level-of-service (LOS) standard that should be achieved at state intersections is "D.") 
g.  Appendix, including all work sheets, traffic counts and pertinent correspondence. 
The following is a more detailed explanation of the various aspects involved in preparing the report: 
a.  Existing traffic shall include traffic counts performed at each intersection to be analyzed, if current turning movement counts are not available. The most recent traffic volume counts, whether by RIDOT, consultant or the city, may be used for the study. Counts should, as a rule, not be more than one year old from when the report is prepared. Counts between one and three years old may be used if factored to the current year. Counts older than three years will not be accepted. 
Peak hour counts are acceptable at intersections, generally from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. and from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m. 
Counts are not to be taken on state or federal holidays. 
The presence of schools in the area must be considered when determining the date of counts. 
b.  Analysis of all intersections will be analyzed using the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) at the most up to date version at the time. 
c.  Trip generation and distribution should use local trip generation rates. If local rates are not available, the latest ITE trip generation rates should be used. In the event ITE does not address the development, or is of a limited sample size, studies of similar uses may be used. Documentation of these studies should be submitted for verification. There must be some discussion of the assumptions behind the distribution of generated trips (both for the site and other approved developments in the area). The methodology to be used should be discussed at the scoping meeting. 
d.  Growth in existing traffic. Growth in existing traffic is described as a factor representative of travel growth outside the study area. This factor should be applied to the existing through traffic, and appropriate turning movements, before approved development traffic is applied. The volume should be compounded to the reasonable build out years, typically 3—10 years, depending on the build out schedule. For developments with a build out of less than 3 years, growth in existing traffic need not be applied. If the city does not require growth in existing traffic, then this factor should not be applied. 
e.  Approved development traffic. Approved development traffic is described as traffic generated by all approved developments within the area at the time of the report preparation. These sites can be obtained from the city and should be documented in the TIS. 
f.  Background analysis. Background analysis includes existing traffic, plus growth in existing traffic, plus approved development. This analysis should take into consideration all transportation improvements expected to be in place within the study area. These improvements should include those which are already programmed or bonded by the state, the city or developer(s). These improvements should be documented in the TIS. 
g.  Projected conditions shall include traffic which will be generated by the development and total traffic calculated after the site traffic is projected. After total traffic is developed, an analysis of traffic operations, with projected future roadway improvements in place (i.e. improvements addressed in the background analysis), is to be performed. 
After the analysis of total traffic is completed, all intersections and/or links within the study area resulting in a level-of-service worse than "D" must be identified and improvement(s) recommended. 
h.  Conclusions/recommendations should identify any improvement suggested as being implemented by "others" and should indicate by whom. If the improvements are funded by a public agency (i.e. the RIDOT), then a copy of the page from the appropriate document should be included in the report. If funded by another developer, then documentation should likewise be included. 
There must be some discussion of the feasibility of constructing any recommended improvements. While detailed construction plans are not expected, some discussion of any obvious constraints is necessary. 
Consideration should be given to providing improvements at locations that experience a significant decrease in capacity due to the proposed development. A final analysis of the study area must be performed to include any recommended improvements. If a traffic signal is to be proposed, then a signal warrant analysis must be performed in accordance with RIDOT's warrant analysis procedures, and included in the report. After review of this analysis, RIDOT may require additional study, including exploring other alternatives to signalization, before reaching a final determination on the need for a signal. 
The report should include a discussion of the improvements that the developer will construct and/or fund as part of the, development proposal. 
(3)  The location and size of any common or public open space, including public access to and along the waterfront, and the form of organization proposed to own and maintain any common or public open space areas. The proposed organization shall include provisions which recognize the right of the commission or the city to enforce the maintenance of common open space in reasonable order and condition and to assess the property owners for the cost of such maintenance in the event of the failure of the organization to maintain the common open space. Such assessment shall become a lien on the properties. This will be carried out in conjunction with Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council policies and decisions on public access and rights-of-way to the shore. 
(4)  A copy of any covenants, deed restrictions or conditional provisions that are intended to cover all or any part of the tract. 
(5)  A survey prepared by a licensed professional land surveyor in accordance with the Procedural and Technical Standards for the Practice of Land Surveying in the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations shall accompany the site plan and shall show the boundaries of the parcel and the limits of all proposed streets, recreation areas, and other property to be dedicated to public use. Appropriate assurances shall be provided by the applicant to the commission indicating that all private roads and other applicable facilities will be maintained, and other supplementary services will be provided by the applicant or successors and assigns.

(Ch. 317, § I, 3-2-04; Ch. 737, § VI, 5-21-19)  
Sec. 19-479. - Deviations and conditional use provisions. 
(a)  Pursuant to and in accordance with G.L. 1956, § 45-24.4-13, the commission may entertain applications for, and in its discretion, grant or deny, deviations and conditional use provisions from these regulations. 
(b)  As provided herein, "deviations" shall mean permission to deviate from the area and performance standards of these regulations which regulate the manner in which a use permitted under the terms of these regulations may be implemented by the owner. 
(c)  As used herein, "conditional use provisions" shall mean a use permitted in these regulations pursuant to and in accordance with the conditions and/or circumstances established in these regulations. 
(d)  Deviations to the terms of these regulations may be granted by the commission when literal enforcement of the regulations relating to setbacks, building heights, parking requirements and other area and dimensional restrictions set forth in the performance standards as outlined in section (g) would preclude the full enjoyment of the owner of a permitted use and would amount to more than a mere inconvenience. 
(e)  Conditional use provisions may be granted by the commission in those cases where the use permitted specifies a conditional use. The conditions provided, and the use granted shall be limited to those which ensure the convenience and welfare of the public and do not substantially or permanently injure the value of neighboring property. The applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that neither the proposed use nor its location on the site would have a detrimental effect on the public health, safety, welfare or morals. 
(f)  In granting a deviation or conditional use provision, the commission may impose such special conditions as are deemed necessary to maintain harmony with other parcels or subdivisions thereof within the waterfront district and to promote the objectives and intent of these regulations and of the development plan. 
(g)  In reviewing any application for a deviation or conditional use provision on any site, the commission may consider, among other factors, the following: 
(1)  Protection of adjoining properties and other parcels in the waterfront district from any detrimental use on the site. 
(2)  Convenience and safety of vehicular and pedestrian movement within the site in relation to adjacent streets, properties, improvements and in conformance with the express design intent. 
(3)  Adequacy of the methods of disposal for sewage, refuse and other wastes, and methods of drainage of surface water. 
(4)  Provisions of off-street loading and unloading of vehicles incidental to the servicing of the buildings and related uses on the site.

(i)  Any deviation or conditional use provision granted by the commission shall expire within one year from the date of granting by the commission unless the applicant exercises the permission granted, or receives a building permit to do so, or seeks an extension from the commission, which extension may be granted for good cause shown. The applicant may petition the commission for up to six six-month extensions. No additional extensions will be permitted and the certificate will expire. However, at the expiration of all the extensions, the developer may chose to refile the existing, or a revised application. This refiled and/or revised application is subject to all the design review workshops, public hearing and notice requirements described herein. 
(Ch. 317, § I, 3-2-04)  
Sec. 19-480. - Uses permitted. 
(a)  The following table lists the sub-districts within the waterfront district, and the uses permitted within each sub-district. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure compatibility and efficient, economical use of land within the waterfront district. These regulations are also intended to encourage development projects and use of land which is functional, and to protect the city's residences, businesses, and infrastructure in a manner that is consistent with the comprehensive plan. 
This article is intended to enable the development of the waterfront district in keeping with the scale and character set forth in the East Providence Waterfront Special Development District Plan. It provides a framework to allow higher land use densities in a context that promotes mixing land uses and building types, provides larger common open space areas and contiguous public access to and along the waterfront, lowers street and utility costs because of reduced frontage, and promotes a concentration of uses within a pedestrian friendly environment. Waterfront development is guided by a development plan review process in which the East Providence Waterfront special development district commission has significant involvement in determining the scale of the development and the character of the uses. 
(1)  Permitted uses are any use allowed in the waterfront district by this article IX, subject to the provisions applicable to that sub-district contained within this article. 
(2)  Accessory uses are uses which are considered to be subordinate to, and serve the main building or principal use; contribute to the comfort, convenience or necessity of the occupants of the main building or principal use served; are subordinate in area, extent and purpose to the main building or principal use served; are located within or external to the main building or principal use, but on the same lot. 
(3)  Conditional uses are a discretionary entitlement which may be granted under the provisions of this article, and which, when granted, authorize a specific use to be made of a specific property, subject to compliance with all terms and conditions imposed on the entitlement by the East Providence Waterfront special development district commission. 
(b)  Any change in the principal use of a property, or within the buildings or structures located on a property, shall be required to be reviewed by the executive director for compliance with the district regulations set forth for the zoning of said property, prior to the occurrence of the proposed change in use. 
(c)  Unnamed uses, or uses not specifically defined in this article, are not allowed except as follows: 
(1)  Upon application therefore, the executive director may determine whether a proposed use which is not specifically named within any zone district created by this article, and is not an accessory use, is similar to and compatible with uses otherwise allowed within a specific zone district and may, upon making a determination of similar and compatible uses, allow the proposed use within that district. 
(2)  In making the determination of similarity and compatibility, the executive director shall consider, among other relevant matters, traffic generation, density of population, and hours of operation of the proposed use in comparison to specifically named uses within the district in question, and with named uses permitted in other zone districts. 
(d)  The waterfront district encourages mixed land uses which may include, but are not limited to, any combination of housing, offices, retail and service businesses, and public and civic uses. Land uses may be mixed by floor (vertically within a building) or horizontally on a parcel of land. Office and residential uses are encouraged above ground level retail spaces. The scale of mixed use may range from a single stand-alone retail use with residential uses on upper stories, to a major development that integrates housing, offices, shops, streets and public spaces. 
The intent of the waterfront district is to provide uses in conformance with the East Providence Waterfront Special Development District Plan. The plan identifies a range of general land uses within each of the waterfront sub-districts, as described in the following subsections: 
(1)  Kettle Point: Medium density residential, with ancillary commercial uses including restaurants, clubhouses, marinas and limited retail geared toward residents. 
(2)  Veterans Memorial Parkway: Medium density multi-family residential along the Veterans Memorial Parkway frontage, with commercial and retail uses at the lower levels of the site, and marina uses at the waterfront. 
(3)  Bold Point Harbor: A mixed-use high density area of commercial, office, retail and high density multi-family residential uses. Hospitality uses, including hotels and lodging, cafes, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues are also encouraged. Marinas, with limited support services, and water-transit related services are also permitted. Heavy commercial or industrial land uses are not permitted. 
(4)  Crook Point: Retail and hospitality uses are encouraged closer to the Washington Bridge, with commercial office, retail and high density residential uses transitioning north toward the Henderson Bridge. 
(5)  Dexter Road: Technology-oriented light manufacturing, including offices, research and development, commercial education institutions and supportive commercial retail uses. Heavy commercial, mini-storage or industrial land uses are not permitted. 
(6)  Phillipsdale: A mix of commercial office, retail, mixed-density residential (single-family, townhouses and multifamily condominiums), light manufacturing (in selected areas) and artisan live/work studio space. 
(7)  Pawtucket Avenue: Commercial office, light manufacturing and research and development, with medium density multifamily residential in selected areas.

(Ch. 317, § I, 3-2-04; Ch. 642, § XXI, 3-15-16; Ch. 737, § VIII, 5-21-19)  
Sec. 19-483. - Site development criteria. 
(a)  Applicants are encouraged to design developments to coincide with the goals and intent of the East Providence Waterfront special development district plan, including proposed building styles and materials, the relationships between any proposed buildings and the site, and the overall physical appearance of the waterfront district. 
The following site development criteria will be evaluated by the design review committee in its review of all development in the waterfront district. Applications for project review shall include a certification for the applicant's architect that the project complies with the intent of these regulations. If the project does not comply, a fully documented explanation of the requested. Deviations and/or conditional use provisions must be provided. 
(b)  Architectural standards. 
(1)  The architectural design of buildings, structures and site layout shall be visually compatible with a traditional New England waterfront sale and character, including building materials, massing, density, scale and roof lines. 
(2)  Where practical, buildings should be placed at the sidewalk or near to the front property line, with their primary entrances oriented to the street. Treatment of the sides and rear of all buildings shall be comparable in appearance and amenities of the treatment given to street frontages. Except for single-family development, buildings on waterfront sites will have their primary facades facing the river. Buildings will orient their required open space to the waterfront. However, care must also be taken to create a pleasing facade to the street-side frontage and entrance of such sites. 
(3)  Integration of all properties within the waterfront district is critical to promote vitality and sustain the mixed use character of the area. Interconnectivity is encouraged through the use of street design and pedestrian connections. Private roads are discouraged, unless they are designed to provide connections to service areas within the property. Campus like developments, such as suburban style office parks or "gated" residential communities, are highly discouraged. 
(4)  Building placement and design should work with varying site grades and topographical elements to incorporate covered/structured parking at lower levels of the building or below grade. Lower level covered parking should be accessed from the side or the rear of the lot, with efforts made to ensure that the primary facade of the building reflects the internal uses and include inviting entrances. 
(5)  Parking structures should be compatible with adjacent uses and architecture, including use of similar facade materials and design. Parking uses and the appearance of parking structures should not dominate the public streetscapes. The design of all above grade parking structures should include usable retail, commercial and/or residential uses as appropriate along first floor and street frontages. 
(6)  The height of buildings should be compatible with surrounding development and neighborhoods. Only low-scale buildings shall be located along the water's edge and adjacent to residential neighborhoods. Scenic view corridors of the water should be preserved. 
(7)  A diversity of roof heights, gable orientations and volumes in new buildings shall be provided. Buildings shall be designed with traditional roof forms that are compatible with the character of the surroundings, including but not limited to gambrel, gable and hipped roofs commonly found in New England cities and towns. 
(8)  Architectural elements such as dormers should be in proportion with the overall building and should also be in keeping with the context of surrounding buildings. Exaggerated or excessively large architectural elements should be avoided. Traditional and contemporary architectural detailing which creates variety, interest and texture on new buildings and additions is encouraged. 
(9)  Traditional building materials such as shingles, wood clapboards, brick and stone should be used for the exterior of new construction and additions. Additional materials, such as precast concrete, prefabricated panels or architectural metals, may be used if they are of a high quality finish and are in a design consistent with a traditional waterfront or New England town character. These materials shall be considered for all buildings or portions of buildings facing public or private streets. Buildings of entirely glass and/or mirrored exterior finishes shall not be permitted. 
(10)  Developers and designers are encouraged to incorporate sustainable design practices and environmentally friendly building materials. Efforts should be made to include elements into the site and building design process that conserve energy and minimize pollution from demolition/construction through building occupancy. Building design should incorporate elements that take full advantage of solar energy for lighting and warning; embrace techniques that optimize water conservation and protect water quality; and implement measures to improve air quality and ventilation. 
(11)  Building facades at lower levels should be a masonry-like material of a high quality and level of finish. Detail and ornamentation should enhance street level facades with entrance points denoted through front porches, columns, differential ceiling heights, lighting and variation of materials to accentuate lobby areas. 
(12)  Primary building entrances should be oriented to the public sidewalks along the primary street frontage. Development along new or existing public streets should provide open and inviting facades and should foster a walkable and enjoyable pedestrian environment. New development should avoid large expanses of blank walls and should provide frequent street level entries. At least 50 percent of the ground floor facade of non-residential buildings shall be constructed of transparent materials, or otherwise designed to allow pedestrians to view activities inside the building. For retail uses, buildings sited along primary streets should utilize traditional storefront design principles along the ground floor, and provide appealing displays and clear glazing to allow views into store windows and building interiors to enhance the pedestrian experience. 
(13)  In sub-districts designated for mixed-uses or commercial and office environments, the ground floor of buildings should primarily entail uses geared toward pedestrians, such as retail stores, cafes and restaurants, or civic and cultural uses such as a museum, galleries or community facilities. 
(14)  Upper levels of building facades should be clad in lighter color materials, with a presentation that responds to a waterfront character. For second floors and above, between 25 percent and 60 percent of the facade should be windows or transparent glazing. Emphasis should be given to using materials and ornamentation to provide a sense of depth and relief to enrich the wall surfaces, including materials that provide a sense of scale and texture, and that reinforce a vertical orientation. 
(15)  The construction of buildings which are designed according to themes or architectural styles associated with chain stores or restaurants shall be reviewed by the East Providence Waterfront special development district commission, and may be modified or prohibited if found to be inconsistent with the intent of this chapter. 
(16)  Residential buildings should be clustered or located in such a manner that provides a distinctive and traditional urban neighborhood character. Buildings shall be oriented to the street, with front yards and entryways that provide easy and inviting access to pedestrian connections. 
(17)  Large scale development shall take the form of village-like groupings of small scale buildings, rather than a large individual structures or box-like buildings set back on a large expanse of paved parking. New buildings shall not be large bulky horizontal masses, but shall be scaled down into groupings of smaller attached or detached structures with a vertical orientation. 
(18)  Infill development and/or redevelopment within existing built areas shall require a "build-to" line to re-establish continuity of the street wall. Likewise, small-scale development without a directly abutting neighbor should be guided by adjacent development patterns as a means to incrementally fill empty portions of the streetscape and achieve compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods. 
(19)  New public and civic structures should use the highest quality materials and design to assign a sense of permanence and importance to their role in the community. Design of the buildings should reflect an inviting appearance, and incorporate plazas or open space areas to encourage public gathering. Additionally, these structures should relate strongly to the streets and open spaces where they are located. 
(20)  Where feasible, emphasis shall be given to protect historic structures from demolition and carefully rehabilitate them in a way that is consistent with their original architectural intent. New additions to historically significant buildings should be designed for compatibility with the original structure in size, composition and material and should result in the minimum necessary loss of original architectural material. Consultation with the state historic preservation and heritage commission shall occur when historic properties are considered for rehabilitation or redevelopment. 
(21)  Service areas, mechanical equipment, dumpsters and loading areas shall be placed to the rear or side of buildings in visually unobtrusive locations and shall not impede on-site vehicular and pedestrian circulation. On waterfront locations the service and loading facilities shall not be located on the water side of the structure and shall be placed in a manner to minimize and screen such uses from public view. Service areas and loading areas shall be screened through landscaping or structural elements to prevent direct views from adjacent properties or from public or private streets used by the general public. Mechanical equipment and dumpsters should be screened through walled units or integrated into architectural features of the buildings. 
(22)  The East Providence Waterfront special development district commission shall require schematic architectural drawings of the exteriors of all proposed new buildings to be submitted as part of review process. The commission shall review these drawings for conformity with the design guidelines set forth herein. The commission may permit specific written or graphic architectural standards or codes for building appearance and design to be submitted by the applicant for review and approval. 
(c)  Open space and public areas. 
(1)  Site design and layout in the waterfront district should incorporate elements such as plazas and usable open spaces, especially adjacent to buildings next to the waterfront or in mixed-use and retail areas. To ensure that open space is well-used, the space should be visible, easily accessible and barrier free, with multiple points of entry from public areas (streets, sidewalks, and walkways or bike paths). Open spaces should be oriented to maximize exposure to the water and scenic views. East-west streets should be designed as boulevards with landscaped medians and wide corridor views towards the water. Community entries should be identified by maintaining them as large open spaces within the streetscape. 
(2)  Public greens and common areas should be provided within residential areas to provide useable open space and park like settings within a neighborhood context. 
(3)  Open space areas should be well buffered from moving vehicles so that users can enjoy and relax in the space. The space may be visible from streets or internal drives but should not be wholly exposed to them. "Outdoor rooms" that are partially enclosed with building walls, freestanding walls, landscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking buffers are encouraged. 
(4)  Public spaces should abut active uses to encourage pedestrian traffic between such uses. Public use of the waterfront, such as through passenger ferry, marinas, retail activities, cafes and restaurants, and recreational uses, should all provide context for open space. 
(5)  Plants used in landscaped areas should be native species and of the highest quality and of sufficient quantity and sale to make a visual impact. Plantings should be selected and located so that their functional and aesthetic qualities can be maximized. Public open space should provide shade areas wherever possible. 
(6)  Open space areas should provide adequate amenities for comfort and convenience, such as seating, lighting, directional signage, bicycle racks, drinking fountains, shelters, trash receptacles and public restrooms. 
(7)  Open spaces and plazas should be built with high quality, durable materials that reflect detailing consistent and compatible with the architectural character of nearby buildings and the waterfront location. Paving materials should be selected according to the intended use of the space. Designers are encouraged to utilize permeable paving materials wherever practicable to reduce stormwater runoff. 
(8)  Open spaces within private developments should contribute to public spaces with linkages that reinforce the pedestrian environment. Private developments should take the "indoors" outdoors by incorporating interior space (e.g. dining areas, merchandise displays) onto walkways and plazas connected to the public sidewalk system. Similarly, developments should bring the "outdoors" into the building by opening interior spaces through elements such as atriums connected to the public sidewalk system. 
(9)  Sites of historic interest or sites providing an opportunity and context for historical interpretation along the waterfront should be incorporated into open space areas and appropriately commemorated and marked with interpretative signage. The state historical preservation commission or other appropriate agency should assist in developing an appropriate context for commemoration initiatives. 
(10)  Development in the waterfront district should integrate artwork into public and private settings. Artwork may consist of freestanding pieces (e.g. sculptures or water fountains) or may be integrated with its surroundings (e.g. relief sculpture imbedded into the pavement or a wall, mosaics or murals, sound effects, decorative railings or lighting) to create a stronger sense of place. Artwork should be appropriate, and ideally, custom-made and should complement and reinforce the character of the site in terms of subject, scale, style, and materials. Art may be used to reveal historical facts about the site, or draw attention to a unique physical quality of the site. Public spaces should be designed to accommodate live performing arts and public gatherings. 
(11)  For higher density non-residential uses in the waterfront district that abut lower density residential properties, a minimum 100-foot open space setback is required. Landscaping in this open space setback shall include planting elements to ensure an effective visual and audio screen and buffer between residential and non-residential uses. 
(12)  Street-trees should be provided along all pedestrian corridors along with the planting of ground cover. The street tree canopy should appear tight, formal and planted in clusters at entry nodes and plazas. Ground cover planting materials should be natural and soft, and remain low, well below sight lines of pedestrians. Tree and shrub plantings shall be selected as suitable for their use in the interest of creating an aesthetically pleasing environment. 
(d)  Waterfront resources. 
(1)  Properties adjacent to the waterfront shall maintain an appropriate contiguous area, to the maximum extent possible, to include setbacks for public waterfront access and buffer zones for maintenance and preservation of natural areas. The buffer zone is to preserve the value and utility of the water's edge, including enhanced measures to protect and restore natural habitat areas and environmental resources. The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program should be referred to for its specific findings, policies, guidelines and regulations for projects within the coastal zone requiring an assent. Early consultation with CRMC program staff is strongly encouraged to identify coastal features and address setback, hazard mitigation, shoreline protection, storm water run-off and other requirements. Public access to and along the waterfront and recreational amenities shall be provided within the contiguous area, including connections and coordination with adjacent properties as part of an integrated public waterfront facility. 
(2)  Public access to and along the water's edge shall be provided in the most generous and integrated way that is compatible with the function of the land, water uses and activities. Interest in water for active and passive purposes is widespread and should be accommodated to the maximum extent feasible. Public access in the coastal zone, both vertical and perpendicular, must conform with state policies and regulations, including the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Program. 
(3)  Recreation and excursion access to and along the waterfront are desirable and should be fully integrated into the site design. Waterfront facilities should be oriented towards providing multi-modal transportation opportunities for boating, pedestrians, bicyclists, and public bus or ferry users, and accommodations made for such transportation needs. Comfort and convenience amenities such as like racks, benches, trash receptacles, shelters, ticket kiosks and restroom facilities should be provided. 
(4)  Design details for such features as lighting, paving, bollards, benches, or other amenities should be carefully selected to reflect the waterfront heritage of the area. Such features should be coordinated as much as possible between public and private improvements. For waterfront locations, the quality and durability of these amenities should be of the highest standards, and of timeless aesthetic character to withstand many years of use and exposure to weather. 
(5)  Only low-scale commercial or public buildings shall be located near the water's edge, except for in designated areas in the sub-districts as determined by the commission. Views to the water should be preserved from critical public vantage points. Massing and placement of buildings should be designed to minimize impacts on water views and retain value for upland development potential. 
(6)  Parking shall not be located directly on the water's edge. 
(e)  Parking and circulation standards. 
(1)  Structured parking within the waterfront development district is encouraged where feasible, either beneath or within commercial and higher density residential buildings, in order to maximize the use of valuable land for principal uses and to reduce the appearance of excessive amounts of surface parking within the district. 
(2)  Parking structures should be compatible with adjacent uses and architecture. Parking uses and the appearance of parking structures should not dominate public streetscapes. The design of all above-grade parking structures should include usable retail, commercial, and/or residential uses as appropriate to their location along first floor and street frontages. 
(3)  Surface parking lots shall be located to the side or rear of buildings or in the interior of a block, except for waterfront lots, in which case the parking shall not be located on the water-side of such buildings. Parking lots and driveways should not dominate the frontage of streets, interrupt pedestrian routes, or negatively impact the environment or surrounding developments. Parking lots should be sufficiently screened with natural landscape, decorative fencing or walls to minimize visual impacts. 
(4)  Surface parking areas should be designed to include internal landscaped islands and exterior landscaped buffer areas to soften the visual impacts of automobiles and asphalt. Shade tree location should buffer pedestrian circulation routes and should respect view corridors to the water. All parking lots should be planted with sufficient trees so that at full growth a significant majority of the surface area of the lot is shaded. At a minimum, developments should comply with the development plan review provisions of chapter 19, zoning, article VIII, section 19-454. 
(5)  On-site pedestrian circulation networks should be designed to provide safe access through the site, especially between buildings and parking areas. Paving and ground surface treatments should reinforce and define pedestrian circulation direction and patterns. Materials may be simple, but should have a level of patterning and detail through change in materials, color or scoring patterns. 
(6)  Stormwater management facilities shall be provided in conjunction with parking areas for flood control purposes and to treat stormwater to effectuate pollutant removal in accordance with city and state standards and regulations. Permeable paving materials, vegetated buffers and infiltration systems should be used wherever possible and practical to reduce the volume and improve the quality of stormwater. 
(7)  Pedestrian lighting should be incorporated into the design of parking areas and along pedestrian walkways. Additional lighting should be used to reinforce architectural edges as well as highlight special site elements. Nighttime illumination should provide for safety and security of residents and visitors. Lighting for parking and vehicle queuing areas should provide adequate illumination for vehicle and pedestrian safety and security while shielding surrounding areas from excessive light trespass and glare. 
(8)  Parking areas shall include provisions for the "parking" of bicycles in locations that are safely segregated from automobile traffic and parking. 
(9)  Shared access driveways and parking areas should be encouraged where ever possible for mixed use developments and/or adjacent uses which have different hours, days and/or seasons of peak parking demand. 
(10)  Design of internal parking and roadways should be looped rather than dead ended to allow for efficient circulation and movement through the waterfront district and shared parking areas. 
(11)  Design of parking lots should include measures to reduce the number of curb-cuts along roadways. Properties should be limited to one curb-cut per parking area, or at least be located a minimum of 100 feet from curb-cuts either on site or on adjacent properties. Where feasible, access and parking lot entryways to abutting properties across roadways should be aligned to create direct intersections, providing efficiency and safety for vehicles entering and exiting the sites. 
(12)  Roadways and internal vehicle circulation corridors should be designed to accommodate the type and volume of vehicles that are expected to enter during the peak design period, with minimal impacts to levels of service on- and off-site. 
(13)  Parking and garages for all residential uses shall be prohibited in front yard setback areas. Garages facing a front yard property line shall not be located closer to the front lot line than the foremost facade of the principle building facing the front property line. 
(14)  On-street parking may be permitted by the East Providence Waterfront special development district commission, and may be added to the number of off-street spaces for the purpose of calculating minimum parking requirements. 
(f)  Streetscape standards. 
(1)  New streets, as well as existing streets that are rehabilitated or reconstructed, should be designed to accommodate expected vehicles and pedestrians safely while encouraging appropriate speeds. 
(2)  Street placement and design should provide for views to and from the water. Streets that connect to the waterfront shall be designed and developed to pedestrian-scale with a high-level of amenities. Distinctive architectural and landscape features should be encouraged at intersections to enliven the space, including permanent installations of landscaped gateways, public art and/or flag displays in key locations. Where possible, gateway access to the waterfront, and east-west oriented streets, shall be wide boulevard-type roadways with divided travel lanes and landscaped medians. Additionally, for certain streets, unique destination and gateway treatments should be implemented. Community name and directional signs should be placed at gateways and should be compatible with the architectural themes and character of the neighborhood. 
(3)  Sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of all roadways, with curbing, grassed landscape strips between the sidewalk and the curb, street trees and other plantings to soften roadway edges. Sidewalks should be wide enough to accommodate pedestrians comfortably and safely. Textured paving within the street should be utilized to distinguish crosswalks. The pedestrian environment should be further enhanced through the use of fixed street furniture, compatible and consistent lighting, trash receptacles, and shade trees. 
(g)  Street and site furnishings. 
(1)  Consistency in the form and quality of street and site furniture is essential to the ambiance of the public areas. A standard design shall be used in public areas throughout the waterfront district, with recommended types and styles provided by the design review committee. Variations and additions should be considered for unique situations along waterfront areas. It is also essential that a program of regular care and maintenance be provided. 
(2)  Furnishings within individual development sites shall be chosen to complement the specific architectural and site design. Inclusion of furnishings to enrich the setting and provide amenities is strongly encouraged. 
(3)  Furnishings such as flagpoles, kiosks and public art should be considered and selected in part based on their compatibility with other furnishings and the building architecture. In general, furnishings should be understated and should not detract from the overall character of the site either through their appearance, siting or proliferation. The materials used for receptacles, seating and light poles should be consistent within the development site. 
(4)  The provision of benches is encouraged within development sites. In addition to free standing benches, options for integral seating such as broad steps and cheek walls should be considered in the design of open spaces and building entries. Benches shall be located based on a practical consideration of where people would like to sit and the demand for seating in a particular area. Areas closely associated with employees going outdoors for lunch or break time and areas where drop-off and pick-ups, such as building entries, should be considered for locating seating. 
(5)  Seating along sidewalks or trails shall be placed on a hard surface and immediately adjacent to the walkway to allow for free circulation on the sidewalk or trail. Along the walkway, the layout should have a perceivable order, such as placing benches or other furnishings along the same side or in a consistent manner. Clustering or paring benches is recommended as a means of offering seating for groups and creating a rhythm of furnishings. 
(6)  Benches shall be placed on a hard surface and surface mounted. 
(7)  Trash receptacles shall be of the designated design and will be used along the public sidewalks and trail system. Site developers will be responsible for providing receptacles in public areas. Trash and ash receptacles within the building zone should be chosen to complement the architectural and site design of a particular development. 
The receptacles should be durable and in keeping with the other materials selected for the site including lighting and benches. Plastic, aggregate surfaced concrete and fiberglass receptacles are not permitted. Removable trash liners are recommended for easy disposal. If refuse is to be sorted for recycling, receptacles with three-holed recycling tops are recommended. The divided recycling top allows the number of receptacles to be kept to a minimum. 
Trash receptacles shall be sited along heavily trafficked walks, in close proximity to building entries, and in areas where people gather for eating or break time. Ash receptacles shall be placed to minimize cigarette litter, for example, near building entries and designated smoking areas. Receptacles shall be conveniently located for use, but shall not impede circulation or interrupt the view of the building entry. Receptacles shall be surface-mounted to maintain their designated locations. 
(8)  Daily newspapers and printed materials, such as free real estate and employment guides, shall be incorporated into a unified newspaper kiosk placed in or adjacent to the right-of-way provided by the city and/or private developers in convenient locations. Separate boxes for all these various printed materials, typically found chained to utility poles and traffic signs shall be prohibited. 
(9)  Inclusion and placement of mailboxes, overnight delivery and newspaper boxes shall be considered as part of the overall site design. For all commercial and office buildings, these amenities shall be incorporated within the building, and shall not exist outside of the building in any location other than one specifically designated for such service areas. For other building types, such as hotel and retail uses, the boxes shall be located for the convenience of the building users and mail delivery systems used within the development. Boxes shall be accessible to pedestrians and relatively convenient to vehicles associated with their use. Their placement must not impede circulation or interrupt the view toward the building entry. In all cases boxes shall be grouped together in an area that is visible but unobtrusive. All boxes must be located on a hard surface and be surface mounted. 
(10)  Lighting standards. 
a.  The character and brightness of exterior lighting on different development sites shall remain relatively constant. This consistency is important in establishing the overall visual quality of the night time environment of the waterfront district and providing a sense of security. Lighting shall illuminate driveways, sidewalks and bikepaths, define outdoor spaces at night, and provide orientation to building entries. 
b.  Lighting shall be organized in simple patterns which are sympathetic to the spatial form of the site design. The pattern of light fixtures and poles shall reinforce the pattern of drives, walks and open space. Lighting of open spaces shall be along the perimeter to emphasize the form of the space. 
c.  In general, roadways and site drives shall be lit from both sides. Exceptions to this standard may include instances where the drive forms one edge of a large contiguous space, for example, where an entry drive may encircle an entry court landscape. When placed on both sides, lights shall be located opposite one another rather than in an alternating or staggered pattern. Driveway and walkway lighting shall be placed parallel to the pavement edge with a recommended uniform setback of two to six feet. Lighting shall be located in rhythm with related tree plantings. 
d.  The use of a consistent light source, a family of fixtures and poles, and a hierarchy of lighting levels shall unify development parcels and connect the various waterfront sub-districts with each other. A designated family of fixtures shall be used along public roadways, site driveways, public sidewalks and bikeways, and parking lots in order to reinforce a unified image. 
e.  Within parking lots a pole height of 25 feet is required. The pole height has been established to balance a desire to maintain a mounting height compatible with the scale of adjacent buildings and trees and to minimize the number of poles. Exceptions to this requirement may be considered on an individual basis. 
f.  Poles should be located behind raised curbs either within a raised median or along curbed sidewalks. Poles within paved areas (not behind a raised curb) are strongly discouraged. 
g.  All fixtures shall employ shielding and glare control devices to make the night time environment more pedestrian friendly, and to direct light downward rather than upward. Lights intended to provide a lantern effect, such as might be used to define the edge of an entry drive, shall utilize a shielding device that allows the fixture to be lit while continuing to minimize light loss to the sky. 
h.  Driver and pedestrian orientation shall be provided through a hierarchy of lighting effects that correspond to different zones and uses within development sites. Height of poles shall be scaled according to function, for example, poles along driveways shall be 20—25 feet, and in pedestrian areas lighting shall be 10—15 feet. Driveway and pedestrian lights may be used along circulation drives and sidewalks within parking lots to clarify movement and provide a hierarchy of lighting associated with use. 
i.  The housing for uplighting and architectural lighting placed in the landscape shall not be conspicuously visible. Flush ground mounted fixtures are recommended, where practical. In situations where this is not practical, lighting sources and mounting fixtures shall be located to minimize visibility by day and by night. 
j.  An increased sense of security shall be provided by using light to define the edges of the space, such as the outer edge of open spaces, parking lots and driveway corridors. Brighter lights shall be provided at the destination edge, such as the building entry. The lowest levels of light should appear within the parking lot and not at its edges. 
k.  Intersections, decision points, crossings, steps, arrival points, etc. should be articulated in a manner that signals their presence, shape and nature. The illumination pattern should provide visual clues as to what conditions may lie ahead. 
l.  The relationship between plant material and lighting shall be considered when determining the spacing, height and distribution pattern of lighting. Lighting design shall avoid foliage shadows and provide good uniformity and vertical surface illumination. 
(h)  Landscaping. 
(1)  Landscaping shall be used as a unifying design element and a cost-effective long-term aesthetic and environmental enhancement for public and private spaces. Primary landscape treatment shall consist of three tiers, ground cover, shrubs, and trees, and shall be combined with appropriate walks and street surfaces to provide an attractive development pattern. Landscaping can be in the form of planting beds, raised planters, berms, containers or window boxes. Landscape materials selected should be appropriate to the local growing conditions. 
(2)  Streets and parking lots shall be planted with deciduous trees that will over time bring the canopy together, provide shade and visual relief from automobile clutter. Guard plane plantings should be selected for hardiness, maintenance requirements, and water consumption. 
(3)  Loading and receiving areas, and trash storage areas shall be screened from the public view by landscaping treatment and by appropriate screening. Plantings and walls may be used to screen outdoor areas from wind and unsightly views. 
(4)  Specimen trees shall be used as accents and focal points in locations such as community and neighborhood entries. Colorful flowering shrubs, groundcovers and annual flower plantings should also be used to accent entries. 
(5)  Planting of ground surface materials should remain low, well below sight lines of pedestrians. The tree canopy should appear tight, formal and planted in clusters at entry nodes and plazas. Natural soft planting should be used in public areas adjacent to the waterfront. 
(6)  Plant materials along the river should be native species or improved horticultural varieties of the same. 
(7)  All plantings should be irrigated using latent drip technologies to maximize efficiency and preservation of resources. A strong landscape maintenance program by a licensed professional shall be required of any development program. 
(i)  Signage standards. 
(1)  Signage and graphics within the waterfront district shall introduce visitors and motorists to the area, direct them, and provide a means for orientation and wayfinding. Use of high quality graphics is essential to the overall visual experience. Informational and directional signs should serve as gateway elements and complement the landscape and architectural style of the overall development. Signs should be simple in form and color, and be clearly legible. 
(2)  Mixed-use buildings shall provide locations on the commercial areas of the building facade that are specifically designed to accommodate changeable tenant signage including wall signs, projecting signs and window signs. Structure, materials, detailing and power sources shall be designed with consideration of signage installation requirements and shall be readily adaptable and reparable as tenant sign needs change. 
(3)  Sign locations shall be oriented to the public right-of-way and shall avoid facing residential uses wherever possible. 
(4)  Direct exposure of light sources and internally illuminated signage shall be avoided in residential areas. Indirect and external light sources shall be the preferred option where lighting is required. Orientation of any illuminated sign or light source shall be directed to avoid visibility, spill light or glare into residential uses. 
(5)  Small scale signs projecting from the building face, perpendicular to the right-of-way, shall be considered appropriate in pedestrian oriented contexts. Tenant identification signs may also be incorporated into canopies above primary building entrances or storefronts. 
(6)  Signs should be traditional in design and easy to read, with proportion and balance in mind. Signs with dark background and light letters provide better visibility. Letterform, logos and artwork should look comfortable within the sign perimeter. Long, narrow and odd shaped signs should be avoided, as they tend to distract the balance ratio. 
(7)  Signs should creatively use two and three dimensional form, profile and iconographic representation: lighting, typography, color and materials in expressing the character of the use, the identity of the development, the character of the neighborhood, and the architecture of the building are encouraged. 
(8)  Signage shall be limited to one business identification per frontage and shall include only tenant identification text and logos. Product advertisement on signage or in display windows is prohibited. 
(9)  Pole signs and monuments are not permitted in the waterfront district. Signage for multiple uses in a single building or complex should be incorporated into decorative wall signs mounted onto the building or incorporated into decorative screening elements or walls to screen parking areas. 
(10)  Signs should fit within the architectural features of the facade and complement the buildings architecture. Signs should not overlap and conceal architectural elements. 
(11)  Support structures, hangers and brackets should be proportional to the sign face and remain dark in color as not to compete with the sign itself. 
(12)  Temporary signs are permitted for a period not to exceed 12 months. Up to one temporary sign may be permitted off-premises with the written approval of the property owner. Temporary signs may not be placed within a public right-of-way. Signage shall meet the standards of section 19-483(i)(1)—(11). Banners or flags may be permitted for up to two months and must be replaced or removed when tattered, faded, or torn. All temporary signage or banners shall be removed at the end of the permitted period at the owner's expense. Application and fee for a temporary sign permit shall be made to the East Providence waterfront special development district commission. 
(j)  Fencing. 
(1)  In instances where security and safety relating to certain land uses and activities require fencing, such fencing should be no higher or more extensive than needed to provide general safety or security needs and it shall be constructed of ornamental materials or some other appropriate material. 
(2)  For properties along the waterfront, fencing shall not be used to deter public access to and along the waterfront or to inhibit migration of wildlife between natural areas. 
(k)  Utilities. 
(1)  On-site utilities shall be located underground unless otherwise recommended by the utility company. At a minimum, the utilities feeding the site shall be placed underground in the access right-of-way. The East Providence Waterfront special development district commission may waive, upon good cause shown at the public hearing, a portion of or this entire requirement. 
(2)  Service areas and mechanical equipment should be screened through walled units or integrated into architectural features of the buildings. 
(Ch. 317, § I, 3-2-04; Ch. 737, § IX, 5-21-19)  
Sec. 19-484. - Nonconformances. 
Within the waterfront districts established herein, or by amendments which may later be adopted, there may exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this article was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this article or future amendments. It is the intent of this article to permit these non-conformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Nonconforming uses are declared by this article to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, reconstructed, or used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(1)  All work performed on a nonconforming structure shall be pursuant to a building permit, meet all the requirements of this article and all city codes, and conform to any other health or safety regulations of laws imposed by local, county, state, regional or federal agencies in effect at the time of the work and shall not expand any nonconformity. 
(2)  Ordinary maintenance and minor repair of nonconforming structures is permitted if the aggregate cost of the work done in any period of 12 consecutive months does not exceed 25 percent of the replacement value of the structure, as determined by the building inspector and if the size of the structure or the number of building units in not increased. 
(3)  A damaged nonconforming structure, restoration of which will cost 50 percent or less of its full replacement cost immediately prior to such damage, as determined by the building inspector, may be restored to its previous nonconforming state but must otherwise comply with all provisions of this article. A damaged nonconforming structure, restoration of which costs more than 50 percent of its full replacement cost, shall not be restored. 
(4)  Repairs and alterations may be made to nonconforming residential structures, including multi-family structures, without replacement cost limitations, if located in a district permitting residential dwellings and if the requirements of subsection (1) above are met, including the limitation therein that the repairs and alterations shall not expand the nonconformity. New construction on property with a nonconforming residential structure shall comply with the current applicable standards of this article. 
(5)  Repairs, interior modifications, and alterations to nonconforming nonresidential structures may be made only if none of the structural alterations prolong the life of the supporting members of the structure, including without limitation bearing walls, columns, beams or girders. Structural elements may be modified or repaired only if the building inspector determines that such modification or repair is immediately necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of occupants of the nonconforming structures or adjacent property, and the cost of all repairs or alterations does not exceed 50 percent of the replacement cost of the nonconforming structure immediately before such repairs or alterations, as determined by the building inspector. New construction on property with a nonconforming nonresidential structure shall comply with the current applicable standards of this article. No expansion, intensification, or modification of a nonconforming nonresidential structure shall be permitted without the permission of the executive director and/or commission, as appropriate. Modifications may be made to a nonconforming nonresidential use for the addition of new employees, provided that alterations are limited to the interior of the structure and are in compliance with subsection 19-477, and that sufficient parking can be provided on the site and in compliance with the parking and circulation standards contained herein. Such modifications shall be reviewed by the executive director through a preapplication consultation prior to issuance of any permits, and may be subject to review by the commission in accordance with section 19-477. 
(6)  If the use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued, the structure shall lose its nonconforming structure status, and shall be removed or altered to conform to the provisions of this article. Such removal or alteration to conform to the provisions of this article shall occur within 12 months of the date that loss of nonconforming structure status is determined or within such other date that the commission decides pursuant to public hearing outlined in section 19-477. Failure to remove or alter the structure beyond that period without written approval of the executive director on behalf of the commission due to unusual circumstances constitutes a violation of this article and a public nuisance. A use of a nonconforming structure shall be considered abandoned or discontinued whenever any of the following apply: 
a.  The use of a nonconforming structure is discontinued for a period of six or more calendar months. 
b.  The actual removal of characteristic furnishings, equipment, structures, machinery, or other components of the use occurs during the 12 month period. 
c.  No business receipts or records are available for the 12 month period. 
d.  Utility bills indicate that no use has occurred during the 12-month period. 
(7)  The change of ownership, tenancy, or management of a nonconforming use shall not affect its nonconforming status, but only if the use, extent, and intensity of use does not change. 
(8)  A nonconforming residential use in a nonconforming residential structure may continue to be used as a residence until such time as the building is amortized, condemned, removed, converted to a conforming use, or destroyed such that restoration would cost more than 50 percent of its full replacement value before it was damaged. 
(9)  If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of six or more calendar months, the use shall lose its nonconforming status, and all rights to reestablish or continue the nonconforming use shall terminate regardless of any reservation of an intent not to abandon or of an intent to resume active operations. Abandonment or discontinuance of use shall be deemed to have occurred whenever any of the following apply: 
a.  The nonconforming use is discontinued to a period of six or more consecutive calendar months. 
b.  A nonconforming use is replaced by a conforming use. 
c.  The actual removal of characteristic furnishings, equipment, structures, machinery, or other components of the use occurs during the six-month period. 
d.  No business receipts or records are available for the six-month period. 
e.  Utility bills indicate that no use has occurred during the six-month period. 
(10)  Replacement of a nonconforming use with another nonconforming use is prohibited. 
(11)  Expansion or intensification of a nonconforming use is prohibited without the permission of the executive director and/or the commission, as appropriate. Modifications may be made to a nonconforming nonresidential use for the addition of new employees, provided that alterations are limited to the interior of the structure and are in compliance with subsection 19-477, and that sufficient parking can be provided on the site and in compliance with the parking and circulation standards contained herein. Such modifications shall be reviewed by the executive director through a preapplication consultation prior to issuance of any permits, and may be subject to review by the commission in accordance with section 19-477. 
(12)  When any nonconforming structure or use is no longer permitted pursuant to the provisions of this article (loss of nonconforming status, or at the end of an amortization period (as outlined below) determined by the commission), no building permit or certificate of occupancy shall thereafter be issued for further continuance, alteration or expansion of the use or structure. Any building permit or certificate of occupancy issued in error shall not be construed as allowing the continuation of the structure or use. 
(13)  The commission may adopt amortization schedules for nonconforming structures, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use within the waterfront district, pursuant to the procedures outlined for public hearings as provided in section 19-477. At the public hearing, the commission shall hear a report by the executive director on the issue and shall determine if the use or structure should be amortized and over what period. The nonconforming structure or use shall be discontinued within the amortization period determined by the commission. In determining a reasonable amortization period for a nonconforming use or structure, the commission shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The amount of original investment in or original cost of the structure or use. 
b.  The present actual or depreciated value of the structure or use. 
c.  The remaining time period, if any, to amortize the costs of the structure or facilities associated with the use under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
d.  The salvage value of the structure or facilities associated with the use. 
e.  The remaining useful life of the structure or facilities associated with the use. 
f.  The remaining term of any lease for the property on which the structure or use is located. 
g.  The harm to the public that will result if the structure or use remains beyond the time period recommended by the executive director for amortizing the structure or use. 
The executive director shall provide estimates of all costs and valuations required by this section. The owner or operator of a nonconforming structure or use shall have the burden of proving that the amortization period recommended by the executive director is unreasonable. 
(Ch. 317, § I, 3-2-04)  
Sec. 19-485. - Affordable/inclusionary housing. 
Developers of new market rate single- and/or multi-family housing developments within the waterfront district are required to provide affordable housing units for low- and moderate-income households in order to ensure safe, decent and affordable housing to families, elderly and people with special needs. 
(1)  The provisions of this article shall apply to all new residential development or property conversions resulting in five or more parcels or new dwelling units intended and designed for permanent occupancy which receives subdivision, conditional use or design review committee approval after the effective date of this article. 
(2)  In projects of five or more dwelling units, a ten percent minimum inclusionary requirement shall apply for low- to moderate-income households. If, in the applications of the requirements of this article, a decimal fraction unit requirement is obtained, an in-lieu fee shall be provided equal to the applicable decimal fraction cost of a full housing unit. 
(3)  The applicant may request that the commission allow the applicant to make a payment of an in-lieu fee for constructing affordable housing units with submission of the complete application for project approval. The commission shall not consider any subsequent application for in-lieu funding. The commission shall consider the following issues, among others, in making this determination: the reasons the applicant desires to pay the in-lieu fee; the types of housing proposed for the development; the difference in price between the affordable units and the market priced units; and the public benefit that would be obtained by not building the units on-site. The applicant shall pay for the number of affordable dwelling units, or partial units that subsection (2) above would otherwise require, according to the following fee schedule. 
(4)  The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations regarding calculation of the housing in-lieu fee in accordance with G.L. § 45-24-46.1, said fee to be commensurate with the value that would have been provided through the actual construction of the affordable units. The housing in-lieu fee shall be reviewed by the commission every three years. The commission shall use money received under this subsection only for the construction and promotion of affordable housing. 
a.  Fifty percent of any fee required pursuant to this section shall be paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the project. The remaining 50 percent shall be paid in full before a certificate of occupancy is issued for any unit in the housing project. 
b.  Any fee required by this section shall be paid to the East Providence Waterfront Commission Affordable Housing Fund. 
(5)  Construction of inclusionary units shall be provided at the same time as other units within the development, with ten percent of the units in each phase of the residential development dedicated at the time building permits are issued, and identified as such on the site plan or development plan and final subdivision plat, as applicable. The completion of inclusionary units in a project shall be comparative to the completion of the market-rate units. 
(6)  Inclusionary units must be distributed throughout the development. 
(7)  The inclusionary units shall be substantially the same as the market rate units or buildings in exterior materials and finish. The developer may reduce either the size or provide less expensive interior amenities for the inclusionary units as long as there are not significant differences visible from the exterior of the units and the size, fixtures and design of the units are reasonably consistent with the market rate units in the project, provided all units conform to the requirements of local building codes in effect at the time. 
(8)  Only qualified households shall be eligible to occupy or own and occupy the inclusionary units. Developers may utilize an entity such as a non-profit housing corporation or a public housing authority to obtain qualified applicants. Developers shall select only qualified households to occupy or own and occupy inclusionary units. Immediate relatives of developers, by virtue of their position or relationship, are ineligible to occupy inclusionary units. 
(9)  The executive director shall promulgate rules and regulations governing the affordable housing programs, including the eligibility for purchasers and renters of affordable housing units. Those rules and regulations shall govern household size, household makeup, and household income, and shall be consistent with The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Program Income Eligibility Determination Guidelines. Sales prices for affordable units shall be determined based on these same references. The income limits, sales prices, and rental rates shall be determined based on these same references. The income limits, sales prices, and rental rates shall be updated annually as soon as HUD releases the median income updates and shall be made available to the public immediately thereafter by inclusion in the city's affordable housing program guidelines and information and through the city's CDBG office, planning and building inspection departments. 
(10)  When inclusionary units are required, a deed restriction shall be recorded setting forth the applicable restrictions in this chapter. The minimum period of affordability for inclusionary units are as follows: 
a.  Projects receiving public subsidies shall maintain affordability for a period of not less than 30 years or a different period when required by city or state law. A program to assure continued affordability for these units shall be administered by the commission or by a non-profit housing agency approved by the commission. 
b.  Inclusionary units which are built without public subsidies shall be required to maintain affordability for a period of 30 years or for a different period when required by city or state law. A program to assure continued affordability for these units shall be administered by the commission or by a non-profit housing agency approved by the commission. The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the commission or its designee to provide monitoring and to assure the affordability of the inclusionary units for a period of not less than 30 years from the effective date of occupancy. The executive director shall be authorized to enter into such an agreement on behalf of the city. The approved agreement shall be recorded with the city clerk prior to the issuance of a building permit for the project. 
1.  All buyers of "for sale" inclusionary units shall enter into a resale agreement with the commission or its designee prior to the close of escrow for such inclusionary unit (a standard form option agreement instrument shall be reviewed and approved by the commission). The resale agreement shall specify the required affordability term, shall provide for an option for the commission or its designee to designate an eligible purchaser and shall provide the commission or its designee with first right of refusal to purchase the units, and shall provide for a calculation of future equity assignment upon sale of the unit. Such agreement shall be recorded against each lot or unit. 
2.  Conversion of an inclusionary rental unit to a "for sale" unit, if otherwise permitted, shall not void any provisions of applicable inclusionary housing agreements or requirements. 
(11)  Each owner of any rental inclusionary units shall submit an annual report to the commission by January 31 for the previous calendar year, identifying monthly rental rates, vacancy status of each inclusionary unit, income status for residents and any other related data deemed necessary by the commission while ensuring privacy for all residents. The deed restriction for ownership units shall require conformance reporting upon sale of ownership of inclusionary units.

(2)  The commission shall approve an application for demolition when in the opinion of the fire chief or building inspector that the building constitutes a hazard to public safety; 
(3)  Unless the commission votes to issue a certificate of appropriateness for such construction, alteration, repair, removal, and demolition, the commission shall file with the building inspector and director of planning its rejection of such application; 
(4)  In the absence of change in such structure arising from casualty, no new application for the same or similar work shall be filed within one year after such rejection;

a.  Preservation of the structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community; 
b.  Preservation of the structure would cause undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into account the financial resources available to the owner, including the sale of the structure to any purchaser willing to preserve the structure; 
c.  The preservation of the structure would not be in the interest of the majority of the community. 
(6)  When considering an application for demolition or removal of a historic structure, the commission shall assist the owner in identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition, including sale of the structure on its present site;

developments and subdivisions;
(c) Promote high quality and appropriate design and construction of subdivisions and
land development projects;
(d) Protect existing natural and built environments and mitigate all significant
negative impacts of any proposed development on the existing environment;
(e) Promote design of land developments and subdivisions which are well-integrated
with the surrounding neighborhoods with regard to natural and built features, and
which concentrate development in areas which can best support intensive use by
reason of natural characteristics and existing infrastructure;
(f) Encourage design and improvement standards to reflect the intent of the East
Providence Comprehensive Plan with regard to the physical character of the various
neighborhoods, districts, and special and critical areas of the City;
(g) Promote thorough technical review of all proposed land developments and
subdivisions by appropriate officials;
(h) Encourage dedications of public land and impact mitigation to be based on clear

(i) Provide for the establishment and consistent application of procedures for local
record keeping on all matters of land development and subdivision review, approval
and construction.
2
Sec. 1 - 3. Title. The full title of these Regulations shall be “The East Providence Land
Development and Subdivision Review Regulations”. As a short title these Regulations shall be
known, and may be cited as, the “Development Review Regulations”.
Sec. 1 - 4. Construction and Intent.
(a) These Regulations are not intended to supersede, abrogate, or interfere with any provision of

provisions of these Regulations are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable
conditions imposed by any other provision of these Regulations or of any other applicable law,
ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation of any kind, the regulations which are more restrictive
and impose higher standards or requirements shall govern.
(b) Private deed restrictions or private covenants for a subdivision, which have not been
included as a part of the approved subdivision plan, do not fall within the jurisdiction of
enforcement by any local agency and cannot be enforced by the Division of Building Inspection.
Sec. 1 - 5. Consistency.
(a) In the instance of uncertainty in the construction or application of any section of these
Regulations, the Regulations shall be construed in a manner that will further the implementation
of, and not be contrary to, the goals and policies, procedures, maps, and other policy statements

supersede all other subdivision regulations in effect at the time of such adoption.
Sec. 1 - 7. Continuation of Prior Regulations. Subdivisions which have been submitted for
approval under the provisions of the subdivision regulations in effect prior to December 31, 1995
may be continued to be reviewed and approved under those regulations in accordance with the
following:
(a) Application Filed - Any subdivision which, at the time of adoption of these Regulations, has
submitted an application for subdivision approval, shall continue in the review process before the
Planning Board in accordance with the subdivision regulations in effect at the time the
application was received as complete.
(b) Preliminary Approvals - Any subdivision which, at the time of adoption of these Regulations,
has received preliminary approval, or preliminary approval with conditions, from the East
Providence City Council, shall continue in the review process before the Planning Board and
3
shall be subject to the subdivision regulations in effect at the time preliminary approval was
granted provided any one of the following conditions have been met:
(1) The final plat, including all material required by these Regulations, is filed with
the Planning Department within one (1) year from the date of preliminary approval;
or,
(2) The subdivision is located within an area and is of a nature to be within the

and the preliminary plans as approved have been filed with CRMC for an Assent as
required by the Coastal Resources Management Program; or,
(3) The subdivision is located within an area and is of a nature to be within the
jurisdiction of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management
(RIDEM) and the preliminary plans as approved have been filed with RIDEM for
approval as required by the Freshwater Wetlands Act; or,
(4) The applicant has expended significant moneys in the preparation of preliminary
subdivision plans in an amount that, if preliminary approval were to become void
and re-application under these Regulations were to be required a significant
economic hardship would result. The Planning Board shall determine what
constitutes “significant economic hardship”.

received final approval, or final approval with conditions, from the East Providence City
Council, may initiate or construct any part of the development, or record said plans in accordance

subdivision made by the Planning Board shall be made to the Board of Appeal as herein
provided.

GENERAL PROVISIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 5 - 1. General Provisions and Requirements - Applicability. These rules and
regulations shall apply in all cases of subdivision of land, including re-subdivision, and in all
cases of land development projects, and in all cases a new plan or plat and an application for
review and approval shall be required. The Administrative Officer and/or the Planning Board
shall consider each application for subdivision and/or land development project approval as
applicable according to the procedures set forth in these Regulations, unless otherwise
specifically provided.
Sec. 5 - 2. Application for Development Review. An applicant for subdivision or land
development project approval shall submit all of the materials required by these Regulations to
the Administrative Officer. The Administrative Officer shall advise applicants as to which
approvals are required and the appropriate board for hearing an application for a subdivision or
land development project. The major types of applications are:
(a) Administrative Subdivision. Re-division of existing lots which yields no
additional lots for development, and involves no creation or extension of streets.
Such re-division shall only involve divisions, mergers and division, or adjustments of
boundaries of existing lots.
(b) Minor subdivision. A plan for subdivision of land consisting of five (5) or
fewer units or lots, provided that such development does not require waivers or
modifications as specified in these Regulations. Minor subdivisions shall be
classified as those on existing frontage and those requiring street creation or
extension.
(c) Major subdivision. Any subdivision not classified as either an administrative
subdivision or a minor subdivision.
(d) Land Development Project. As defined in Chapter 19 Zoning, of the Revised
Ordinances of East Providence.
If an applicant is requesting an action which does not have a formal application form, such as
requests for waivers and modifications, the applicant shall submit a written request to the
Administrative Officer describing the requested action and the justification for the requested
action.
Sec. 5 - 3. Original Lot. In all cases of subdivision, including re-subdivision, the original lot
shall be counted as one of the lots created by an application for subdivision approval.
Sec. 5 - 4. Required Findings. Prior to approval of any application for subdivision and/or
land development project, the Administrative Officer or Planning Board, as applicable, shall
18
address each of the general purposes stated in Article 1 and shall make positive findings on all of
the applicable standards listed below, as part of the proposed project’s record. If a positive
finding for any of these standards cannot be made, the Administrative Officer and/or Planning
Board shall have grounds for denial of the project.
(a) Subdivision and land development project proposals shall be consistent with the East
Providence Comprehensive Plan, including its goals, objectives, policy statements, and Land Use
2010 Plan, and/or shall satisfactorily address the issues where there may be inconsistencies;
(b) All lots in a subdivision and all land development projects shall conform to the standards and
provisions of the East Providence Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 19, provided however, that lots
not being created for the purpose of present or future development need not meet the area and
other dimensional requirements of Section 19-145 of the Zoning Ordinance provided that:
(1) A notation is shown on the recorded plat that the lot being created is not a
buildable lot; and/or
(2) A conservation or preservation restriction pursuant to Title 34, Chapter 39 of the
Rhode Island General Laws, as amended, is granted to the City of East Providence
prohibiting any such present or future development.
(c) There will be no significant negative environmental impacts from the proposed development
as shown on the final plan, with all required conditions for approval;
(d) Subdivision, as proposed, will not result in the creation of individual lots with such physical
constraints to development that building on those lots according to pertinent regulations and
building standards would be impracticable. Lots with such physical constraints to development
may be created only if identified as permanent open space or permanently reserved for a public
purpose on the approved and recorded plans;
(e) All proposed land developments and all subdivisions shall have adequate and permanent
physical access to a public street. Lot frontage on a public street without physical access shall
not be considered compliance with this requirement. Lots cannot be isolated by topographic,
natural or other features which prevent adequate physical access from the street.
(f) Each subdivision and land development project shall provide for safe circulation of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic, for adequate surface water run-off, for suitable building sites,
and shall provide for preservation of natural, historical, or cultural features that contribute to the
attractiveness of the community to the extent feasible; and,
(g) The design and location of streets, building lots, utilities, drainage improvements and other
improvements in each subdivision and land development shall minimize flooding and soil
erosion.
19
Sec. 5 - 5. Criteria for Review. In addition to the required findings and general purposes of
these Regulations, the Administrative Officer and/or Planning Board may utilize the following
criteria in their review of any subdivision or Land Development Project:
(a) In cases where there is the potential for further subdivision of the parcel which is the subject
of the application under current applicable zoning regulations, the Planning Board shall consider
the impacts from such future development in their review of the proposed subdivision and may
impose any or all of the requirements and standards allowed by these Regulations.
(b) Lots must be provided with access to a street which is adequate for the safe flow of vehicular
traffic;
(c) Frontage must provide safe access to a public street, and lots must be accessible by the fire
department, police department and other agencies charged with protection of the public peace,
safety and welfare;
(d) Adequate provision shall be made to preserve scenic values along the road frontage of statedesignated
scenic highways in accordance with standards adopted by the State Scenic Highway
Board pursuant to Rhode Island General Laws Sec. 24-15-9.
(e) Proposed lots and access thereto shall be designed to minimize conflict with existing
adjacent uses, driveways, buildings or other structures, streets, intersections, hills, curves or other
similar existing features;
(f) Wherever possible and practical, the lots shall be subdivided so as to avoid creation of
individual lots having sole direct frontage on an existing public arterial or collector street. In
such cases, the Administrative Officer shall require the applicant to submit alternative plans to
demonstrate the feasibility of creating other types of subdivisions, such as minor subdivision
with an internal street. If the Planning Board determines that such development is feasible and
practical, the Planning Board may vote to prohibit the creation of frontage lots and the applicant
shall be required to develop the property in an alternative fashion.
Sec. 5 - 6. Project Concept Review Conference.
(a) At the pre-application stage, the applicant or City may request an informal project concept
review conference. The project concept review conference provides an opportunity to review

plans shall be presented at a scale sufficient to show all details clearly on a sheet or
sheets measuring not less than eight and one-half (8-1/2) by eleven (11) inches at the
outside edges and not more than twenty-four (24) by thirty-six (36) inches at the
outside edges. A copy of the project concept sketch plan shall be remain with the
Department of Planning following the project concept review conference.

eleven (11) inches at the outside edges and not more than twenty-four (24) by thirtysix
(36) inches at the outside edges. Such vicinity sketch map shall show existing
streets and highways, natural drainage courses and similar major natural or manmade
features of the area, and land uses in the area covered by the map, including
residential, commercial, industrial and public uses.

and existing use(s) of the property along with a general description of the uses and type of
development proposed by the applicant, and a check payable to the City of East Providence as
follows: for Minor Subdivisions – seventy-five dollars ($ 75), or for Major Subdivisions or Land
Development Projects - one hundred fifty dollars ($150). The scale of the plans shall be
sufficient to clearly show all of the information required.
(e) Pre-application discussions are intended for the guidance of the applicant and shall not be
considered approval of a project or its elements.
(f) A new pre-application conference may be required where factors relating to a proposed
subdivision or land development have substantially changed since the time of the initial preapplication

(b) Such an assessment may be required by the Planning Board for minor subdivisions if the
Board finds that the proposed development may have a negative impact on the existing natural
and built environment or may be inappropriate for the character of the surrounding
neighborhood, and/or if all or part of the property that is the subject of the application includes
land identified in the Comprehensive Plan as being within an area of Critical Concern or
sensitive environmental areas.
(c) The assessment will include an evaluation of all influences, both positive and negative,
which can be expected to affect the natural and man-made environment in the vicinity of the
proposed project, or will demonstrate lack of such impact. Both direct and indirect impacts shall
be evaluated. Fiscal impacts, including tax benefits and school and service requirements, must
be addressed. A traffic impact study, as described below, may be required as part of the impact
assessment. Other impacts which shall be considered as part of the impact assessment are

23
recommence upon the resubmission of a corrected application by the applicant. However,
in no event shall the Administrative Officer be required to certify a corrected submission as
complete or incomplete less than fourteen (14) days after its resubmission.

approval(s) from the council, and then return to the Planning Board for subsequent required
approvals.
(c) Where applicant requires both Planning Board approval and action by the City Council on
some other aspect of the project, including, but not limited to, street abandonment, the applicant
shall first obtain an advisory recommendation on the required action from the Planning Board, as

Sec. 5 - 12. Phasing of projects.
(a) The Planning Board may provide for the preliminary and final review stages, and for the
construction of major land developments and major subdivisions, to be divided into reasonable
phases. When a Land Development Project and/or Major subdivision is submitted for
Conceptual Master Plan approval as provided elsewhere in these Regulations, the Planning Board
shall review the adequacy of existing and projected public improvement, services and facilities
which may be impacted by the proposed development in its entirety. If the Planning Board
determines that such improvements, services and facilities, including but not limited to, water
supply, sewerage, streets and associated drainage facilities, schools, recreational facilities, and
fire and police protection will not be adequate to serve the residents of the subdivision or
development at the time of recording of the plat, the Planning Board shall have the authority to
establish a rate of development of the entire subdivision or project by requiring it to be built in
phases.
26
(b) Where phasing is permitted or required, the Planning Board shall first approve the entire site
design as a master plan. Thereafter, the applicant shall be required to submit plans for
preliminary and/or final review and/or approval indicating the development of the entire site in
two or more phases. In such review and approval, the Board may, in its discretion, impose
conditions for determining the physical limits of phases, for allowing progression to additional
phases, for allowing two (2) or more phases to proceed in review or construction simultaneously,
for interim public improvements or construction conditions, for changes to master or preliminary
plans, and may include other provisions as necessitated by special conditions.
(c) When an application is submitted for Conceptual master plan approval, the applicant shall
submit copies of the conceptual master plan and narrative report as required by these Regulations
to the applicable City, state, federal or private agencies for review and comment. The
Administrative Officer will work with the applicant in determining the applicable agencies. Each
agency so notified by the applicant shall be requested to provide its comments on a form to be
provided by and returned to the Administrative Officer at least seven (7) days prior to the date of
an informational and/or public hearing on the application. The applicant shall be responsible for
obtaining comments from any non-City agencies and/or departments and providing them to the
Administrative Officer in the appropriate time period. The Administrative Officer shall be
responsible for obtaining responses from other City departments. If comments are not received
by the Administrative Officer in the appropriate time period, it shall be assumed that the agency
does not wish to comment.
(d) Each department or agency to which such a request for comments is made shall provide said
comments on a completed written form, along with any supplementary material, which shall
describe:
(1) an estimate of the impact of the development or subdivision on the facilities
and/or services provided by the department or agency;
(2) Whether existing facilities and/or services are adequate to serve the subdivisions’
residents;
(3) Whether plans for the necessary improvements to existing facilities and/or
services are included in the City’s Capital Improvement Program or are otherwise
planned, and,
(4) An estimate of how long it would take to provide any necessary improvements to
existing facilities and/or services.
(e) Based on the responses received from the various departments and agencies, the Planning
Board shall establish, at the time of master plan approval, a rate of development of the entire
development or subdivision that will permit residential construction only when improvements,
services and facilities will be adequate to serve the residents of the subdivision or development.
The Planning Board may require that improvements be installed, or lots sold, in two or more
phases.
(f) In the case of plans which call for development over a period of years, a schedule showing
the proposed times within each section of the development may be started shall be submitted.
27
The proponents of a phased development shall include suitable provisions for assurance that each
phase could be brought to completion in a manner which would not result in an adverse effect
upon the City as a result of the termination at that point.
(g) The master plan shall remain vested as long as it can be proved, to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board, that work is proceeding on either the approval stages or on the construction of
the development as shown in the approved master plan documents. Vesting shall extend to all
information shown on the approved master plan documents.
Sec. 5 - 13. Waiver and/or Modification of Requirements.
(a) The Planning Board shall have the power to grant waivers and/or modifications from the
requirements of these Regulations as may be reasonable and within the general purposes and
intents of these and other applicable City plans and regulations. The only grounds for such
waivers and/or modifications shall be where the literal enforcement of one or more provisions of
these Regulations is impracticable and will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question or where such waiver and/or modification is in the best interest
of good planning practice and/or design as evidenced by consistency with the City’s
comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance.
(b) Requests for waivers and/or modifications shall be made in writing and shall provide
justification for the requested action. Applicants shall submit such requests to the

ARTICLE 12
DESIGN AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENT STANDARDS
Sec. 12 - 1. Design and Public Improvement Standards - Relation to Comprehensive Plan.
(a) At such time that a comprehensive plan or any portion thereof for the City is prepared by
the Planning Board and officially adopted by the City Council, the Planning Board shall consider
such plan and require that the proposed subdivision or land development project follow the goals
and objectives, procedures, maps, and other policy statements of the comprehensive plan.
(b) Where a preliminary draft of a comprehensive plan or any portion thereof has been prepared
by the Planning Board, the Planning Board may consider such plan and where practicable require
that the proposed subdivision or land development project follow such plan in regard to the goals
and objectives, procedures, maps, and other policy statements of the comprehensive plan.
Sec. 12 - 2. Suitability of Land Generally. The Planning Board shall not sanction the
subdivision of land for residential use if the Planning Board considers such land to be unsuitable
for platting or building purposes. Among other things, consideration shall be given to areas
subject to high groundwater level, flooding, hurricane damage, adjoining land uses, topography,
swampy areas, prevailing winds, health, welfare and safety.
Sec. 12 - 3. Site Design. Subdivisions and land development projects shall be developed so
that site design shall meet all the general purposes and required findings of these Regulations and
of Chapter 19 Zoning, of the Revised Ordinances of East Providence, as applicable. Land
Development Projects shall be required to meet the applicable provisions of Chapter 19 Zoning,
of the Revised Ordinances of East Providence, including the Development Plan Review (DPR)
standards.
Sec. 12 - 4. Naming of Subdivision. The proposed name of any subdivision shall not
duplicate or closely approximate phonetically the name of any other subdivision within East
Providence. The Planning Board shall have final authority in approving all subdivision names.
Sec. 12 - 5. Street Names. No street name shall duplicate or closely approximate phonetically
the name of any other street in East Providence. A street planned as a continuation of or that is
obviously in alignment with an existing street shall be given the same name as the existing street.
The Planning Board shall have final authority in approving all street names.
Sec. 12 - 6. Lots.
(a.) Size. Lot areas and dimensions shall not be less than the minimum requirements of
Chapter 19 Zoning, of the Revised Ordinances of East Providence, unless relief is granted by the
Zoning Board of Review, or provided that lots not being created for the purpose of present or
future development meet the requirements of Article 5 for non-buildable lots.
73
(1.) If the proposed subdivision cannot be served by a public water and sanitary
sewer system, the Planning Board may, on the recommendation of the Department of
Public Works, require larger sizes and greater frontages for lots in such areas if it
deems such action necessary to prevent unsanitary conditions from occurring on such
lots. The requirements of the Department of Public Works of the City shall be used
as a guide for determining whether an unsanitary condition may occur, and the lot
sizes recommended by the Department of Public Works shall be used as a guide in
determining lot sizes and lot dimensions necessary to assure healthful conditions.
(2) The depth and width of lots laid out for residential, commercial and industrial
purposes shall be adequate to provide for off-street service and parking facilities
required by the type of use and development contemplated.
(3) Where an easement located on the side, front or interior of a lot affects a lot in
such a manner as to conflict with the use of the land for the intended purpose, the
Planning Board shall have the right to require an increase in the depth or width of
such lot.
(b.) Use. The use of lots shall conform to the requirements in Chapter 19 Zoning, of the
Revised Ordinances of East Providence, unless relief is granted by the Zoning Board of Review.
(c.) Frontage on street. All lots shall front on an existing or proposed public street and shall
have satisfactory access to such street. Double frontage shall be avoided.
(d.) Lot lines. Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles to straight street lines or
radial to curved street lines.
(e) Shape. The Planning Board shall have the right to prohibit or require modification to lots
which are shaped or configured in such a manner as to conflict with the use of the land for the
intended purpose. In particular, long, narrow strips of land shall be avoided in lot layout and
design. Unusual shapes, angles and dimensions, such as “flag pole” lots, shall be avoided in lot
layout and design. The Planning Board may, in reviewing a proposed subdivision, require
modification to the proposed lot layout as it deems necessary to achieve the purposes of these
Regulations.
(f.) Corner lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have sufficient width and depth to
permit appropriate building setback from each street.
(g. ) Solar orientation. Lots should be arranged so as to take maximum advantage of south
facing slopes in the proposed subdivision. The longer axis of these lots should be oriented northsouth
wherever possible, in order to minimize potential shading or limitation of solar (skyspace)
access from adjacent site development, vegetation, or other natural features.
74
Sec. 12 - 7. Development Design. All subdivision and land development shall be in
compliance with Chapter 19 Zoning, of the Revised Ordinances of East Providence, unless relief
is granted by the Zoning Board of Review. Not withstanding other portions of these
Regulations, the following standards may be applied to development by the Planning Board:
(a) Residential development:
(1.) the location of a proposed access driveway along the street frontage may be
modified or relocated;
(2.) the proposed number of access driveways onto any street from any lot or group
of lots may be modified, or limited;
(3.) driveways of adjacent lots, or groups of contiguous lots may be combined and
the use of common driveways may be required where feasible;
(4.) screening, buffering, and/or landscaping of the lots and/or driveway from
adjacent public streets may be required;
(5.) provisions may be made for ensuring adequate sight distances from the proposed
access driveway along adjacent public streets in order to alleviate any potentially
hazardous situation;
(6.) improvements to the street on which a proposed lot or lots front may be required
by the Planning Board in order to provide safe vehicular access in accordance with
Sec. 12-20 of these Regulations. Provided, however, that the standards for
construction or upgrading of any such street(s) shall not exceed those applicable
standards of Article 13 of these Regulations (Required Improvements).
(7.) easements may be required to be granted to the City to prohibit individual
driveway access from lots onto frontage streets if adequate provision is made for
access from individual lots to common driveways, or to prohibit individual driveway
access from lots onto arterial or collector streets where the lot or lots have frontage
on a local street;
(8) provisions may be made for incorporating proposed frontage lots into future
subdivision of contiguous land, if such future subdivision is determined to be
feasible by the Planning Board. Such provisions may include the following:
(a) preparation of a concept plan to indicate future access to and
development of residual land contiguous to proposed frontage lots;
75
(b) reservation of land or easements to provide for future access from access
streets to contiguous land; and/or
(c) temporary driveways for frontage lots with provisions made for future
permanent driveways to be connected to future streets in subdivision of
contiguous land.
(b) Commercial and industrial development design. Commercial and industrial developments
may be subject to the residential development standards noted above, as applicable. Applicants
are encouraged to design developments for which the basic design will be consistent with the
goals of the East Providence Comprehensive Plan, including proposed style and materials, the
relationship between any proposed buildings and the site and adjoining land uses and structures,
and the overall physical appearance.
Sec. 12 - 8. Frontage on Improved Streets.
(a) The area to be subdivided shall have frontage on an existing or proposed public street. If
such an existing street has not been improved to the standards and specifications as required in
these Regulations, the Board may require the subdivider or developer to make certain
improvements along the part of the street abutting the property or leading to the property being
subdivided where necessary for drainage, safety, traffic or other reasons as deemed proper by the
Board.
(b) For purposes of these Regulations, streets platted but not improved or accepted for
maintenance by the City, shall not be considered existing improved public streets. Where these
streets are incorporated within the subdivision, or otherwise proposed to be developed, an
application for subdivision review and approval shall be required and the proposed streets, to the
extent practicable, may be subject to the design and improvement requirements as established by
these Regulations.
Sec. 12 - 9. Street Classification. Street design within a proposed subdivision shall conform
to a street hierarchy system as established herein. All proposed streets in a subdivision shall be
considered in regard to their prospective use and shall be designed for such use. Requirements
for right-of-way and pavement width, drainage and other utilities, sidewalks, curbing and other
design standards shall be tailored to street function. Street classification shall be determined by
the Planning Board upon the recommendation of the Administrative Officer and Director of
Public Works. The following major categories of street classification are established:
(a) Arterial. A major street that serves as an avenue for the circulation of traffic into,
out of, or around the municipality and carries high volume of traffic.
76
(b) Collector. A street whose principal function is to carry traffic between local
streets and arterial streets, but that may also provide direct access to abutting
properties.
(c) Local. A street whose primary function is to provide access to abutting properties,
including minor and marginal access streets.
Sec. 12 - 10. Street Layout Generally. The following shall apply to street layout generally.
Specific standards and required improvements are contained in Article 13.
(a) The arrangement of streets shall be considered in relation to the existing and planned
streets and shall be arranged to conform with the East Providence Comprehensive Plan or any
portion thereof. Proposed streets shall provide for the continuation or projection of principal
streets existing or adjoining property and shall be continued with at least the same width through
the subdivision, except where such continuance or conformity is impracticable or undesirable in
the opinion of the Planning Board. All street design shall consider existing topographic and
natural conditions. Wherever possible, streets shall be planned to conform to the surrounding
topographic conditions.
(b) The street system shall be designed to permit the safe, efficient, and orderly movement of
traffic and public safety and emergency vehicles; to meet, but not exceed, the needs of the
present and future population served; to have a simple and logical circulation pattern; to respect
natural features and topography, and to create an attractive streetscape.
(c) Wherever possible in residential subdivisions, the street system shall be designed to serve
the needs of the neighborhood and to discourage use by through traffic. However, in major
subdivisions and in land development projects, access shall be designed to avoid street systems
which have only one principal means of egress. In order to provide for alternative access, at least
two vehicular access streets may be required by the Planning Board in major subdivisions when
determined by the Board to be feasible. Proposed streets within a major subdivision shall
provide for their continuation or projections to intersect with principal streets on the perimeter of
the subdivision or with adjacent vacant property in order that the streets may be extended at a
future time to the extent practicable.
(d) Where the plat submitted covers only a part of the owner’s or subdivider’s tract, the street
system shall be so laid out as to be capable of future coordinated redevelopment with the
remainder of the tract and adjoining land. In such a case, a sketch of the prospective future street
system of the future phases shall be furnished with the master plan.
(e) Private streets shall not be permitted, except where allowed by Chapter 19 Zoning, of the
Revised Ordinances of East Providence, and only where the criteria established by Chapter 19 are
met.
77

(d.) Dead-end alleys. Dead-end alleys shall be prohibited.
Sec. 12 - 12. Blocks.
(a.) Size. In residential subdivisions, intersecting streets shall be laid out at such intervals that
block lengths between such street lines are not more than one thousand (1,000) feet, except
where special conditions justify a variation from same. Minimum widths of blocks should
generally be not less than two hundred (200) feet between street lines. In any case, the width of
blocks shall be such as to allow two (2) rows of lots.
Commercial and industrial blocks shall be laid out in such a way as to be suited for the intended
occupancy. Industrial blocks shall be large enough to accommodate potential industries and
commercial and industrial blocks shall make adequate provision for off-street parking and
delivery service.
(b.) Crosswalks. Pedestrian crosswalks may be required across streets through the middle of
blocks where deemed essential for pedestrian access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers or
other community facilities and shall not be less than ten (10) feet wide.
Sec. 12 - 13. Easements. Easements shall be required by the Planning Board where necessary
for the proper location and placement of improvements as described below and shall be shown
on all preliminary plans and all final recorded plans. The Planning Board may, in its own
discretion, require the dedication of land to the City in lieu of easements if such dedication would
provide greater control over and access to the intended use. Easements shall contain such granite
bounds as determined by the Director of Public Works. Said bounds shall be shown on all final
plats. A summary of minimum easement widths is contained in Article 13.
(a.) Watercourses. Where a subdivision abuts on or is traversed by a watercourse, drainage
way, channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way
conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse and of such width as will be
adequate for the purpose and for access of maintenance vehicles, but in no case be less than
twenty (20) feet in width.
78
(b.) Utilities. Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for
sewers, storm drains, sub-drainage facilities, water and gas mains, pole lines and conduits or
other utilities where they are anticipated or needed and shall be of such width as will be adequate
for the purpose, but in no case shall be less than the widths as listed in Article 13.
(c) Grading. The Planning Board may require the dedication of an easement to the City in
order to grade or to maintain grading on private property where such grading is necessary to
establish or maintain adequate drainage, sight distances, or topographic features required as a
condition of subdivision approval.
(d) Sight distance. Where deemed necessary by the Planning Board to establish or maintain
adequate sight distances for vehicular traffic, the dedication of an easement to the City may be
required which would prohibit the erection or maintenance of any visual obstruction such as a
fence, structure, tree, shrub, wall, earthen embankment, hill or any other obstruction.
(e) Bicycle or Pedestrian Access. Bicycle and pedestrian access shall be provided where
required for existing and proposed greenways as identified in the City’s Comprehensive Plan on
a separate strip of land dedicated to the City or on an easement having a minimum width of
fifteen (15) feet.
(f.) Other easements. All other required easements shall be of sufficient width and area for
the intended purpose.
Sec. 12 - 14. Lighting. Applicant shall be required to submit a lighting plan in all cases where
street creation or extension is proposed and for all land development projects. The City will
consider waivers from the standard detail for street lighting to allow for period lighting, however,
the City will not accept such lighting for maintenance and a homeowners’ association shall be
responsible for maintaining such lighting. Period lighting shall meet City standards for height of
pole and area of light coverage. All such requests shall be subject to approval by the Planning
Board.
Sec. 12 - 15. Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all proposed
streets in subdivisions and land development projects, where applicable, in accordance with the
standard detail set forth by the Engineering Division, except for short cul-de-sac streets serving
five (5) or fewer lots or dwellings, in which case the sidewalk may be constructed on one side of
the street upon review and approval by the Planning Board. Sidewalks may be required to be
installed along streets in other areas if the Planning Board finds any of the following:
(1) The subdivision is located within an area within one-half (1/2) mile of a public or
private school:
(2) The subdivision is located in reasonable proximity to major public or private
facilities such as churches, shopping areas, playgrounds, etc. where there is a
79
reasonable likelihood that pedestrian traffic to/from/within the proposed subdivision
would result; or
(3) The subdivision is located within an area with high vehicular traffic volumes and
where there would be a likelihood of significant danger to pedestrians.
Sidewalks may be required to be installed as off-site improvements in accordance with the
provision of Sec. 12 - 20 of these Regulations (Off-site Improvements).
Sec. 12 - 16. General drainage/erosion standards. All subdivision and land development shall
provide for the adequate drainage of all surface and subsurface waters in conformance with
Article 13.
Sec. 12 - 17. Setbacks for Stormwater Detention or Retention Ponds. Any retention or
detention pond required for stormwater management shall be set back at least the minimum
required yard setback amount established by Chapter 19 Zoning, of the Revised Ordinances of
East Providence, as applicable, from any property line.
Sec. 12 - 18. Land Development Projects or neighborhood units.
The requirements of this article concerning minor and marginal access street widths, size of lots,
block lengths and widths may be modified by the Planning Board in the case of large
developments of single family and multifamily units in combinations of detached, semidetached,
row houses or garden and high-rise apartments which are land development projects or a
subdivision of a tract of land large enough to be developed according to a cluster subdivision
plan, a self-contained neighborhood or super block in accordance with a well studied plan
maintaining approximately the same population density, intensity of development and land use as
required by the East Providence Comprehensive Plan or any portion thereof, properly
safeguarded by restrictions which, in the judgment of the planning board, adequately provide for
circulation, access by emergency vehicles, off-street parking, light and air needs and
recreational, public open space and school requirements of the maximum anticipated population.
Sec. 12 - 19. Public open space.
(a) As a condition of approval, the Planning Board may require a subdivider or developer to
dedicate land for the laying out of adequate local parks, playgrounds, school sites and other
public uses in residential areas to be dedicated to the City, and where circumstances warrant or
where the size and prospective use of the subdivision or land development project, the Planning
Board may require the dedication of adequate land for such public purposes as identified in the
City’s Comprehensive Plan and adopted recreation, conversation and open space plans, under
the following conditions:
(1) The necessary dedication is clearly and substantially related to the subdivision or
land development being proposed.
80
(2) The land proposed for the dedication is determined to be appropriate for the
proposed use.
(3) The Planning Board shall provide in its vote of final approval the basis for
requiring such land dedication. In its vote, the Board shall be required to make the
finding that significant negative impacts of the proposed development on the existing
conditions would result if the land dedication were not made, and to clearly
document the adverse impacts in the public record.
(b.) Where a small park or other neighborhood open recreational space, school site, drainage
area or other public use which is located in whole or in part in the applicant’s subdivision is
shown on the City’s comprehensive plan, or the appropriate section thereof, hereinafter adopted,
the Planning Board may require the dedication or reservation of such open space within the
subdivision.
Sec. 12 - 20. Off-Site Improvements.
(a) As a condition of approval, the Planning Board may require a subdivider or developer to
construct reasonable and necessary improvements located off the land being subdivided or
developed, under the following conditions:
(1) Necessary improvements are those clearly and substantially related to the
subdivision or land development being proposed.
(2) The Planning Board shall provide in its vote of final approval the basis for
requiring such off-site improvements. In its vote, the Board shall be required to
make the finding that significant negative impacts of the proposed development on
the existing conditions would result if the off-site improvements were not made, and
to clearly document the adverse impacts in the public record.
(3) The improvements required as a condition of approval must be related to the
significance of the identified impact.

Planning Board may require marginal access streets, screen planting or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through traffic from local traffic.
(2) Where a subdivision in a commercial or industrial district borders on or
contains a railroad right-of-way, limited access highway or expressway, the planning
board may require a marginal access street approximately parallel to and on each side
of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening

to permit reduced paved width in the R-1 and R-2 districts, the Board shall be required to make
positive findings on the following:
85
(1) That expected traffic volumes on the local street are expected to be low, i.e. those
of a single-family residential neighborhood, and the primary use of the street is to
provide access to the properties in the subdivision.
(2) That there is no possibility of encouraging through-traffic by providing a
continuous connection of subdivision streets to streets outside of the subdivision.
(3) That the residential land use of the neighborhood serviced by the streets of
reduced width will be Low Density (generally less than eight (8) dwelling units per
acre).
(4) That an adequate number of off-street parking spaces can be accommodated on
the properties abutting the street to prevent continual inordinate on-street parking,
and that provisions are made for a covenant running with the land to perpetuate this
off-street parking area.
(e.) Cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets. Dead-end streets without a turnaround and not
designed for eventual continuance shall not be approved. Streets which are designed to have one
end permanently closed (cul-de-sacs) shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
roadway having a minimum outside curb radius at least fifty (50) feet and shall not exceed six
hundred (600) feet in length. Where a dead-end street is to provide access to adjacent property,
provisions for a temporary turnaround or "tee" shall be required until such time as the adjacent
tracts is developed and the street extended.

streets. Each lot in the subdivision shall abut on a public street with access to an existing public
highway.
(h.) Street grades. The maximum grade of arterial and collector streets shall be five (5)
percent, and the minimum grade shall be one-half of one (0.5) percent. The maximum grade of
minor street shall be eight (8) percent, and the minimum grade shall be one-half of one (0.5)
percent. Where, in the judgment of the City Engineer, it is not feasible to maintain a grade of
eight (8) percent or less, the engineer may allow a steeper grade, but in no case shall the grade
exceed twelve (12) percent.
(i.) Intersecting streets. Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at
right angles, and no street shall intersect any other street at an angle less than sixty (60) degrees.
86
(j.) Street offsets and cross-streets. Cross-streets shall intersect precisely or shall be offset by
a distance of at least one hundred twenty-five (125) feet measured from centerline to centerline.

89
shall weigh less than ten (10) tons. Rolling shall start longitudinally at the sides and
proceed toward the center of the pavement, overlapping on successive trips by at
least one-half the width of the rear wheels of the roller. Rolling shall be continued
until all roller marks are eliminated. The motion of the roller shall at all times be
slow enough to avoid displacement of the hot mixture and to prevent adhesion of the
surface mixture to the roller; the heels shall be kept properly moistened by either
water or oil.
The roller shall be operated by a competent, experienced roller operator and shall be
kept in as nearly continuous operation as practicable while the work is underway.
(g.) Drainage, culverts and bridges. All necessary drainage, culvert and bridge

Sec. 13 - 9 Drainage.
(a.) Purpose and objectives. The purpose of this section is to promote the design of
developments which effectively control the impacts of erosion, inadequate drainage and stormwater
runoff. Soil erosion and sediment runoff shall be adequately controlled during and after
construction and shall not adversely affect adjacent or neighboring properties, surface and
groundwater, or public facilities and services. Applicants are encouraged to utilize the “State of
Rhode Island Stormwater Design and Installation Standards Manual” (Rhode Island Department
of Environmental Management and Rhode Coastal Resources Management Council) in the
design of stormwater best management practices, as well as the Rhode Island Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Handbook. Effective drainage, site design techniques and erosion control can
accomplish the following:
(1.) Reduce nonpoint source pollutants generated from erosion of sediments and
stormwater runoff;
(2.) Prevent damage to private and public property from flooding caused by poor
drainage system design;
(3.) Improve surface water and groundwater quality by minimizing runoff volumes and
peak discharge rates, and by promoting the overland flow and infiltration of
uncontaminated runoff;
(4.) Minimize the negative impacts of stormwater runoff to enhance and protect surface
and ground water quality, and promote effective flood management;
(5.) Through vegetative root systems, stabilize ground water tables and play an
important part in soil conservation, erosion control and flood control.
(b.) Drainage standards.
(1) Drainage system. All developments shall be provided with a drainage system that is
adequate to prevent the undue retention of surface water on the development site.
Surface water shall not be regarded as unduly retained if:
a. The retention results from a technique, practice or device installed as part of
an approved sedimentation or storm water runoff control plan; or
93
b. The retention is not substantially different in location or degree than that
experienced by the development site in its pre-development stage, unless
such retention presents a danger to health or safety.
(2) No surface water may be channeled or directed into a sanitary sewer.
(3) To the maximum extent practicable, all development shall conform to the natural
contours of the land and natural and pre-existing man-made drainage ways shall
remain undisturbed.
(4) Whenever practicable, the drainage system of development shall coordinate with
and connect to the drainage system or drainage ways on surrounding properties or
streets.
(5) In areas where a comprehensive watershed drainage or stormwater management
study has been performed, the Administrative Officer may recommend to the
Planning Board, based on preliminary review of plans, that a proposed drainage
system be subject to an independent engineering evaluation, performed by a
qualified engineering consultant in accordance with the procedures for Professional
Review fees contained in Article 4, including that the applicant bear the costs of
such review. The Planning Board shall have final authority on the need for an
independent evaluation. Such evaluation shall be performed by the consulting
engineer and results of same shall be provided to the Administrative Officer to
establish that soil drainage conditions can support the proposed drainage system and
that stormwater treatment will be addressed.
(6) Drainage systems shall be designed so that there will be no increase in the rate of
runoff from the post-development site as compared to the pre-development site
based on an assumption of a pre-development site condition of vacant land. The
Administrative Officer may recommend that the Planning Board modify the
requirement for an assumption of a pre-development site condition of vacant land,
provided that the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Board
that special site and drainage conditions so warrant, and that there will be no adverse
impacts on off-site drainage or water quality.
(7) Retention or detention systems shall be appropriately landscaped or buffered.
(8) Underground or aboveground detention or retention basins shall be designed to
accommodate a minimum twenty-five year storm. For any detention or retention
systems proposed to be located within special flood hazard zones (as defined by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency's "Flood Insurance Rate Map" and "Flood
Boundary and Flood Way Map," as may be amended), such systems shall be
designed to withstand a minimum one-hundred year storm. All drainage plans shall
include an analysis of the impacts upon the development of a one-hundred year
94
storm event. The City may require mitigation of any identified impacts where
appropriate.
For all retention or detention basins, whether aboveground or underground,
percolation tests and test pits shall be performed at the proposed site of the basin in
accordance with the requirements of the City Engineer. This information will
determine the suitability of the subsurface to accommodate the designed basin. The
maximum high groundwater (HGW) level shall also be determined at the location of
any proposed detention or retention basins.
(9) When retention or detention basins, oil and water separators, or drainage
swales are proposed to be incorporated in the drainage system with the approval of the
Planning Board, such facilities shall be maintained by the City or the developer or
successor property owners in accordance with maintenance guidelines established by
the Planning Board upon approval. Where the developer or successor property owners
are required to maintain, failure of the developer or successor property owners to
properly maintain such facilities shall result in an expense imposed by the City to be
legally established as a lien against the property. If the City agrees to accept
maintenance, the Planning Board reserves the right to require that the developer
deposit funds in a dedicated account in sufficient amount to cover projected
maintenance needs for a specific period, said amount and period to be a condition of
plan approval.
(10) Stormwater management. All developments shall be constructed and maintained
such that adjacent or neighboring properties are not unreasonably burdened with
surface waters as a result of such developments. More specifically:
a. No development may be constructed or maintained such that development
unreasonably impedes the natural flow of water from higher adjacent or neighboring
properties across such development, thereby unreasonably causing substantial damage to
such higher adjacent or neighboring properties; and
b. No development may be constructed or maintained such that surface waters from
the development are unreasonably collected and channeled onto lower adjacent or
neighboring properties at such locations or at such volumes as to cause substantial
damage to such properties. The drainage plan shall address potential impacts on
downstream property based on a twenty-five year storm. Off-site analysis shall be
included in the drainage plan when required by the Planning Board; and
(c.) Required Information. All plats and developments shall provide for the
adequate drainage of all surface and subsurface waters. Where required by these
Regulations, the applicant shall submit a detailed drainage plan and written analysis
which shall contain all information required to review accommodations for the
95
adequate drainage of all surface and subsurface waters, and which shall conform to the
following:
(1.) All calculations shall be performed by a Rhode Island Registered
Professional Engineer and shall compute the pre-development and post-development
peak run-off rates. Such calculations shall employ the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation
Service), Technical Release 55 method for estimating peak discharges in small
watersheds. Where limitations of this method make its use inappropriate, use of
other methods approved by the City Engineer will be allowed.
(2.) All proposed drainage facilities shall be designed to accommodate a 25-year
storm. Based on post development calculations, such facilities shall direct water to
an approved location and in a manner approved by the City Engineer. All drain pipe
shall have a minimum of 2 feet of cover measured from finished grade to the top of
the bell end of the pipe, unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer. In addition,
all storm drain pipe shall be constructed of pre-cast concrete Class IV or better, as
required by the City Engineer. Storm drains shall be designed based on a ten-year
storm design.
(3.) Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream is located in a
subdivision plat or where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream will be
altered, relocated or otherwise changed in a subdivision plat, the developer shall
make adequate provisions for post development peak flows and provide a predevelopment
and post-development analysis of upstream and downstream conditions.
Improvements as necessary must be made at cost to the Developer. Where deemed
necessary, such watercourses shall be enclosed by pipe or other means of an
appropriate size and satisfactory to the City Engineer. Appropriate permits issued by
the Department of Environmental Management shall be required before approval can
be granted.
(4.) If the original groundwater elevation as hereafter determined or the spring
groundwater elevation as certified by the Developer's Engineer is higher than two (2)
feet below finished grade of the lowest floor elevation of a building, a restriction
shall be placed on the plat specifying that the lowest floor elevation of a building
shall be at least two (2) feet above groundwater elevation.
(5.) No original contour of a subdivision shall be so altered so as to reduce the
suitability of the soil for proper sub-drainage. Additional percolation tests as
required by this chapter may be required in areas where the contours have been
altered.
(d.) Required Tests. Drainage systems proposing the subsurface disposal of storm water shall
require the following tests.
96
(1. ) Percolation Tests - At least one percolation test, carried out in accordance
with the procedure hereinafter outlined, shall be made at the site of each subsurface
system. Additional testing may be required if the soil is highly variable, unfavorable,
or if a large disposal system is required. The results of each percolation test and
pertinent information shall be submitted to the City Engineer and the location of the
percolation tests shall be marked on the topographical map.
(2.) Groundwater Tests - An adequate number of borings, excavations or
observations shall be made by a registered professional engineer of a qualified
sanitarian engaged by the developer to clearly establish the elevation of the ground
water table in accordance with the procedure outlined in this section. The ground
water determination shall be made at the location of the proposed subsurface disposal
system. In addition, one other test shall be conducted for each 5 acres to be
developed. At least two additional determinations shall be made on areas less than 5
acres. The location of the ground water-table observations shall be indicated on the
topographical map.
(e.) Persons Qualified to Test.
(1.) Engineers and Surveyors - Percolation tests, ground water table elevation
determinations, and the gathering and submission of other essential information shall
be carried out by a registered professional engineer or registered land surveyor at the
expense of the owner or developer.
(2.) Sanitarians and Soil Scientists - Percolation tests, determinations of the
depth to the ground water table may be carried out by a qualified professional
sanitarian or soil scientist approved by the City Engineer. Such approval shall be
made on the basis of satisfactory experience and education in the area of soil science
and standard for the design and construction of individual sewage disposal systems.
Such qualification shall be presented in writing.
(f.) Percolation Test Procedure.
(1.) Dig two or more test holes within the area of the proposed subsurface
disposal system, not less than 10 feet apart. One of the holes should be at the depth
of the bottom elevation of the proposed seepage system, and the second hole should
be at a depth of about 18 inches below the bottom elevation of the proposed seepage
system. This is to evaluate the consistency with depth of the seepage qualities of the
soil. The size of the seepage system must be based on the slowest percolation rate
obtained. The holes shall not be less than 6 inches in diameter or 6 inches square,
nor should they be greater than 8 inches in diameter or 8 inches square.
(2.) Scarify the bottom and sides of the test holes and remove all loose material.
Place about 2 inches of coarse sand or fine gravel in the holes to prevent bottom
scouring.
97
(3.) Fill the holes with clear water to a minimum depth of 12 inches above the
coarse sand or fine gravel. Keep water in each hole for at least four hours and
preferably overnight by refilling. If necessary to maintain water in each hole for this
period, provide a reservoir of water and an automatic siphon to deliver it to the holes
intermittently, or the percolation test holes should be soaked and maintained full for
not less than four hours before the percolation test is made. In uncompacted sandy
soils containing no clay or silt, the above saturation procedure is not necessary, the
test can be made as soon as the water from one filling, has seeped away.
(4.) The percolation test should be made following the saturation process.
When the saturation process is complete, the water depth should be adjusted to 6
inches over the coarse sand or fine gravel before the test is begun. The drop in water
level should be measured from a fixed reference place, such as a board laid across the
hole, over 30-minute intervals, refilling the holes to a depth of 6 inches as necessary.
(5.) When three consecutive readings at 30 minute intervals read the same rate,
the test may be considered complete. If no stability is reached between three 30-
minute readings, not less than four hours of readings must be followed. The drop in
water level which occurs during the final 30 minute period is used to calculate the
percolation rate. This rate is expressed in minutes per inch.
(6.) Soils in which the first 6 inches of water seeps away in less than 30 minutes,
after the saturation period, the time interval between measurements should be
reduced to 10 minutes and the test. ran over a period of one hour. The drop in water
level which occurs during the final 10-minute period is used to calculate the
percolation rate. This rate is expressed in minutes per inch.
(7.) If an unanticipated cut in topography is made, the results of any percolation
test made prior to the cut is invalid. A new percolation test shall be made under the
changed conditions.
(8.) In no case shall a percolation test be made in filled or frozen ground. If a
seepage system is to be located in filled ground, a percolation test must be made in
the original ground.
(g.) Procedures for Ground Water Table Elevation Determinations.
(1.) Wet Season Determinations - The ground water table elevation
determination shall be made when the water table is highest; this occurs usually
during the months of January through April. (Specific dates may be determined on a
yearly basis by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.) In
making this determination it is necessary to bore or dig an adequate number of holes
of convenient size in the proposed leaching area to a depth of at least five (5) feet
below the lowest point of the proposed subsurface seepage system. An open
98
perforated pipe at least four (4) inches in diameter shall be installed. Such pipe
should remain in place until final approval has been issued by the City. This pipe
shall be capped at the top and mounded to prevent the collection of surface water.
All water table observations should be made during the wet season no sooner than 48
hours after excavation. It is recommended that multiple water table observations be
made.
(2.) Dry Season Determinations - Although the ground water table is more
accurately measured in the wet season, data may be available or developed
throughout the year to predict the maximum ground water table elevation during the
wet season. To make such dry season determination, the applicant shall dig a ten
(10) foot deep test hole in the location of the proposed leaching system. In addition,
the applicant shall submit data and comply with the applicable procedures set forth
in either (a.) or (b.) below.
(a.) In cases where the soil consists of: unconsolidated sand or gravel
outwash to a depth of at least ten (10) feet; has a percolation rate not greater
than five (5) minutes per inch; and if groundwater or ledge is not encountered
within ten (10) feet or original ground surface, an adjustment factor may be
applied to the observed groundwater table in order to correct the Maximum
Groundwater Table Elevation. This adjustment factor is to be determined by
the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.
If the corrected groundwater table depth is less than four (4) feet, or if ledge
and soil other than unconsolidated sand and gravel outwash is encountered less
than ten (10) feet below the original ground surface, the groundwater table
must be determined in the wet season or in accordance with (b.) below.
(b.) Where soil conditions are other than those described in (a.) above, the
designer shall collect, evaluate and provide to the City all pertinent information
relative to accurate groundwater table elevation determination in conjunction
with the designer’s specific professional conclusions and sworn affidavit as to
groundwater table elevations.
(3.) The above procedures for dry season determinations set forth in (b.) above
may not be available to determine the groundwater table where:
(a.) The groundwater table is estimated to be within four (4) feet of the original
ground surface; or
(b.) An impervious layer is within six (6) feet of the original ground surface;
or
(c.) The existing soil is a dark silt loam such as a Mansfield, Newport,
Pittstown and or stissing soil series as defined by the United States Department
of Agriculture Soil Survey of Rhode Island.
99
(4.) The date of each test, the depth from the surface of the ground to the water
table or to the bottom of a dry hole, and the type and depth of soil encountered shall
be recorded and submitted.
(5.) Certification of Results. The engineer or sanitarian shall execute a
certificate relating to the accuracy of the technical data on each sheet submitted for
both the percolation tests and groundwater determinations.

stockpiled soil either by redistribution on-site and/or removal of soil from a lot or lots, shall be
shown on the plans. Stockpiled soil shall be prohibited to remain on any lot in a subdivision
unless there is active on-going construction. Street trees shall be left standing or planted in either
the required front yard or between the curb and sidewalk area as recommended by the
Superintendent of Parks.
(b.) Trees may be planted prior to or at the completion of building in the subdivision. If the
subdivider or developer so desires, he or she may deposit with the City funds in an amount to be
determined by the superintendent of parks sufficient to cover the procuring and planting of trees.
Trees planted shall be in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations. Trees shall be of a
