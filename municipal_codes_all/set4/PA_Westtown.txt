ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 53-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Westtown Broadband
and Telecommunications Ordinance of 2001."
§ 53-2. Purpose.
The Township of Westtown finds that the development of broadband
systems has the potential of having a great benefit to and positive impact
on the people of Westtown. Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technologies associated with cable television and telecommunications
systems, the township also finds that public convenience, safety, and
general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers
vested in the township or such persons as the township so designates.
Further, the township recognizes that broadband systems have the capacity
to provide not only entertainment and information services to township
residents but also a variety of broadband, interactive services to township
agencies and other institutions. For these purposes, the following goals,
among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter:
A. Cable services and telecommunications services should be available to
as many township residents as possible.
B. A broadband system authorized to provide cable and
telecommunications service should be capable of accommodating both
the present and reasonably foreseeable future cable- and
telecommunications-related needs of the community.
C. A broadband system should be constructed and maintained during the
franchise term so that new components may be integrated to the
maximum extent possible into existing system facilities.
D. A broadband system should be responsive to the needs and interests of
the local community. The township intends that all provisions set forth
in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the
foregoing public purposes, and that any franchise issued pursuant to
this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public
purposes as integral parts thereof.

by the franchisee to provide cable service or telecommunications service in
the franchise area.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE  The transmission of electronic
impulses, other than cable service, over facilities which occupy any public
right-of-way within the township. Telecommunications service includes, but
is not limited to, voice or data transmissions, internet services of any type
or form, as well as any video transmissions which do not constitute "video
programming" as defined by the Cable Act.
TOWNSHIP  The Township of Westtown, Pennsylvania, as represented by
the Board.
TRANSFER  Any transaction in which an ownership or other interest in
a franchisee, its broadband system or any person that is an operator of
the broadband system is transferred from one person or group of persons
to another person or group of persons so that control of the franchisee is
transferred; or the rights and/or obligations held by the franchisee under
a franchise agreement are transferred or assigned to another person or
group of persons. "Control" for these purposes means working control, in
whatever manner exercised. The addition, deletion or other change of any
general partner of the franchisee, any person who owns or controls the
franchisee or an operator of the broadband system is such a change of
control.
USER  A person or organization utilizing a channel or equipment and
facilities for purposes of producing and/or transmitting material, as
contrasted with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber.

ARTICLE III
Grant of Franchise
§ 53-4. Grant of franchise.
The township may grant one or more franchises, and each such franchise
shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this
chapter. This chapter may be amended from time to time, and in no event
shall this chapter be considered a contract between the township and a
franchisee such that the township would be prohibited from amending
any provision hereof. No such amendment shall be applied retroactively to
materially impair preexisting contractual agreements entered into between
the township and a franchisee.
§ 53-5. Franchise required.
No person may construct or operate a broadband system over, on or under
public streets in the township without a franchise granted by the township
unless otherwise authorized by law, and no person may be granted a
franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the
township pursuant to this chapter.
§ 53-6. Franchise characteristics.
A. A franchise authorizes use of township streets for installing cables,
wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit and other facilities to
provide cable service or telecommunications service within a franchise
area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize the franchisee to
provide service to, or install cables, wires, lines, underground conduit
or any other equipment or facilities on private property without owner
consent [except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section
621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2)], or to use publicly or
privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the
owners.
B. The term of a franchise shall not exceed 15 years and may not exceed
five years unless the franchise agreement contains clear and
enforceable provisions for regulating upgrades, improving any
customer service requirements, reevaluating the provision of additional
access channels, reevaluating interconnection of the system with other
broadband systems and making such other requirements as may be
necessary in light of advancements in technology, at minimum intervals
of not greater than every five years.
C. A franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude
the issuance of other franchises to operate broadband systems within
the township, or affect the township's right to authorize use of township
streets by other persons to operate broadband systems or for other
purposes as it determines appropriate.
§ 53-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 53-6
1:55
§ 53-7. Franchisee subject to other laws and police power.
§ 53-8. Interpretation of franchise terms.
D. Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by the
township and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a
contract between the franchisee and the township, and the terms,
conditions, and provisions of such franchise agreement, subject to this
chapter and all other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the
rights and obligations of the franchisee and the township relating to the
franchise.
E. All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to any prior
lawful occupancy of the streets, and the township reserves the right to
reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed
within the streets.
F. A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to
the original franchisee. No transfer of a franchise shall occur without
the prior consent of the township and unless application is made by the
franchisee and township approval obtained, pursuant to this chapter
and the franchise agreement.
G. A franchise holder may not enter into or enforce any exclusive contract
with a subscriber (including a building owner) as a condition of
providing or continuing service.
A. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all
applicable federal, state and township laws. A franchisee shall at all
times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the
township, including all rights the township may have under 47 U.S.C.
§ 552.
B. No course of dealing between a franchisee and the township, nor any
delay on the part of the township in exercising any rights hereunder,
shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the township or
acquiescence in the actions of the franchisee in contravention of rights
except to the extent expressly waived by the township or expressly
provided for in a franchise agreement, or except as provided in 47
U.S.C. § 546(d).
C. The township shall have the maximum plenary authority to regulate
broadband systems, franchisees and franchises as may now or
hereafter be lawfully permissible; except where rights are expressly
waived by a franchise agreement they are reserved, whether expressly
enumerated or not.
A. The express terms of this chapter will prevail over conflicting or
inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement unless such franchise
agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a requirement of this
chapter.
§ 53-6 WESTTOWN CODE § 53-8
1:56
§ 53-9. Operation of broadband system without franchise.
After the effective date of this chapter, any person who occupies township
streets or public rights-of-way for the purpose of operating or constructing
a broadband system and who does not hold a valid franchise from the
township shall be subject to all provisions of this chapter, including but
not limited to its provisions regarding construction and technical standards
and franchise fees. In its discretion, the township at any time may require
such person to enter into a franchise agreement within 30 days of receipt
of a written notice by the township that a franchise agreement is required;
and/or require such person to remove its property and restore the area
to a condition satisfactory to the township within such time period; and/or
remove the property itself and restore the area to a satisfactory condition
and charge the person the costs therefor. In no event shall a franchise
be created unless it is issued by action of the township and subject to a
franchise agreement.
§ 53-10. Right of condemnation reserved.
Nothing in this chapter or the franchise shall limit any right the township
may have to acquire by eminent domain or otherwise any property of the
franchisee.
B. The provisions of a franchise agreement will be liberally construed in
favor of the township in order to effectuate the purposes and objectives
of this chapter and the franchise agreement and to promote the public
interest.
C. Except as to matters that are governed solely by federal law or
regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

request for an RFP from an applicant seeking a franchise to provide
cable service and/or telecommunications service, the township shall
commence a proceeding to identify the relevant future needs and
interests of the community and, upon completion of that proceeding,
shall promptly issue an RFP and proposed franchise agreement, which
shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made
available to any other interested party. The applicant shall respond
within the time directed by the township, providing the information and
material set forth in Subsection C. The procedures, instructions and
requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant as
if set forth and required herein. The Township Manager, or his/her
designee, shall be authorized to seek additional information from any
applicant and to establish deadlines for the submission of that
information.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A, a person may apply for
an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited proposal and

1:59
(1) Name and address of the applicant and identification of the
ownership and control of the applicant, including: the names and
addresses of the 10 largest holders of an ownership interest in the
applicant and affiliates of the applicant, and all persons with 5% or

persons who control the applicant and its affiliates; all officers and
directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and any other business
affiliation and broadband system ownership interest of each named
person.
(2) A demonstration of the applicant's technical ability to construct
and/or operate and maintain the proposed broadband system,
including identification of key personnel.
(3) Legal qualifications.
(a) A demonstration of the applicant's legal qualifications to
construct and/or operate the proposed broadband system,
including but not limited to a demonstration that the applicant
meets the following criteria:
[1] The applicant must not have submitted an application for
an initial or renewal franchise to the township, which was
denied on the ground that the applicant failed to propose a
broadband system meeting the cable and
telecommunications related needs and interests of the
community, or as to which any challenges to such
franchising decision were finally resolved adversely to the
applicant, within three years preceding the submission of
the application.
[2] The applicant must not have had any franchise validly
revoked by any franchising authority within three years
preceding the submission of the application.
[3] The applicant must have the necessary authority under
Pennsylvania law to provide cable service and/or

substantially comply with its lawful obligations under
§ 53-12 WESTTOWN CODE § 53-12
1:60
applicable law, including obligations under consumer
protection laws and laws prohibiting anticompetitive acts,

provide.
[7] An applicant shall not be issued a franchise if an elected
official of the township holds a controlling interest in the
applicant or an affiliate of the applicant.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the township shall provide an
opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be
inappropriate to deny it a franchise under Subsection
C(3)(a)[2] or [5], by virtue of the particular circumstances
surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to
cure all harms flowing therefrom, the lack of involvement of
the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from
the operation of broadband systems.
(4) A statement prepared by a certified public accountant regarding
the applicant's financial ability to complete the construction and
operation of the broadband system proposed.

telecommunications service will reasonably meet the future cableand
telecommunications-related needs and interests of the
community, including descriptions of how the proposal will meet
the needs described in any recent community needs assessment
conducted by or for the township, and, if applicable, how the
proposal will provide adequate public, educational and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial
support to meet the community's needs and interests.
(11) Pro forma financial projections for the proposed franchise term,
including a statement of projected income, and a schedule of
planned capital additions, with all significant assumptions
explained in notes or supporting schedules.
(12) If an applicant proposes to provide broadband service to an area
already served by an existing franchisee, the identification of the
area where the overbuild would occur, the potential subscriber

shall consider, among other things, the following factors:
(1) The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with
the applicable law and the material terms of any existing franchise
for the township.
(2) Whether the quality of the applicant's service under an existing
franchise in Westtown, including signal quality, response to
customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been
reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities
served.
(3) Whether the applicant has the financial, technical and legal
qualifications to provide broadband service.
§ 53-12 WESTTOWN CODE § 53-12
1:62
(4) Whether the applicant's proposal is reasonable to meet the future
cable- and telecommunications-related needs and interests of the
community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and
interests.
(5) Whether, to the extent not considered as part of Subsection D(4),
the applicant will provide adequate public, educational and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial
support.
(6) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-ofway
and private property which would be used by the broadband
system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance
as planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services and/or the public rights-ofway;
the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of the
broadband system to meet the cable- and telecommunicationsrelated
needs and interests of the community; and the comparative
superiority or inferiority of competing proposals.
(7) Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other broadband system in the township, or whether
grant of the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the
delivery of cable service or telecommunications service in the
township.
E. If the township finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise
considering the factors set forth above, it shall issue a franchise,
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise
agreement. If the township denies a franchise, it shall issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding
whether to issue or not to issue a franchise, the township may hold one
or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which
comments from the public on an applicant's proposal may be received.
The township also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on
its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject
any application which is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP.
F. If the township grants a franchise subject to the applicant's entry into a
franchise agreement, the township and the franchisee shall agree on
the terms of a franchise agreement within 30 calendar days from the
date of the township resolution granting the franchise. This period may
be extended for good cause by the township. If agreement is not
reached with the township within 30 calendar days from the date of the
township resolution granting the franchise, or if the period is not
extended by the township, the franchise will be null and void without
further action by the township. The township shall approve or
disapprove the proposed agreement by resolution, or may direct that it
be subject to further negotiation.
§ 53-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 53-13
1:63
§ 53-13. Application for grant of renewal franchise.
Renewal franchise authorizing the provision of broadband service shall
be conducted, if applicable, in a manner consistent with Section 626 of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. If neither the franchisee nor the township
activates or can activate the renewal process set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a)
to (c) (including, for example, if the provisions are repealed or do not
otherwise apply), the provisions of § 53-12 shall apply and a renewal
request shall be treated the same as a request for an initial franchise.
The following additional requirements shall apply to all applicants seeking
renewal after the effective date of this chapter where the procedures set
forth in 47 U.S.C. § 546(a) to (c) are activated:
A. Within six months after receipt of notice from a franchisee that has
invoked the renewal procedures of Section 626 of the Cable Act, the
township shall undertake a proceeding, including notice to and
opportunity for participation by the public, for the purpose of
identifying future cable- and telecommunications-related community
needs and interests, including the costs of meeting such needs and
interests; and reviewing compliance by the franchisee with the thencurrent
franchise. Such proceeding shall be completed within 12
months from the date begun. The township shall submit a copy of its
findings, if any, in writing to the franchisee within said twelve-month
period.
B. Upon the expiration of the twelve-month period set forth in Subsection
A above, the franchisee may submit to the township a proposal for
renewal.
C. Upon receipt of the renewal application, the township shall publish a
notice of its receipt once in a newspaper of general circulation within
the township and make copies available for review by the public.
D. Within four months of the date it receives the proposal for renewal, and
based on the standards set forth in § 53-12D of this chapter, the
township will either pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise,
subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the
township and the franchisee; or pass a resolution that makes a
preliminary assessment that the franchise should not be renewed;
provided that, if the township and a franchisee cannot reach a franchise
agreement within four months after the proposal is received, then the
resolution agreeing to renewal shall be deemed a resolution
preliminarily assessing that the franchise should not be renewed.
E. If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should not be
renewed, at the request of the franchisee, the township will commence
a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the Cable Act, 47
U.S.C. § 546(c), to address the issues set forth in Section 626(c)(1)(A) to
(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c)(1)(A) to (D).
F. If renewal of a franchise is denied, the township may acquire ownership
of the broadband system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system

minimum, the following information:
§ 53-15. Filing fees.
to another person upon approval of the Board. Any such acquisition
or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of
the broadband system valued as a going concern but with no value
allocated to the franchise itself.
G. If renewal of a franchise is denied and the township does not purchase
the broadband system or approve or effect a transfer of the broadband
system to another person, the township may require the former
franchisee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former
franchisee's expense. If the former franchisee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the township may have the removal done at
the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.

inconsistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, they
shall not apply.

B. The justification for the requested modification, including the impact of
the requested modification on subscribers and others, and the financial
impact on the applicant if the modification is approved or disapproved,
demonstrated through, inter alia, submission of financial pro formas;
C. A statement whether the modification is sought pursuant to Section 625
of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 545, and, if so, a demonstration that the
requested modification meets the standards set forth in 47 U.S.C. § 545;
D. Any other information that the applicant believes is necessary for the
township to make an informed determination on the application for
modification; and
E. An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized officer
certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the application,
and certifying that the application is consistent with all federal and

feasibility of interconnecting the broadband system with other
broadband systems.
B. When feasible, the franchisee shall, at the request of the township,
interconnect with other broadband systems.
C. Nothing herein shall require the franchisee to interconnect with
another broadband system without the permission of such system. All
costs of any interconnection required by this section are external costs
which may be passed through directly to basic subscribers. To the
extent township approval is required for any such basic rate
adjustment, the franchisee shall be under no obligation to perform such
interconnection until such approval is granted.

system can be extended. This construction will be completed as soon as
possible, but, in any case, within six months of attainment of said density
for aboveground facilities and within 12 months for underground facilities.
The franchisee may apply to the township for an extension of the time limit
not to exceed an additional six-month period, provided that the franchisee
used due diligence in attempting timely completion and any delay was
caused by circumstances beyond the franchisee's control; in which case the
township's agreement to said extension shall not be unreasonably withheld.
For new residential subdivisions, the franchisee shall install broadband
system facilities in the public right-of-way to be dedicated to the township
concurrent with the installation of other utilities in the public right-of-way.
§ 53-22. Technical standards.
A. Any broadband system within the township shall meet or exceed the
technical standards set forth in 47 CFR 76.601 and any other applicable
technical standards, including any such standards as hereafter may be
amended or adopted by the township.

manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast station, the
facilities of any public utility, the broadband system of another
franchisee, or individual or master antennas used for receiving
television or other broadcast signals.
C. At the times specified in the franchise agreement or as required by FCC
rules, the franchise shall perform at its expense proof of performance
tests, and such other tests as may be specified in the franchise
agreement, designed to demonstrate compliance with this section, the
franchise agreement and FCC requirements. The franchisee shall, upon
the request of the township, make such test results available to the
township for inspection and copying at the franchisee's offices. The
township shall have the right to inspect the broadband system facilities
during and after their construction to ensure compliance with this
section, the franchise agreement and applicable provisions of local,
state and federal law, and may require the franchisee to perform
additional tests based upon its prior investigation of system
performance or upon subscriber complaints.

the amount of capacity required to transmit one public access channel
upstream, for public, educational and governmental use, the provision
by the franchisee of all modulators, demodulators, laser transmitters/
receivers and other devices as may be required to permit use of the

of any property owner or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct pedestrian
or vehicular traffic.
E. The franchisee shall at all times employ ordinary care and shall install
and maintain in use commonly accepted methods and devices

privilege of abandoning any property in place.
H. If any removal, relaying or relocation is required to accommodate the
construction, operation or repair of the facilities of another person that
is authorized to use the public streets, a franchisee shall, after 30 days'

reasonable prior notice to the township and complies with township
requirements. The township shall have the right to supervise such
trimming.

underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible
and may not erect poles in public rights-of-way without the express
§ 53-29 WESTTOWN CODE § 53-29

into between the franchisee and the utility companies having ownership
of or otherwise having jurisdiction over such existing power and
telephone poles. Copies of agreements for use of conduits or other
facilities shall be filed with the township as required by the franchise

underground, either at the time of initial construction of a broadband
system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be
located underground at the franchisee's expense. Between a street and
a subscriber's residence, a franchisee's cable must be located
underground if both electrical and telephone utility wiring are located
underground. If either electric or telephone utility wiring is aerial, a
franchisee may install aerial cable except where a property owner or
resident requests underground installation and agrees to bear the
additional cost of such installation over and above the cost of aerial
installation.
N. All wires, cable lines and other transmission lines, equipment and
structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference
with the rights and convenience of property owners, and shall be
constructed and maintained by the franchisee so as not to interfere with
television and radio reception by inhabitants not using the services of
the franchisee. The township may issue such rules and regulations
concerning the installation and maintenance of a broadband system
installed in, on or over the streets, as may be consistent with this
chapter and the franchise agreement. The township shall have the right
to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the
franchisee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere
with the broadband system operations of the franchisee.
O. All safety practices required by law shall be used during construction,
maintenance and repair of a broadband system. A franchisee shall not
place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with any
gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or
obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the
residents of the township of their use of any street or any other public
right-of-way, and shall at all times fully comply with the requirements of
Act 287 pertaining to "Call One."
P. Prior to erection of any towers, poles or conduits or the construction,
upgrade or rebuild of a broadband system authorized under this
chapter, the franchisee shall first submit to the township and other

in any other manner reasonably calculated to provide adequate notice.
location of all such facilities. For the erection of towers, the franchisee
shall in addition comply with the requirements of Chapter 170, Zoning,
as may be amended from time to time. No erection or installation of
any tower, pole, underground conduit or fixture or any rebuilds or
upgrading of the broadband system shall be commenced by any person
until approval therefor has been received from the township.
Q. Any contractor proposed for work or construction, installation,
operation, maintenance or repair of broadband system equipment must
be properly licensed under laws of the state and all applicable local
ordinances.
R. In the event the use of any part of a broadband system is discontinued
for any reason for a continuous period of 12 months, or in the event
such broadband system or property has been installed in any street
without complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise
agreement, or the franchise is terminated or canceled or has expired,
the franchisee, within 30 days after written notice by the township,
shall commence removal from the streets of all such property as the
township may require.
S. The township may extend the time for the removal of abandoned
facilities for a period not to exceed 180 days.
T. In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee shall
restore the area to a condition satisfactory to the township.

franchisee must produce the information. However, at the time the
allegedly proprietary information is submitted, the franchisee may
request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as
confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must
state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary
and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality

submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may
grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the
franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal in any
appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any

Rate Regulation
§ 53-42. Rate charge and rate schedule.
§ 53-43. Local regulatory framework.
A. Each franchisee shall state in its proposal to enter into an agreement

ARTICLE XI
Franchise Fee
§ 53-44. Use of streets and public rights-of-way.
The township finds that the streets and public rights-of-way of the county,
state and township to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a
broadband system are valuable public property acquired and maintained
by the county, state and township at great expense to the taxpayers. The
township further finds that the grant of a franchise to use streets and public
rights-of-way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would
be required to invest substantial capital.
§ 53-45. Payment to township.
A. The township shall be paid a franchise fee in an amount no less than the
greater of 5% of its gross annual revenues, or the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law. Every franchise agreement shall
specify the percentage the franchise is initially required to pay as a
percentage of gross revenues, but if the maximum amount permitted
increases, the franchisee shall, simultaneously with the effective date of
any change in any law or, if later, the effective date of any regulation
required to implement the law, increase the franchise fee to the
maximum allowed by that law.
B. The franchise fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that the
franchisee may be required to pay under any federal, state or local law
and to any other tax, fee or assessment imposed by utilities and cable
operators for use of their services, facilities or equipment.
C. Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a
tax.
D. No acceptance of any payment by the township shall be construed as a
release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the township may
have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this
chapter or for the performance of any other obligation of the
franchisee.
E. In the event any franchise fee payment or recomputation amount is not
made on or before the date specified herein, the franchisee shall pay
additional compensation and interest charges computed from such due
date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of
the township's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid
amount is owed.
F. The franchise fee and any other costs assessed by the township against
a franchisee shall be paid quarterly to the township and shall
commence as of the effective date of the franchise, unless otherwise
agreed in the franchise agreement. The township shall be furnished at
the time of each payment with a statement verified by the franchisee's
§ 53-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 53-45
1:83
general manager reflecting the total amount of semiannual gross
revenues for the payment period. Quarterly payments shall be made to
the township no later than 45 days of March 30, June 30 and September
30 and within 60 days of December 31. Quarterly computation dates are
the last days of the months of March, June, September and December.
If requested by the township, an annual statement of gross revenues
shall be furnished to the township by an independent, certified public
accountant approved by the township. The franchisee shall provide an
annual complete audit statement for each calendar year within 90 days
from the end of that calendar year.
G. The township shall have the right to inspect and copy, subject to the
provisions regarding proprietary information in § 53-35 of this chapter,
the franchisee's records and the right to audit and to recompute any
amounts determined to be payable under this chapter for a period of
three years from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of
the township unless the audit discloses an underpayment in excess of
3%, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the franchisee
as a cost incidental to the enforcement of the franchise. Any additional
amounts due to the township as a result of the audit shall be paid within
30 days following written notice to the franchisee by the township of
the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report,
unless written notice of disagreement is filed by the franchisee with the
township within such time period.
H. The franchisee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records in such a
manner as to enable the Board to determine the cost of assets of the
franchisee which are used in providing broadband services within the
township.
I. To the extent imposition of the franchise fee as enumerated in this
section is expressly prohibited by controlling state or federal law, the
township shall be paid by the franchisee, or other applicable user of the
public right-of-way, an impact fee in the amount as set from time to time
by resolution of the Board of Supervisors.

A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, hold harmless
and defend the township, its officials, boards, commissions, commissioners,
agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action,
proceedings and judgments for damages or equitable relief arising out
of the construction, maintenance or operation of its broadband system,
the conduct of the franchisee's business in the township, or in any way
arising out of the franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise granted
hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or a franchise agreement.
This provision includes, but is not limited to, the township's reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or
proceeding; and claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by
the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors
or franchisees of programs to be delivered by the broadband system.
§ 53-51. Indemnification for Cable Act claims.
A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the township, and in its capacity as such, the officers, agents
and employees thereof, from and against any and all claims, suits, actions,
liability and judgments for damages or otherwise subject to Section 638 of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 558, arising out of or alleged to arise out of the
installation, construction, operation or maintenance of its system, including
but not limited to any claim against the franchisee for invasion of the right
of privacy, defamation of any person, firm or corporation, or the violation
or infringement of any copyright, trade mark, trade name, service mark or
patent, or of any other right of any person, firm or corporation. Nothing
herein shall prohibit the township from participating in the defense of any
litigation by its own counsel at its own cost and expense.
§ 53-52. No limit of liability.
Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the
township shall be construed to limit the liability of the franchisee for

ARTICLE XIII
Enforcement Remedies
§ 53-53. Violations and penalties; additional remedies.
§ 53-54. Determination of appropriate remedies.
In determining which remedy or remedies are appropriate, the township
shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person or
persons bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy
required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as
the township determines are appropriate to the public interest.
A. In addition to any other remedies available under this chapter or at law
or equity, the township may apply any one or a combination of the
following remedies in the event a franchisee materially violates this
chapter, its franchise agreement or applicable state or federal law:
(1) Impose liquidated damages in the amount of $250 per violation
which, if unpaid, shall be lienable by the township as a municipal
claim. Each day that a violation continues shall be separate
violation for which a separate fine may be imposed. The franchisee
shall pay all fines within 30 days. Payment of such fines by the
franchisee will not relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply
with the requirements of this franchise.
(2) In addition to or instead of any other remedy, seek legal or
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) Impose penalties available under state and local law for violation of
township ordinances.
B. Except as otherwise provided hereunder, prior to applying one or more
of the remedies provided in this section, the Township Manager shall
provide notice to the franchisee identifying the specific nature of the
violation. The franchisee shall, within 30 days, cure the violation, unless
the Township Manager determines that the violation cannot be
reasonably cured within such period. In the event that the violation is
not corrected within 30 days or such longer period determined by the
Township Manager, the township may proceed to apply the remedies
provided in this section as may be appropriate under the
circumstances.

ARTICLE XIV
Transfers
§ 53-55. Township approval required.
No transfer shall occur without prior approval of the township.
§ 53-56. Application.
An application for a transfer shall provide complete information on the
proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical and
other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the
transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the information
required in § 53-12C of this chapter shall be provided with respect to the
proposed transferee. Within 30 days of receiving an application for transfer,
the township shall notify the franchisee of the information it requires to
make the determination in § 53-57 of this chapter, and shall take action in
that application within 120 days after receiving the requested information.
§ 53-57. Determination by township.
In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject
to conditions an application for a transfer of a franchise, the township shall
consider the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee
to operate the system; whether the incumbent operator is in compliance
with its franchise agreement and this chapter and, if not, the proposed
transferee's commitment to cure such noncompliance; whether the
transferee owns or controls any other broadband system in the township, or
whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition
in the delivery of broadband service in the township; and whether operation
by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect
subscribers, the township's interest under this chapter, the franchise
agreement, or other applicable law, or make it less likely that the future
cable- and telecommunications-related needs and interests of the
community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost. The township reserves
the right to review the purchase price of any transfer or assignment of a
broadband system. Any negotiated sale value which the township deems
unreasonable will not be considered in the rate base for any subsequent
request for rate increases, if permitted by applicable law.
§ 53-58. Transferee's agreement.
No application for a transfer of a franchise shall be granted unless the
transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of this
chapter and the franchise agreement, and that it will assume the obligations
and liabilities known and unknown of the previous franchisee under this
chapter and the franchise agreement.
§ 53-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 53-59
1:89
§ 53-59. Approval does not constitute waiver.
Approval by the township of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute
a waiver or release of any of the rights of the township under this chapter
or the franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the
transfer.
§ 53-60. Processing fee.
As a condition of considering a transfer, the township may impose a fee
upon the transferee to cover its estimated out-of-pocket expenses in
considering the application for transfer of a franchise. Any amount collected
in excess of the estimated amount shall be returned to the transferee.
§ 53-59 WESTTOWN CODE § 53-60
1:90
ARTICLE XV
Revocation or Termination of Franchise
§ 53-61. Basis for revocation.
A franchise may be revoked by the township for a franchisee's failure to
construct, operate or maintain the broadband system as required by this
chapter or the franchise agreement, for defrauding or attempting to defraud
the township or subscribers, if the franchise is declared bankrupt, or for any
other material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise
agreement. To invoke the provisions of this section, the township shall give
the franchisee written notice of the default in its performance. If, within
60 calendar days following such written notice from the township, the
franchisee has not taken corrective action or corrective action is not being
actively and expeditiously pursued to the satisfaction of the township, the
township may give written notice to the franchisee of its intent to revoke
the franchise, stating its reasons; provided that no opportunity to cure shall
be provided where the franchisee has defrauded or attempted to defraud
the township or its subscribers, or in the event the franchisee is declared
bankrupt. In the case of a fraud or attempted fraud, the franchise may be
revoked after the hearing required under § 53-62; revocation for bankruptcy
shall be governed by § 53-63.
§ 53-62. Revocation procedure.
Prior to revoking a franchise, the township shall hold a public hearing,
upon 30 calendar days' notice, at which time the franchisee and the public
shall be given an opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing,
the township may determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the
information presented at the hearing, and other information of record. If the
township determines to revoke a franchise, it shall issue a written decision
setting forth the reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be
transmitted to the franchisee.
§ 53-63. Revocation after bankruptcy.
Any franchise may, at the option of the township following a public hearing
before the township, be revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment
for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee
to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other
action or proceeding, unless within that one-hundred-twenty-day period:
A. Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
B. Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the terms
and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and has
executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction,
assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
chapter and the franchise agreement, and such other conditions as may
be established or as are required pursuant to Article XIV.
§ 53-61 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 53-64
1:91
§ 53-64. Revocation after foreclosure.
In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities,
equipment or property of a franchisee, the township may revoke the
franchise, following a public hearing before the township, by serving notice
on the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event the
franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and
will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
§ 53-65. Rights on revocation.
If the township revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a franchisee
abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to its
subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:
§ 53-66. Automatic forfeiture.
Notwithstanding § 53-62, where the township has issued a franchise
specifically conditioned in the franchise agreement upon the completion
of construction, system upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified
date, failure of the franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or
to comply with such other specific obligation as required, will result in the
automatic forfeiture of the franchise without further action by the township
where it is so provided in the franchise agreement, unless the township, at
its discretion and for good cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an
extension of time.
A. The township has approved the transfer of the franchise to the
successful bidder; and
B. The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the township to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement and this chapter, and such other conditions as may be
established or as are required pursuant to Article XIV.
A. The township may require the former franchisee to remove its facilities
and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the
township may have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or
surety's expense.
B. In the event of revocation, the township, by resolution, may acquire
ownership of the broadband system at an equitable price.
C. If a broadband system is abandoned by a franchisee or the franchisee
fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers or otherwise
terminates the franchise, the ownership of all portions of the broadband
system in public rights-of-way shall revert to the township and the
township may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the
system.

A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, discharge from employment or
discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms, conditions or
privileges of employment because of race, color, religion, national origin,
sex or age. The franchisee shall comply with federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same
may be from time to time amended.
§ 53-69. Subscriber privacy.
A franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy of all subscribers pursuant
to the provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551. A

by Ord. No. 2001-5; 11-18-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-2]
A. Between the dates of May 1 and September 30 of any year, no person,
firm, corporation or other entity owning or occupying any land within
the Township of Westtown shall allow any grass, weeds or other
vegetation whatsoever, which is not normally considered edible or
planted and maintained for some useful or ornamental purpose, to grow
or remain upon such land uncontrolled, to cause any unpleasant or
obnoxious odor, to conceal any filthy deposit, to provide a place for the
accumulation of garbage or rubbish, to produce any obnoxious pollen or
seed, or to provide a breeding place for insects. Any such grass, weeds
or vegetation growing upon any land in the Township in violation of the
provisions of this section is hereby declared to be a nuisance and
detrimental to the health, safety, cleanliness, comfort and general
welfare of the citizens of the Township.
B. Bamboo is a group of perennial evergreens in the true grass family
(Poaceae) and are often called "tree" grasses because of their large,
woody, branched stems. Certain of the more than 1,450 species of
bamboo can be invasive and can grow to 40 feet in height and have
been planted next to public roadways in the Township. During wind,
rain and/or snow storm events, the stalks of the bamboo plants bend
and can block portions of public roads, cause a hazard to highway
traffic and impair the use and maintenance of the roads. The Board of
Supervisors has, therefore, determined that bamboo species, including,
but not limited to, Bambuseae, Phyllostachys and Pseudosasa, including
Common Bamboo, Golden Bamboo and Arrow Bamboo, shall not be
planted, maintained or otherwise permitted to exist within 40 feet of
the edge of pavement or the traveled portion of any public roadway in
the Township. All bamboo located on any property and within 40 feet of
the edge of pavement or the traveled portion of a public road is hereby
declared to be a nuisance.
A. The owner of any premises which is vacant or occupied by the owner
and the occupant of any premises occupied by other than the owner
thereof shall remove, trim, cut or otherwise control all grass, weeds or
other vegetation growing or remaining upon such owned or occupied

§ 54-3. Notice; failure to comply; work to be done by Township.

The Supervisors of the Township or their duly authorized agents are hereby
authorized to give notice by personal service or by United States mail
directed to the last known address of the owner or occupant, as the case
may be, of any lands whereon bamboo, grass, weeds or other vegetation
is growing or remaining in violation of the provisions of §§ 54-1 and 54-2
of this chapter and directing such occupant or owner to remove, mow, cut
or trim such bamboo, grass, weeds or vegetation so as to conform to the
requirements of this chapter. The owner or occupant shall conform to the
directions of the notice within five days after the issuance thereof. In the
event that any person, firm, corporation or other entity so notified shall
neglect, fail or refuse to comply with such notice within the period of time
stated therein, the Township or its authorized agents may remove, trim, cut
or mow such bamboo, grass, weeds or other vegetation, and the cost of such
removal, trimming, cutting or mowing, together with the additional penalty
provided by law, may be collected by the Township from such person, firm,
corporation or other entity in the manner provided by law, including the
placing of a municipal lien on the offending property.
§ 54-4. Violations and penalties.
Any person who violates or permits a violation of this chapter shall, upon
conviction in a summary proceeding brought before a District Justice under
the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, be guilty of a summary
offense and shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000, plus
costs of prosecution. In default of payment thereof, the defendant may be
sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days. Each day or
portion thereof that such violation continues or is permitted to continue
shall constitute a separate offense, and each section of this chapter that is
violated shall also constitute a separate offense.

violation of the prohibition set forth in § 54-1B of this chapter shall

grant additional time for the completion of the work. Where the Township
Engineer determines that the extension of time will require a substantial
modification of the runoff and erosion control plan by the Soil and Water
Conservation District, any extension of a permit shall be subject to approval
of such revised plans in accordance with the applicable procedure of this
chapter.
§ 80-13. Performance bond.

in the permit within the time specified, or within any extension thereof
granted by the Township Engineer, in the amount of the total estimated cost
of all control measures and the cost of safeguards for adjoining properties.
Said bond may be combined with a bond filed under Chapter 149,
Subdivision and Land Development. Each bond shall be maintained and
renewed annually and shall be executed by a surety to a guaranty company
qualified to transact business in the state.
A. Failure to carry out the control measures described in the application at
the appropriate times as specified in the applicable time schedule or

structure and as though each thereof had a direct and separate
connection to the sewer system.
B. Industrial waste:
(1) In the event the Township consents to accept industrial waste into
the sewer system, charges will be made for all waste having total
suspended solids and biochemical oxygen demand in excess of the
following concentrations:
(a) Suspended solids: 3 parts per million.
(b) BOD: 250 parts per million.
(2) The total charge for the total volume of waste having
concentrations in excess of the foregoing shalt be determined in
accordance with the following formula:
Total charge:
Q + (0.001 Q (BOD in pps -250) + (0.001 A (ss in ppm -300))
Where:
Q = Metered quantity charge
BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand
ss = Suspended solids
ppm = Part per million
A. Methods of measuring volume.
(1) Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the water
supplier discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into
the sewer system, the volume of water used, as determined from
meter readings made by or made available to the Township, shall
be used in computing the sewer rentals.
§ 132-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-5
1:155
(2) In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to
or other than from the water supplier and discharge sanitary
sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, those
persons may provide a meter on such additional or other sources of
supply. The total amount of water used as shown by these meter
readings will be used in computing the sewer rentals. If no such
meter is installed, the Sewer Collection Agent shall estimate the
total amount of water used for the purpose of determining the
sewer rentals. [Amended 1-4-1993 by Ord. No. 93-1]
(3) In cases where persons use water from the water supplier and/or
from any other source such that all or any part of the water so used
is not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of water used
to determine the sewer rentals shall be computed by one of the
following methods:
(a) By placing a meter or measuring device on the sewer
connection. The readings from this meter or measuring device
shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.
(b) By placing a meter or measuring device on the effluent not
discharging into the sewer system. The reading from this
meter or measuring device will then be deducted from the total
water meter readings and the remainder will be used in
computing the sewer rentals.
(c) When, in the opinion of the Sewer Collection Agent, it is not
desirable or not practical to install devices to continuously
determine the quantity of water not discharged to the sewer
system, the sewer manager will determine in such manner and
by such method as he/she may prescribe the percentage of
metered water discharged into the sewer system and the
quantity of water used to compute the sewer rentals shall be
the percentage so determined of the quality measured by the
water meter or meters. Any dispute as to the estimated amount
shall be submitted to the Township after notice of the estimate,
whose decision on the matter shall be final for the current
calendar year. [Amended 1-4-1993 by Ord. No. 93-1]
B. Measuring devices. All meters or measuring devices not provided by
the water supplier, but otherwise used under the provisions of this
article, may be furnished and installed by the Township at the expense
of the property owner and shall be owned by and under the control of
the Township and may be tested, inspected or repaired by the Township
employees whenever deemed necessary. The owner of the property
upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for
its maintenance and safekeeping and all repairs thereto shall be made
by the Township at the property owner's expense, whether such repairs
are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes. Bills for

C. Meter reading. The Township shall be responsible for the reading of all
meters or measuring devices, unless such readings are otherwise made
available to the Township by the water supplier, and they shall be made
available to Township employees for meter reading at any reasonable
time.
A. No person shall discharge into the sewer system any exhaust steam or
any oils, tar, grease, gas, benzine or other combustible gases or liquids,
or any garbage (unless treated in an approved manner), offal, insoluble

F. Tank truck or hauled waste discharges shall be subject to rates and
charges in accordance with a schedule established by the Township, as
amended from time to time.
A. Any user discharging wastewater to the sewerage system defined as
extra-strength wastewater in this article or as revised in such
resolutions as the Township or West Goshen Township in the case where
the user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system
shall adopt from time to time shall pay the surcharge established in this
Chapter or as amended by resolution of the Board of Supervisors. The
effective date of any change in definitions or fees shall be stated in all
such resolutions.
B. No user shall discharge into the sewerage system any extra-strength
wastewater without a written permit from the Township providing for
sampling and the payment of a surcharge to the Township or West
Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system), in accordance with the formulas
set forth in the current pretreatment chapter. The Township and West
Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system) shall retain and have the right at
any time to give notice to the industrial user that extra-strength
discharges will no longer be accepted.
C. The surcharge computations shall be based on the wastewater sample
analyses for the most recent complete calendar quarter. Surcharges
shall be based on wastewater sample analyses (or, in the absence
thereof, on the Township estimates) for the calendar quarter which they

§ 132-34. Prohibitions and restrictions on industrial users.
apply. The surcharge formulas are independent of each other and
measure different characteristics of the same wastewater. Surcharges
measured by each formula are cumulative.
D. The surcharge billings shall be in addition to any other quarterly sewer
use charge paid by the user to the Township. Payment of a surcharge
shall not relieve the user of its obligation to comply with the local
loading limits promulgated by resolution in § 132-34B of this article.
A. Permit required for discharge of industrial wastewater. Prior to the
discharge of any industrial waste or other waste not defined as sanitary
sewage into the sewerage system, the discharger shall first obtain an
industrial wastewater discharge permit issued by the Township.
B. Local discharge limits.
(1) The Township shall by resolution adopted by the Township's Board
of Supervisors establish and promulgate local discharge limits
regulating the discharge of specific pollutants to the sewerage
system by industrial users. Local discharge limits may be
established for any substance which is discharged, or likely to be
discharged, to the sewerage system. Such limits shall be calculated
as mandated by the Pretreatment Coordinator and the Engineer,
and may be amended from time to time by the control authority.
(2) Local discharge limits may limit concentration, mass or a
combination of the two.
(3) The procedure for the calculation of local discharge limits shall be
as recommended by the EPA.
(4) Local discharge limits shall be calculated to prevent interference;
pass-through; the discharge of toxic materials in toxic amounts;
threats to worker health and safety; physical, chemical or
biological damage to the sewerage system; and noncompliance
with the Township's NPDES permit or the West Goshen Township
Sewer Authority's NPDES permit (in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system).
(5) Local discharge limits applicable to industrial users shall be
adopted by resolution of the Township. Local discharge limits
applicable to all industrial users shall be included in all industrial
waste discharge permits.
(6) Discharging any pollutant in excess of a local discharge limit
established for that pollutant shall be a violation of this article.
(7) The Pretreatment Coordinator may develop best management
practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in individual wastewater

discharge permits, to implement local limits and the requirements
of § 132-31. [Added 1-19-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-1]
A. All industrial users shall provide and maintain at their own expense
facilities adequate to prevent an accidental discharge or slug load of
any substance stored or used at the industrial user's facilities that, if
discharged into the sewerage system, will violate any of the provisions
of §§ 132-31 and 132-34 of this article. Slug control plans shall be
submitted, as requested, to both the Township and West Goshen
Township in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen
Township sewerage system, detailing the facility plans and operating
procedures to be utilized by the industrial user for this protection. Slug
control plans shall contain, at a minimum, the following information, in
addition to such additional data as shall be required from time to time
by the Pretreatment Coordinator:
(1) A description of discharge practices, including nonroutine
discharges, and a complete description of stored chemicals.
(2) Procedures for immediately notifying the Pretreatment
Coordinator and the municipality to whose sewer collection system
the industrial user is connected of accidental discharges and slug
loads into the sewerage system.
(3) Procedures to prevent adverse impacts from such discharges and
procedures to prevent reoccurrence of all such discharges.
B. An industrial user proposing to connect to the sewerage system after
the effective date of this article shall submit a copy of its slug control
plan to the Township and West Goshen Township in the case where the
user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system and to
the Pretreatment Coordinator for approval, or demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Pretreatment Coordinator they are not needed,
before connection to the sewerage system. Review of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the
responsibility to modify the industrial user's facility as necessary to
meet the requirements of this article.
C. In the case of an accidental discharge or slug load to the sewerage
system of any pollutant, the industrial user shall immediately notify by
telephone both the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial
user is connected and the Pretreatment Coordinator of the incident.
The notification shall include information regarding the location of the
discharge, the kind of pollutants involved, the concentration and
volume of the discharge and corrective actions planned or taken.
[Amended 1-19-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-1]
D. Within five days following an accidental discharge or slug load, unless
waived by the Pretreatment Coordinator, the industrial user shall

If the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, located in 40 CFR
Chapter 1, Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471, as amended from time to
time, for any industrial user are more stringent than limitations imposed
under this article for industrial users in that subcategory, then the
pretreatment standards shall apply and are hereby incorporated in this
article. The Township shall notify all affected industrial users of the
applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12. If an industrial
user subject to a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not
previously submitted an application for an industrial waste discharge
permit, the industrial user shall apply for a permit within 90 days of the
promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
§ 132-37. Dilution prohibition.
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment
standard or pretreatment requirement, no industrial user shall increase the
use of process water or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance
with a pretreatment standard or requirement. The Township may impose
mass limitations on industrial users in cases where the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
§ 132-38. State requirements.
State requirements and limitations on industrial wastewater discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations or those established and imposed in this
article.
submit to the municipality to whose sewer system the industrial user
is connected and to the Pretreatment Coordinator a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences.
Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any liability on
account thereof. [Amended 1-19-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-1]
E. A notice shall be permanently posted by each industrial user on a
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of an accidental discharge or slug load. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause such an accidental discharge
to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
[Amended 1-19-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-1]

A. General.
(1) No industrial users shall connect to or discharge wastewater to the
sewerage system without an industrial waste discharge permit.
(2) Upon written application to the Township, but prior to discharge,
the Pretreatment Coordinator may determine that industrial users
which are not significant industrial users or do not have industrial
wastewater do not require an industrial waste discharge permit
and may discharge industrial wastewater to the sewerage system,
but are required to comply with all other provisions of this article.
If an industrial user makes changes to the processes, flow,
wastewater concentration, wastewater characteristics or other
operations reported in the most recent industrial waste discharge
questionnaire filed by the industrial user with the Township, and
those changes result in its meeting the definition of an industrial
user, the industrial user shall immediately upon becoming aware
that such a change has occurred, or 90 days prior to such a change
if it is planned, notify in writing both the Township and West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system and, if the application and
proposed discharge are in compliance with this article, obtain an
industrial waste discharge permit, which shall be issued within 90
days of submission of the permit application.
(3) Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted
an application for an industrial waste discharge permit, the user
shall, within 90 days after the promulgation of the applicable
National Categorical Pretreatment Standard:
(a) Obtain an industrial waste discharge permit; and

(b) No industrial waste discharge permit shall be issued to an
industrial user whose discharge of materials to sewers,
whether shown upon the application or determined after
inspection and testing conducted by the Township or West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to
the West Goshen Township sewerage system, is not in
conformance with federal, state or the Township's ordinances
and resolutions. If an application is denied, the Township shall
state in writing the reason or reasons for denial, and said
written communication shall be delivered to the applicant, and
if applicable, to the municipality to whose sewer system the
industrial user is proposing to connect.
(5) If the Township denies an application for an industrial waste

written request for the review. The control authority's written
decision shall be provided to the industrial user within 20 days of
the close of the public hearing or hearings and shall be final.
(6) If, based on the characteristics of the industrial user's waste
discharge, additional pretreatment and/or operation and
maintenance procedures are required to meet any Township,
municipal, state or federal pretreatment standards, the industrial
user shall submit to the Township and West Goshen Township (in
the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system) prior to issuance of the industrial waste
discharge permit the shortest, reasonable schedule by which the
industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment. The
Township and West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system) shall
include a compliance schedule acceptable to the Township and/or
West Goshen Township as the case may be, in the user's industrial
waste discharge permit, which shall be conditional upon
compliance with timely implementation of the additional
pretreatment required. The following conditions shall apply to this
schedule:
(a) The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the industrial user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (e.g., hiring an engineer,
completing preliminary plans, completing final plans,
executing contract for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction, etc.).
(b) No increment shall exceed nine months.
(c) Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit to
both the Pretreatment Coordinator and the municipality to
whose sewer system it is connected a written report, including,
as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment
of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on
which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the
§ 132-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-40
1:187
reason for delay and the steps being taken by the industrial
user to return the construction and implementation to the
schedule established. In no event shall more than three months
elapse between such progress reports to the Pretreatment
Coordinator and the municipality to whose sewer system it is
connected.
C. Permit action. A permit issued under this section may be modified,
revoked and reissued or terminated for good cause, including but not
limited to the following:

E. Permit duration and permit fees.
§ 132-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-40
1:189
(1) Industrial waste discharge permits shall be issued for an initial oneyear
period and shall expire at the end of that one-year period
unless the Township or West Goshen Township in the case where
the user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage
system elects to revoke the permit on or before its expiration. Upon
the user's payment of the requisite permit fee to the Township,
renewal permits shall be issued for a period not to exceed five years
upon written application of the permittee made at least 60 days
prior to the permit's expiration. Subsequent permits may be issued
upon payment to the Township of the requisite fee for up to fiveyear
periods upon prior written application made to the Township
at least 90 days before the permit's scheduled expiration. The
terms and conditions of the permit shall be subject to modification
by the Township or West Goshen Township in the case where the
user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system
during the term of the permit. The industrial user shall be informed
of any proposed changes in its permit at least 30 days prior to the
effective date of the change. However, the Township or West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system shall use their best efforts
to inform the industrial user of such change at least 60 days prior
to the effective date of the change, but its/their failure to do so shall
not preclude or delay implementation of the required change. In
the event that such changes require major changes in pretreatment
by the industrial user, and the industrial user's failure to comply
with the amended discharge requirements does not itself or with
other failures to comply put the Township or West Goshen
Township in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system in substantial danger of
violating any agreement, permit, regulation, ordinance or law, then
the Pretreatment Coordinator may grant the industrial user a
period not to exceed six months from the date otherwise required
for compliance within which to effect such changes to its
pretreatment facilities as are necessary to comply with the permit's
terms and conditions. Upon demonstration of justifiable cause
proven by the permittee within the said six-month period, the
Pretreatment Coordinator may extend the date otherwise required
for compliance for such additional reasonable period of time as he/
she determines necessary. No extensions shall be considered or
granted unless the industrial user makes written request for a time
extension and submits to the Township and West Goshen Township
in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen
Township sewerage system an implementation schedule acceptable
to the Township and such municipality contemporaneously with the
extension request.
(2) Permit fees and renewal fees shall be established by resolution
adopted and amended from time to time by the control authority
and shall include but not necessarily be limited to the following: an
application review fee, an administrative fee, a sampling fee, an
§ 132-40 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-40
1:190
§ 132-41. Reporting requirements for industrial users.
analytical costs fee, any surcharges and/or fines and any
miscellaneous expenses incurred from the purchase or utilization
of any sampling apparatus and/or activities.
F. Permit transfer. Industrial waste discharge permits are issued to a
specific industrial user for a specific operation. An industrial waste
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new
owner, new user, different premises, different facilities or a new or
changed operation without the approval of the Township and West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system. The succeeding owner or industrial
user shall file a new application and, until permit or modification
thereof is issued, shall comply with the terms and conditions of the
existing industrial waste discharge permit and such additional permit
conditions as the Township and such municipality shall require.
G. Waste characteristic change. Any industrial user who plans or becomes
aware of a change in the method of operation or in the pretreatment
facilities which will increase the concentration of pollutants which are
regulated by this article or the volume of wastewater discharged to the
sewerage system shall notify the Township and West Goshen Township
in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system of the change at least 90 days prior to such change. If
required by the Township or the municipality, the industrial user shall
apply for an industrial waste discharge permit that reflects the
proposed changes. The new industrial waste discharge permit will be
subject to a fee to reimburse the Township and such municipality for all
expenses incurred as a result of the processing of the permit and permit
application. Approval or denial of a new industrial waste discharge
permit shall be regulated by the procedures established hereunder for
the issuance of an original permit.
H. Files. The Township shall maintain files in which copies of all industrial
waste discharge permits, revisions thereto, and supporting data will be
filed for reference. Files shall be maintained for a period of at least five
years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of
any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or when
requested by the EPA.
A. Compliance date report under National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case
of a new source, following commencement of the introduction of
wastewater into the sewerage system, any industrial user subject to
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit to the
Township and West Goshen Township in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system a written
report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the
discharge from the regulated process which are limited by categorical
§ 132-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-41
1:191
standards, and the average and maximum daily flow from these process
units in the user's facility which are limited by such categorical
standards. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical
standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operations and maintenance and/or pretreatment are
scheduled to bring the industrial user into compliance with the
applicable categorical standards. This statement shall be signed by
an authorized representative of the user and, when requested by the
Township, certified by a qualified professional.
B. Periodic compliance reports. [Amended 1-19-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-1]
(1) Each industrial user shall submit to the Township and the
municipality to whose sewer system it is connected, during the
months of April, July, October and January, or by such date as
otherwise specified in the industrial users industrial waste
discharge permit or otherwise by the Township, a complete and
accurate written report, in form and content as prescribed by the
Township, indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in
the discharge during the reporting period which are regulated by
the industrial waste discharge permit. All monitoring data obtained
for purposes of determining compliance with the industrial waste
discharge permit by certified analytical techniques must be
reported by the industrial user. In addition, this report, where
applicable, shall include a record of all daily flows which, during
the reporting period, exceeded the maximum daily flow listed in the
industrial users industrial waste discharge permit. In cases where
the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best
management practice (BMP) or pollution-prevention alternative,
the user must submit documentation required by the Pretreatment
Coordinator or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user. All periodic compliance reports
shall also contain the following certification statement signed by
the authorized representative of the user:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a procedure designed to assure that qualified
personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the facilities proposed to be connected to the sewerage
system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware
that there are significant penalties for submitting false
information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations relating to unsworn falsifications.

1:192
(2) A facility determined to be a nonsignificant categorical industrial
user by the Pretreatment Coordinator must annually submit the
following certification statement signed by the authorized
representative of the user. This certification must accompany an
alternative report required by the Pretreatment Coordinator:
Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible
for managing compliance with categorical Pretreatment standards
under 40 CFR, I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
belief that during the period from _______ to ______ [insert dates]:
(a) The facility described as [facility name] met the definition of
nonsignificant categorical industrial user as per § 132-30;
(b) The facility complied with all applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements during this reporting period; and
(c) The facility never discharged more than 100 gallons of total
categorical wastewater on any given day during this reporting
period.
This compliance certification is based on the following
information.
(3) The Township may impose mass limitations where the imposition of
mass limitations is appropriate. In such cases, the periodic
compliance report required by Subsection B(1) shall state the mass
of pollutants regulated in the industrial user's discharge permit to
the sewerage system. These reports shall contain the results of
sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the
nature and concentration, or, where requested by the Township,
production and mass of pollutants contained therein, which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of
monitoring shall be prescribed in the industrial users industrial
waste discharge permit. All sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the EPA
pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136,
and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures
approved by the EPA.
(4) For categorical industries that have mass limits as categorical
standards, the Township may specify equivalent concentrations to
regulate the strength of the industrial user's discharge. If
concentration limits are regulated in lieu of mass discharge limits,
the industrial user must provide the Township and West Goshen
Township (in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system) with the following information
as part of each written compliance report:
(a) For the reporting period, the rate of production of the process
for which categorical standards have been established.
§ 132-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-41
1:193
(b) The average wastewater flow rate generated by the regulated
production activity for the reporting period.
(c) Thirty days' notice of any anticipated change in production.
(5) The industrial wastewater discharged into the sewerage system
shall be sampled and analyzed by and at the expense of the
industrial user, and copies of the original laboratory reports listing
the results of the analyses and the analytical methods used shall be
submitted to the Pretreatment Coordinator.
(6) Except as indicated in Subsection B(7) below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
Township. Regardless of sampling technique used the samples
must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including
appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis
as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics
and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by
the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA
methodologies may be authorized by the Township, as appropriate.
In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
(7) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples
must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Pretreatment Coordinator may
authorize a lower minimum. For periodic compliance reporting the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.
(8) Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(9) All records and information resulting from the monitoring activities
required by the industrial waste discharge permit, any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities undertaken independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with established best management
practices shall be retained by the industrial user for at least five
§ 132-41 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-41
1:194
§ 132-42. Monitoring facilities.
years. This period of retention shall be extended during the course
of any unresolved litigation regarding the industrial user or the
Township or when requested by either the Township or the EPA.
C. Baseline monitoring report.
(1) Where an industrial user, subject to a newly promulgated National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, has not previously submitted
the baseline monitoring information required by 40 CFR 403.12(b),
as from time to time amended, the industrial user shall, within 180
days after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, provide this information to the Township
and West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system). The
report shall include all items required by 40 CFR 403.12(b).
(2) A new source, or an industrial user proposing to discharge wastes
into the sewerage system that is subject to a National Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, shall submit to the Township and West
Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system) the baseline monitoring
report required by 40 CFR 403.12(b) at least 90 days prior to
commencement of discharge from the regulated process or facility.
D. Noncompliance discharge report. [Amended 1-19-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-1]
(1) If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of
this article, an applicable pretreatment standard or the industrial
users industrial waste discharge permit, the industrial user shall
notify the Pretreatment Coordinator and municipality to whose
sewer system the industrial user is connected within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also
repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the
repeat analysis to the Pretreatment Coordinator and to such
municipality within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
(2) Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the Township
performs sampling at the users between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the
Township receives the results of this sampling, or if the Township
has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial
user.
A. When requested by the Township or West Goshen Township in the case
where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage
system, all industrial users shall provide and operate, at their own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurements of its industrial waste discharge. The monitoring facility
§ 132-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-42
1:195
§ 132-43. Inspection and sampling.
The Township and West Goshen Township in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system may inspect the
facilities of any industrial user. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the Township or its
representative, or West Goshen Township in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system or its
representatives, as a condition of the permit issued by the Township
authorizing any discharge to the sewerage system, ready access at all
reasonable times, and in the event of emergency situations posing an
immediate threat to the sewerage system, to all parts of the premises,
buildings and facilities for the purpose of inspection, sampling records
examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The
Township, such municipality and the EPA shall have the right to set up
on the industrial user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
should normally be situated on the industrial user's premises, but the
Township or West Goshen Township in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system may, when
such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
industrial user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street
or sidewalk area, subject to the issuance of proper permits for such
purpose, and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or
parked vehicles.
B. The monitoring facility shall be constructed in accordance with plans
and specifications approved by the Township and West Goshen
Township in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen
Township sewerage system. There shall be ample room in or near such
facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for
analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the
expense of the industrial user. The facility shall be located as to be
accessible at all times to persons authorized by the Township or West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system. By obtaining an industrial waste
discharge permit, the industrial user consents to the entry upon its land
and facility and agrees to facilitate such entry by representatives of the
Township and such municipality, and further consents to the use of the
monitoring facility for observation, sampling and measuring of the
wastewater discharge at all times. Construction of the monitoring
facility shall be completed within 120 days following issuance of the
industrial waste discharge permit.
C. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facilities in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge. [Added 1-19-2010 by Ord. No.
2010-1]
§ 132-42 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-43
1:196
Where an industrial user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry onto their
premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Township, such municipality or the EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay.
§ 132-44. Pretreatment.
A. Industrial users shall provide necessary pretreatment and flowequalizing
facilities as required to comply with this article and shall
achieve compliance with all applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the
appropriate federal regulations, or as otherwise required by the
Township. Any industrial user required to pretreat or flow-equalize
wastewater to a level in compliance with the provisions of this article
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's sole
expense. Detailed plans and other materials and documents showing
the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted
to the Pretreatment Coordinator and West Goshen Township in the case
where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage
system for review before construction of the facility. The review of such
plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial
user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to
produce an effluent in compliance with the provisions of this article.
Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities, flow-equalizing
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be reviewed
and commented on by the Township and West Goshen Township in the
case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes.
B. The industrial user may allow a bypass, which does not cause
pretreatment standards to be violated, but only for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. If an industrial user knows in
advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior written notice to
the Pretreatment Coordinator and to the municipality to whose sewer
system it is connected at least 10 days before the date of the bypass.
The industrial user shall give oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that
exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Pretreatment
Coordinator and the municipality to whose sewer system it is connected
immediately after an unanticipated bypass incident is brought under
control, but in no event later than four hours from the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written report shall also
be provided to the Pretreatment Coordinator within five working days
of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written report shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause;
the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the
bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to
continue; and, the steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.

§ 132-45. Hazardous waste discharge.
§ 132-46. Confidential information.
C. The Township shall annually publish in the local daily newspaper of
largest circulation within the Township's service area a list of industrial
users serviced by the Township which were in significant
noncompliance with any applicable pretreatment standards or
pretreatment requirements during the preceding twelve-month period.
D. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards and
pretreatment requirements shall be made available to the Township,
West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system) and the EPA upon request.
E. The Township and West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is
connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system) shall have
access to all such pretreatment facilities and flow-equalizing facilities
as required by this article at all reasonable times for purposes of
inspection and testing, and in the event of an emergency posing a
threat to the sewerage system, at any time.
A. It shall be a violation of this article and the industrial user's discharge
permit for an industrial user to discharge any quantity of waste to the
sewerage system, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 261.1 et seq., Subparts A
through D, as from time to time amended. In the event of an accidental
discharge, the industrial user shall provide an immediate written
notification of such discharge, but in no event later than 4 hours from
the time the user becomes aware of or in the exercise of reasonable
prudence should have become aware of the discharge, to the Township,
to West Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system, to the EPA Region III Waste
Management Division Director and to the DEP. Failure to provide such
notice shall constitute a violation of this article.
B. The notification required by Subsection A shall include the name of the
hazardous waste as in 40 CFR, Chapter 1, Section 261.1 et seq.,
Subparts A through D, as from time to time amended, the EPA
hazardous waste number, the type of discharge (continuous, batch or
other), and a certification under penalties of perjury that the industrial
user has a program in place to reduce to compliance levels the volume
and toxicity of hazardous wastes illegally discharged to the sewerage
system. If the industrial user's discharge to the sewerage system
constitutes more than 100 kilograms of such waste, the notification
shall also include an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the waste and an estimation of the mass and concentration
of such constituents.
A. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits, notifications, monitoring
§ 132-44 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-46
1:198
§ 132-47. Measuring volumes of wastewater.
programs and inspections shall be available to the public or any
governmental agency upon written request unless the industrial user
specifically requests in writing and is able to demonstrate to the
Township's satisfaction that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets of the industrial user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a written report, those
portions of a report that have been accepted by the Township as
confidential shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available upon written request to governmental agencies
for uses related to this article, the NPDES permit, state disposal system
permits and/or the state or federal pretreatment programs; provided,
however, that such portions of any report shall be available for use by
the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person or industrial user furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.
C. When information accepted by the Township as confidential is
transmitted to any governmental agency by the Township, a written
notification to the industrial user shall be provided by the Township
listing the confidential information transmitted and the governmental
entity requesting the information.
A. The flow volume used to determine wastewater flows and surcharges
shall be specified in the industrial waste discharge permit and be based
on:
(1) Direct wastewater metering;
(2) Metered water use; or
(3) Such other method acceptable to the Township.
B. Both the Township and West Goshen Township in the case where the
user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system may,
in their discretion, require that each industrial user connected to its
sewer system which has been issued an industrial waste discharge
permit install, calibrate, maintain and use any meter or measuring
device specified therein at the industrial user's own expense. The
municipality which accepts the industrial waste shall be responsible for
the reading of all meters or measuring devices. The Township and West
Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected to the West
Goshen Township sewerage system shall have the absolute right, but
not the duty, of reading the meters, from time to time, at its discretion.
The meters and devices shall be made available for meter reading at
any reasonable time, and in the event of an emergency posing a threat
to the sewerage system, at any time.
§ 132-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-48
1:199
§ 132-48. Enforcement.
A. Immediate suspension of discharge presenting imminent danger.
(1) The Township and West Goshen Township in the case where the
user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system
shall order the immediate suspension of discharge of wastewater to
the sewer system when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion
of the Township or West Goshen Township, as the case may be, in
order to stop or prevent an actual or threatened discharge which
presents an imminent danger of harm to people, to the sewerage
system or to the environment, or interference ("dangerous
discharge").
(2) Any industrial user notified of an order to suspend shall comply
therewith immediately. In the event of a failure of the industrial
user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township
or West Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected
to the West Goshen Township sewerage system, shall take such
steps as it deems necessary to enforce compliance with the order to
effect the suspension of discharge of the industrial user's
wastewater into the sewerage system, including immediate
severance of the industrial user's sewer connection to the
Township's or to West Goshen Township's sewerage system. The
Township or West Goshen Township shall permit reinstatement of
the discharge upon satisfactory proof of the elimination of the
imminent and substantial danger referred to above. The industrial
user shall submit a detailed written report to the Township and
West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to
the West Goshen Township sewerage system) describing the causes
of the actual or threatened discharge and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence within 15 days of the date of the first
such discharge or threat of discharge. The Township and West
Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to the
West Goshen Township sewerage system) shall have the concurrent
right and power to suspend discharge by such industrial user to the
sewerage system and to enforce the requirements of this
subsection.
(3) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Township and
West Goshen Township (in the case where the user is connected to
the West Goshen Township sewerage system) from enforcing this
article, or any part hereof, or from enjoining and preventing the
discharge of any hazardous waste or any other discharge deemed
unlawful or dangerous to the sewerage system by any legal process
selected by the Township and West Goshen Township (in the case
where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system), including but not limited to an action or actions
at law or in equity for injunctive relief and damages, administrative
enforcement proceedings, criminal enforcement proceedings
authorized by any federal or state statute or law, or through any
§ 132-48 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-48
1:200
§ 132-49. Enabling regulations.
As a precondition to the Township's acceptance of sewage effluent
containing industrial wastewater from another municipality, each such
municipality connected to the sewerage system shall, within 90 days after
other authorized legal proceeding. All remedies of the Township
and West Goshen Township in the case where the user is connected
to the West Goshen Township sewerage system shall be cumulative.
B. Termination of service. Any user who violates any provision of this
article, any regulation promulgated by the Township pursuant to this
article or any enabling legislation, any resolution promulgated by the
Board of Supervisors pursuant to or related to this article, any
applicable state or federal regulations or an industrial waste discharge
permit or any condition thereof shall be subject, in addition to any civil
or criminal penalties which may be imposed, to severance of its sewer
connection to the sewerage system, termination of its sewage service
and revocation of its industrial waste discharge permit.
C. Notification of violation. Whenever the Township or West Goshen
Township in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen
Township sewerage system finds that the industrial user has violated or
is violating this article, an industrial waste discharge permit or any
prohibition, limitation, condition or requirements contained herein, or
has failed to timely provide the Township or West Goshen Township in
the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system with the information needed to accurately determine
compliance with any pretreatment standard or pretreatment
requirement, the Township or West Goshen Township in the case where
the user is connected to the West Goshen Township sewerage system,
or both, may serve upon such person or industrial user who is in
violation a written notice of violation. The notice may require a
response in the form of a plan, explanation, compliance schedule or
other appropriate response within a specified time period. Compliance
with any such requirement shall be mandatory.
D. Legal action by municipalities. If any industrial user violates the
provisions of this article, Township, federal or state pretreatment
standards or pretreatment requirements, its industrial waste discharge
permit, any prohibition, limitation, condition or requirements contained
therein or herein or any order issued by the Township or other
governmental authority having jurisdiction related to the sewerage
system or the sewer service of the Township or West Goshen Township
in the case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system, either the Township or West Goshen Township in the
case where the user is connected to the West Goshen Township
sewerage system, or both, may commence an action or actions at law or
in equity for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Court of
Common Pleas of Chester County, and may, in addition, take such other
enforcement action as provided for in this section.
§ 132-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-49
1:201
adoption of this article, enact regulations imposing the discharge
restrictions (and require compliance with industrial waste discharge
permits), charges, reporting and monitoring requirements no less stringent
than those set forth in this article on all users within its jurisdiction, and
establishing procedures for compliance with this article. Such requirement
shall be embodied in a written agreement between the Township and such
municipality. All such regulations so adopted shall be amended within 60
days, as necessary, to impose the same standards and requirements as
those imposed by the Township through amendment of this article. Such
municipality shall, upon adoption of the required regulations, give written
notice to all commercial and industrial dischargers connected to the
municipality's sewerage system of all of the regulatory compliance
requirements related to industrial waste discharge permits.
§ 132-50. Civil penalties for industrial users.
A. The Township may establish by resolution adopted by the Board of
Supervisors a recommended schedule of civil penalties which may be
imposed by the Township against any industrial user who violates a
provision of this article or its industrial waste discharge permit that is
in significant noncompliance or which fails to respond timely and
adequately to any notice of violation issued by the Township in
accordance with the Township's civil assessment policy. In assessing
such penalties, the Township shall provide the noncomplying industrial
user with the opportunity to show cause why a civil penalty pursuant to
§ 132-52 hereof should not be assessed. Notice shall be served upon the
industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by
the Township's Board of Supervisors, or a hearing officer designated by
the Board for that purpose. Notice of the hearing shall be served by the
Township's administrative staff upon the industrial user and any other
party in interest at least 10 days before the hearing by regular United
States Mail, postage prepaid.
B. In furtherance of any such proceeding, the Board or hearing officer, as
the case may be, shall have the following powers:
(1) Issue in the name of the Township notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings;
(2) Issue subpoenas and take the evidence; and
(3) Make findings of fact, conclusions of law and render a decision and
order, which may include the imposition of a civil penalty or such
other order as the Board shall direct.
C. Testimony at the hearing shall be under oath and recorded
stenographically. A transcript shall be made available to any party to
the proceeding upon payment of the charges therefor. All other
administrative costs of the proceedings, including but not limited to
stenographer attendance fees, advertising, postage and notices and
§ 132-49 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-50
1:202
§ 132-51. Injunctions against violations of pretreatment standards.
The Township may seek injunctive relief in a proceeding in equity for
the prevention, abatement or termination of any prohibited discharge to
the sewerage system, for a violation of any pretreatment standard or for
violation of any other provision of this article in any of the following
circumstance. In any such proceeding, the Township may seek to collect any
civil penalties assessed, or unpaid, pursuant to §§ 132-50 and 132-52 hereof.
§ 132-52. Violations and penalties.
similar costs, shall be paid for by the user, who shall deposit with its
request for hearing a deposit escrow fee of $1,000 from which the
administrative fees shall be paid. Any balance remaining after payment
of all such costs shall be returned to the user requesting the hearing.
A. A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent danger of
substantial harm to the sewerage system, Township personnel, the
environment or the public or imperils or results or may result in a
violation of any federal or state permits held by the Township or the
West Goshen Township Sewer Authority relating to the use, operation
and maintenance of the sewerage system.
B. A discharge from an industrial user presents an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the environment.
C. A discharge from an industrial user causes the Municipal Authority or
the West Goshen Township Sewer Authority to violate any condition of
their NPDES permit.
D. An industrial user has shown a lack of ability or intention to comply with
a pretreatment standard.
A. Fines to be established by Township and by municipalities. As a
precondition to the Township's acceptance of sewage effluent
containing industrial wastewater from another municipality, each
municipality that discharges or is connected to the sewerage system
shall, within 90 days of the adoption of this article, enact an ordinance
which provides that any industrial user who is found to have violated
the ordinance specified by § 132-49 hereof shall be liable to a fine of up
to $1,000, together with the costs of prosecution and the municipality's
reasonable attorney's fees, for each offense in a criminal enforcement
proceeding commenced before a District Justice. Each day on which a
violation shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and
distinct offense. Such requirement shall be embodied in a written
agreement between the Township and such municipality. In addition to
all other remedies and penalties provided for in this article, the
Township may commence and prosecute an enforcement action before
any District Justice for a violation of this article as provided for in this
section wherein the violator shall be subject to the fine, costs and fees
provided for herein; provided, however, that should any violation of this
§ 132-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-52
1:203
article constitute a violation of the Sewage Facilities Act,38 a District
Justice shall be authorized to impose a fine of up to $5,000, together
with the costs of prosecution and the municipality's reasonable
attorney's fees, for each such offense.
B. Action to enforce municipalities' ordinances applicable to any user.
Each municipality shall at the direction of the Township take any action
permitted by law or in equity to enforce any ordinance enacted
pursuant to §§ 132-49 or 132-52A of this article.
C. Civil penalties for violations by industrial users. To the extent that any
provisions of this article are enabled by the Pennsylvania Sewage
Facilities Act, Act of January 24, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1535, as amended,39
any industrial user who violates any substantive or procedural provision
of § 132-34 et seq. hereof or any term or condition of any industrial
waste discharge permit may, in addition to all other civil and criminal
penalties authorized by this article, be assessed a civil penalty of up to
$5,000 for each such violation, as is determined by the Township
depending upon the severity of the violation, pursuant to the
procedures and standards set forth in Section 13.1 of the Sewage
Facilities Act, 35 P.S. § 750.13a and 13b(b). In addition, the Township
may assess against and collect from such violator the cost of damages
caused by such violation and the cost of correcting the violation. Each
violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct
violation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a single operational upset
which gives rise to simultaneous violations shall be treated as a single
violation.
D. Uses of civil penalties collected by Township. Civil penalties collected
pursuant to this section shall be placed in a restricted account and shall
only be used for the repair of damage and any additional maintenance
needed or any additional costs imposed as a result of the violation for
which the penalty was imposed, to pay any penalties imposed upon the
Township by the federal or state governments for violation of
pretreatment standards, for the costs incurred by the Township to
investigate and take enforcement action that resulted in a penalty being
imposed and for the monitoring of discharges in a pretreatment
program. Funds remaining in the restricted account after the foregoing
uses have been met may be used for capital improvements to the
Township's sewerage system.

completed in shorter prescribed periods in order to facilitate
administration.
(2) Initial inspections may be conducted concurrent with the pumping
requirements of § 132-59A or § 132-59B, as applicable. However, if
the liquid depth in the initial treatment unit is above the unit's
outlet piping, the initial treatment unit must be pumped dry at the
time of inspection. Pumping may also be required at the time of
inspection for other conditions which would prevent a satisfactory
inspection where such conditions are identified by the maintenance
contractor and the requirement for pumping is verified by the
Township's authorized agent. [Amended 11-17-2014 by Ord. No.
2014-2]
(3) A written inspection report signed by the maintenance contractor
shall be furnished to the Township by the person owning the
property served by the on-lot sewage disposal system within 30

County Health Department and DEP standards within one year
prior to the effective date of this article. Copies of all approved
Chester County Health Department permit data, including plot
plan, as-built plot plan, design specifications, and installation
inspection reports must be submitted to the Township by the
property owner to qualify for a waiver from the initial
inspection requirements.
(b) A property owner has applied for a Chester County Health
Department permit to repair a malfunctioning on-lot sewage
disposal system but no repair was deemed possible by the
Health Department. Copies of all Chester County Health
Department documentation, including the permit application
form, soils testing field reports, and a written determination
from the Health Department that no repair is possible must be
submitted to the Township by the property owner to qualify for
a waiver from the initial inspection requirements. Any such
waiver will not absolve the property owner from the
§ 132-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 132-57
1:209
§ 132-58. Operation.
responsibility to maintain the on-lot sewage disposal system in
a manner to prevent malfunction, including frequent pumping,
water conservation, or any other means deemed acceptable by
the Chester County Health Department. The property owner
shall further assume an ongoing responsibility to revisit
options for repair of the on-lot sewage disposal system with the
Chester County Health Department at least annually in order
to determine whether any new technologies may have been
approved by DEP which would allow for permit issuance to
repair the on-lot sewage disposal system.
B. Routine inspections.
(1) Each person owning a building served by an on-lot sewage disposal
system shall employ a maintenance contractor to complete routine
inspections for the purpose of evaluating ongoing condition and
maintenance needs of each on-lot sewage disposal system in the
Township.

inspections shall also be completed every three years after final
installation approval by the Chester County Health Department
SEO for all on-lot sewage disposal systems constructed after the
effective date of this article.
(3) Routine inspections may be conducted concurrent with the
pumping requirements of § 132-59A or B, as applicable.
(4) A written inspection report signed by the maintenance contractor
shall be furnished to the Township by the person owning the
property served by the on-lot sewage disposal system within 30
days of the inspection. All written inspection reports shall be on a
form provided by the Township.
A. Only normal domestic wastes shall be discharged into any on-lot
sewage disposal system. The following shall not be discharged into the
system:
(1) Industrial waste.
(2) Automobile oil and other nondomestic oil.
(3) Toxic or hazardous substances or chemicals, including but not

waste hauler shall be submitted by the property owner to the Township
within the prescribed pumping periods.
B. The required pumping frequency may be modified at the discretion of
the Board of Supervisors or the Township's authorized agent if the
initial treatment unit is undersized, if an inspection reveals solids or
scum in excess of 1/3 of the liquid depth of the tank, if the hydraulic
load on the system increases significantly above average, if a garbage
grinder is used in the building, if the system malfunctions or for other
good cause shown.
C. All on-lot sewage disposal system pumping shall be performed in
accordance with Chapter 504 of the Chester County Health Department
regulations and shall also conform to the following minimum standards,
unless other standards are specified by an equipment manufacturer:
(1) At all times, the pumper truck operator's personal safety, as well as
protection of the environment and the landowner's property, shall
receive the highest priority.

shall comply with all laws and regulations regarding the activities
associated with on-lot sewage disposal system maintenance and
disposal of materials removed therefrom.
D. Any person owning a building served by an on-lot sewage disposal
system which utilizes any components or technologies deemed by DEP
to require more detailed operation and maintenance requirements than
provided for in this article, including but not limited to individual
residential spray irrigation systems (IRSIS), alternate systems, or
experimental systems shall be further subject to the maintenance
responsibilities recommended by DEP for said system. The Township
may impose additional requirements as deemed necessary to provide
for the increased oversight inherent in these cases, including but not
limited to collection of an annual fee and additional financial security.
E. Surface contouring shall be required as necessary to direct surface
water and drainageways away from all components of on-lot sewage
disposal systems.
F. Additional maintenance activity may be required as needed including,
but not limited to, providing reasonable access to initial treatment unit,
cleaning and unclogging of piping, servicing and the repair of
mechanical and electrical equipment, leveling of distribution boxes,
tanks and lines, removal of obstructing roots or trees, etc.
A. No person shall operate or maintain an on-lot sewage disposal system
in such a manner to constitute a malfunction. Any suspected
malfunction shall be reported to the Chester County Health Department
SEO, who shall make a final determination as to functional status and
rehabilitation measures required. Any person owning a building served
by an on-lot sewage disposal system determined to be in a state of
malfunction by the Chester County Health Department SEO shall
perform all corrective measures required by the SEO to abate the
malfunction. The Chester County Health Department SEO shall have
the authority to require abatement of any malfunction by the following
methods: cleaning, repair or replacement of components of the existing
system, adding capacity or otherwise altering or replacing the system's
§ 132-59 WESTTOWN CODE § 132-60
1:212
§ 132-61. Retaining tanks.
initial treatment unit, expanding the existing disposal areas, replacing
the existing disposal area, replacing the system with a retaining tank,
frequent pumping, or any other alternative appropriate for the specific
site.
B. In the event other remedies described in this section fail to abate a
malfunction, the Chester County Health Department's Sewage
Enforcement Officer and/or the Township's authorized agent may
require the installation of water conservation equipment and the
institution of water conservation practices in structures served. Water
using devices and appliances in the structure may be required to be
retrofitted with water saving appurtenances or they may be required to
be replaced by water conserving devices.
C. Should none of the remedies described in this section be totally
effective in eliminating the malfunction of an existing on-lot sewage
disposal system, the property owner is not absolved of responsibility for
that malfunction. The Township and the Chester County Health
Department may require action by the property owner to lessen or
mitigate the malfunction to the extent necessary.
D. There may arise geographic areas where numerous on-lot sewage
disposal systems are known or are suspected to be in a state of
malfunction. A resolution of these area-wide problems may necessitate
detailed planning and a revision to the portion of the Sewage Facilities
Plan pertaining to areas affected by such malfunctions. When a DEPauthorized
Official Sewage Facilities Plan Revision has been
undertaken, mandatory repair or replacement of individual
malfunctioning sewage disposal systems within the area affected by the
revision may be delayed, pending the outcome of the plan revision
process. However, immediate corrective action may be compelled
whenever a malfunction, as determined by the Chester County Health
Department and/or the Department, represents a serious public health
or environmental threat.
A. Retaining tanks shall only be utilized as a remedy for a malfunctioning
on-lot sewage disposal system when it has been determined by the
Chester County Health Department SEO and the Township that no
other remedy is viable.
B. Where no on-lot sewage disposal system malfunction has been
identified by the Chester County Health Department, the use of
retaining tanks shall be subject to approval by the Board, the Chester
County Health Department, and DEP. Board approval shall be further
predicated upon a satisfactory operation and maintenance agreement
specific to each use, to which both the Township and the property
owner shall be party. The Township may impose additional
requirements as deemed necessary, including but not limited to
collection of financial security and an annual fee.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 144-101. Short title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Westtown Township Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 144-102. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed
increases flooding, flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the capacity of streams and storm sewers,
greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood reduction
efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces infiltration
and groundwater recharge, increases nonpoint source pollution to
waterways, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land disturbance and development throughout a watershed can
harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and stream banks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted
through loss of recharge.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
minimization of impacts of new development, redevelopment, and other
earth-disturbance activities causing accelerated runoff and erosion and
loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the people of the municipality and all of the
people of the Commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource that provides infiltration
and groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by reducing the
volume of stormwater generated and by using project designs that
maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high water quality,
infiltration, stream base flow, and aquatic ecosystems. Cost-effective
and environmentally sensitive stormwater management can be
achieved through the use of nonstructural site design techniques that
minimize impervious surfaces, reduce disturbance of land and natural
resources, avoid sensitive areas (e.g., riparian buffers, floodplains,
§ 144-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 144-102
1:229
§ 144-103. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect public health, safety and general
welfare, property and water quality by implementing drainage and
stormwater management practices, criteria, and provisions included herein
for land development, construction and earth-disturbance activities, to
achieve the following throughout the municipality:
steep slopes, wetlands, etc.), and consider topography and soils to
maintain the natural hydrologic regime.
F. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
G. Federal and state regulations require the municipality to implement a
program of stormwater controls. The municipality is required to obtain
a permit and comply with its provisions for stormwater discharges from
its separate storm sewer system under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal or other storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of the waters of the commonwealth.
A. Reduce the frequency and magnitude of flooding and stormwater
impacts affecting people, property, infrastructure and public services.
B. Sustain or improve the natural hydrologic characteristics and water
quality of groundwater and surface waters.
C. Protect natural resources, including riparian and aquatic living
resources and habitats.
D. Maintain the natural hydrologic regime of land development sites and
their receiving watersheds.
E. Minimize land disturbance and protect and incorporate natural
hydrologic features, drainage patterns, infiltration, and flow conditions
within land development site designs.
F. Reduce and minimize the volume of stormwater generated, and manage
and release stormwater as close to the source of runoff as possible.
G. Provide infiltration and maintain natural groundwater recharge to
protect groundwater supplies and stream base flows, prevent
degradation of surface water and groundwater quality, and to otherwise
protect water resources.
H. Reduce stormwater pollutant loads to protect and improve the
chemical, physical, and biological quality of ground- and surface
waters.
I. Reduce scour, erosion and sedimentation of stream channels.
§ 144-102 WESTTOWN CODE § 144-103
1:230
J. Reduce flooding impacts and preserve and restore the natural floodcarrying
capacity of streams and their floodplains.
K. Protect adjacent and down-gradient lands from adverse impacts of
direct stormwater discharges.
L. Minimize impervious surfaces and connected impervious surfaces to
promote infiltration and reduce the volume and impacts of stormwater
runoff.
M. Provide proper long-term operation and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management facilities, BMPs and conveyances that are
implemented within the municipality.
N. Reduce the impacts of runoff from existing developed land undergoing
redevelopment while encouraging new development and
redevelopment in urban areas and areas designated for growth.
O. Implement an illicit discharge detection and elimination program that
addresses nonstormwater discharges.
P. Provide performance standards and design criteria based on
watershed-based stormwater management planning.
Q. Provide standards to meet certain NPDES stormwater permit
requirements.
R. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93, to protect, maintain, reclaim and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of the
commonwealth.
S. Implement the requirements of total maximum daily load (TMDLs)
where applicable to waters within or impacted by the municipality.
T. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
U. Fulfill the purpose and requirements of PA Act 167 (PA Act 167, Section
3):
"(1) Encourage planning and management of stormwater runoff in
each watershed which is consistent with sound water and land
use practices.
(2) Authorize a comprehensive program of stormwater management
designated to preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity

§ 144-112. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful.
B. The governing body shall have the authority to waive or modify the
requirements of one or more provisions of this chapter if the literal
enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions
pertaining to the land in question, provided that such modification will
not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose and intent of
the chapter is observed. Cost or financial burden shall not be
considered a hardship. Modification may also be considered if an
alternative standard or approach can be demonstrated to provide equal
or better achievement of the results intended by the chapter. A request
for modification shall be in writing and accompany the SWM site plan
submission. The request shall state in full the grounds and facts on
which the request is based, the provision or provisions of the chapter
involved and the minimum modification necessary.
C. PADEP approval required. For any proposed regulated activity involving
earth disturbance equal to or greater than one acre, the municipality
may approve measures for minimum volume and infiltration control
other than those required in this chapter only after consultation with
and evaluation by PADEP that the alternate site design meets state
water quality requirements and does not conflict with state law,
including, but not limited to, the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, 35

ARTICLE III
Stormwater Management Standards
§ 144-301. General requirements.
A. Applicants proposing regulated activities in the municipality which are
not exempt under § 144-106 shall submit a stormwater management
site plan (SWM site plan) to the municipality for review and approval in
accordance with Articles III and IV. SWM site plans approved by the
municipality shall be on site throughout the duration of the regulated
activity.
B. The stormwater management and runoff control criteria and standards
in this chapter shall apply to the total proposed regulated activity, even
if it is to take place in stages. The measurement of impervious surfaces
shall include all of the impervious surfaces in the total proposed
regulated activity even if the development is to take place in stages.
C. No regulated activity within the municipality shall commence until:
(1) The municipality issues approval of a SWM site plan, which
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this chapter;
and
(2) The applicant has received a letter of adequacy or approval for the
erosion and sediment control plan review by the municipality and
the Conservation District (if required), and has received all other
local, state and federal permit approvals required for the project
involving the regulated activity.
D. Neither submission of an SWM site plan under the provisions herein
nor compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall relieve any
person from responsibility for damage to any person or property
otherwise imposed by law.
E. The applicant shall design the site to minimize disturbances to land, site
hydrology, and natural resources, and to maintain the natural
hydrologic regime, drainage patterns and flow conditions. The
applicant shall apply the procedures set forth in § 144-304 for the
overall site design and for selection, location and design of features and
BMPs to be used to comply with the requirements of this chapter.
F. To the maximum extent practicable, post-construction stormwater shall
be discharged within the drainage area of the same stream or water
body receiving the runoff prior to construction of the proposed
regulated activity.
G. For regulated activities with one acre or more of proposed earth
disturbance, existing drainage peak rate discharges up to and including
the one-hundred-year storm onto or through adjacent property(ies) or
down-gradient property(ies), including diffuse drainage discharge, shall
not be altered in any manner without written permission from, and,
§ 144-301 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 144-301
1:255
where applicable as determined by the municipality an easement and
agreement with, the affected landowner(s) for conveyance of
discharges onto or through their property(ies). Such discharge shall be
subject to any applicable discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
(1) If directed by the Township, regulated activities with one acre or
less proposed earth disturbance, the applicant shall provide
written notification to the affected landowner(s) describing the
proposed regulated activity and proposed discharge(s), unless
otherwise required by the municipality.
H. Areas located outside of the site (i.e., areas outside of the regulated
activity) that drain through a proposed site are not subject to water
quality and volume control, infiltration, stream channel protection, or
peak flow rate control requirements (as presented in §§ 144-305,
144-306, 144-307, and 144-308). Drainage facilities located on the site
shall be designed to safely convey flows from outside of the site through
the site.
I. If site conditions preclude capture of runoff from limited portions of the
disturbed area for achieving water quality volume control standards,
stream channel protection standards, and the five-year and ten-year
storm event peak runoff rate reduction standards for new development
required by this chapter, the applicant shall propose alternate methods
to mitigate the bypass of the BMPs, subject to the approval of the
Municipal Engineer. In no case shall resulting peak rate be greater than
the predevelopment peak rate for the equivalent design storm.
J. For all regulated activities, erosion and sediment control BMPs shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained during the regulated
activities (i.e., during construction) as required to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter, to meet the erosion and sediment
control requirements of the municipality, if applicable, and to meet all
requirements under Title 25 of the Pa. Code and the Clean Streams
Law.52
K. For all regulated activities, permanent BMPs and conveyances shall be
designed, implemented, operated, and maintained to meet the purposes
and requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under
Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law,53 and the
Storm Water Management Act.54
L. The design of all BMPs and conveyances shall incorporate sound
engineering principles and practices in a manner that does not
aggravate existing stormwater problems as identified by the
municipality. The municipality reserves the right to disapprove any
design that would result in construction in an area affected by existing

stormwater problem(s) or continuation of an existing stormwater
problem(s).
M. Existing wetlands, either on the site or on an adjacent property, shall
not be used to meet the minimum design requirements for stormwater
management or stormwater runoff quality treatment. Stormwater
discharges to existing wetlands shall not degrade the quality or
hydrologic integrity of the wetland.
N. Hotspots runoff controls. Specific structural or pollution prevention
practices may be required, as determined to be necessary by the
Municipal Engineer, to pretreat runoff from hotspots prior to
infiltration. Following is a list of examples of hotspots:

O. Contaminated and brownfield sites. Where BMPs may contribute to the
migration of contaminants in groundwater, the water quality and runoff
volume, stream channel protection, and peak rate control standards
shall be met; however, at the Municipal Engineer's discretion, the
minimum infiltration requirement may be reduced or eliminated
commensurate with the contaminated area and the required water
quality and runoff control measures may be increased to mitigate the
reduced infiltration requirement for the contaminated area.
P. Additional water quality requirements. The municipality may require
additional stormwater control measures for stormwater discharges to
special management areas, including, but not limited to:
§ 144-301 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 144-301
1:257
(1) Water bodies listed as "impaired" by PADEP.
(2) Any water body or watershed with an approved total maximum
daily load (TMDL), specifically Goose Creek Watershed.
(a) Total phosphorous is the assigned TMDL pollutant to Westtown
Township within the Goose Creek Watershed. As such, the
Township may require additional phosphorous-reducing

Q. Applicants shall utilize the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual (PA BMP Manual), as amended, or other sources
acceptable to the Municipal Engineer, for testing and design standards
for BMPs, and, where there is a conflict with the provisions of this
chapter, the most restrictive applies.
R. For areas underlain by karst or carbonate geology that may be
susceptible to the formation of sinkholes and other karst features, the
location, type, and design of infiltration BMPs shall be based on a site
evaluation conducted by a qualified licensed professional and based on
the PA BMP Manual or other design guidance acceptable to the
Municipal Engineer.
S. All regulated activities located within a special flood hazard area
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
shall comply with the Westtown Township Zoning Ordinance, § 170-401,
Floodplain District, and shall be designed to maintain the flood-carrying
capacity of the floodway such that the base flood elevations are not
increased, either upstream or downstream. The natural conveyance
characteristics of the site and the receiving floodplain shall be
incorporated into the stormwater management practices proposed for
the site.
T. Disturbance of existing ground cover during construction of the
proposed regulated activity is prohibited within fifty (75)55 feet of top-

buffer width may be reduced to 25 feet of the setback to a minimum
of 10 feet. If an existing buffer is legally prescribed (e.g., deed
covenant, easement, etc.) and it exceeds the requirement of this
chapter, the existing buffer shall be maintained.
(3) The buffer shall be maintained with appropriate native vegetation
as defined in the appendices of the Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Manual, dated December 30, 2006. Excavating,
placing fill, building structures, or making any alterations that may
adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any portion of the
riparian buffer shall be prohibited unless the proposed work is
associated with a regulated wetlands mitigation program.

§ 144-305. Water quality and runoff volume requirements.
To control post-construction stormwater impacts from regulated activities
and meet state water quality requirements, BMPs shall be provided in
the site design that replicate predevelopment stormwater infiltration and
runoff conditions, such that post-construction stormwater discharges do not
degrade the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of the receiving
waters. The applicant shall comply with the following water quality and
runoff volume requirements for all regulated activities, including all new
development and redevelopment activities:
A. The post-construction total runoff volume shall not exceed the
predevelopment total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than
the two-year, twenty-four-hour duration precipitation (design storm).
The water quality and runoff volume to be managed shall consist of any
runoff volume generated by the proposed regulated activity over and
above the predevelopment total runoff volume and shall be captured
and permanently retained or infiltrated on the site. Permanent
retention options may include, but are not limited to, reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
B. For modeling purposes, the predevelopment ground cover conditions
shall be determined using the corresponding ground cover assumptions
presented in § 144-309D of this chapter.
C. The design of the facility outlet shall provide for protection from
clogging and unwanted sedimentation.
D. BMPs that moderate the temperature of stormwater shall be used to
protect the temperature of receiving waters.
E. Water quality improvement shall be achieved in conjunction with
achieving the infiltration requirements of § 144-306. The infiltration
volume required under § 144-306 may be included as a component of
the water quality volume. If the calculated water quality and runoff
volume is greater than the volume infiltrated, then the difference
between the two volumes shall be managed for water quality and runoff
volume control through other techniques or practices but shall not be
discharged from the site.
F. Runoff from the disturbed area shall be treated for water quality prior
to entering existing waterways or water bodies. If a stormwater
management practice does not provide water quality treatment, then
water quality BMPs shall be utilized to provide pretreatment prior to
the runoff entering the stormwater management practice.
G. The municipality may require additional water quality and runoff
control measures for stormwater discharging to special management
areas such as those listed in § 144-301P.
§ 144-305 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 144-305
1:263
§ 144-306. Infiltration requirements.
Providing for infiltration consistent with the natural hydrologic regime
is required to compensate for the reduction in the recharge that occurs
when the ground surface is disturbed or impervious surface is created
or expanded. The applicant shall achieve the following infiltration
requirements:
H. When the regulated activity contains or is divided by multiple drainage
areas, the water quality and runoff volume shall be separately
addressed for each drainage area.
I. Weighted averaging of runoff coefficients shall not be used for manual

basements, foundation walls, etc.), unless otherwise approved by
the Municipal Engineer.
(3) For any infiltration practice that collects runoff from shared or
multiple features and that is located within 50 feet of a building or
feature with subgrade elements (e.g., basements, foundation walls,
etc.), the bottom elevation shall be set below the elevation of the
subgrade element.
(4) Be consistent with the protocols written in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, December 2006
or latest version thereof.
L. Infiltration facilities shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be
located to avoid introducing contaminants to groundwater:

protected from compaction due to heavy equipment operation or
storage of fill or construction material. Infiltration areas shall also be
protected from sedimentation. Areas that are accidentally compacted
or graded shall be remediated to restore soil composition and porosity.
Adequate documentation to this effect shall be submitted to the
Municipal Engineer for review. All areas designated for infiltration shall

of earth disturbance, the applicant shall comply with the following stream
channel protection requirements to minimize stream channel erosion and
associated water quality impacts to the receiving waters:

activity) that drain through a proposed site are not subject to peak flow
rate control requirements. Drainage facilities located on the site shall
be designed to safely convey flows from outside of the site through the
site.

ARTICLE IX
Development and Design Standards
§ 149-900. Application.
The following standards shall be complied with in all subdivision and land
developments:
§ 149-901. General standards for public streets.
A. Improvement specifications; general requirements.
(1) Physical improvements to the property being developed shall be
provided, constructed and installed as shown on the record plan, in
accordance with the requirements of the Township.
(2) As a condition for approval of a final plan by the Township, the
applicant shall enter into an agreement with the Township as to
installation of all improvements shown on the plan and required by
these regulations. Before the final plan may be endorsed by the
Township, the applicant shall submit a completed original copy of
the subdivision improvements agreement.
(3) All improvements, whether public or private, installed by the
applicant shall be designed and constructed in accordance with
applicable criteria and specifications referenced herein. If there
are no applicable regulations, the Township may authorize that
specifications be prepared by a registered professional engineer.
(4) Inspection of the installation of the improvements required by this
chapter shall in all cases be the responsibility of the Township or
the appropriate state regulatory agency.
A. The location and width of all public streets shall conform to the
Westtown Township Official Map or to such parts thereof as may have
been adopted by the Township.
B. The proposed public street system shall extend existing or recorded
streets at the same or greater width, but in no case at less than the
required minimum width.
C. Where Westtown Township determines that it is desirable to provide for
public street access to adjoining property, public streets shall be
extended by dedication to the boundary of such property.
D. New minor public streets shall be so designed as to discourage through
traffic, but the applicant shall give adequate consideration to provision
for the extension and continuation of major and collector streets into
and from adjoining properties.
E. Where a development abuts an existing public street of improper width
or alignment, the Township may require the dedication of land
sufficient to widen the street or correct the alignment.
§ 149-900 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-901
1:375
§ 149-902. Partial and half streets.
§ 149-903. Right-of-way and cartway.
F. The length of a cul-de-sac shall be a minimum of 350 feet and a
maximum of 1,500 feet. Any proposed cul-de-sac longer than 1,500 feet
must be approved by the Board upon recommendation of the Township
Engineer. In no case shall any cul-de-sac street serve more than 25
dwelling units. Cul-de-sac length shall be measured from the radius of
the cul-de-sac turnaround to the edge of paving/curbline of the closest
through street. [Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
A. New half or partial streets will not be permitted except where essential
to the reasonable development of a tract in conformance with the other
requirements and standards of these regulations and where, in
addition, satisfactory assurance for dedication of the remaining part of
the public street can be obtained.
B. The applicant shall provide the entire required right-of-way or as much
thereof as lies within his property, along all existing public streets
which traverse or abut his property.
A. The right-of-way and cartway widths of all new or proposed public and/
or private streets shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors and
shall be classified as follows:
(1) Arterial highway.
(a) The right-of-way of Routes 202 and 3 shall be 120 feet.
(b) The right-of-way of Routes 926 and 352 shall be 80 feet.
(c) The cartway widths will be determined by the Township after
consulting with the Chester County Planning Commission and
PennDOT. [Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
(2) Collector street. Right-of-way shall be 60 feet and cartway width
shall be 28 feet. See Note 1.
(3) Minor street. Right-of-way shall be 50 feet and cartway width shall
be 24 feet. See Notes 1 and 2.
(4) Cul-de-sac street. A cul-de-sac is a minor street. Turnaround shall
have a right-of-way radius of 60 feet. Turnaround cartway paving
width shall have a radius of 50 feet. See Notes 1 and 2.
(a) When required for future extension, the turnaround right-ofway
shall be placed adjacent to the tract boundary with
sufficient width along the boundary line to permit extension of
the street at full width.
(b) The small triangle of land beyond the cul-de-sac to the
boundary shall be so deeded that, until the road is continued,
§ 149-901 WESTTOWN CODE § 149-903
1:376
maintenance of these corners of land will be the responsibility
of the adjoining owners.
(c) The Board of Supervisors may approve alternative designs for
the end of a cul-de-sac, provided the applicant proves their will
be adequate turning space for delivery trucks, snowplows and
school buses. For example, the Board of Supervisors may
approve a larger cul-de-sac bulb with landscaped space in the
middle of the bulb, provided there is an adequate system to
ensure proper maintenance of the landscaped space. The
Township may also require the establishment of a well-drained
snow storage easement at the end of a cul-de-sac to allow snow
to be pushed directly down the street onto grass. The provision
of this easement may make a landscape island more feasible.
[Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
(5) Service street (alley). Service streets are permitted only in small-lot
single-family detached development (see definitions). The right-ofway
shall be 20 feet and the cartway width shall be 12 feet.
NOTE 1: Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be
required by Westtown Township for the purpose of promoting
the public safety and convenience, or to provide for parking in
commercial and industrial areas and in areas of high-density
residential development.
NOTE 2: At the sole discretion of the Township Supervisors, the
right-of-way of a minor street may be reduced to 40 feet and the
cartway width of a minor street may be reduced to 20 feet for
properties of one acre or more. Turnaround paved cartway of culde-
sac streets shall not reduced.
B. All streets, whether public or private, shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with Township regulations.
C. Right-of-way along existing streets. [Added 7-22-2002 by Ord. No.
2002-5]
(1) Where a subdivision or land development is proposed adjacent to
an existing public street, the applicant shall dedicate sufficient
right-of-way to result in the future right-of-way width provided for
in § 170-1511 of the Zoning Chapter. If the applicant only controls
land on one side of an existing street, then the applicant shall only
be responsible to dedicate land to result in a width from the street
cartway center line to the future right-of-way line equal to 50% of
the future street right-of-way width. Therefore, for example, if a
collector street has a sixty-foot-wide future right-of-way, an
applicant on one side would be responsible to ensure that a thirtyfoot-
wide right-of-way is provided on the applicant's side of the
center line.

1:377
§ 149-904. Street grades.
§ 149-905. Horizontal curves.
§ 149-906. Vertical curves.
At all changes of public street grades where the algebraic difference
exceeds 1%, vertical curves shall be provided to permit the following
minimum sight distances:
(2) The dedication of future right-of-way shall not be required where
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors,
based upon any review by the Township Engineer and Planning
Commission, that there is not a reasonable relationship between
the need for the additional right-of-way and the traffic created by
the proposed development.
(3) Along a state-owned street or highway, if the State Department of
Transportation refuses to accept a dedication of right-of-way, then
the future right-of-way shall be dedicated to the Township or be
irrevocably committed and reserved for future dedication when the
Board of Supervisors determines the right-of-way is needed.
A. On all streets there shall be minimum center-line grade of 1% and a
maximum of 7%.
B. The center-line grade may be increased up to 10% upon the
recommendation of the Township Engineer and the approval of the
Board of Supervisors.
C. The center-line grade on a cul-de-sac public street shall not exceed 7%,
and the grade of the diameter of the turnaround shall not exceed 4%.
D. Drainage of cul-de-sac public streets shall preferably be toward the
open end.
A. Whenever public street lines are deflected in excess of five degrees,
connections shall be made by horizontal curves.
B. To ensure adequate sight distance, minimum center-line radii for
horizontal curves shall be as follows:
(1) Minor streets: 150 feet.
(2) Collector streets: 300 feet.
(3) Arterial highways: 500 feet.
(4) Service streets: 80 feet.

event at less than an angle of 60°.
B. No more than two streets shall intersect at the same point.
C. Streets entering the opposite sides of another street shall either be
directly opposite each other or shall be offset at least 200 feet on minor
and collector streets, measured center line to center line along the
center line of the street being intersected.
D. Intersections with arterial highways shall be located not less than 1,000
feet apart, measured from center line to center line, along the center
line of the arterial highway.
E. Where the grade of any street at the approach of an intersection
exceeds 4%, a leveling area of at least 75 feet measured from the
curbline of the street being intersected shall be provided. The grade of
this area shall not exceed 2%.
F. Street curb intersections shall be rounded by a tangent arc with a
minimum radius of 35 feet.
G. Curb and right-of-way radii shall have the same center point of origin.
H. Street right-of-way lines shall be parallel to curb lines.
A. A minimum clear sight triangle of 75 feet (as measured from the centerline
intersections of two streets) shall be provided at all intersections.
The minimum clear sight triangle shall be increased to 100 feet if either
street is a collector street and to 150 feet if either street is an arterial
highway. There shall be no physical obstruction, planting, berm or
grade above the height of 18 inches within the right-of way section of
this triangle or above the height of 2 1/2 feet elsewhere in this triangle.
B. Wherever a portion of the line of such triangle occurs behind (i.e., from
the street) the building setback line, such portion shall be shown on the
final plan of the development, and shall be considered a building
setback line.
C. Stopping sight distance at all intersections shall be in accordance with
PennDOT standards. [Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]

defined and the method of construction and installation shall be in strict
accordance with the requirements of PennDOT Specifications Publication
408 and/or PennDOT Seldom Used Specifications 1983 and/or the latest
revision thereof.
A. Wherever a development abuts (or contains) an existing or proposed
public street or highway with an ultimate right-of-way of 60 feet or
more, the development shall be designed to restrict access to that
street. If the street is an arterial highway, access to that arterial
highway shall be restricted by either:
(1) The creation of reverse frontage lots abutting arterial roads which
shall have access from a road of lesser classification.
(2) The creation of a public or private street which is separated by a
reserve strip from the arterial highway. The ownership and
maintenance of the reserve strip shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Township. Except as specified above, reserve strips
shall be prohibited.
B. Dead-end public streets are prohibited, except as stubs to permit future
street extension into adjoining properties, unless designed as cul-de-sac
streets.
C. Any public street dead-ended because of authorized staged
development shall be provided with a temporary, all-weather
turnaround, within the development, and the use of such turnaround
shall be guaranteed to the public until such time as the public street is
extended.
D. Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract boundary
line to permit extension of the street at full width.
A. Drainage. All drainage and utility structures, including but not limited
to manholes, inlets, pipes, water and electric lines, shall be installed
prior to the final grading of the cartway.
B. Grading. Grading shall be completed to the full width of the right-ofway.
Banks shall be sloped not less than three horizontal to one vertical
with top of slopes rounded.
C. Subgrade. The subgrade within the limits of the proposed cartway shall
be shaped to conform to the line, grade and cross-section of the
proposed cartway and shall be thoroughly compacted as per PennDOT
Publication 408 as last revised. Subgrade shall be sloped to correspond
§ 149-909 WESTTOWN CODE § 149-910
1:380
to the slope of the finished road surface. Before placing the base
course, the subgrade shall be dressed with one inch of fine aggregate.
NOTE 1: Backfill of trenches within the cartway and shoulder area
shall be mechanically tamped in uniform layers of not more than eight
inches, thoroughly compacted, 95% dry volume, prior to application of
the base course.
NOTE 2: If, during the installation of any of the aforementioned items,
the Township determines that the material used for backfill is
unacceptable, the contractor shall be required to use select fill.
D. Paving:
(1) The Township Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, shall determine the type of paving which shall
be utilized.
(2) Type I Base Course. Base course shall be constructed of stone
aggregate, rolled with vibratory roller, and thoroughly compacted
in two layers to a depth of not less than eight inches for residential
and 10 inches for industrial. The materials and construction
methods shall be in strict accordance with the requirements of
Section 310, "Crushed Aggregate Base Course," PennDOT Seldom
Used Specifications.
(3) Type II Base Course. Base course shall consist of five inches for
residential and six inches for industrial, after compaction, of hot
mixed, hot laid bituminous concrete base course placed on a sixinch
compacted layer of PennDOT No. 2A course aggregate, Type C
or better (no slag material). The materials and construction
methods shall be in strict accordance with the requirements of
Section 305, Bituminous Concrete Base Course, and Section 305,
Subcourse, of PennDOT Publication 408 Specifications. The
subbase and base course shall be rolled with a vibratory roller.
(4) Bituminous Surface Course ID-2A. Bituminous surface course
ID-2A shall consist of constructing a binder course and wearing
course of hot mixed, hot laid asphalt concrete on the above
prepared base course. The binder course shall be rolled with
vibratory roller and compacted to a depth of not less than two
inches and the wearing course not less than 1 1/2 inches. The
materials and construction methods shall be in strict accordance
with the requirements of Section 420, Bituminous Wearing Course
ID-2, and Section 421, Bituminous Binder Course ID-2, of PennDOT
Publication 408, as amended. The Township may require that the
final application of bituminous concrete be withheld until the
streets are offered for dedication to the Township if the wearing
course is not applied immediately after the binder course. (NOTE:
The binder course shall be thoroughly cleaned and tack coated in
accordance with PennDOT Publication 408, as amended.)

the suffix street, road, avenue, boulevard, drive, etc.
C. All street names shall be subject to the approval of Westtown Township
and of the Postmaster.
D. Street name signs shall be placed at all intersections, naming all streets
at each intersection, and shall be visible from both directions. In
general, mounting heights of signs shall be seven feet. Signs shall be
mounted on 2 3/8 inch outside diameter galvanized steel tubular posts
10 feet in length. Posts shall be embedded in concrete footings three
feet six inches deep by 12 inches in diameter. Signs shall be aluminum

E. Crosswalks (interior walks) may be required wherever necessary to
facilitate pedestrian circulation and to give access to community
facilities as well as in blocks of over 1,000 feet in length.
F. Such crosswalks (interior walks) shall have an easement width of not
less than 10 feet and paved width (if paved) of not less than four feet.
G. Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate two tiers
of lots, except where reverse frontage lots are required along an
arterial highway, or where prevented by the size, topographical
conditions or other inherent conditions of property, in which case the
Township may approve a single tier of lots.
H. Blocks in commercial and industrial areas may vary from the elements
of design detail in Subsection G if required by the nature of the use. In
all cases, however, adequate provision shall be made for off-street
parking and loading areas as well as for traffic circulation and parking
for employees and customers.
A. The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be appropriate for the type
of development and use contemplated and shall conform to zoning
regulations.
B. Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines.
C. Interior lots shall not be permitted unless the width of the access strip
is at least equal to the minimum lot width at the minimum building
setback line for the particular zoning district in which the interior lot is
located. [Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
D. Wherever feasible, lot lines shall follow Township boundaries rather
than cross them in order to avoid jurisdictional problems.
E. Depth and width of parcels intended for nonresidential uses shall be
adequate for the use proposed and sufficient to provide satisfactory
space for on-site parking, loading and unloading, setbacks,
landscaping, etc.
F. If, after subdividing, there exist substandard remnants of land, they
shall be either incorporated in existing or proposed lots, or legally
dedicated to public use, if acceptable to the Township.
G. For any new lot intended for the construction of a principal building, a
contiguous and uninterrupted area equal to 75% of the minimum lot
area required by the Zoning Chapter shall be provided which is
unencumbered by any of the following: wetlands, one-hundred-year
floodplains, steep slopes and/or stormwater detention basins. The
§ 149-913 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-914
1:383
§ 149-915. Driveways.
contiguous area shall be provided for construction of buildings and
customary accessory uses without intruding into these features.
[Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
H. All easements and rights-of-way shall abut the property line whenever
possible.
I. Lots shall be conveniently shaped and the depth of the lots shall,
generally, not exceed the width by more than 2 1/2 times.
J. All lots shall have frontage on a street in accordance with Chapter 170,
Zoning.
K. Double or reverse frontage lots shall be avoided except where required
to provide separation of residential development from arterial highways
or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation.
L. All residential reverse frontage lots shall have a rear yard with a
minimum depth of 60 feet (measured along the shortest distance from
the proposed dwelling unit to the ultimate right-of-way) and shall,
within such rear yard and immediately adjacent to the right-of-way,
have a planting screen easement of at least 10 feet in width, across
which there shall be no right of access.
A. Township approval is required for construction of a driveway. The
approval request may be included with a building permit application in
the case of new construction.
B. A plan shall be submitted with each application for approval of a
driveway and shall include the following:
(1) Site plan to scale at least one inch equals 50 feet.
(2) Location of building, septic tank and disposal field, well and all
other structures.
(3) Adjacent driveways within 100 feet.
(4) Plan of driveway.
(5) Topography of lot by field or photogrametric survey with contours
at two-foot intervals.
(6) Profile of proposed driveway from edge of road to end of driveway,
showing existing and proposed grades.
C. Private driveways for residences, except for townhouses, apartments
and mobile home parks, shall be located at least 60 feet from the point

1:384
D. Private driveways in commercial, industrial and business park zoning
districts and for townhouse, mobile home parks and apartments shall
be located at least 100 feet from the point of intersection of the nearest
street right-of-way lines and at least 10 feet from every property line.
E. Driveways used jointly by more than one property owner may straddle
the property line. The appropriate easement restrictions shall be noted
on the final plan.
F. All driveways shall be located, designed and constructed in such a
manner as not to interfere or be inconsistent with the design,
maintenance and drainage of the highway.
G. Driveways shall be located in such manner that they will not cause the
following: interference to the traveling public; a hazard to the free
movement of normal highway traffic; or areas of undue traffic
congestion on the highway. In accordance with this principle, driveways
should be located where the highway alignment and profile are
favorable, i.e., where there are no sharp curves or steep grades, and
where sight distance in conjunction with the driveway access would be
adequate for safe traffic operation.
H. Driveways should not be located in such sections that would interfere
with the placement and proper functioning of highway signs, signals,
detectors, lighting or other devices that affect traffic control. The
location of a driveway near a signalized intersection that has an
actuated traffic signal may include a requirement that the permittee
provide (without expense to the Township or PennDOT) additional
detectors and signal poles and heads for the control of traffic movement
from his establishment or for relocation of existing detectors.
[Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-5]
I. Where highway curbs exist, driveway approaches shall be installed 1 1/
2 inches above the adjacent highway or gutter grade to maintain the
proper drainage.
J. Where highway curbs do not exist, driveways shall be constructed in
such a manner as not to interfere with the drainage grade line of
shoulders. If, in the opinion of the Township Engineer, a pipe is required
to maintain the grade line, the permittee shall install such pipe at his
expense, parallel to the pavement edge and at a minimum distance of
10 feet therefrom and on the grade line as directed by the Township
Engineer. Where a pipe is placed in the shoulder line, the driveway may
slope away from the roadway at a lesser gradient than the normal
shoulder slope but not less than 1/4 inch per foot from the paving edge
to the pipe. The minimum pipe length shall be equal to the width of the
driveway plus 10 feet.
K. Design requirements.
(1) The grade of the driveway within 20 feet of the pavement edge or
the curbline of the public road, Township or state, shall not exceed
§ 149-915 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-915
1:385
4%. The maximum grade permitted beyond this point is 15%.
Vertical curves shall be used at a change of grades exceeding 5%.
(2) Width of driveway within the legal right-of-way of the public road
shall be at least 10 feet, and shall be nine feet within the property
line. Adequate turnaround surface shall be provided on the
property so egress to the street is in a forward direction. Where the
grade of the driveway exceeds 10%, at least one level parking
space shall be provided just within the property line for emergency
parking.
(3) The driveway within the legal right-of-way of the public road shall
be constructed with crushed aggregate meeting the requirement of
Section 350 of PennDOT Form 408 Specifications, compacted to a
minimum depth of six inches. It shall be surfaced with a minimum
of 2 1/2 inches of ID-2 surface course or approved equal. The
remaining length of driveway may be constructed of any suitable
stabilized material or bituminous surface adequate for the intended
use and vehicle loads. [Amended 7-22-2002 by Ord. No.
2002-5]
(4) Discharge of roof drains or downspouts onto the driveway which

conformance with the Uniform Condominium Act of 1980.73 All
such common open space land shall be held as "common element."
E. Maintenance of open space.
(1) In the event that the organization established to own and maintain
common open space, or any successor organization, shall at any
time fail to maintain the common open space in reasonable order
and condition in accordance with the development plan, the
Township may serve written notice upon such organization, or upon
the residents and owners of the development, setting forth the
manner in which the organization has failed to maintain the
common open space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall
include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be cured
within 30 days thereof, and shall state the date and place of a
hearing thereon which shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At
such hearing the Township may modify the terms of the original
notice as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time
within which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth in
the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall not be
corrected within said 30 days or any extension thereof, the
Township, in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties
within the development and to prevent the common open space
from becoming a public nuisance, may, in its discretion, enter upon
said common open space and maintain the same for a period of one
year. Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a taking of
said common open space, and shall not vest in the public any rights
to use the common open space except when the same is voluntarily
dedicated to the public by the residents and owners and such
73.Editor's Note: See 68 Pa.C.S.A. § 3101 et seq.
§ 149-921 WESTTOWN CODE § 149-921
1:394

said year, the Township shall, upon its initiative or upon the request
of the organization theretofore responsible for the maintenance of
the common open space, call a public hearing upon notice to such
organization, or to the residents and owners of the development,
to be held by the Township, at which hearing such organization
or the residents and owners of the development shall show cause
why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the election of
the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Township shall
determine that such organization is ready and able to maintain
said common open space in reasonable condition, the Township
shall cease to maintain said common open space at the end of
said year. If the Township shall determine such organization is
not ready and able to maintain said common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, in its discretion, continue
to maintain said common open space during the next succeeding
year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each
year thereafter. The decision of the Township in any case shall
constitute a final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
(2) The cost of such maintenance and enforcement proceedings by the
Township shall be assessed ratably against the properties within
the development that have a right of enjoyment of the common
open space and shall become a lien on said properties. Said
assessments or charges shall be subordinate in lien to the lien of
any prior mortgage or mortgages on the property which is subject
to such assessments or charges. The Township, at the time of
entering upon such said common open space for the purpose of
maintenance, shall file notice of such lien, in the office of the
Prothonotary of Chester County, upon the properties affected by
such lien within the development.
(3) Included in any terms of ownership shall be protection of the open
space against development in perpetuity by means of a
conservation easement prohibiting development. The required
easement shall be conveyed either to the Township directly (in
which case the development's property owners shall be named as
third-party beneficiary) or to a conservation organization
acceptable to the Board (in which case the Township and property
owners of the development shall be named as third-party
beneficiaries).

of the dwelling units shall be paid prior to the recording of the final
plan, except as follows:
(a) If the required fee would be greater than $2,000, and the
applicant and the Township mutually agree to provisions in a
binding development agreement to require the payment of all
applicable recreation fees prior to the issuance of any building
permits within each clearly defined phase or subphase of the
development, then fees are not required to be paid prior to
recording of the final plan but may instead be paid within the
requirements of that development agreement.
(b) If the applicant agrees to pay such fees in installments, then all
such fees shall not be considered to be paid for the purposes o
any applicable time limitations for utilization under the state
Municipalities Planning Code74 until all such fees are paid in
full, including all installments and phases.
A. The buffer shall be a landscaped area free of structures. No driveway or
street shall be permitted in the buffer except at points of ingress or
egress. Parking shall be permitted only when specifically authorized by

unless absolutely necessary. Applicants shall make all reasonable
efforts to harmonize their plans in order to preserve these existing
trees.
B. When development of a proposed subdivision and/or land development
necessitates the clearing of trees or portions of tree masses, applicants
shall be guided by the following criteria in selecting trees and
ornamentals for retention or clearing:
(1) Aesthetic values (autumn coloration, type of flowers and fruit, bark
and crown characteristics, amount of dieback present).

protection zone is impossible, and/or relocation of
improvements impractical, then compensatory planting shall
be required for each viable tree within the tree protection zone
and each specimen tree anywhere on the site.
(b) Compensatory trees shall be provided in the following ratios,
based on the sum total of the diameter inches of trees being
removed. The standards are applicable to both deciduous and
§ 149-924 WESTTOWN CODE § 149-924

evergreen trees. Compensation is not required for shrubs,
unless otherwise required by the Board of Supervisors.
[1] For viable nonspecimen: one inch of new tree caliper shall
be provided for every four inches of existing tree diameter
cut or removed. For example, if a single-trunked, twentyinch
diameter oak is removed, five diameter inches shall
be replanted.
[2] For viable specimen: one inch of new tree diameter for
every one inch of existing tree diameter cut or removed.
Where it has been determined by the Zoning Officer that a
specimen tree has been or is proposed to be cut or
removed, the person responsible shall be fined no more
than $1,000.
[3] For existing street trees within the right-of-way, one tree,
with a caliper of 3 1/2 inches shall be replanted as a

developed in conformance with § 149-928 of this chapter.
B. A reduction in the number of trees or shrubs actually planted may be
authorized by the Board of Supervisors and/or Planning Commission
only after it can be demonstrated that:
(1) Planting in the quantities normally prescribed would be injurious to
existing significant tree masses or individual specimen plantings;
and
(2) Existing tree masses or individual specimen plantings have
survived all construction activities and are reasonably assured of
continued maintenance and survival.
C. Trees and shrubs shall be of nursery-grown stock of noncolumnar
varieties, and shall be insect, pest and disease resistant.

(3) Racks or holders shall be provided for all refuse containers. Such
containers, racks or holders shall be so designed as to prevent
containers from being tipped to minimize spillage and container
deterioration and to facilitate cleaning around them.
(4) All refuse shall be collected at least once weekly. Where suitable
collection service is not available from municipal or private

A. Specific intent: to avoid noise conflicts between Route 202 and new
construction.
B. When a use including dwelling units is to be constructed within 300 feet
of the future right-of-way line of U.S. Highway 202, the following
requirements shall be in effect:
(1) A continuous earthen berm shall be constructed between Route
202 and any proposed residential building sites within 300 feet of
the future right-of-way of Route 202. The berm shall be designed to
deflect noise from the highway away from any proposed
residences.
(2) The Board of Supervisors may waive the requirement for this berm
along all or part of the tract's Route 202 frontage in the following
circumstances:
(a) The applicant can prove, by submission of a detailed noise
study prepared by a professional engineer with significant
experience in noise analysis, that the berm is not needed
because the noise levels from the highway would not create a
nuisance for future residents. A noise nuisance shall be defined
as a sound level at any proposed residential building footprint
of greater than 62 dB(A) Ldn in sound level. The sound level
shall be measured at times between 3:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
(b) Construction of the berm requires the removal of numerous
mature and attractive trees.
(c) The topography of the site makes construction of the berm
unreasonable.
§ 149-928 WESTTOWN CODE § 149-929
1:414
(d) The Board determines that construction of the berm would
interfere with preservation of a significant viewshed.
(e) The berm would interfere with future logical access points to
Route 202.
(3) The design and landscaping of a required earthen berm shall be
reviewed by the Township Engineer and shall be subject to
approval by the Board based upon the following criteria:
(a) The earthen berm shall be covered with an all-season
groundcover and shall be well landscaped with evergreen trees
and shrubs.
(b) The design of the earthen berm should generally follow the
standards of the U.S. Federal Highway Administration.
(c) The berm should generally be located within the required
setback from Route 202.
(d) The berm should average 10 feet in height above the average
ground level and not have side slopes with a horizontal to
vertical ratio of less than 2.5:1. The top of the berm shall not be
less than four feet wide.
(e) The berm should vary in height and alignment, especially if
longer than 300 feet.
(f) No earthen berm shall obstruct the site distance requirements
of this chapter.
(4) The Board may require that existing trees and major vegetation
within 200 feet of the future road right-of-way not be substantially
removed or altered except as is essential for construction in order
to provide buffering and screening from highway noise.
(5) Provisions for ownership and maintenance of the berm must be
approved by the Board of Supervisors.
(6) The following definitions shall apply to the noise protection
provisions of this chapter:
A-WEIGHTING SOUND LEVEL  The sound pressure level in
decibels as measured on a sound level meter using the A-weighting
network. The level so read is designated dB(A).
DECIBEL (dB)  A unit for measuring the sound pressure level
equal to 20 times the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the
pressure of sound measured to the reference pressure, which is 20
micropascels (20 micronewtons per square meter).
Ldn  Day-night average calculated in accordance with the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
§ 149-929 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 149-929

the use of a sound level meter and frequency weighting network,
such as A, B or C, as specified in American National Standards
Institute specifications for sound level meters (ANSI S1.4-1983, or
the latest revision thereof). If the frequency weighting employed is
not indicated, the A-weighting shall apply.
SOUNDS  An oscillation in pressure, particle displacement,
particle velocity or other physical parameter, in a medium with
internal forces that causes compression and rarefaction of that
medium. The description of sound may include any characteristics

§ 154-18. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by this article shall not be imposed upon the following
transactions:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed of confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time
of condemnation, which reconveyance may include property line
adjustments provided said reconveyance is made within one year
from the date of condemnation.
(2) A document which the commonwealth is prohibited from taxing
under the Constitution or statutes of the United States.
(3) A conveyance to a municipality, Township, school district or county
pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, Township, school
district or county of a tax-delinquent property at sheriff sale or tax
claim bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded, but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties takes shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
§ 154-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 154-18
1:431
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided the property or interest therein subject to such transfer
was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife prior to
the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent and
child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and between a grandparent and
grandchild or the spouse of such grandchild, except that a
subsequent transfer by the grantee within one year shall be subject
to a tax as if the grantor were making such transfer.
(7) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration of property
passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal
representative of a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
(8) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of an
ordinary trust where the transfer of the same property would be
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all of
the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries are
contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be
granted unless the Recorder of Deeds is presented with a copy of
the trust instrument that clearly identifies the grantor and all
possible beneficiaries.

beneficiary of an ordinary trust.

successor trustee.

be imposed under this article. Where the document by which title is
acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth that
the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the benefit of
his principal there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the department reasonably determines that the

(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the LST shall annually
file an exemption certificate with the Township and with the
person's employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to
receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the
Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the
exemption certificate is filed. In the event the Township utilizes a
tax collection officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption
certificate to that officer. The exemption certificate shall have
attached to it a copy of all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2
forms from the employment within the Township for the year prior
to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be
exempted from the tax. Upon receipt of the exemption certificate
and until otherwise instructed by the Township or except as
required by Subsection A(2) below, the employer shall not withhold
the tax from the person during the calendar year or the remainder
of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies.
Employers shall ensure that the exemption certificate forms are
readily available to employees at all times and shall furnish each
new employee with a form at the time of the hiring.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the Township that the person has received earned
income and net profits from all sources within the Township equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is
otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or
upon an employer's payment to the person of earned income within
the Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that
calendar year, an employer shall withhold the LST from the person
under Subsection B(3) below.
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2) above, the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2) above, a lump sum equal to the
amount of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the
exemption claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the
per-payroll amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of
tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in
that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the Township may pursue collection under
this act.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2) above, it is the intent of this
subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating

exempting any employee from a LST.

Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township Manager or the LST Collector shall
determine eligibility for refunds to exempt persons and provide
refunds.
A. Each employer within Westtown Township, as well as those employers
situated outside Westtown Township but who engage in business within
Westtown Township, is hereby charged with the duty of collecting the
tax from each of his employees engaged by him/her or performing for
him/her within Westtown Township.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the combined rate
of the tax levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest onehundredth
of a dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll
period basis for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in
an occupation, except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For
purposes of this subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate
annual rate of the tax levied by the school district and the Township.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the LST by more than one
political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
§ 154-37 WESTTOWN CODE § 154-38
1:444
§ 154-39. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of
the tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the LST Collector. If
an employer fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the
employer makes collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions
paid by him/her or her to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this
article, the employer shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full
as though the tax had been originally levied against the employer.
§ 154-40. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his or her employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the LST Collector on or before the 30th day following the
end of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 154-41. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within Westtown Township shall be required to comply with the

year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The Township shall provide a taxpayer a
receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the Township if the failure to
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the
employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
LST in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the employer if the
employer complies with the provisions of Subsection B of § 154-37 of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the LST 30 days after the end of
each quarter of a calendar year.

person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the

ARTICLE IV
Natural Features Protection
§ 170-400. Statement of intent.
The standards and requirements in this article are intended to afford
appropriate levels of protection to those natural features within Westtown
Township that represent significant resource opportunities to the Township
and its surrounding region or which, when subject to undue disturbance,
may constitute threats to public health, safety, and welfare. The Township
considers adherence to these standards a basic prerequisite to any land
development or disturbance otherwise authorized under this chapter or
other regulations, and has designed the balance of this chapter to work in
harmony with the terms of this article. The Township reserves the right to
hire professionals, at the expense of the land owner or developer, to assess
adherence to these standards.
§ 170-401. Floodplain Regulations. [Amended 11-4-1996 by Ord.
No. 96-17; 10-16-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-3; 9-5-2017 by Ord. No.
2017-3]
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act of 1978, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
Therefore, the Board of Supervisors of the Township does hereby order
as follows.
B. Intent. The intent of this section is to:
(1) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
(2) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(3) Minimize danger to public health and safety by protecting water
supply, sanitary sewage disposal, and natural drainage.
(4) Protect the quality and quantity of surface and subsurface water
supplies adjacent to and underlying floodplain areas.
(5) Contribute to the protection of stream waters against
sedimentation; the prevention of stream bank erosion; the
maintenance of cool water temperatures; and the preservation of
fish and wildlife habitats, through the protection of trees and other
riparian vegetation.
(6) Maintain the scenic and aesthetic character of the streams and
stream valleys, consistent with the goals of the Westtown Township
Comprehensive Plan.
§ 170-400 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-401
1:511
(7) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents by preventing the unwise
design and construction of development in areas subject to
flooding.
(8) Fulfill the responsibility of the Township as a trustee of the people's
right to clean air, pure water, and the preservation of the natural,
scenic, historic and aesthetic values of the environment pursuant to
Article I, Section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.
(9) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
C. Applicability. Provisions of all other codes, ordinances, and regulations
shall be applicable insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of
this chapter and Westtown Township's need to minimize the hazards
and damage resulting from flooding. It shall be unlawful for any person,
partnership, business or corporation to undertake, or cause to be
undertaken, any construction or development anywhere subject to
floodplain regulations unless a permit has been obtained from the
floodplain administrator.
D. Establishment of floodplain regulations. Floodplain regulations shall be
applicable to those areas of Westtown Township, Chester County, which
are classified as Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (FIRMs) for Westtown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania,
as prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),
dated September 29, 2017, or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study, and the Soil Survey of Chester and Delaware Counties, as
prepared by the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil
Conservation Service. The above referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any
subsequent revisions and amendments are hereby adopted by
Westtown Township and declared to be a part of this section. Floodplain
regulations shall be comprised of three subareas, as follows:
(1) Floodway Area (F1): An area identified as the "floodway" as
established in the Flood Insurance Study referenced above and
shown on the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map as Zone AE.
The term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information for
those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the
Flood Insurance Study. The floodway area is required to carry and
discharge the waters of the base flood elevation without increasing
the water surface elevation at any point more than one foot above
existing conditions.
(2) Flood-Fringe Area (F2): An area identified as an AE Zone in the
Flood Insurance Study referenced above and shown on the
§ 170-401 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-401
1:512
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map, where a floodway has
been delineated.
(a) AE Area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
for which base flood elevations have been provided but no
floodway has been determined. No encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted in a floodway or an AE Zone
without floodway, unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance
with standard engineering practice that the proposed
development, together with all other existing and anticipated
development, would not result in an increase in flood levels
within the entire community during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
(3) General Floodplain Area (F3): An area subject to inundation by the
base flood, where a detailed study has not been performed, but
where a base flood elevation boundary has been approximated by
the Flood Insurance Study and shown as Zone A on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map referenced above. Where the specific base
flood elevation cannot be determined for this area using other
sources of data such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Floodplain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey Flood-
Prone Quadrangles, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use,
development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in
accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications,
who shall certify that the technical concepts, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Township.
(4) Revisions, amendments, and modifications.
(a) The delineation of areas subject to floodplain regulations may
be revised, amended and modified by the Westtown Township
Board of Supervisors in compliance with the National Flood
Insurance Program when:
[1] There are changes through natural or other causes.
[2] Changes are indicated by future detailed hydrologic and
hydraulic studies.
[3] Where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision.
(b) Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, the
§ 170-401 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-401
1:513
Township shall notify FEMA of the changes to the special flood
hazard area by submitting technical or scientific data.
E. Boundary dispute. Should a dispute concerning any boundary subject to
floodplain regulations arise, an initial determination shall be made by
the Zoning Officer. Any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to
the Zoning Hearing Board under the provisions of Article XXI of this
chapter. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.

route across the area subject to floodplain regulations to the
point of discharge.
(2) The following shall not be placed or caused to be placed in the
designated floodway area: fences (except that which are necessary
and appurtenant to agricultural uses and are either designed to
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters or collapse
during flood events to permit the unimpeded flow of floodwaters),
other matters which may impede, retard or change the direction of
the flow of water or that will catch or collect debris carried by such
water, or that are placed where the natural flow of the stream or
floodwaters would carry the same downstream to the damage or
detriment of either public or private property adjacent to the
floodplain. The placement of mobile homes shall not be permitted
in any designated floodway area.

permanently attached additions.
(2) No development or use of land shall be undertaken when the effect
of such development or use of land, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, would increase the water
surface elevation at any point above the base flood elevation unless
the effect of such development on flood heights is fully offset by
accompanying stream improvements which have been approved by
all appropriate local and/or state authorities. When an owner and/
or developer proposes to offset the effects of development by
construction of stream improvements or to install fill or alter or
relocate a watercourse, he/she shall submit an engineering study
prepared by a registered professional engineer which fully
evaluates the effects of such construction. The report shall use the
base flood elevation as herein defined as the basis of analysis. All
adjacent communities and the Pennsylvania Department of
Community and Economic Development shall be notified by the
developer by certified mail of all such intended activities prior to
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and the developer
shall submit copies of such notification to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. In addition, the developer shall assure the

hearing the testimony of any Township Board, Commission, or
technical advisor concerning the extent to which the proposed
use would diminish the capacity of areas subject to floodplain
regulations to store and absorb floodwaters, to moderate flood
velocities, and to accommodate sediment; be subject to flood
damage; cause erosion and impair the amenity of areas subject
to floodplain regulations; or adversely affect the area
contiguous to areas subject to floodplain regulations as well as
areas downstream; or on any other pertinent aspect of the
case.
(k) In all proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board, including
application for special exception from the provisions of this
section, the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show
that the use required will be in general conformity with the
objectives of this section, that proper safeguards will be
observed, and that the use will not be injurious to the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
(l) The applicant shall demonstrate that the use will be in
accordance with all applicable federal, state and local agency
codes, ordinances and regulations including those of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and the
Chester County Conservation District, and that permits will be
obtained from these agencies as a condition of receiving a
building or construction permit from Westtown Township for
the work identified in the application to the Zoning Hearing
Board.
(m) Upon receipt of such appeal the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider the appeal in accordance with the Municipal Planning
Code and any other local ordinance.
(n) Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Hearing
Board may seek relief therefrom by appeal to court, as
provided by the laws of this state, including the Pennsylvania
Flood Plain Management Act.
A. Intended purposes. The purposes of this section are as follows:
(1) To promote the public health, safety and welfare by the protection
of steep slope areas and by encouraging the retention of open
space located and designed so as to constitute a harmonious and
§ 170-401 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-402
1:534
appropriate part of the physical development of Westtown
Township.
(2) To permit only those uses of steep slope areas which are
compatible with the conservation of natural conditions and which
maintain stable soil conditions by minimizing disturbances to
vegetative ground covers and restricting the regrading of steep
slope areas.
(3) To limit soil erosion and the resultant destruction of the land,
siltation of streams, and damage to the property of individuals.
(4) To protect low-lying areas from flooding by limiting the increase in
stormwater runoff caused by grading of sloped areas, changes of
ground cover, or the erection of structures.
(5) To maintain the ecological integrity and habitat value of steeply
sloped areas, i.e., indigenous vegetation and wildlife, which could
be adversely affected by otherwise permitted disturbances.
(6) To allow the continuing replenishment of groundwater resources
and the maintenance of springs.
B. General provisions.
(1) Compliance. No area within the Steep Slope Conservation District
shall hereafter be used without full compliance with the terms of
this section and other applicable regulations.
(2) Steep Slope Conservation District overlay concept. The Steep Slope
Conservation District shall be deemed an overlay on any zoning
district(s) now or hereafter enacted to regulate the use of land in
Westtown Township.
(a) The Steep Slope Conservation District shall have no effect on
the permitted uses in the underlying zoning district, except
where said uses are intended to be located within the
boundaries of the Steep Slope Conservation District, as defined
herein, and said uses are in conflict with the permitted uses set
forth in this section.
(b) In those areas of the Township where the Steep Slope
Conservation District applies, the requirements of the Steep
Slope Conservation District shall supersede the requirements
of the underlying zoning district(s).
(c) Should the Steep Slope Conservation District boundaries be
changed as a result of legislative or administrative actions or
judicial decision, the zoning requirements applicable to the
area in question shall revert to the requirements of the
underlying zoning district(s) without consideration of this
section.
§ 170-402 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-402
1:535
(d) For any parcel or any part thereof on which the Steep Slope
Conservation District is an overlay, should the underlying
zoning classification(s) be changed as a result of legislative or
administrative actions or judicial decision, such change(s) in
classification shall have no effect on the boundaries of the
Steep Slope Conservation District, unless an amendment to
said boundaries was included as part of the proceedings from
which the subsequent change(s) originated.
(3) Preservation of other restrictions. It is not intended by this section
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants,
or deed restrictions. However, where this section imposes greater
restrictions, the provisions of this section shall prevail.
(4) Municipal liability. Any determination that a proposed use complies
with this chapter, or any approval of a subdivision or land
development plan, or any issuance of a building permit within or
near the Steep Slope Conservation District shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the
Township, or by any official or employee thereof, of the
practicability or safety of the proposed use and shall create no
liability upon the Township, its officials or employees. This chapter
does not imply that areas outside the Steep Slope Conservation
District boundaries or land uses permitted within said District will
always be totally free from the adverse effects of erosion, or other
effects of nearby steep slopes.
C. Designation and interpretation of district boundary.
(1) The Steep Slope Conservation District consists of two areas which
are delineated and defined as follows: [Amended 5-20-1996 by
Ord. No. 96-5]
(a) Prohibitive slope. Prohibitive slopes are those of greater than
25% delineated and measured over a six-foot or greater
difference in vertical elevation, as based on a site survey or on
the United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps of the
Regional Base Map Series of 1973 for the West Chester
Quadrangle (i.e., sloping more than 25 feet vertical over a
distance of 100 feet horizontal), where such slope exists over
any continuous horizontal distance of 50 feet or more, as
measured parallel to the contour lines.
(b) Precautionary slope. Precautionary slopes are those of 15% to
25% delineated and measured over a six-foot or greater
difference in vertical elevation, as based on a site survey or on
the United States Geological Survey Topographic Maps of the
Regional Base Map Series of 1973 for the West Chester
Quadrangle (i.e., sloping 15 to 25 feet vertical over a distance
of 100 feet horizontal), where such slope exists over any
§ 170-402 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-402
1:536
continuous horizontal distance of 50 feet or more, as measured
parallel to the contour lines.
(2) Accurate topography shall be shown. If a more detailed
topographic survey has not been completed, see the topographic
mapping of the Chester County Department of Computing and
Information Services. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
(3) Boundary interpretation and appeals procedure.
(a) Each application for construction or land disturbance within
the Steep Slope Conservation District shall be submitted in
accordance with § 170-402E(1) below. Any area of the Steep
Slope Conservation District that falls within the subject lot or
lots shall be interpolated and shown on the site plan required
under § 170-402E(1)(a) through shading of such area or areas.
The site plan shall contain a certification by the registered
professional engineer or surveyor having prepared the plan as
to the accuracy of the slopes as depicted on the plan. Areas
shown as less than 10% slope may be based on United States
Geological Survey information. Any area shown as 10% or
greater slope shall be delineated on the basis of an actual field
survey of the topography of the site.
(b) Where the exact location of the boundaries of the district in
relation to a given parcel is in question, the applicant's site
plan may be supplemented by a topographic survey of the
property and any other documentation deemed pertinent. The
Township Engineer shall evaluate all such material submitted
and shall make a written report of the results of his
determination, a copy of which shall be provided to Board of
Supervisors.
(c) Any party aggrieved by any such determination of the
Township Engineer or other decision or determination under
this section may appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The
party contesting the location of the district boundary shall
have the burden of proof in case of any such appeal.
D. Permitted uses.
(1) Standards applicable to all uses within the steep slope conservation
district.
(a) All grading shall be minimized, and no grading shall be
undertaken within any area of the Steep Slope Conservation
District except where approved in conjunction with a use
permitted under the terms of this section.
(b) Finished slopes of all cuts and fills shall not exceed 33%, unless
the applicant can demonstrate that steeper slopes can be
stabilized and maintained adequately.
§ 170-402 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-402
1:537
(2) Uses permitted in areas of prohibitive slope. The following are the
only uses permitted as of right in areas of prohibitive slope. Such
uses also shall be in compliance with the base zoning district, and
shall not involve the erection of buildings, construction of streets,
installation of sewage disposal systems, or permanent removal of
topsoil.
(a) Parks and outdoor recreational uses, consistent with the goals
of watershed protection.
(b) Logging and woodcutting, where such activity is limited to
highly selective removal of trees. Maximum precautions shall
be taken to avoid destruction of or injury to understory brush
and trees.
(c) Grading for the minimum portion of a driveway necessary to
access a single-family dwelling when it can be demonstrated
that no other routing which avoids slopes exceeding 20% is
feasible.
(d) Yard area of any permitted building, so long as such building is
itself not within the prohibitive slope area. The yard area may
not be disturbed by grading or clearing.
(3) Uses permitted in areas of precautionary slope; lot area;
impervious coverage. [Amended 5-20-1996 by Ord. No. 96-5;
3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
(a) In areas of precautionary slope, the same uses shall be allowed
as provided in the underlying zoning district.
(b) All grading of precautionary slope shall be conducted in a
manner that minimizes alteration of the landscape, that
maximizes preservation of natural vegetation and that avoids
erosion.
(c) The Zoning Officer may require that the applicant for activity
within areas of over 15% slopes submit an erosion and
sedimentation control plan for review and approval by the
Chester County Conservation District and/or Township
Engineer, and/or submittal and approval of a stormwater
management plan by the Township Engineer.
[1] The Zoning Officer shall place conditions upon any permit
to incorporate mitigation measures to ensure compliance
with this chapter and state regulations and to provide for
stable slopes, based upon any review of the Township
Engineer or Conservation District. If such reviews are
required, the applicant shall be required to fund the costs
of such reviews.
§ 170-402 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-402
1:538
[2] The procedures and standards contained in § 170-402E
shall also apply.
(d) Any vegetation removal shall be conducted in a selective
manner that minimizes erosion.
(e) Any road or driveway shall be designed in a manner that
minimizes alteration of slopes over 15%. To the maximum
extent feasible, roads and driveways shall follow the natural
topography to minimize cuts and fills.
(f) If the total of all area(s) of precautionary slopes on a lot exceed
25% of the total area of a lot, then no more than 50% of the
precautionary slopes on that lot shall be disturbed, graded or
modified.
(g) Alteration shall not occur in areas of natural springs. Alteration
shall be minimized around other important groundwater
resource features.
E. Administration. Administration of this section is governed by Article XX
of this chapter. In addition, the following requirements shall apply:
[Amended 5-20-1996 by Ord. No. 96-5; 3-3-2003 by Ord. No.
2003-2]
(1) Application procedures. Before a permit is issued for any
construction or land disturbance activity on land within or affecting
the Steep Slope Conservation District, the following material, in
full or in pertinent parts, shall be submitted for review by the
Township Engineer:
(a) An earthmoving plan of the property which indicates existing
grades with contour lines at two-foot intervals. Proposed
grades within the area of any proposed activity, disturbance, or
construction also shall be shown. All areas within the Steep
Slope Conservation District shall be shaded accordingly.
(b) A site plan indicating existing and proposed structures, other
impervious surfaces, storm drainage facilities, and retaining
walls. The site plan also shall locate and identify existing
vegetation and ground cover within areas of prohibitive and
precautionary slopes, as well as proposed landscaping material
to be installed.
(c) Architectural plans, elevations, and sections.
(d) A statement, signed and sealed by a registered architect or
engineer, explaining the building methods to be used in
overcoming foundation and other structural problems created
by slope conditions, preserving the natural watersheds, and
preventing soil erosion and excessive surface water runoff to
neighboring properties and/or streets.
§ 170-402 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-402
1:539
§ 170-403. Wetlands; soils with seasonally high water table.
(e) Plan, profile, and typical cross sections of any proposed street,
emergency access, or driveway, with the seal of a registered
professional engineer thereon.
(f) A statement, signed by the owner or future occupant at the
time of subdivision, land development, or building permit
application, that there is a full understanding of any difficulties
associated with access stemming from steep slopes.
No approval or building permit shall be authorized by the
Zoning Officer without the Township Engineer's review of this
material and his recommendation thereon.
A. Soils with seasonally high water table. No on-site sewer system, or any
portion thereof, shall be constructed or located on or within any soil
area where the seasonal high water table, according to the Soil Survey
of Chester and Delaware Counties (Soil Conservation Service, 1063), is
within one foot of the ground surface.
B. Wetlands. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
(1) Wetlands shall be determined to exist when indicated by one or
more of the following:
(a) The National Wetlands Inventory Maps, as prepared by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
(b) Hydric soils, as depicted in the Soil Survey of Chester and
Delaware Counties; and
(c) The existence of hydrophytic vegetation or hydrologic
conditions, as determined by on-site investigations.
C. Should the existence of wetlands be indicated as per the requirements
of § 170-403B(1) above, a wetlands delineation shall be performed by a
licensed professional engineer, hydrogeologist, soil scientist, or
similarly qualified professional experienced in wetlands ecology, the
selection of such at the discretion of the applicant. Plans shall be
submitted to the Township for review which show the delineation and
indicate any disturbance of wetlands anticipated. The qualifications of
the consultant performing the delineation shall be submitted with such
plans. Further, unless it is clearly evident in such plans that no
disturbance to the designated wetlands is anticipated, the delineation
performed shall be submitted to the appropriate regulatory agencies,
including but not limited to the US Army Corps of Engineers and the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) for
boundary confirmation and/or requisite wetlands permits. All potential
impacts on wetlands shall conform to applicable regulations, as
amended. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
§ 170-402 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-403
1:540
§ 170-404. Existing vegetation; management practices.
D. Should the Township conclude per the requirements of § 170-403B(1)
that wetlands exist on the site, contrary to the applicant's findings, the
Township shall, at its discretion, request that either the Corps of
Engineers or PADEP verify the Township's findings and perform a
delineation. In the event such agencies verify the Township's findings,
the applicant will be required to secure any required wetlands permits,
unless the applicant's activity clearly will not impact existing wetlands.
[Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
E. Where wetlands exist and disturbance permits and/or mitigation
activities are required, final plan approval or granting of applicable
permits from the Township shall be contingent upon the applicant
receiving all necessary permits from the PADEP. [Amended 3-3-2003
by Ord. No. 2003-2]
A. Conservation of woodlands and other vegetation.
(1) Except in conjunction with routine property maintenance,
disturbance to the following shall be minimized:
(a) Healthy, well-stocked woodlands. In instances where
disturbance or tree cutting is unavoidable or considered
desirable in accordance with sound forest management
practice, an effort shall be made, with consultation from a
qualified professional, to retain as much of the woodland as
possible, of a size and configuration which would promote its
growth and natural regeneration.
(b) Vegetation, other than woodlands, providing wildlife food and
cover or visual amenity. This may include, but not necessarily
be limited to, single or groups of specimen trees, hedgerows,
and other vegetation not considered as woodland.
(2) Disturbance or removal of vegetation occupying environmentally
sensitive areas shall be undertaken only when necessary and on a
limited, selective basis to minimize the adverse impacts of such
actions. This shall include but not necessarily be limited to
vegetation performing important soil stabilizing functions on
floodplains, stream and pond banks, and sloping lands.
B. Protection of vegetation from mechanical injury and grading change.
(1) All woody vegetation to be retained within 25 feet of a building site,
parking area, or other proposed improvement shall be protected
from equipment damage by snow fencing or other effective
barriers.
(2) Heavy equipment operators shall minimize damage to existing tree
trunks and root systems by not driving heavy equipment within the
area circumscribed by the drip line of any tree. In addition, roots
§ 170-403 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-404
1:541
shall not be cut or disturbed within the area circumscribed by the
dripline of any tree.
(3) Tree trunks and exposed roots damaged during construction shall
be protected from further damage by fencing or other structural
barrier. Treatment of damaged areas shall be dictated by the
nature of the injury, e.g., damaged bark shall be cut back to a point
where the bark is intact and tight to the tree, exposed roots shall be
cleaned up and covered with topsoil.
(4) Trees shall not be used for roping, cables, signs, or fencing. Nails
and spikes shall not be driven into trees.
(5) The area around the base of existing woody vegetation shall be left
open. No impervious cover, storage of equipment, materials,
debris, or fill shall be allowed within the dripline of any existing
tree.
(6) Grade changes to occur at any location on the property shall not
result in an alteration to soil or drainage conditions which would
adversely affect existing vegetation to be retained following site
disturbance, unless adequate provisions are made to protect such
vegetation and its root systems.
C. Protection of vegetation from excavations.
(1) When digging trenches for utility lines or similar uses, disturbance
to the root zones of all woody vegetation shall be minimized.
(2) If trenches must be excavated in the root zone, all disturbed roots
shall be cut as cleanly as possible. The trench shall be backfilled as
quickly as possible, avoiding soil compaction.
D. Vegetated area maintenance standards for all districts.
(1) Intent of regulations. It is the intent of these regulations that,
within or adjacent to predominantly residential areas, property
owners shall not permit vegetation to become overgrown to the
point of becoming unsightly and/or unhealthy. At the same time,
plants that are grown for a useful or ornamental purpose, fields in
agricultural use, and areas of significant natural value should not
be subjected to excessive, unnecessary, or hindering standards of
maintenance.
(2) Terms of management. Where applicable [as determined by
Subsection D(3) and (4) below], the following practices for the
control of vegetation on properties within Westtown Township shall
be adhered to:
(a) On developed properties, grassed areas shall be controlled to a
maximum height of 12 inches during the growing season.
§ 170-404 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-404
1:542
(b) Mowing shall be timed for the most effective control of the
specific vegetation (e.g., ragweed and Canada thistle to be
mowed in midsummer before flower buds are set).
(c) Selective control of noxious vegetation, as defined, may be
practiced by means other than mowing. Selective control shall
include the following, in order of preferred method: hand
pulling, mechanical removal, burning, trimming; use of
herbicides shall be the least preferable means of control. No
method shall be used which would completely strip vegetation
off the soil.
(3) Conditions of applicability.
(a) Except as exempted under Subsection D(4) below, the terms of
this section shall apply to:
[1] Any lot within a subdivision or land development in which
average lot size is two acres or less; or
[2] Any preexisting lot of two acres or less, whether or not
created through a prior subdivision.
(b) Lots shall be considered established, for purposes of this
section, upon final approval by the Township and recording in
the office of the Recorder of Deeds of Chester County.
(4) Exemptions from the terms of this section.
(a) Character of the lot: uses, existing vegetation. The terms of
this section, where otherwise applicable, may be waived when
a lot, or portion thereof, exhibits one or more of the following
uses and/or vegetative characteristics:
[1] Floodplain (as delineated in § 170-401 of this chapter) or
marsh;
[2] Meadow, wildflower meadow, berry patch;
[3] Hedgerow;
[4] Agriculture, including land left fallow for up to one year;
and
[5] Areas undergoing a directed process of natural
succession.
(b) Character of abutting uses.
[1] The terms of this section may be waived where:
[a] None of the lands abutting or across a road from the
lot are being put to development uses (residential,
institutional, commercial, industrial); or

§ 170-406. Topsoil retention.
[b] All abutting developed lands are owned by (and
occupied by no one other than) the party owning the
lot in question, and/or abutting landowners waive
enforcement of the terms of this section against the
lot.
[2] The waivers in Subsection D(4)(a) and (b) above shall not
apply to that portion of the lot within 50 feet of an existing
road surface, said portion still requiring vegetation control
as per § 170-404D(2) above.
(5) Enforcement.
(a) Interpretation, administration, and enforcement of the terms
of this section shall be the responsibility of the Westtown
Township Zoning Officer. Any appeal from his decision shall be
handled in accordance with the terms of Article XXI of this
chapter.
(b) In evaluating the applicability of these requirements and
exemptions, the Zoning Officer shall, as he/she deems
necessary, consult with the Township Engineer or other
organizations or individuals with conservation expertise. Such
consultation shall, to the maximum extent possible, involve the
affected landowner, and shall be conducted for the purpose of
attaining the greatest consistency with the stated intent of
these regulations.
E. This § 170-404 shall not apply to forestry that meets the requirements
of § 170-408. [Added 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
F. Subdivision and land development. See also the tree preservation and
replacement requirements in § 149-924D of the Township Code.
[Added 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
A. In any use or development of a tract where permanent open space is to
be created and/or retained, the landowner or applicant shall, whenever
possible and in conjunction with other applicable ordinances, include in
such open space those agriculturally suited soils whose acreage,
configuration, and location offer future opportunity for agricultural use.
B. In the siting of individual structures on lots, areas of agriculturally
suited soils should be left free of structures or paving whenever
possible, to allow opportunities for gardens and other agricultural uses.
A. Permission to remove required. No person shall excavate or otherwise
remove topsoil for sale or for use other than on the premises from
which the topsoil shall be taken, except in connection with the
§ 170-404 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-406
1:544
construction or alteration of a building on such premises in conjunction
with an approved plan, and excavation or grading incidental thereto,
without first having procured permission therefor from the Board of
Supervisors.
B. Application.
(1) The Board of Supervisors shall not consider any application for the
removal of topsoil from the premises for sale or otherwise unless
and until the owner of the premises shall first file with the Zoning
Officer an application requesting such permission, together with a
map of the premises prepared by a registered surveyor, showing
the contour lines and proposed contour grades resulting from such
intended removal of topsoil in relation to the topography of the
premises, and the proposed contour lines, proposed grades, and an
estimate of the amount of topsoil in cubic yards to be removed,
shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the Board of
Supervisors.
(2) An erosion and sedimentation control plan and erosion control
permit approved by the Chester County Conservation District must
accompany the application for the removal of topsoil from the
premises.
(3) No such permission for topsoil removal shall be issued until such
map plan and permit has been filed, and until the proposed contour
lines and grades have been approved by the Board of Supervisors.
C. Review procedure. A hearing before the Board of Supervisors shall be
granted to an applicant for permission to remove topsoil within 30 days
after the applicant request such a hearing. The Board of Supervisors in
considering and reviewing the application and in arriving at its decision
shall be guided and take into consideration the public health, safety or
general welfare and particular consideration shall be given to the
following factors.
(1) Soil erosion by water and wind.
(2) Drainage.
(3) Soil fertility.
(4) Lateral support slopes and grades of abutting streets and lands.
(5) Land values and land uses.
(6) Such other factors that may relate to the public health, safety or
general welfare.
D. If after examining the application and the map provided for in
§ 170-406B(2) of this chapter, and after the hearing in the event a
hearing is requested by the applicant, and the Board of Supervisors is
of the opinion that the proposed topsoil removal will not create
§ 170-406 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-406
1:545
conditions inimical to the public health, welfare or safety, and will
not result in the creation of any sharp declivities, pits or depressions,
topsoil erosion or fertility problems, depressed land values, nor create
any drainage, sewerage problems or other conditions of danger,
permission to remove the topsoil shall be granted.
E. Conduct of operation:
(1) If permission to remove the topsoil shall be granted, the owner or
person in charge shall so conduct the operations that there shall be
no sharp declivities, pits or depressions and in such a manner that
the area shall be properly leveled off, cleared of debris, and graded
to conform with the contour lines and grades as approved by the
Board of Supervisors.
(2) The topsoil removal operations shall not be permitted within 60
feet of a property line.
(3) The owner of the premises or the person in charge of the removal of
topsoil, when permission has been duly granted, shall not remove
from the premises the top layer of arable soil to a depth of six
inches, but such top layer of arable soil to a depth of six inches shall
be set side for retention on the premises, and shall be respread
over the premises when the rest of the soil has been removed,
pursuant to levels and contour lines approved by the Board of
Supervisors.
(4) The soil removal operation may not take place during the months of
December, January, and February.
(5) Dust and mud on public roads resulting from the topsoil removal
operation shall be removed or controlled within 24 hours of notice
by the Township to the owner or person in charge.
(6) All areas where topsoil has been stored, or removed and respread
shall be reseeded with an appropriate ground cover within 30 days.
F. Permit required:
(1) No excavation shall be made and no topsoil shall be removed under
the provisions of this chapter unless a permit therefor shall have
been first obtained as provided herein, and no excavation shall be
made and no topsoil shall be removed except in conformity with the
provisions of this section and Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land
Development. At the time of application, a fee to the order of the
Township shall be paid by the applicant for the permit for removal
of the topsoil from the premises. Said fee shall be as provided for in
§ 170-2304 of this chapter.
(2) In the event of refusal of the topsoil removal permit the fee paid by
the applicant shall be refunded, except that all monies and costs
incurred by the Township for engineering surveys and reports,

§ 170-800. Statement of intent.
§ 170-801. Use regulations.
A. In addition to the goals presented in the general purpose and the
community development objectives sections of this chapter, the purpose
of this district is to make specific provisions for appropriate multifamily
residential, limited office and visual arts center uses in selected
locations, particularly along major highways, which can serve as logical
transitional districts between single-family residential development and
areas of heavier traffic, and which produce fewer hazards and less
interference with highway traffic than conventional commercial areas
by: [Amended 12-16-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-6]

multifamily residential development;
(3) Accommodating increased population on smaller tracts of land
while preserving open space;
(4) Providing for a balance of choice in residential structural types and
to provide for adequate traffic, fire, landscaping, and screening
controls, so as to present an attractive and safe addition to
residential development patterns in the Township; and
(5) Providing for office uses that produce fewer hazards and less
interference with highway traffic than traditional commercial uses
and are thereby compatible with high-density residential
development.
(6) Providing for a visual arts center (VAC) use that promotes,
educates, entertains, informs and advances the visual arts in the
community.

substantial visual screen within five years from the date of approval
of the plan by the Board.
(4) Off-street parking space may be provided as an individual garage or
carport or a parking area adjacent to or near the apartment it
serves, but not closer than 20 feet to the apartment wall, except
when located within the apartment house.
(5) Parking access shall be screened by a masonry wall, fence, or
appropriately landscaped area, with a height of not less than six
feet. No parking space shall be located within any front yard,
except that parking areas may be located within 10 feet of front lot
lines, provided that the parking areas are screened by a continuous
solid masonry wall, not less than six feet high and interrupted only
at entrances and exits.

ARTICLE IX
Flexible Development Procedure
§ 170-900. Statement of intent.
A. In addition to the general goals listed in the preamble and the
community development objectives, the Board acknowledges that the
technology of land development and the demand for housing is
undergoing substantial and rapid change, and recognizes the
applicability of the objectives set forth in Article VII of Act 247, the
Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10701 et seq).
B. Therefore, the specific intent of this article is to:88
(1) Encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so
that the growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety
in type, design, and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and
more efficient use of open space ancillary to said dwellings;
(2) Provide greater opportunities for better housing and recreation for
all who are or will be residents of the Township;
(3) Encourage a more efficient use of land and public service and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the
economies so secured may enure to the benefit of those who need
homes;
(4) Encourage more flexible land development which will respect and
conserve natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains,
groundwater, wooded areas, steeply sloped areas, and areas of
unusual beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem;
(5) Encourage innovations in residential developments that are
designed to minimize energy consumption and maximize recycling
of materials in their layout, transportation, climate control, energy
sources, and solid and liquid waste treatment systems; and
(6) Provide a procedure which can relate the type, design, and layout
of residential development to the particular site and the particular
demand for housing existing at the time of development in a
manner consistent with the preservation of the property values
within existing residential areas, and to assure that the increased
flexibility of regulations over land development established hereby
is carried out pursuant to sound, expeditious, and fair
administrative standards and procedures.
88.Editor's Note: Former Subsection B(1), regarding uniform treatment, which immediately
followed, was repealed 9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1. This ordinance also redesignated
former Subsection B(2) through (7) as B(1) through (6), respectively.

§ 170-901. Applicability of flexible development procedure.
[Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
For purposes of this article, the flexible development procedure is defined
as applying to:
§ 170-902. Applicability to base zoning districts.
A. Land under single ownership, planned and developed as a whole;
B. In a single development operation or a programmed series of
development operations including all lands and buildings;
C. Dwellings and related subordinate facilities;
D. Comprehensive and detailed plans which include not only streets,
utilities, lots or building sites, and the like, but also site plans, site
analyses, floor plans and elevations for all buildings as intended to be
located, constructed, used and related to each other, detailed plans for
other uses and improvements on the land as related to the buildings,
lighting, landscaping; and
E. A program for provision, operation and maintenance of such areas,
improvements, and facilities as will be for common use by some or all of
the occupants of the development, but will not be provided, operated or
maintained at general public expense unless acceptable to or found
necessary by the Board of Supervisors.
A. Where approved by the Board of Supervisors as a conditional use, the
flexible development procedure may be applied in the A/C Agricultural/
Cluster Residential District and the R-1 Residential District where
tracts suitable in location and character for the proposed development
are to be developed under a unified plan, in accordance with the
requirements and procedures set forth herein. In consideration of
conditional use approval, the Board of Supervisors shall determine the
reasonableness of the increase in density potentially authorized under
this section, in the context of the physical characteristics of the site,
and in the context of justification of increased density through provision
for additional public and/or private amenities and/or through increased
efficiency in public services. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No.
2003-2]
B. Unified tract(s) of land for flexible development may be of any size.
Flexible development on tract(s) containing less than 10 acres shall be
permitted to include only residential uses consisting of single-family
detached dwellings and shall not be eligible for bonus density as
otherwise provided in § 170-904A(2) herein. [Amended 3-3-2003 by
Ord. No. 2003-2]
C. Flexible development shall be appropriately located with respect to the
general pattern of community development, existing or proposed, and
to public and private facilities and services, existing or clearly to be

1:578
§ 170-903. Permitted uses. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
The uses permitted in a flexible development shall be subject to conditional
use approval and shall be limited to:
available by the time development reaches the stage where they will be
required. The following specific requirements shall be met:
(1) Flexible development shall be so located with respect to major
streets and highways or other transportation facilities as to provide
direct access to such developments without creating traffic along
minor streets in residential neighborhoods outside such
developments.
(2) The site shall be suitable for development in the manner proposed
without hazards to persons or property, on or off the site, from
probability of flooding, erosion, subsidence or slipping of the soil,
or other dangers, annoyances, or inconveniences. Condition of soil,
groundwater level, drainage and topography shall be appropriate
to both kind and pattern of use intended.
(3) Each area of land to be developed pursuant to this article shall be
in one ownership, except that an area made up of two or more
parcels in separate ownership may be so developed provided that
all applications made under this article with respect to any portion
of the area shall be the joint application of all of the landowners. If
an area is developed with two or more parcels, all parcels shall be
contiguous to each other. In the event of development of two or
more parcels under one application, the owners shall present a
written agreement which agreement shall have been recorded and
shall run with the land, that the development will be in accordance
with a single plan with common authority and common
responsibility.
D. The location and conformity of the area shall be such that the flexible
development thereof pursuant to this article would be consistent with
the Westtown Township Comprehensive Plan.
A. Single-family detached dwellings.
B. Twin dwellings.
C. Multifamily dwellings, including four-family dwellings and townhouse
or single-family attached dwellings, but excluding apartment dwellings
in the R-1 District. In the A/C District, apartment dwellings shall be
permitted where located not less than 200 feet from any existing public
road or highway bordering the tract subject to flexible development and
not less than 100 feet from the boundary of any adjacent lot or tract
whereupon any single-family detached dwelling exists. [Amended
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
§ 170-902 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-903
1:579
§ 170-904. Density standards. [Amended 12-5-1994 by Ord. No.
94-6; 5-1-1995 by Ord. No. 95-2; 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
The following standards shall govern the density of dwelling units on the
land in flexible development:
D. Agricultural use, in accordance with the provisions of § 170-1609 of this
chapter. A principal dwelling may be permitted on the same premises as
a principal agricultural use.
E. Farm-related business meeting the requirements of § 170-1616.
F. Open space and/or noncommercial recreational uses deemed
appropriate by the Board of Supervisors for incorporation into the
design of the development.
G. Building, structures, and/or uses owned or operated by Westtown
Township.
H. If a flexible development meets the age restrictions for residents that
apply to an adult community development, the flexible development
also may include the following uses:
(1) Community center facility.
(2) Swimming club.
(3) Uses or facilities customarily accessory to an age-restricted adult
community and primarily intended to serve residents of the
development and their occasional invited guests.
I. Uses customarily accessory to permitted residential, agricultural and
open space uses. As a condition of approval, the Board may specifically
limit accessory uses potentially available to dwellings other than singlefamily
detached dwellings and may require the applicant for flexible
development to establish appropriate restrictions and/or covenants.
A. Permitted base density and potential bonus density.
(1) Base density. In a flexible development, subject to compliance with
all applicable standards, criteria and requirements herein, and as a
condition of conditional use approval, the Board of Supervisors may
approve a plan that provides for a greater number of dwelling units
per acre than would be permitted by the Township zoning
regulations otherwise applicable to the subject tract(s). Except
where bonus density is permitted subject to the provisions of
§ 170-904A(2) below, the maximum density computed over the
entire flexible development shall not exceed 1.1 dwelling units per
acre of tract area, calculated in accordance with the provisions of
§ 170-1519B of this chapter. In calculating density, including bonus
density where applicable, fractions shall be rounded to the next
lower whole number.
§ 170-903 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-904
1:580
(2) Bonus density. The maximum density established in accordance
with § 170-904A(1) above may be further increased, where
approved by the Board of Supervisors subject to conditional use
approval, and in accordance with the standards herein. Bonus
density for any purpose shall be added to the base density,
calculated in dwelling units per acre. Bonus density shall not be
construed as a multiplier to be applied to the base density
calculation. Any use of bonus density shall be subject to compliance
with the performance standards of § 170-904A(3). In no case shall
the maximum total density exceed 1.5 dwelling units per acre of
tract area, notwithstanding the ability of the applicant to
potentially justify further density increase based on provisions in
§ 170-904A(2)(a) and/or (b) below:
(a) For every 5% of the gross area of the tract that is permanently
preserved as common open space above the minimum
established under § 170-904C below and meeting the criteria
of § 170-904A(3), the maximum density may be increased by
0.075 dwelling units per acre. For example, if 50% of the gross
area of a tract in the R-1 District proposed to be developed for
single-family detached dwellings is provided as common open
space, representing an addition of two increments of 5% each
(40 + 5 + 5), then the maximum density may be increased to
1.25 dwelling units per acre (1.1 + 0.075 + 0.075).
(b) In addition, a maximum density bonus of up to 0.3 dwelling
units per acre above the density that would otherwise be
permitted shall be approved if the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that the applicant will
complete or fund substantial public improvements to mitigate
one or more significant off-site impacts of the development.
[1] Substantial public improvements shall be limited to
improvements to public streets, public recreation and
open space, public water supply systems, public sanitary
sewage systems, and public stormwater management
systems which are identified by the Township at the time of
the conditional use approval process and which will
significantly reduce the need for public expenditures to
resolve a clear public need. In consideration of potential
substantial public improvements, the Township shall give
preference to such improvements as clearly benefit the
neighborhood(s) most immediately affected by the
proposed flexible development. Provision of additional
open space resulting in the approval of bonus density
under § 170-904A(2)(a) above shall not also be considered
a substantial public improvement.
[2] No density bonus shall be granted for any improvement(s)
that an applicant for a development would otherwise be
required to complete or fund under a Township, Township
§ 170-904 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-904
1:581
Authority, state or federal requirement. For example, in
the case of public street improvements, no density bonus
shall be granted for improvements to a segment of an
existing street immediately adjacent to the applicant's
property where such improvements would otherwise be
required by the Township and/or the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation.
[3] At the time of conditional use application, the applicant
shall identify the specific proposed substantial public
improvement(s) for which bonus density is requested and
shall indicate the anticipated cost(s) of completing
proposed substantial public improvement(s). [Amended
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
[4] The amount of density bonus granted for any substantial
public improvement(s) shall not exceed the maximum
incremental density increase calculated as set forth in
§ 170-904A(2)(b) above and shall be established by the
Board of Supervisors as a condition of approval based on a
preponderance of evidence as follows: Bonus density,
measured in an incremental increase in dwelling units,
shall be determined by roughly equating the incremental
cost to the developer of providing substantial public
improvement(s), with a reasonable value to the developer
for the increase in unit count. [Amended 9-15-2008 by
Ord. No. 2008-1]
[5] Commitment to complete or fund any substantial public
improvement(s) shall be in a legally binding form
acceptable to the Township Solicitor.
(c) Special bonus density for historic preservation. In addition to
the maximum total permitted density, including bonus density
as provided in § 170-904A(2)(a) and (b) above, and not subject
to the overall density cap of 1.5 dwelling units per acre,
additional dwelling units may be approved as follows: [Added
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
[1] Bonus dwelling units for preservation of historic sites and
landscapes. One additional dwelling unit may be provided
for each two acres comprising a lot (or open space parcel)
which contains any Township-, state- or federally
designated historic site or historic building or any historic
site or building included or eligible for inclusion in the
Chester County Historic Sites Survey and where such
acreage otherwise meets all applicable criteria for open
space. The use of this bonus shall be limited to no more
than four bonus dwelling units for each distinct historic
landscape preserved and shall be subject to the following
criteria:
§ 170-904 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-904
1:582
[a] The Township shall approve the configuration of the
lot and/or restricted open space created to
accommodate preservation of the historic landscape,
which shall include, at a minimum, those portions of
the property that contain outbuildings or ruins
associated with the historical use of the principal
historic building(s) and/or those areas of greatest
public visibility.
[b] In order to be eligible for this bonus, the historical
setting, including all acreage used to calculate bonus
dwelling units, and the principal facades of any
historical structures shall be preserved through
establishment of a conservation easement acceptable
to the Township. Such easement shall be recorded
prior to or simultaneously with the recording of
approved land development plans and prior to
issuance of building permits, as applicable, for any
situation where this bonus shall be utilized.
[c] Land(s) utilized for calculation of this bonus also may
be counted toward the calculation of required or
bonus open space, where applicable open space,
criteria are met.
[2] Additional bonus dwelling units for historic restoration/
rehabilitation. Where preservation of historic sites, as
provided in § 170-904A(2)(c)[1] above, includes
restoration or rehabilitation of historic structures
approved by the Township, one additional dwelling unit
may be provided for each 2,000 square feet, or portion
thereof exceeding 1,000 square feet, of habitable floor
area on all floor levels in the historic sections of such
structures, subject to the following requirements:
[a] Eligible structures shall have been used historically as
principal residential or agricultural structures or
structures accessory to a principal residential use and
shall be included or be eligible for inclusion as part of
a Township-, state- or federally designated historic
site or shall be included in the Chester County
Historic Sites Survey;
[b] For the purposes of this section, measurement of
habitable floor area may include previously
nonhabitable space converted or to be converted to
habitable floor area as a result of rehabilitation (e.g.,
barn space converted into habitable floor area);
[c] The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of
the Township, submitting copies of appropriate plans
§ 170-904 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-904
1:583
and other documentation as necessary, that such
structures have been or shall be restored and/or
rehabilitated in accordance with plans prepared by
a qualified restoration architect and in general
compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation of Historic Structures;
[d] All principal facades of eligible historic structures
shall be preserved through establishment of
conservation easement(s) acceptable to the Township;
[e] This bonus shall not apply if the integrity and scale of
eligible historic structures have been or will be altered
by additions that overwhelm their historic integrity
due to the size of such addition(s) or to the use of
modern or inappropriately scaled or proportioned
materials, including exterior skins, windows, doors,
chimneys, porches, and other features.
[3] Limitation to use of historic preservation bonus. No
historic preservation bonus shall be applicable if the
owner or developer of the subject property shall, or has
within three years of the development application period
or during actual development, and without the express
approval of the Township, destroyed or demolished any
historic site or historic building identified on the Chester
County Historic Sites Survey or other relevant study on file
with the Township.
(3) Performance standards for use of bonus density. In addition to all
other applicable standards of this chapter, conditional use approval
for any flexible development utilizing bonus density in accordance
with § 170-904A(2) shall be subject to compliance with the
following standards and criteria unless modified at the discretion of
the Board of Supervisors; the applicant shall submit plan(s),
narrative and graphic material(s) as necessary to adequately
demonstrate compliance with these standards:
(a) Open space. In addition to compliance with all other applicable
criteria herein, and in particular the standards of § 170-907,
the following additional standards shall be applied to open
space within any flexible development utilizing bonus density:
[1] All open space used toward calculation of compliance with
minimum open space requirements shall comply with all
applicable standards separately from any additional open
space that is utilized toward calculation of bonus density.
[2] All open space used incrementally toward calculation of
bonus density as provided in § 170-904A(2)(a) shall, in
addition to full compliance with all other applicable
standards herein, fully exclude from calculation of open
§ 170-904 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-904
1:584
space area any existing or proposed impervious surfaces,
stormwater management facilities, wetlands, water
bodies, watercourses, prohibitive slope (including created
slopes exceeding 25%), and any lands subject to floodplain
regulations. [Amended 9-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-3]
(b) Scenic views.
[1] Historical landscapes and scenic views within or across
any tract subject to flexible development shall be
protected to the greatest extent practicable.
[2] Introduced landscaping, utilizing predominantly native
vegetation and replicating landscape features
characteristic to Westtown and its environs, shall be used
to mitigate scenic impacts of development from public
roads and neighboring residential properties where such
views shall be altered by proposed development, grading,
or other improvements necessary to accommodate
proposed development. For purposes of this subsection,
mitigation shall not require a complete visual screen,
where the Township agrees that a filtered or diffuse screen
is augmented by other landscaping or site conditions to
deflect prominent lines of sight from development impacts
or otherwise minimize the visual impacts of development.
(c) Stormwater management.
[1] Stormwater management facilities shall be designed to
optimize the capture of stormwater at the sources of
generation, maximize recharge to the subsurface
groundwater system and minimize discharge to surface
water flow. Guidance for stormwater management shall
use the most current best management practices such as
those promulgated by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection.
[2] Collectively, in addition to compliance with the design
criteria for stormwater management set forth in Chapter
149 of the Code of the Township of Westtown, the design of
stormwater management facilities across the tract subject
to flexible development shall result in groundwater
infiltration of stormwater equal in volume to the
incremental increase of the two-year storm,
predevelompent to postdevelopment. For purposes of
calculating the predevelopment volume of the two-year
storm, predevelopment land cover conditions shall be
assumed to be woodland-good for any area predominantly
under cover of trees and meadow-good for any other area,
regardless of actual cover conditions. The applicant shall
be required to submit soil percolation test results and
§ 170-904 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-904
1:585
other credible evidence including a maintenance program
satisfactory to demonstrate long-term feasibility of
required groundwater infiltration. Where groundwater
infiltration of the full incremental volume of the two-year
storm is not practicable, the Township may require
employment of other means to mitigate potential
groundwater impacts.
B. The amount of acreage contained within the tract area, for purposes of
calculating maximum density within a flexible development, shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions of § 170-1519A of this
chapter.
C. The following percentages of the gross area of the tract shall be set
aside as common open space for the use and benefit of the residents of
the development and/or Township:
(1) A/C Agricultural/Cluster Residential District: 60%. [Amended
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
(2) R-1 Rural-Suburban Residential District, where single-family
detached dwellings are provided: 40%.
(3) R-1 Rural-Suburban Residential District, where twin dwellings are
provided: 50%.
(4) R-1 Rural-Suburban Residential District, where permitted
multifamily dwellings are provided: 60%. Where more than one
dwelling unit type is provided in the R-1 District, the minimum
open space shall be calculated proportionally to the relative
proportion of each unit type, as provided in Subsection C(3), (4)
and/or (5) above. Additional open space also may be required as a
condition of approval of applicable bonus densities.
D. A developer may construct flexible development in stages if the
following criteria are met:
(1) The application for conditional use approval covers the entire
flexible development and shows the location and approximate time
of construction for each stage, in addition to other information
required by this chapter.
(2) At least 15% of the dwelling units in the plan given conditional use
approval are included in each stage, unless otherwise approved by
the Board of Supervisors.
(3) The second and subsequent stages are completed consistent with
the plans accompanying conditional use application and are of such
size and location, including a sufficient degree of completion of the
road network and other infrastructure, that they constitute
economically sound units of development.
§ 170-904 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-904
1:586
(4) Each stage shall include common open space in amounts and at
locations deemed acceptable by the Board to meet, at minimum,
the open space needs generated by that stage and to assure
protection of the sensitive features of the tract.
(5) In the case of a flexible development proposed to be developed over
a period of years, a variation in each stage to be developed from the
density of use established for the entire flexible development may
be permitted. A greater concentration of density of land use within
one or more stages of development may be allowed, whether it be
earlier or later in the development than others, provided that final
approval shall not be given to any stage if the residential density of
the area which includes stages already finally approved and the
stage for which final approval is being sought exceeds by more than
20% the residential density allowed for the entire flexible
development in the tentatively approved plan. In no case shall a
flexible development be developed over a period greater than three
years, unless an extension is approved by the Board of Supervisors.
E. The following standards apply to the housing sites within the flexible
development:
(1) Single-family detached dwellings, twin dwellings and permitted
multifamily dwellings may be arranged so as to provide for
individual lots for each unit, or may be arranged as rental units or
condominiums. Sufficient yard areas shall be set aside and
designated on the plan for each type of housing, so that on an
average throughout the development:
(a) The maximum net residential density for permitted multifamily
areas shall not exceed 10 dwelling units per acre of tract area
designated for such use.
(b) The maximum net residential density for twin dwelling units
shall not exceed six dwelling units per acre of tract area
designated for such use.
(c) The maximum net residential density for single-family
detached housing areas shall not exceed four units per acre of
tract area designated for such use.
(d) The acreage set aside for common open space rights-of-way of
public streets shall not be used for computation of net
residential density for any residential use.
(2) Permitted multifamily dwellings shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with the following standards:
(a) Maximum dimensions. No row of townhouses or single
structure containing single-family attached dwellings shall
exceed 120 feet in any dimension, nor shall exceed five
dwellings in a single structure or continuous row. No other
§ 170-904 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-904
1:587
structure containing permitted multifamily dwellings shall
exceed 100 feet in any dimension.
(b) All buildings within an integrated townhouse development
shall be set back from the right-of-way line of any street the
development abuts a distance of not less than 100 feet.
(c) Maximum impervious coverage. Not more than 45% of the
gross area of the tract shall be covered by impervious surfaces.
(d) Design standards.
[1] Streets within an integrated townhouse development shall
be designed in accordance with the terms of Chapter 149,
Subdivision and Land Development; provisions for the
maintenance of any private streets shall be an essential
part of the plan for development. The Township may, but is
not required to, accept dedication of the streets within the
integrated townhouse development for public use. It may
require the posting of security in an amount and form
satisfactory to it for the construction of such streets, as set
forth in Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land Development.
[2] Parking requirements.
[a] Except where part of a shared parking arrangement
authorized under the terms of Article XVII, all
required off-street parking shall be developed within
the boundaries of the townhouse development tract.
[b] Parking for each dwelling unit shall be provided either
at the rear of the unit or shall be grouped into one or
more parking areas serving a number of dwelling
units. Individual curb cuts shall be permitted only for
access to garages contained in units. Other front yard
parking and individual curb cuts at the street line for
access to parking shall be discouraged.
[c] Provisions for pedestrian circulation paths from the
parking lot(s) to the buildings shall be provided. These
paths shall be constructed of an all-weather surface.
[d] No parking space shall be more than 250 feet from an
entrance to the building it serves.
[3] Screening: As required by § 170-1508 of this chapter.
[4] Storage: As required by § 170-1509 of this chapter.
[5] Landscaping: As required by § 170-1507 of this chapter.
[6] Access and traffic control. Routes for vehicular and
pedestrian access and parking shall be designed and
§ 170-904 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-904
1:588
situated so as to create no nuisances or detractions from
privacy. Design of the site shall comply further with the
standards in §§ 170-1510, 170-1511, 170-1512, and
170-1513 of this chapter. Townhouse structures shall be
arranged so as to reduce the amount of roads required
to serve the development and to provide for an adequate
open space design.
(3) The developer shall make adequate provision for the maintenance
of buildings and land within yard areas set aside for condominium
development by the organization of a condominium corporation
with the responsibility for collection of sufficient levies or fees to
pay the cost of such maintenance. Such maintenance may be
conducted in conjunction with the requirements of § 170-908,
where a condominium corporation owns and maintains common
open space. Any such terms and provisions shall be consistent with
the requirements of the Uniform Condominium Act of 1980.89
(4) All housing shall be designed with regard to topography and
natural features of the site in conjunction with the requirements of
§ 170-905A. The effects of prevailing winds, seasonal temperatures,

(1) Ownership of a portion of the open space may be retained by the
developer and/or the original owner of the development tract,
provided that the open space and recreational needs of the
residents are adequately met by that portion not retained. The
developer and/or original owner of the tract shall make this
determination; however, the Board, at its discretion, may require
that the developer and/or original owner of the tract put aside more
open space for the use of the residents if, in its opinion, the amount
set aside by the developer and/or original landowner is not
sufficient.
(2) The following standards shall apply to that portion of open space
(common open space) not retained by the developer and/or original
owner:
(a) Ownership. Any of the following methods may be used, either
individually or together, to preserve, own, and maintain
common open space: condominium, homeowners' association,
dedication in fee simple, dedication of easements, and transfer
of fee simple title and easements to a private conservation
organization. Such land shall not be eligible for transfer to
another party except for transfer to another method of
ownership permitted under this section, and then only where
there is no change in the open space ratio. The following
specific requirements are associated with each of the various
methods:
[1] Homeowners' association. The common open space may
be held in common ownership by a homeowners'
association. This method shall be subject to all of the
provisions for homeowners' associations set forth in
Subsection B(2)(b) below, and the homeowners'
association agreement shall be recorded.
[2] Fee simple dedication. The Township may, but shall not be
required to, accept any portion or portions of the common
§ 170-907 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-907
1:596
open space, provided such land is accessible to the
residents of the Township, there is no cost of acquisition
(other than any costs incidental to the transfer of
ownership, such as title insurance), and the Township
agrees to and has access to maintain such lands. As a
condition of approval of any flexible development, the
Board of Supervisors may require that a maximum of 20%
of the required common open space be dedicated to the
Township for recreational purposes. [Amended 3-3-2003
by Ord. No. 2003-2]
[3] Transfer to a private conservation organization. With
permission of the Township, an owner may transfer either
the fee simple title, with appropriate deed restrictions
running in favor of the Township, or a conservation
easement to a private nonprofit organization, among
whose purposes is to conserve open space land and/or
natural resources, provided the organization is acceptable
to the Township is a bona fide conservation organization
with perpetual existence; the conveyance contains
appropriate provision for proper reverter or retransfer in
event that the organization becomes unwilling or unable to
continue carrying out its functions; and a maintenance
agreement acceptable to the Township is reached.
[4] Dedication of easements. The Township may, but shall not
be required to, accept easements for public use of any
portion or portions of open space land, title to which is to
remain in ownership by condominium or homeowners'
association, provided that such land is accessible to the
residents of the Township; there is no cost of acquisition
(other than any costs incidental to the transfer of
ownership, such as title insurance); and a maintenance
agreement acceptable to the Township is reached.
[5] Condominium. The common open space may be controlled
through the use of condominium agreements. Such
agreements shall be in conformance with the Uniform
Condominium Act of 1980 (68 Pa.C.S.A. § 3107 et seq.). All
such common open space land shall be held as "common
element."
(b) Maintenance.
[1] In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain common open space, or any successor
organization, shall at any time after establishment of the
development fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
development plan, the Township may serve written notice
upon such organization or upon the residents and owners
§ 170-907 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-907
1:597
of the development, setting forth the manner in which
the organization has failed to maintain the common open
space in reasonable condition, and said notice shall
include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance
be cured within 30 days thereof, and shall state the date
and place of a hearing thereon which shall be held within
14 days of the notice. At such hearing the Township may
modify the terms of the original notice as to the
deficiencies and may give an extension of time within
which they shall be corrected. If the deficiencies set forth
in the original notice or in the modifications thereof shall
not be corrected within said 30 days or any extension
thereof, the Township, in order to preserve the taxable
values of the properties within the development and to
prevent the common open space from becoming a public
nuisance, may, in its discretion, enter upon said common
open space and maintain the same for a period of one
year. Said entry and maintenance shall not constitute a
taking of said common open space, and shall not vest in
the public any rights to use the common open space except
when the same is voluntarily dedicated to the public by the
residents and owners and such dedication is acceptable
to the Township. Before the expiration of said year, the
Township shall, upon its initiative or upon the request
of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the common open space, call a public
hearing upon notice to such organization, or to the
residents and owners of the development, to be held by
the Township, at which hearing such organization or the
residents and owners of the development shall show cause
why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the
election of the Township, continue for a succeeding year.
If the Township shall determine that such organization is
ready and able to maintain said common open space in
reasonable condition, the Township shall cease to maintain
said common open space at the end of said year. If the
Township shall determine such organization is not ready
and able to maintain said common open space in a
reasonable condition, the Township may, in its discretion,
continue to maintain said common open space during the
next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and
determination, in each year thereafter. The decision of the
Township in any case shall constitute a final administrative
decision subject to judicial review.
[2] The cost of such maintenance and enforcement
proceedings by the Township shall be assessed ratably
against the properties within the development that have a
right of enjoyment of the common open space and shall
become a lien on said properties. Said assessments or

of entering upon such said common open space for the
purpose of maintenance, shall file notice of such lien, in
the office of the Prothonotary of Chester County, upon the
properties affected by such lien within the development.
[3] Included in any terms of ownership shall be protection of
the open space against development in perpetuity by
means of a conservation easement prohibiting
development. The required easement shall be conveyed
either to the Township directly (in which case the
development's property owners shall be named as third
party beneficiary) or to a conservation organization
acceptable to the Board (in which case the Township and
property owners of the development shall be named as
third party beneficiaries). [Amended 12-5-1994 by Ord.
No. 94-6]

alternative is not utilized: The developer of any cluster development
proposed to contain any area(s) of common open space may arrange
with the County Board of Assessment a method of assessment of the
open space which will allocate to each tax parcel in the cluster
development a share of the total assessment for such open space.
Where this alternative is to be utilized, the method of allocation shall be
approved by the Board of Supervisors.
E. The members of the organization shall share equitably the costs of
maintaining and developing common open space, in accordance with
the procedures established by them.

§ 170-1000. Statement of intent.
The purpose of the Multi-Use District is to provide an area within the
Township for many of the uses permitted in other sections of this chapter, as
well as for uses not elsewhere specifically authorized in this chapter when
such uses can be made compatible with the public interest and welfare. It
is intended that the Multi-Use District be a district which has reasonable
access to transportation, both by road and by rail, and is accessible to
off-site water and sewer service, it being the belief that such proximity
will allow for the uses which could not properly locate elsewhere in the
Township.

following standards: [Added 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
(a) The use will not typically generate more than 10 tractor-trailer
trucks entering or leaving any lot per day, and will involve
tractor-trailer trucks being directed to use the most
appropriate access route from the lot as a condition of
approval.
(b) The use will meet all of the performance standards of Article
XV of this chapter, including but not limited to § 170-1506.
(c) The use will be of such character and have such external

§ 170-1206. Regulations for multifamily dwellings. [Added 5-2-2005
by Ord. No. 2005-4]
The following regulations shall apply for multifamily dwellings in place of
the regulations contained in § 170-1202:
A. Minimum lot area: five acres. The lot area shall not be separated by any
public street or other publicly owned vehicle thoroughfare from any
other land area. A rental or condominium form of ownership shall be
allowed.
B. Maximum density:
(1) The maximum density shall be calculated as provided in
§ 170-1519A. The maximum density per acre of tract area shall be:
10 dwelling units per acre for dwellings of one bedroom or less;
eight dwelling units per acre for dwellings of two bedrooms; and
four dwelling units per acre for dwellings of three or more
bedrooms. If a lot includes a mix of numbers of bedrooms in
different units, then the density shall be calculated proportionately.
For example, on a five-acre lot, two acres could be considered as
having one-bedroom units, allowing 20 units and three acres could
be considered as having two-bedroom units, allowing an additional
24 units for a total of 44 units on five acres.
(2) Density and building length bonuses.
(a) Age-restricted bonus. If all of the multifamily dwellings are
limited by deed enforceable by the Township and by lease to
occupancy by persons age 55 and older and their spouses, then
the maximum multifamily dwelling density shall be increased
by 20% above the density that would otherwise be allowed. The
age restrictions shall be in legal form acceptable to the
Township Solicitor.
(b) Landscaping bonus. When a multifamily dwelling development
involves substantially greater amounts and sizes and a higher
quality of landscaping than would otherwise be required by
Township ordinances, as determined by the Board of
Supervisors, then the maximum multifamily dwelling density
shall be increased by 10% above the density that would
otherwise be allowed.
[1] The applicant shall provide a planting plan sealed by a
registered landscape architect.
§ 170-1205 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1206
1:628
[2] The planting plan shall be reviewed by the Planning
Commission and be subject to approval by the Board of
Supervisors. The determination of whether a planting plan
justifies a bonus under this section should be based upon a
review by an independent landscape architect chosen by
the Township. The Township may require the applicant to
fund the reasonable costs of such independent review.
(c) Architectural bonus. If the Board of Supervisors, based upon
Planning Commission review, determines that the proposed
development would have high architectural quality consistent
with the character of Westtown Township as viewed from
public streets, then an additional density bonus of 5% shall be
approved above the density that would otherwise be allowed.
The Township may require the applicant to fund reasonable
costs for an independent review of the architectural plans by a
registered architect chosen by the Township.
[1] The architectural design shall be intended to blend the
buildings with their surroundings. The architectural
design shall include finishes, textures, extensions,
placement of glass and other features to visually reduce
the bulk of the building as viewed from a street and to
make a large building appear more like two or more
connected smaller buildings.
[2] A preliminary architectural design shall be provided in
accordance with Subsection L below.
(d) The density bonuses shall be added and not multiplied upon
each other. Therefore, if a bonus of 20% and a 5% bonus apply,
the resulting total bonus shall be 25%.
(e) In no case shall the density bonuses of this section result in a
maximum density exceeding 12 dwelling units per acre.
(f) See Subsection H below for how these bonuses also can allow a
longer building length.
C. Minimum vegetative cover. A minimum of 40% of the gross area of the
tract shall be planted and maintained with new and/or preserved trees
and other vegetative material.
D. Minimum building setbacks. Any building shall be set back the
following minimum distances from the following:
(1) Controlled or semicontrolled access highway; arterial street: 120
feet.
(2) Collector, local or other public street with two-way traffic: 75 feet.
(3) Internal street or street with one-way traffic: 50 feet.

(4) Parking areas, other than underground parking: 20 feet.
(5) Lot lines in separate ownership: 50 feet.
(6) Minimum separation distance between principal buildings on the
lot: 35 feet.
E. Maximum building height: four stories or 50 feet, whichever is more
restrictive. A level used for vehicle parking that is in a basement level
shall not be counted towards the maximum number of stories.
Extensions of roof lines above 50 feet shall be permitted to
accommodate architectural roof pitches. However, the horizontal area
that extends above 50 feet shall not be greater than 15% of the
horizontal area covered by the building on the ground level.
F. Maximum building coverage: 20%.
G. Maximum impervious coverage: 55%.

[1] All unused or abandoned tower-based WCFs and accessory
facilities shall be removed within 90 days of the cessation
of operations at the site and the subject property restored
to its original natural condition unless a time extension is
approved by the Township.
[2] If the WCF and/or accessory facility is not removed within
90 days of the cessation of operations at a site, or within
any longer period approved by the Township, the WCF and
accessory facilities and equipment may be removed by the
Township and the cost of removal assessed against the
owner of the WCF or the property owner upon which the
WCF is located.
[3] Any unused portions of tower-based WCF, including
antennas, shall be removed within 90 days of the time of
cessation of operations. The Township must approve all
replacements of portions of a tower-based WCF previously
removed.
(q) Permit fees. The Township may assess appropriate and
reasonable permit fees directly related to the Township's
actual costs in reviewing and processing the application for
approval of a tower-based WCF, as well as related inspection,
monitoring, and related costs.
(r) FCC license. Each person that owns or operates a tower-based
WCF shall submit a copy of its current FCC license, including

(u) Financial security. Prior to receipt of a zoning permit for the
construction or placement of a tower-based WCF, the WCF
applicant shall provide to the Township financial security
sufficient to guarantee the removal of the tower-based WCF.
The amount of financial security shall be mutually agreed upon
by the WCF applicant's engineer and the Township's engineer
or consultants, and shall remain in place until the tower-based
WCF is removed.
(2) Conditional use review process and additional regulations.
(a) Tower-based WCF are permitted in specific zoning districts
and along certain roadways by conditional use only as outlined
in § 170-2009 and at the minimum height necessary to satisfy
their function in the WCF applicant's wireless communications
system. No WCF applicant shall have the right under these
regulations to erect a tower to the maximum height specified in
this section unless it proves the necessity for such height.
(b) Notice. Upon submission of an application for a tower-based
WCF and the scheduling of the public hearing upon the
application, the WCF applicant shall mail notice to all owners
of every property within 1,000 feet of the property upon which
the proposed facility is located as measured from the
perimeter of the property. The WCF applicant shall provide
proof of the notification to the Township.
(c) The WCF applicant for such conditional use approval shall
prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the WCF
applicant cannot adequately extend or infill its
communications system by the use of equipment such as
§ 170-1404 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1404
1:648
redoes, repeaters, antenna(s) and other similar equipment
installed on existing structures, such as utility poles or their
appurtenances and other available tall structures. The WCF
applicant shall further demonstrate that the proposed towerbased
WCF must be located where it is proposed in order to
serve the WCF applicant's service area and that no other viable
alternative location exists.
(d) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by a
propagation study evidencing the need for the proposed tower
or other communication facilities and equipment, a description
of the type and manufacturer of the proposed transmission/
radio equipment, the frequency range (megahertz band)
assigned to the WCF applicant, the power in watts at which the
WCF applicant transmits, and any relevant related tests
conducted by the WCF applicant in determining the need for
the proposed site and installation.
(e) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all state and federal laws and regulations
concerning aviation safety.
(f) Where the tower-based WCF is located on a property with
another principal use, the WCF applicant shall present
documentation to the Board that the owner of the property has
granted an easement for the proposed WTF and that vehicular
access will be provided to the facility.
(g) The conditional use application shall be accompanied by
documentation demonstrating that the proposed tower-based
WCF complies with all applicable provisions in this section,
including specifically, the regulations applicable to all towerbased
WCFs.
(h) Visual appearance and land use compatibility. Tower-based
WCF shall employ stealth technology which may include the
tower portion to be painted silver or another color approved by
the Board in context with its surroundings, or shall have a
galvanized finish. All tower-based WCF and related equipment
shall be aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the
surrounding environment and shall maximize the use of a like
facade to blend with the existing surroundings and
neighboring buildings to the greatest extent possible. The
Board of Supervisors shall consider whether its decision upon
the subject application will promote the harmonious and
orderly development of the zoning district involved; encourage
compatibility with the character and type of development
existing in the area; benefit neighboring properties by
preventing a negative impact on the aesthetic character of the
community; preserve woodlands and trees existing at the site
§ 170-1404 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1404
1:649
to the greatest possible extent; and encourage sound
engineering and land development design and construction
principles, practices and techniques.
(i) Co-location and siting. An application for a new tower-based
WCF shall not be approved unless the Board of Supervisors
finds that the wireless communications equipment planned for
the proposed tower-based WCF cannot be accommodated on
an existing or approved structure or building. The Board may
deny an application to construct a new tower-based WCF if the
WCF applicant has not made a good-faith effort to mount the
antenna(s) on an existing structure. The WCF applicant shall
demonstrate that it contacted the owners of tall structures,
buildings, and towers within a one-quarter-mile radius of the
site proposed, sought permission to install an antenna on those
structures, buildings, and towers and was denied for one of the
following reasons:
[1] The proposed antenna and related equipment would
exceed the structural capacity of the existing building,
structure or tower, and its reinforcement cannot be
accomplished at a reasonable cost.
[2] The proposed antenna and related equipment would cause
radio frequency interference with other existing
equipment for that existing building, structure, or tower
and the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable
cost.
[3] Such existing buildings, structures, or towers do not have
adequate location, space, access, or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to
perform its intended function.
[4] A commercially reasonable agreement could not be
reached with the owner of such building, structure, or
tower.
(j) Additional antennas. As a condition of approval for all towerbased
WCFs, the WCF applicant shall provide the Township
with a written commitment that it will allow other service
providers to co-locate antennas on tower-based WCFs where
technically and economically feasible. The owner of a towerbased
WCF shall not install any additional antennas without
obtaining a building permit if required by the Township.
(k) Retention of experts. The Township may hire any consultant
and/or expert necessary to assist the Township in reviewing
and evaluating the application for approval of the tower-based
WCF and, once approved, in reviewing and evaluating any
potential violations of the terms and conditions of these
provisions. The WCF applicant and/or owner of the WCF shall
§ 170-1404 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1404
1:650
reimburse the Township for all costs of the Township's
consultant(s) in providing expert evaluation and consultation
in connection with these activities.
(l) Timing of approval. Within 30 calendar days of the date that an
application for a tower-based WCF is filed with the Township,
the Township shall notify the WCF applicant in writing of any
information that may be required to complete such application.
All applications for tower-based WCFs shall be acted upon
within 150 days of the receipt of a fully completed application
for the approval of such tower-based WCF and the Township
shall advise the WCF applicant in writing of its decision. If
additional information was requested by the Township to
complete an application, the time required by the WCF
applicant to provide the information shall not be counted
toward the one-hundred-fifty-day review period. Time
extensions may be granted if agreed upon by all parties.
(m) Engineer signature. All plans and drawings for the conditional
use approval of tower-based WCF shall contain a seal and
signature of a professional structural engineer, licensed in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(3) The following regulations shall apply to tower-based wireless
communications facilities located outside the public rights-of-way:
(a) Development regulations.
[1] Tower-based WCF shall not be located within 75 feet of
any underground utility or underground utilities
easements (with the exception of water and sewer lines).
[2] Tower-based WCF greater than 40 feet in height are
permitted outside the public rights-of-way in certain
zoning district(s) and certain properties by conditional
use, subject to the Township's permission, as follows:
[a] Township District; and
[b] Township-owned properties.
[3] Sole use on a lot. A tower-based WCF may be permitted as
a sole use on a lot. The minimum distance between the
base of a tower-based WCF and any adjoining property line
or street right-of-way line shall equal 110% of the
proposed height of the tower-based WCF. At the Board's
sole discretion, the Board may allow a reduced setback if it
is demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board
that in the event of failure the WCF is designed to collapse
upon itself within a setback area less than the required
minimum setback without endangering such adjoining
uses and their occupants.
§ 170-1404 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1404
1:651
[4] Combined with another use. A tower-based WCF may be
permitted on a property with an existing use, or on a
vacant parcel in combination with another use, except
residential, subject to the following conditions:
[a] The existing use on the property shall be any
permitted use in the applicable district, and need not
be affiliated with the WCF.
[b] Minimum setbacks. The minimum distance between
the base of a tower-based WCF and any adjoining
property line or street right-of-way line shall equal
110% of the proposed height of the tower-based WCF.
At the Board's sole discretion, the Board may allow a
reduced setback if it is demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Board that in the event
of failure the WCF is designed to collapse upon itself
within a setback area less than the required minimum
setback without endangering such adjoining uses and
their occupants.
(b) Design regulations.
[1] The WCF shall employ the most current stealth technology
available in an effort to appropriately blend into the
surrounding environment and minimize aesthetic impact
and shall be subject to the approval of the Township.
[2] Tower-based WCF located outside the public rights-of-way
shall be greater than 40 feet in height in order to increase
coverage, provide for increased co-location capabilities
and result in less need for additional towers of such height
in the Township.
[3] Any proposed tower-based WCF shall be designed
structurally, electrically, and in all respects to
accommodate both the WCF applicant's antennas and
comparable antennas for future users.
[4] Any tower-based WCF over 40 feet in height shall be
equipped with an anti-climbing device, as approved by the
manufacturer.
(c) Surrounding environs.
[1] The WCF applicant shall ensure that the existing
vegetation, trees and shrubs located within proximity to
the WCF structure shall be preserved to the maximum
extent possible.
[2] The WCF applicant shall submit a soil report to the
Township complying with the standards of Appendix I:
§ 170-1404 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1404

wires, if used.
(d) Fence/screen.
[1] A security fence having a minimum height of 10 feet shall
completely surround any tower-based WCF greater than
40 feet in height, as well as any building housing WCF
equipment.
[2] Landscaping shall be required to screen as much of a
newly constructed tower-based WCF as possible. The
Board may permit any combination of existing vegetation,
topography, walls, decorative fences or other features
instead of landscaping, if, in the discretion of the Board,
they achieve the same degree of screening.
(e) Accessory equipment.
[1] Ground-mounted related equipment associated with, or
connected to, a tower-based WCF shall be placed
underground or screened from public view using stealth
technologies, as described above.
[2] All related equipment, utility buildings and accessory
structures shall be architecturally designed to blend into
the environment in which they are situated and shall meet
the minimum setback requirements of the underlying
zoning district.
(f) Access road. An access road, turnaround space and parking
shall be provided to ensure adequate emergency and service
access to tower-based WCF.
(g) Parking. For each tower-based WCF greater than 40 feet in
height, there shall be at least one off-street parking space.
(h) Inspection. The Township reserves the right to inspect any
tower-based WCF to ensure compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and any other provisions found within the Township
Code or state or federal law. The Township and/or its agents
shall have the authority to enter the property upon which a
WCF is located at any time, upon reasonable notice to the
operator, to ensure such compliance.
(4) The following regulations shall apply to tower-based wireless
communications facilities located in the public rights-of-way.

ARTICLE XV
General Regulations
§ 170-1500. Statement of intent.
In setting forth general regulations in this article, it is the intent of the
Township to establish clear standards for activities and for the design and
impact of site development that may be associated with a variety of zoning
districts or types of land use. In most instances, these regulations are to
be interpreted and applied in conjunction with the requirements of one or
another use district of this chapter; they are limited with respect to the
Zoning Map only as stipulated by the terms of this article.
§ 170-1501. Visibility at intersections.
The following shall apply to all zoning districts:
§ 170-1502. Projections into setbacks and setback exceptions.
[Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
A. On a corner lot or at a point of entry on a public road, nothing shall be
erected, placed, or allowed to grow in a manner which obscures vision:
(1) Above the height of 2 1/2 feet measured from the center line grades
of the intersecting streets; and
(2) Within the area bounded by the center lines of intersecting streets
and a line joining points on these center lines at distances from the
intersection as specified in Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land
Development.
B. There shall be no plantings, ground cover or other objects placed within
the road right-of-way above 18 inches in height.
A. The following components of principal buildings (with or without
accessory dwelling units), may project into any required yard so long as
they are set back at least 15 feet from any lot line: terraces; platforms,
stoops, patios, and other uncovered landings; buttresses; chimneys;
cornices; piers or pilasters; unenclosed fire escapes; and unroofed
steps.
B. In situations where the Board of Supervisors permits a lot size which
conforms to the footprint of a building, such components or decks may
project no more than 25% of the minimum distance between buildings
or be set back at least 15 feet from the tract boundary; projections into
open space not covered by these standards shall be subject to approval
by the Board of Supervisors.
C. Raised decks attached to a dwelling may extend into a required side or
rear yard, provided they are set back a minimum of 15 feet from any lot
line (except along a lot line where two dwellings are attached to each
other).
§ 170-1500 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1502
1:657
§ 170-1503. Modification of front yard requirements.
D. An open gazebo or a similar unenclosed uninhabitable decorative
structure with a maximum floor area of 64 square feet shall be
permitted within a front yard setback, provided the front yard has a
minimum width of 50 feet.

yard not more than 25 feet, but shall not be closer than 15 feet from any
property line.
F. Arbors, garden sheds, private garages, private greenhouses, trellises,
workshops, and similar accessory structures shall be permitted within
side and rear yard areas provided they do not exceed the height, nor
50% of the footprint, of the principal structure. The side and rear yard
setbacks for such structures shall be no less than the height of the
accessory structure, irrespective of the otherwise applicable yard
requirement of the district. Any wheels attached to a mobile structure
must be removed prior to the issuance of any permits. These standards
do not apply to flexible developments. [Amended 6-3-2019 by Ord.
No. 2019-01]
G. Swimming pools, measured from the edge of the water, tennis courts,
and similar outdoor recreation facilities shall be permitted within side
and rear yard areas provided they are set back at least 25 feet from the
lot line.
H. Corner lots. If a corner lot is occupied by a single-family detached
dwelling, and the applicant proves to the Zoning Officer that there is no
suitable permitted location for customary accessory uses/structures
(such as a shed or pool), then the Zoning Officer may permit such
accessory use/structure in one of the two front yards, provided it is
located and landscaped so as to minimize the impacts upon the
neighborhood.
A. To encourage design in accordance with land condition and to develop
the maximum aesthetic potential of the community, the Board of
Supervisors may, at its sole discretion, permit up to 25% of the
residences in a subdivision to be located as much as 10 feet forward of
the required building setback line, if the same number of residences are
located at least an equal distance behind the required setback line.
B. Where an unimproved lot is situated between two improved lots, on
each of which there has existed since the effective date of this chapter a
principal building within 25 feet of the side boundary line of such
unimproved lot and encroaching within the front yard otherwise
required by this chapter, the front yard depth of such unimproved lot
may be the average depth of the front yards of the two adjacent
improved lots, notwithstanding the yard requirements of the district in
which the unimproved lot is located.
§ 170-1502 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1503
1:658
§ 170-1504. Exception to height limitations.
C. Where an unimproved lot adjoins only one improved lot, on which there
has existed since the effective date of this chapter a principal building
within 25 feet of the common side lot line and encroaching within the
front yard otherwise required by this chapter, the front yard depth of
such unimproved lot may be the average depth of the front yard of such
adjacent improved lot and the front yard required for the district in
which such unimproved lot is located, notwithstanding the yard
requirements for such district.
A. Subject to the review and approval by the Board of Supervisors, the
height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to church spires,
belfries, cupolas and domes, monuments, water towers, chimneys on
residential structures, or flagpoles.
B. The height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to wireless
communications facilities except as provided for in § 170-1404.
Furthermore, the height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to a
barn or silo. [Amended 6-15-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-6]
C. The height limitations for wind energy systems shall be as set forth in
§ 170-1618 of this chapter. [Added 2-17-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-393]
D. A special exception may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board,
permitting signal transmitting, receiving, or relay towers, ham radio or
television masts, aerials, and antennas. Such uses may be erected to a
maximum height of 50 feet or the equivalent of the distance to the
property line, whichever is less. The Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider the following factors, in addition to the criteria in § 170-2108
of this chapter, in deciding upon a request for special exception:
[Amended 2-17-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-3]
(1) Compatibility of the proposed facility with existing and zoned uses
in the general neighborhood with respect to safety, visual impact,
aesthetics, noise, and lighting.
(2) Compliance of the proposed facility with all applicable state and
federal licensing and permit requirements, including assurances
that existing uses on surrounding properties will not be disrupted
or otherwise negatively impacted by the operation of the proposed
facility.
(3) The relationship of the proposed site to other similar facilities
within the Township or the immediate region, and the potential
cumulative impacts that could result from a concentration of such
facilities of excessive height.
93.Editor's Note: This ordinance also provided for the redesignation of former Subsections C
and D as Subsections D and E, respectively.
§ 170-1503 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1504

§ 170-1505. Fences and walls. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No.
2003-2; 2-6-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-1]
(4) The ability of the applicant to screen effectively the potentially
negative visual, light, and noise impacts of the proposed facility.
E. A special exception may be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board
permitting a primary or secondary school or religious use to exceed
otherwise applicable height limitations up to a maximum of 60 feet. In
consideration of such request for modification, the Zoning Hearing
Board shall review, and may base approval or denial of the request, or
approval subject to specific conditions, on one or more of the following
factors: [Added 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
(1) Feasibility of adequate development of the proposed use without
exceeding otherwise applicable height limitations;
(2) Impact on architectural design which compliance with applicable
height limitations would entail, in comparison with improvements
to architectural design which may be feasible with an increase in
permitted height;
(3) Degree of change in visual impacts to nearby public roads and/or
private properties which would result if an increase in height were
to be permitted in comparison to visual impacts from development
conforming to applicable height limitations; and
(4) Potential means to mitigate visual impacts of a tall structure from
point(s) of view from nearby public roads and/or private properties,
whether through landscape screening, retention of existing
vegetation and/or land forms, siting of tall portions of structures at
considerable distance from nearby uses or public roads, or
otherwise.
A. A permit is not required for a fence in the Township District.
B. A permit is required for the installation of all other fences exceeding 40
feet in length and within the front, rear or side setback areas, except
fences enclosing agricultural uses, or those constructed in conjunction
with a permit for the installation of a swimming pool. A plot plan
locating the proposed fence shall be submitted with the permit
application. The plot plan may be an informal sketch plan, not
necessarily to exact scale, showing the property boundaries and
accurately locating the proposed fence. The property owner or
contractor shall notify the PA One Call System before beginning
construction of the fence.
C. In a residential district or a residential or agricultural lot in another
zoning district:
(1) A fence located within the required front building setback area of
any yard shall have a maximum height of five feet and shall have a
§ 170-1504 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1505
1:660
ratio of open to structural areas of at least 1:1 (such as a split-rail
or picket fence).
(2) A wall within the required front building setback area shall not
exceed a height of three feet.
(3) A fence or wall located within a minimum principal building
setback area, other than the minimum front building setback, shall
have a maximum height of six feet (decorative post tops may extend
above six feet).
(4) If one side of a fence is smoother or more finished than the other
side of the fence, the smoother or more finished side shall face onto
any abutting lot or public road.
(5) A fence higher than six feet is permitted to enclose a recreation
facility such as a tennis court if the fence is integral to the
recreational use and complies with the required building setbacks
applicable to the zoning district.
D. On any nonresidential lot, a fence or wall shall not exceed a height of
five feet within the minimum front building setback area and eight feet
in any other minimum principal building setback area.
E. Where landscaping is required as a buffer around a use, all fencing
shall be located on the inside of the landscaping, except for fencing that
is mostly open (such as split-rail or picket fencing) and is constructed of
wood or materials with a similar appearance.
F. This section shall not restrict retaining walls that are necessary to hold
back slopes, nor walls of a building that are permitted by this chapter.
G. No fence or wall shall be constructed on a property within the existing
or future right-of-way of a street, nor in any location that would obstruct
a permanent easement.
H. Fences and their support materials shall be placed entirely within the
boundaries of the property being fenced. If the fence is to be located on
or near the property line and the property owner cannot demonstrate
that the property line location is known and identified in the field, as
well as on the permit plan, the Township may require a survey of the
property.
I. The repair or replacement of any fence that currently exists as of the
date of the adoption of this chapter shall not require a permit.
J. Regulations for fencing associated with wireless communications
facilities are set forth in § 170-1404, and those provisions are the
applicable standards to apply to such fencing. [Added 6-15-2015 by

A. No use shall be permitted which is noxious or offensive in the
immediately surrounding area by reason of odor, dust, smoke, gas,
vibration, illumination, or noise, or which constitutes a public hazard
whether by fire, explosion, or otherwise. The sole exception to these
requirements shall be with regard to normal and customary
agricultural practices conducted in compliance with the applicable
provisions of § 170-1609 of this chapter. In determining whether a
proposed use is noxious, hazardous, or offensive, the burden of proof is
on the applicant and will be judged by the following criteria. The
proposed operation shall not:
(1) Constitute any nuisance whatsoever beyond the boundary of the
site on which the use is located by reason of dissemination of
noxious, toxic, or corrosive fumes, smoke, odor, or dust. All
equipment shall be operated by electric power, gas, or other
smokeless fuel.
(2) Result in noise or vibration exceeding the average intensity of noise
or vibration occurring from other causes at the boundary line.
(3) Endanger surrounding areas by reason of the potential for fire or
explosion.
(4) Produce objectionable heat, glare, or radiation beyond the property
line.
(5) Result in electrical disturbance in nearby residences, or adversely
affect the operation of equipment other than on the property on
which the disturbance is located.
(6) Engage in the storage of nonhazardous waste material (as defined
by Pennsylvania Act 97 of 1980, as amended, the Solid Waste
Management Act, 35 P.S. § 6018.101 et seq.) on the lot for any
period beyond 30 days.
(7) Engage in the production, treatment, or storage of toxic or
hazardous waste (as defined by Pennsylvania Act 97 of 1980, as
amended, the Solid Waste Management Act, 35 P.S. § 6018.101 et
seq.). Any use or disposal of toxic or hazardous material or waste
shall conform to the terms of § 170-1517E of this article.
(8) Create any other objectionable condition in an adjoining area
which will endanger public health and safety or be detrimental to
the proper use of the surrounding area.

B. Any use proposed under the terms of this chapter shall conform to all
applicable regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection and the Chester County Health Department,
and with the Township Act 537 Sewage Facilities Plan (35 P.S. § 750.1 et
seq.), regarding the treatment and disposal of industrial or sanitary
wastes.
C. All utilities shall be installed below ground.
D. Where required by the Township, an applicant for a proposed use shall
demonstrate that adequate provisions will be made to reduce and
minimize any objectionable elements to the degree necessary to ensure
that the proposed use will comply satisfactorily with the above
standards. Where so required, the applicant shall submit supplemental
information and plans. The Township may solicit the expert advice of
official agencies or private consultants and such reasonable tests as are
deemed necessary, the costs of which shall be borne by the applicant.
A. Any portion of a lot, site, or tract which is not used for buildings or
structures, loading or parking spaces and aisles, or other impervious
surfaces or designated storage areas shall be planted with an all-season
ground cover. A major objective for such ground cover shall be to
prevent soil erosion and sedimentation off the site.
B. Any use or activity proposed as part of a subdivision or land
development shall further comply with the requirements for shade
trees, street trees, and other landscaping components stipulated in
Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land Development.
C. There shall be no plantings, ground cover or other objects placed within
the road right-of-way above 18 inches in height.
A. A completely planted visual barrier or landscape screen, of sufficient
density not to be seen through and of sufficient height to constitute an
effective screen and give maximum protection and immediate visual
screening, shall be provided and continually maintained between any
industrial, office, or C-1 Commercial District and any contiguous
residentially-zoned district; any multifamily residential use and any
contiguous single-family detached or two-family residential use; any
use by special exception permitted in the Commercial District and any
other use; and any new or expanded nonresidential principal use that
abuts an existing residential use. Specific buffer requirements, as
contained in the use districts, shall be considered to have fulfilled the
obligations herein.
§ 170-1506 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1508
1:663
§ 170-1509. Storage.
The following standards shall apply to the storage of all man-made
materials:
B. Water towers, storage tanks, processing equipment, fans, skylights,
cooling towers, communication towers, vents and any other structures
or equipment which rise above the roof line shall be architecturally
compatible, or shall be effectively shielded from view from any public or
private street by an architecturally sound method which shall be
approved, in writing, by the Township before construction or erection of
said structures or equipment.
C. In any case in which screening of a parking lot is required, such
screening shall include appropriate planting, such as a compact
evergreen hedge, or a masonry wall or ornamental structure, which
shall be not more than four feet in height. Any such wall or similar
structure shall enclose the parking lot and shall be in harmony with the
general architectural design of the principal building or buildings.
D. For the purposes of this section, the following criteria shall apply:
(1) The term "contiguous" shall include each of the following:
(a) Lots that abut but are not separated by a local or minor street;
(b) Lots that are only separated from each other by a creek or
easement; and/or
(c) Lots that are across a local street from each other.
(2) Complete plant visual screening shall not be required along the
primary front lot line of a lot.
(3) Required landscaping and any berming shall be designed to have a
naturalistic appearance with a mix of plant species. Straight rows
of the same species of shrubs shall generally not be used to meet
Township requirements. Plants with a large mature size should be
planted at offsets to allow room for growth. The species, sizes and
locations of plantings proposed to be used shall be shown on
development plans.
(4) Any required buffer shall also meet the standards in § 149-922 of
the Code.
A. Storage for periods in excess of 30 days shall be screened from view of
any public right-of-way and any contiguous residential use. Screening
shall consist of continuous evergreen plantings and/or include an
architectural screen.
B. No storage shall be permitted within the front yard of a lot.
§ 170-1508 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1509
1:664
§ 170-1510. Access and traffic control.
In order to minimize traffic congestion and hazard, control street access
in the interest of public safety, and encourage the orderly development of
street or highway frontage, the following regulations shall apply. Where
the requirements of §§ 170-1511 and/or 170-1512 are applicable and are
more stringent than the provisions of this section, those requirements shall
govern.
C. No merchandise, goods, articles, or equipment shall be stored,
displayed, or offered for sale outside any building except seasonal
articles which are too large or otherwise infeasible to be stored indoors.
Such articles shall be stored adjacent to the principal building housing
the commercial use, and shall be enclosed by either walls or opaque
fencing designed to be architecturally compatible with the building.
Such enclosure shall be at least six feet high. Any outdoor display area
shall be considered sales floor area for purposes of computing building
coverage and parking requirements.
D. Any organic refuse and garbage shall be stored in tight, verminproof
containers. On multifamily, commercial, or industrial properties, solid
waste storage shall be centralized to expedite collection. Storage
containers shall be enclosed on three sides with masonry walls and
shall be architecturally screened.
E. Flammable and combustible liquids, solids, or gases shall be stored in
accordance with the Township Fire Code.94 There shall be no storage of
hazardous waste anywhere within the Township, including temporary
storage in a parked vehicle. Hazardous waste shall be as defined in Pa.
Act 97-1980, the Solid Waste Management Act (35 P.S. § 6018.101 et
seq.), or any subsequent amendment or revision thereto.
F. Any establishment which furnishes carts or mobile baskets as an
adjunct to shopping shall provide definite locations within the required
parking areas for storage of said carts. Each designated storage
location shall be clearly marked for storage of shopping carts. Signs
indicating the storage locations shall not be considered as regulated by
the provisions of Article XVIII.
A. No parking lot or area for off-street parking or for the storage or
movement of motor vehicles shall abut directly a public street or
highway unless separated from the street or highway by a raised curb, a
barrier planting strip, wall or other effective barrier against traffic,
except for necessary accessways. The minimum setback from the street
line to the parking area shall be equal to that specified in § 170-1701D
of this chapter. Each parking lot shall have not more than two
accessways to any one public street or highway for each 500 feet of
frontage. Where practicable, access to parking areas shall be provided
by a common service driveway or minor street in order to avoid direct

B. In any zoning district, in the case of any multifamily residential
development, commercial use, hospital, hotel, patient hostel,
rehabilitative services center, wellness center, health clinic, medical
office building, medical clinic or industrial use or any other
nonresidential use, excepting municipal, the following regulations shall
apply: [Amended 9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
(1) All parking, loading, or service areas used by motor vehicles shall
be located entirely within the lot lines of the property or center.
(2) All buildings shall front upon a marginal street, service road,
common parking lot or similar area, and not directly upon a public
street or highway.
(3) All accessways to a public street or highway shall be located not
less than 300 feet from the intersection of any street lines.
(4) All streets and accessways shall be designed in a manner conducive
to safe exit and entrance.
(5) Any additional traffic signals and acceleration and deceleration
lanes deemed necessary upon review by the Board of Supervisors
to provide safe and adequate access to the property shall be
provided by the developer.
A. Purpose. To reserve adequate rights-of-way for future circulation
improvements, including road widenings, sidewalks, and bikeways.
B. Widths. The following future rights-of-way shall be reserved for future
dedication along each public street:
Future Right of-Way
(feet)
Minor residential service 50
Local street 50
Collector street 60
Routes 926 and 352 80
U.S. Route 202 and PA Route 3 120
C. Ownership and maintenance. Building setbacks adjacent to streets
shall be measured from the future right-of-way, not the existing street
right-of-way, regardless of whether or not the future street right-of-way
has been dedicated. The adjacent property owner shall be responsible

§ 170-1512. Access to Route 202.
§ 170-1513. Interior circulation and access.
to maintain the area between the road shoulder and the future rightof-
way line. See provisions in Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land
Development, regarding dedication of the future right-of-way.
D. If the right-of-way is dedicated from an existing lot line along an
existing public street, and as a result the width or lot area does not
conform to the district regulations, then the lot shall not be regulated as
a nonconforming lot.
A. Right-hand turns. A land use with direct access onto and off of U. S.
Route 202 shall not have either left-hand turns from the use onto Route
202 or left-hand turns from Route 202 to the use. This section shall
neither apply to left-hand turns at official traffic signals nor to uses that
were served by left-hand turns onto and/or off of Route 202 prior to the
adoption of this section. However, if any land use that was served by
left-hand turns onto and/or off of Route 202 prior to the adoption of this
section is to be replaced with a land use that will generate more total
weekday traffic, left-hand turns shall be prohibited onto and off of
Route 202 from the use. Traffic generation comparisons shall be based
upon the Traffic Generation Manual of the Institute of Traffic
Engineers. Appropriate measures should then be taken to encourage
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to erect a median
barrier across any curb cut in Route 202 in that location, if determined
to be reasonable by the Board of Supervisors.
B. Alternative access to Route 202.
(1) Specific intent. The purpose of this section is to discourage direct
vehicular access from uses directly onto and off of U. S. Route 202,
to avoid serious traffic hazards from increased numbers of
vehicular access points along Route 202, and to encourage
alternative access by using existing collector, local, and stub roads.
Access onto Route 202 can thereby be provided through a rational
and reasonable hierarchy of roads and access points.
(2) For all uses, specifically residential uses, proposed within 300 feet
of the future right-of-way of Route 202, if a reasonable alternative
means of access is available by means of an existing street other
than Route 202, uses shall be prohibited from having direct
vehicular access onto and off Route 202. This requirement may be
waived at the discretion of the Board of Supervisors if the
requirement for alternative access would be unreasonable, cause a
serious hardship to the applicant, or be impracticable given the
type of use proposed.
A. General design. Interior drives shall be the minimum widths specified
below and shall be designed so as to prevent blockage of vehicles
§ 170-1511 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1513
1:667
entering or leaving the site. Drives may be one-way or two-way. Areas
provided for loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other
vehicles, and for the servicing of shops by refuse collection, fuel, and
other service vehicles, shall be so arranged that they may be used
without:
(1) Blocking or interfering with the use of accessways, automobile
parking facilities, or pedestrian ways; or
(2) Backing out into a street.

C. Paving. Interior drives shall be paved with an all-weather surface and
provided with curbs and drainage in conformance with the
requirements of § 149-915 of Chapter 149, Subdivision of Land. As
determined by the Board of Supervisors, interior drives designed as
continuous collector road(s) to provide internal through connection(s)
between existing collector and/or arterial roads, which link any
proposed use or development to existing or proposed intersections, or
other points of controlled and/or signalized access to collector and/or
arterial highway(s), shall be paved in accordance with § 149-910 of
Chapter 149, Subdivision of Land. [Amended 9-15-2008 by Ord. No.

D. Fire lane easements.
(1) No multifamily residential, commercial, or industrial building shall
be located more than 150 feet from a duly dedicated, improved, and
accessible fire lane easement, as defined herein, nor more than 600
feet from a duly dedicated, accessible, and improved public street.
If any such building is located further than 600 feet from a public
street, then a subdivision plan must be filed and approved by the
Board before the development plan shall be considered for
approval.

(2) Fire lane easements shall have a minimum unobstructed right-ofway
width of 40 feet, and there shall be constructed within this
right-of-way an all-weather and well-drained cartway surface with a
minimum width of 20 feet. The extension of fire lane easements
shall begin from one or more existing and improved public streets.
(3) Fire lane easements which curve, turn, or change direction shall
have a minimum radius of 55 feet at the pavement. Fire lane
easements containing reverse curves shall have a minimum center
line tangent length of 50 feet between curves.
(4) Dead-end fire lane easements shall be terminated with an
unobstructed vehicular turnaround or cul-de-sac with a minimum
right-of-way radius of 45 feet, and shall have a minimum surfaced
radius of 35 feet. Dead-end fire lane easements shall have a
maximum length of 400 feet.
(5) The location of fire lane easements shall conform to plans for the
extensions of streets, sanitary sewers, water mains, storm sewers,
and other drainage facilities and public utilities, as prescribed in
this chapter and other ordinances of the Township, and shall
provide adequate access to buildings by firemen and other
emergency services.
E. New, relocated or intensified driveways. Any vehicle driveway that is
newly developed, relocated, or converted from serving a residential use
to serving a principal nonresidential use shall meet the driveway
requirements of § 149-915, regardless of whether a subdivision or a
land development is involved. [Added 3-3-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
A. Purpose. The purpose is to require and set minimum standards for
outdoor lighting to:
(1) Provide lighting in outdoor public places where public health,
safety and welfare are potential concerns during hours of darkness.
(2) Protect drivers and pedestrians from the glare of nonvehicular light
sources that shine directly into their eyes or reflect off surfaces and
thereby impair safe traverse.
(3) Protect neighbors and the night sky from direct glare and stray
light from poorly aimed, placed, applied, maintained or shielded
light sources.
B. Applicability.
(1) Outdoor lighting shall be required for safety and personal security
for uses that operate during hours of darkness where there is
public assembly and traverse, including but not limited to the
§ 170-1513 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1514
1:669
following uses: all residential developments, commercial,
industrial, public-recreational and institutional.
(2) Appropriate officers or agents of the Township may require that
lighting be incorporated for other uses or locations, as they deem
necessary.
(3) The glare, light trespass and light pollution requirements herein
contained apply to lighting in all above-mentioned uses, as well as,
but not limited to, lighting for signage, architectural, site/
landscape, recreational and residential uses and all jurisdictions,
including public, private and municipal.
C. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
CANDELA  Unit of luminous intensity of a source in a given direction.
FOOTCANDLE  A unit of illuminance equal to one lumen per square
foot and measurable with an illuminance meter (footcandle or light
meter).
FULL CUTOFF  A luminaire light distribution where zero candela
intensity occurs at or above an angle of 90° above nadir. Additionally,
the candela per 1,000 lamp lumens does not numerically exceed 100
(10%) at or above a vertical angle of 80° above nadir. This applies to all
lateral angles around the luminaire.
GLARE  The sensation produced by luminances within the visual field,
which are sufficiently greater than the luminance to which the eyes
have adapted, and which causes annoyance, discomfort or loss in visual
performance and visibility.
ILLUMINANCE  The quantity of light at a point on a surface
measured in footcandles or lux. Horizontal footcandles are
perpendicular to a horizontal surface. Vertical footcandles are
perpendicular to a vertical surface.
LIGHT TRESPASS  Light emitted by a lighting installation, which
extends beyond the boundaries of the property on which the installation
is sited, and which is considered unwelcome or undesirable.
LUMEN  Unit of luminous flux, amount of light emitted from a source.
LUMINAIRE (LIGHT FIXTURE)  A complete lighting unit consisting of
a lamp, or lamps and ballast (when applicable), together with the parts
designed to distribute light.
LUMINANCE  The luminous intensity of a surface of a given projected
area, in a given direction, and measurable with a luminance meter.
LUX  A unit of light intensity stated in lumens per square meter. There
are approximately 10.7 lux per footcandle.
NON CUTOFF  A luminaire light distribution where there is no
candela limitation in the zone above maximum candela.
§ 170-1514 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1514
1:670
D. Design criteria.
(1) Illuminance.
(a) Lighting, where required by this chapter, shall have intensities
and uniformity ratios in accordance with the current
recommended practices of the Illuminating Engineering
Society of North America (IESNA), unless deemed
inappropriate or unnecessary by independent lighting
consultants retained as experts by the Township. Such
recommended practices are contained in the IESNA Lighting
Handbook, RP-33-99 Lighting For Exterior Environments,
RP-8-00 Roadway Lighting, and other IESNA Recommended
Practices for specific activities such as sports lighting.
(b) Future amendments to IESNA practices shall become a part of
this chapter without further action of the Township.
(c) Horizontal illuminances, or lighting levels, are measured at
grade and are considered as maintained during the life of the
lighting system in use.
(d) Lighting uniformity ratios determine areas of insufficient or
excessive illuminances. Uniformity ratios are given as average
to minimum or maximum to minimum.
(e) Examples of illumination levels for typical outdoor
applications, as extracted from the IESNA RP-33-99 and

(a) Luminaire shall be of a type and design appropriate to the
lighting application.
(b) For lighting horizontal tasks such as roadways, sidewalks,
entrance drives and parking areas, luminaires shall meet
IESNA full-cutoff criteria (no light output emitted above 90° at
any lateral angle around the fixture).
(c) Noncutoff luminaires may be approved by the Zoning Officer
for historical post top luminaires, provided the source is less
than 2,000 initial lumens.
(d) The use of floodlighting, spotlighting, wall-mounted fixtures,
decorative globes and spheres and other fixtures not meeting
IESNA full-cutoff criteria shall be permitted only with the
approval of the Township, based upon applicability in retaining
the rural character of the Township and achieving acceptable
glare control.
(e) When requested by the Township, luminaires shall be equipped
with or be modified to incorporate light directing and/or
shielding devices such as shields, visors, skirts or hoods to
redirect offending light distribution and/or reduce direct or
reflected glare.
§ 170-1514 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1514
1:673
(f) NEMA-head fixtures, a/k/a "barn lights" or "dusk-to-dawn
lights" shall not be permitted where they are visible from other
uses, unless fitted with optical hardware to render them full
cutoff.
(3) Control of nuisance and disabling glare.
(a) All outdoor lighting, whether or not required by this chapter on
private, residential, commercial, industrial, municipal,
recreational or institutional property, shall be aimed, located,
designed, fitted and maintained so as not to present a hazard
to drivers or pedestrians by impairing their ability to safely
traverse and so as not to create a nuisance by projecting or
reflecting objectionable light onto a neighboring use or
property.
(b) All outdoor luminaires shall be shielded in such a manner that
no light is emitted above a horizontal plane passing through
the lowest point of the light emitting element, so that direct
light emitted above the horizontal plane is eliminated. All
outdoor luminaires that illuminate the area under outdoor
canopies shall comply with the requirement. Outdoor canopies
include, but are not limited to, the following applications:
[1] Fuel island canopies associated with service stations and
convenience stores.

they do not project their output into the windows of
neighboring residences, adjacent properties, skyward or onto a
public roadway. The use of searchlights or laser source lights
for advertising or entertainment purposes is prohibited
without a special permit.
(d) Unless otherwise permitted by the appropriate officers or
agents of the Township, e.g., for safety or security or all-night
operations, lighting for commercial, industrial, public
recreational and institutional applications shall be controlled
by automatic switching devices such as time clocks or
combination motion detectors and photcells, to permit
extinguishing outdoor lighting fixtures between 11:00 p.m. and
dawn, to mitigate nuisance glare and sky-lighting
consequences.

municipal applications, shall be reduced by 75% from then
until dawn, unless supporting a specific purpose and approved
by the appropriate officers or agent of the Township.
(f) All illumination for buildings and/or surrounding landscapes
for decorative, advertising or aesthetic purposes is prohibited
between 11:00 p.m. and sunrise, except that such lighting
situated on the premises of a commercial establishment may
remain illuminated while the establishment is actually open for
business, and until one hour after closing.
(g) Vegetation screens shall not be employed to serve as the
primary means for controlling glare. Rather, glare control shall
be achieved primarily through the use of such means as cutoff
fixtures, shields and baffles and appropriate application of
fixture mounting height, wattage, aiming angle and fixture
placement.
(h) In no case shall the intensity of illumination exceed 0.1
horizontal, and 0.1 vertical footcandles. Horizontal footcandles
shall be measured at grade. Vertical footcandles shall be
measured line-of-sight, five feet above grade at the property
line.
(i) Externally illuminated signs and billboards shall be lighted by

(j) Mounting height. Lighting fixtures shall be mounted at a
maximum total height of 20 feet above the ground, except such
height shall be reduced to 16 feet within residentially used
properties or within 200 feet of a residentially used lot, except
for authorized institutional use. This height limitation shall not
apply to lights needed for air safety, that solely are intended to
illuminate a steeple or similar architectural feature, or that
illuminate outdoor public recreation facilities.
(k) For land development applications where lighting is required
(i.e., zoning hearings, conditional use hearings), the
credentials of the expert in outdoor lighting shall be described
in writing. If the expert testimony is provided by more than one
person, the credibility of each expert may be weighed by the
Township.
(l) Directional fixtures for such applications as facade, fountain,
feature and landscape illumination shall be aimed so as not to
project their output beyond the objects intended to be
illuminated, shall be extinguished between the hours of 11:00
§ 170-1514 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1514

p.m. and dawn and shall not be in conflict with the Township's
aim to maintain its rural character.
(m) The use of white strobe lighting for tall structures such as
smokestacks, chimneys and radio/communications/television
towers is prohibited. No exterior luminaire shall have blinking,
flashing or fluttering features.
(n) This subsection shall not restrict routine types of holiday
lighting between November 15 and January 5, provided such
lighting does not produce glare. No beacon light or nighttime
strobe light shall be permitted. This subsection shall not
restrict lights necessary to meet Federal Aviation
Administration requirements.
(o) Outdoor lighting shall be limited to a maximum of 0.25
footcandles in the cases where one of the following situations

(b) Before a conditional use is granted for recreational and sports
lighting and nighttime events, the applicant will conduct traffic
and parking studies and report the results to Westtown
Township to determine if parking, vehicle access and egress,
pedestrian walkways, and site lighting are adequate for
handling the most well-attended anticipated events. The
studies shall be prepared by a qualified traffic consultant and
shall enable the Township to identify traffic and/or parking
problems associated with such events. The studies shall
identify solutions and recommend improvements to mitigate
adverse impacts of the lighted events, if any are found to exist.
(c) An annual permit application shall be required to be submitted
to the Township 45 days before the start of each sports and
recreation year that a permanent recreational and sports
lighting installation is proposed to be utilized. A permit fee
schedule shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors each year to cover all costs to the Township to
include, but not limited to, the following:
[1] Special police detail from the Westtown East Goshen
Police Department to control traffic, parking and on-site
security for any lighted event as determined by the Board

higher mounting height is essential to meet or exceed the
other requirements of this section while still controlling
off-site glare, light trespass and daytime visibility of the
light fixtures as viewed from off site.
[4] The lighting shall be accomplished only through the use of
full cutoff or fully shielded fixtures that employ suitable
shielding. Such lighting shall be designed, installed,
aimed, and maintained so that neither lamps (bulbs) nor
primary reflecting surfaces shall be visible from any
window of residential properties within a radius of 1,800
feet of the boundary of lighted field. The fixtures shall not
present a hazard to drivers or pedestrians by projecting
glare that impairs their ability to safely traverse streets,
driveways, sidewalks, pathways and trails. The fixtures
shall be mounted at an appropriate height, angle, and
location to comply with the above conditions.

C. General standards applicable to all properties on which animals are
kept.
(1) No animals of any kind shall be kept in any structure or elsewhere
on the premises in a manner likely to cause excessive noise,
unhealthy or unsanitary conditions, pollution of groundwater or
surface water, or pollution of stormwater runoff leaving the
property.
(2) Permanent shelter for animals shall be provided in agricultural
areas, as appropriate. Permanent shelter shall be provided for all
animals in residential areas. Such shelter shall be of sufficient size
for good sanitation practices and shall be equipped with adequate
facilities for food, water, and manure removal and handling for the
number and type(s) of animals kept. The location of shelter for
small domestic animals shall conform to setback standards
otherwise applicable to accessory structures. Shelter for all other
animals shall be located not less than 100 feet from any lot line.
(3) A fenced or otherwise enclosed outside area shall be provided

apply.
(2) The Zoning Officer may, as a prerequisite to the issuance of a
building permit, use permit, and/or occupancy permit, advise the
Board to require of the applicant additional information on the
adequacy of the proposed water source, and the potential impacts
of the proposed groundwater removal on any wells relied upon by
neighboring properties.
C. For any use authorized under the terms of this chapter, stormwater
shall be managed in compliance with Chapter 149, Subdivision and
Land Development. Emphasis shall be on retention and infiltration of
stormwater on site, unless this is deemed by the Township to be clearly
impractical or inappropriate in relation to site conditions; any
alternative shall be approved by the Township Engineer.
D. Where any aspect of the water supply system requires a permit from
the Delaware River Basin Commission (including regulations governing
well withdrawal of 10,000 or more gallons per day, as they may be
amended), the Chester County Health Department, or any other agency,
such permit shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of a building permit,
use permit, or occupancy permit.
E. Any of the following facilities may be installed, and any of the activities
undertaken, in conjunction with any nonresidential use authorized
under the terms of this chapter, only upon demonstration by the
applicant that all reasonable measures will be taken to minimize the
adverse impacts of the proposed action on the Township's groundwater
resources. To minimize shall not mean to eliminate, but to make the

(c) An area measured in acres equal to 75% of the total area
comprising any of the following: [Amended 5-2-2005 by Ord.
No. 2005-4]
[1] Any area subject to floodplain regulations; [Amended
9-5-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-3]
[2] Any area where the slope gradient is 25% or greater;
[3] Any area designated as a wetland.
(d) An area measured in acres equal to 25% of the total area
comprising any area containing seasonally high water table
soils. [Added 5-2-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-4]
(2) In the event two or more of the above-named features overlap, the
overlapped area with the most severe reduction shall be counted,
and the overlapped areas shall be counted only once. [Amended
5-2-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-4]
B. The maximum density of use on any tract within a particular zoning
district shall be as follows:
(1) The tract area shall be established according to the procedures of
§ 170-1519A(1) above.
(2) For a proposed residential use, the maximum number of dwelling
units on the tract shall be calculated by multiplying the tract areas
by the appropriate multiplier set forth below. Calculations resulting
in fractions shall be rounded to the next lower whole number.
(a) A/C District.
[1] Standard single-family detached dwelling subdivision:
tract area x 0.5.
[2] Flexible development: tract area x 1.1, except where
bonus density up to a maximum multiplier of 1.5 is
permitted as provided in § 170-904A(2).
[3] Adult community development: tract area multiplied by
1.5, except as provided below. As part of a conditional use
application, as a density bonus, the Board of Supervisors
shall approve an increase in the maximum density above
1.5 dwelling units per acre where the Board is satisfied
that all applicable conditions set forth herein are met. In
no case shall the maximum density be increased to result
in a maximum total greater than 2.25 dwelling units per
acre. Such bonus shall be approved if the applicant proves
to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that the
applicant will complete or fund substantial public
improvements to mitigate one or more significant off-site
impacts of the development or achieve other significant
§ 170-1519 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1519
1:690
community planning objectives, consistent with the
provisions of Subsection B(2)(a)[3][a] below. [Amended
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
[a] Substantial public improvements or design
approaches potentially eligible for bonus density
consideration include, but are not necessarily limited
to significant transportation, water supply or sanitary
sewer improvements; provision of substantial open
space in addition to the minimum otherwise required;
protection and/or renovation/reuse of identified
historic resources as part of the development;
provision of land suitable for active recreation, public
or community facilities; or other substantial public
improvement identified by the Township at the time of
the conditional use approval process and which
significantly reduces the need for public expenditures
to achieve clear public need(s).
[b] At the time of conditional use application, the
applicant shall identify the specific proposed
substantial public improvement(s) for which bonus
density is requested, shall indicate the anticipated
cost(s) of completing such improvement(s) and shall
submit plans and/or other documentation sufficient to
demonstrate the applicant's ability to achieve the
proposed improvements. The amount of density bonus
granted for any substantial public improvement(s)
shall be established by the Board of Supervisors as a
condition of approval based on a preponderance of
evidence as follows: bonus density, measured in an
incremental increase in dwelling units, shall be
determined by roughly equating the incremental cost
to the developer of providing substantial public
improvement(s), with a reasonable value to the
developer for the increase in unit count.
[c] Subject to approval by the Board of Supervisors as
provided herein, incremental bonus density shall be
provided in, but shall not be limited to, the following
situations:
[d] Bonus dwelling units for preservation of historic sites
and landscapes. One additional dwelling unit may be
provided for each two acres comprising a lot (or open
space parcel) which contains any Township-, state- or
federally designated historic site or historic building
or any historic site or building included or eligible for
inclusion in the Chester County Historic Sites Survey
and where such acreage otherwise meets all
applicable criteria for open space. The use of this
§ 170-1519 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1519
1:691
bonus shall be limited to no more than four bonus
dwelling units for each distinct historic landscape
preserved and shall be subject to the criteria set forth
in § 170-904A(2)(c)[1][a], [b] and [c].
[e] Bonus dwelling units for historic restoration/
rehabilitation. Where preservation of historic sites, as
provided in § 170-1519B(2)(a)[3][c][i] above, includes
restoration or rehabilitation of historic structures
approved by the Township, one additional dwelling
unit may be provided for each 2,000 square feet, or
portion thereof exceeding 1,000 square feet, of
habitable floor area on all floor levels in the historic
sections of such structures, subject to the criteria set
forth in § 170-904A(2)(c)[2][a], [b], [c], [d] and [e].
[f] Bonus density for provision for additional open space.
Two additional dwelling units may be provided for
each acre, exclusive of floodplain areas, wetland areas
and areas of greater than twenty-five-percent slope, of
common open space that is provided in excess of
applicable minimum open space requirements and
where such open space is permanently restricted from
future development for other than approved open
space purposes, subject to establishment of
conservation easement(s) or other restrictive
covenant(s) acceptable to the Township.
[g] Bonus density for provision for recreational facilities.
Two additional dwelling units may be provided for
each acre of common open space, regardless of any
other open space requirement or bonus, where such
open space is developed and made available to the
public for active recreational use, upon the
recommendation of the Township Park Advisory
Group.
[h] Bonus density for provision for infrastructure
improvements. Additional dwelling units may be
provided where the applicant constructs or funds the
construction of significant public infrastructure
improvements clearly in excess of that which is
required to serve the proposed development,
including but not limited to public sewer and/or water
facilities, public road or highway improvements,
public trails, and structures devoted to public
recreational use. The number of bonus dwelling units
shall be commensurate with the cost of the substantial
public improvements as provided above.
§ 170-1519 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1519
1:692
[i] Where the applicant demonstrates partial
achievement of the substantial public improvements
identified by the Township, the Board of Supervisors,
at its sole discretion, may approve density bonus in
increments reasonably related to the public
improvement or design mitigation to be achieved. No
density bonus shall be granted for any improvements
that an applicant for a development would be required
to complete or fund under a Township, Township
Authority, state or federal requirement. For example,
in the case of public street improvements, no density
bonus shall be granted for improvements to a segment
of an existing street immediately adjacent to the
applicant's property and improvements that would
otherwise be required by the Township and/or the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.
[j] Commitment on the part of the applicant to complete
or fund substantial public improvements shall be in a
legally binding form acceptable to the Township
Solicitor.
[4] Continuing care retirement community (CCRC). [Added
9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
[a] The density limitations established herein shall apply
collectively to all independent living residences and
assisted living residences included in a CCRC. Skilled
nursing beds in a nursing facility that is developed as
a required component of a CCRC shall not be counted
toward any density limitation but shall be subject to
the provisions of § 170-1303.
[b] Maximum base density in a CCRC shall be established
as tract area x 3.
[c] Maximum total density shall be increased above the
base density calculated per Subsection B(2)[4][b]
above, where units are allocated to two-family
dwellings, townhouses (single-family attached
dwellings) or apartments, as follows:
[d] For each unit in the base density allocation, each twofamily
or townhouse dwelling shall be entitled to one
additional two-family or townhouse dwelling unit over
and above the base density calculation.
[e] For each unit in the base density allocation, each
apartment dwelling shall be entitled to two additional
apartment dwellings over and above the base density
§ 170-1519 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1519
1:693
calculation, except where allocated to assisted living
residences.
[f] For each unit in the base density allocation, each
assisted living residence shall be entitled to three
additional assisted living residences over and above
the base density calculation.
[g] Notwithstanding density increases as provided in
Subsection B(2)[4][c] above, the total maximum
density (collective number of all dwellings) shall be
limited to tract area x 8.

§ 170-1603. Accessory uses and structures. [Amended 3-3-2003 by
Ord. No. 2003-2]
Uses considered customarily accessory and incidental to any permitted use
under this chapter shall include those generally provided for within the
various zoning districts. In addition, the uses listed herein shall specifically
be deemed accessory in accordance with the following terms:
A. Accessory dwellings. [Amended 9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1;
5-21-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-5]
(1) Specific intent. In allowing opportunities for the creation of
accessory dwelling units, it is the specific intent of this subsection
to address directly the housing needs of small households to make
more efficient use of the Townships existing building stock and
infrastructure.
(2) Standards for accessory dwellings. Where authorized as a special
exception under the terms of this chapter, accessory dwellings may
be created in accordance with the following standards:
(a) There shall not be more than one accessory dwelling unit
created on any single-family residential lot.
(b) The accessory dwelling unit may be located in the principal
dwelling or in a structure which is accessory to the principal
dwelling and is located on the same single-family residential
lot.
(c) One of the two dwelling units shall be occupied by the owner of

(d) The accessory dwelling unit shall be occupied only by members
of the family of the occupants of the principal dwelling or those
providing care or services to the occupants of the principal
dwelling unit.
(e) The minimum size of an accessory dwelling shall be 500 square
feet of gross habitable area. The accessory dwelling shall
comprise not more than 35% of the gross habitable area of the
principal dwelling prior to creation of the accessory dwelling.
However, in no case shall the accessory dwelling exceed 1,200
square feet, not including any vehicle garage space.
(f) No other alterations to the exterior of the structure shall be
permitted unless necessary for health or safety reasons. No
exterior changes shall be made which, in the judgment of the
Zoning Hearing Board, are not in conformance with the
existing single-family character of the neighborhood.
(g) Except where an off-site sewage system is available, the
applicant shall submit to the Township a permit for an on-site
sewage disposal system issued by the Chester County Health
§ 170-1603 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1603
1:699
Department, certifying that the sewage disposal facilities are
adequate for the projected number of residents. Where the
existing on-site system is found to be inadequate, by the
Department, to serve the projected demand, no approval shall
be given for the accessory dwelling unit until the system is
improved to meet Health Department requirements and a
permit is issued by the Department.
(h) One off-street parking space shall be required for the
accessory dwelling unit in addition to those required for the
principal dwelling. The additional parking space shall not be
located within any required yard area.
(i) To ensure compliance with this chapter, an architectural plan
shall be submitted, accurately drawn to scale, indicating the
location and size of the existing and proposed dwelling units,
parking areas and any proposed exterior alterations.

lot. Where building area exceeds 600 square feet, one
additional parking space shall be provided for each additional
200 square feet of building area.
(c) Sale of farm products shall be conducted either from a
temporary stand, dismantled at the end of the growing season,
or from a permanent building, the location of which complies
with all Township setback standards for that zoning district.

§ 170-1605. Home occupations. [Amended 9-15-1997 by Ord. No.
97-3]
There shall be two categories of home occupations: "minor" and "major."
Such uses shall be permitted when in accordance with the following
standards:
(3) In no event shall the provisions of this section be construed to
authorize as a permissible residential accessory use a microwave
antenna for satellite communication that is used or intended to be
used for the propagation or transmission of radio or
electromagnetic waves. It is the intent hereof that such microwave
antennae shall be permitted only within the Commercial (C-1) and
Multi-Use (M-U) Districts.
A. General standards applicable to all home occupation classifications.
The following standards shall apply to all home occupations, whether
minor or major:
(1) Operation. A home occupation shall be conducted within a dwelling
which is the residence of the principal practitioner.
(2) Permit. All applicants shall be required to obtain a permit in
accordance with the requirements of § 170-1605C.
(3) Structural appearance. The appearance of the residential structure
or accessory structure shall not be altered or the occupation be
conducted in such a manner which would cause the premises to
differ from its residential character by the use of materials,
construction, lighting, show windows, signs, or advertising visible
outside the premises to attract customers or clients, other than
those signs permitted by this chapter. No interior display of goods
shall be visible from the outside.
(4) Vehicles. The storage of commercial vehicles shall comply with
§ 170-1605A(10) and (11) below.
(5) Storage. There shall be no exterior storage of materials or refuse
resulting from the operation of the home occupation.
(6) Hazardous materials. There shall be no storage or use upon the
premises of toxic, explosive, polluting, dangerous, or other
substances defined as hazardous by the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection.
(7) Nuisance. No equipment or process shall be used in a home
occupation which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors,
dust, or electrical interference detectable to normal senses beyond
the property line in excess of levels customarily generated by a
residential use. Only general types and sizes of machinery that are
typically found in dwellings for hobby or domestic purposes shall
§ 170-1604 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1605
1:705
be permitted. No use shall generate any of the conditions listed
above in excess of what is typical in a residential neighborhood.
(8) Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to
prove that the standards of this section will be met. Based upon the
potential nuisances of a proposed major home occupation, the
Zoning Hearing Board may determine that a particular type or
intensity of use is unsuitable to be a home occupation or that the
proposed lot area or setbacks are not sufficient to contain such
nuisances.
(9) Truck traffic. The use shall not require the parking or servicing by a
vehicle with more than 26,000 pounds gross registered vehicle
weight.
(10) Hours. Home occupations shall be conducted in a way that is in
conformance with the provisions of § 170-1515, Noise standards, of
this chapter. This time limit shall also apply to any loading or
unloading of vehicles on the property or on a street that causes
noise to adjoining residents.
(11) Advertising. The address of the home occupation shall not be
advertised in such a way that would encourage customers or
salespersons to come to the property.
B. Determination of classification. The Zoning Officer shall determine
whether a proposed home occupation is minor, major, or prohibited. The
applicant shall be responsible for supplying such information as
deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to make this determination.
C. Issuance of permits. The following procedure for approval and
permitting shall apply:
(1) Upon determination that the proposed use is a minor home
occupation and is in conformance with the requirements of this
chapter, the Zoning Officer shall issue a zoning permit.
(2) Where the Zoning Officer determines that the proposed use is a
major home occupation and does not meet any or all of the criteria
specified for a permitted home occupation listed in § 170-1605G,
the use shall require review and approval by the Zoning Hearing
Board in accordance with the provisions of § 170-2108 and the
criteria of this section. The Zoning Hearing Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, as it deems necessary, to
implement the purposes of this chapter. Following approval, the
Zoning Officer shall issue a zoning permit.
D. Permit limitations. A home occupation permit shall not be transferable
to another property or to another type of home occupation. The permit
issued shall only be valid for the use and on the property for which it
was originally issued. The permit shall expire five years from the date of
its issuance. Both minor and major permits may be renewed by the
§ 170-1605 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1605
1:706
Zoning Officer if upon review of the renewal application the Zoning
Officer determines that there has been no substantial change in the
scope of the original permit.

major home occupation.
(18) Any occupation that the Zoning Hearing Board deems similarly
objectionable in terms of scale and impact.
(19) Other uses of similar character to those listed above.
F. Minor home occupation. Minor home occupations shall meet the
definition of "no-impact home-based business," as that term is defined
by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 10107, as
amended, and all of the criteria contained therein, which currently

approval of an institution, shall consider the proximity of the proposed
use to any other similar institution within the Township and/or to
similar facilities in adjacent municipalities, and shall not approve any
such request where resulting proximity might unduly alter the intended
character of the neighborhood through the relative concentration and
scale of such uses.
F. In addition to the requirements of § 170-1508 of this chapter, there shall

§ 170-1608. Conversion of dwellings.
L. One sign shall be permitted in association with a bed-and-breakfast
operation. Any such sign shall comply with the standards for home
occupation signs contained in Article XVIII of this chapter.
M. Each bed-and-breakfast facility shall be equipped with smoke detectors
and fire extinguishers in accordance with the requirements of the
Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry and with the
stipulations of the Township Fire Code.96 Guests shall be provided
information regarding the floor plan of the dwelling and the location of
emergency exits.
N. Except where an off-site sewage system is available, no permit for a
bed-and-breakfast facility will be issued by the Zoning Officer unless
the applicant furnishes written approval from the Chester County
Health Department concerning the adequacy of the on-site sewage
system to serve the increased demand resulting from the bed-andbreakfast
facility.
A. Statement of intent. The intent of this section is to provide alternative
uses for structurally sound, large, and primarily older single-family
detached dwellings that are costly to maintain as a single-family use
and contain an excessive amount of living space for today's decreasing
family size. This section is also intended to increase the supply of
smaller dwelling units and provide for a more efficient use of the
existing housing stock, while protecting the character of sound, stable
residential neighborhoods and preserving the basic character of
dwellings that might otherwise become obsolete.
B. Standards for conversion to other residential use. A single-family
detached dwelling, existing on the effective date of this chapter, may be
converted into and used as a two-family or multifamily dwelling, when
approved as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board in
accordance with the terms of Article XXI of this chapter and with the
following stipulations: [Amended 5-2-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-4]
(1) The owner of the converted structure must reside on the premises.
(2) Site and architectural plans for the conversion of said dwelling
shall be submitted to the Zoning Hearing Board. Where two or
more families are to be housed above the ground floor, such plans
shall bear the approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Labor
and Industry as required by law.
(3) Such plans shall provide adequate and suitable parking spaces for
a minimum of two automobiles per proposed dwelling unit. These
spaces shall not be located between the front lot line and dwelling.

(4) Such dwelling(s) shall be subject to the height, width, yard, and
other applicable regulations effective in the zoning district where
the existing single-family dwelling is located.
(5) In no instance shall the lot area for a converted structure be less
than three acres.
(6) There shall be no external alteration of the building except as may
be necessary for reasons of safety. Fire escapes and outside
stairways shall, where practicable, be located to the rear of the
building.
(7) A new dwelling unit resulting from conversion shall have a
minimum habitable floor area of 500 square feet.
(8) Regardless of the size of the existing structure, the total number of
dwelling units following conversion shall not exceed five.
(9) Except where an off-site sewage system is available, the applicant
shall submit a permit for an on-site sewage disposal system issued
by the Chester County Health Department, certifying that the
proposed sewage disposal facilities are adequate for the projected
number of residents.
(10) The Zoning Hearing Board may specify the maximum number of
dwelling units to be created within any such structure, and may
prescribe such further conditions and restrictions with respect to
the conversion and use of such dwelling, and to the use of the lot,
as the Board may consider appropriate.
A. No minimum lot area shall apply to the growing and harvesting of
crops, plants or trees or raising of insects (such as honeybees), or
aquaculture. A use involving the keeping of animals shall meet the lot
area requirements of § 170-1516. The raising of mushrooms shall
require a one-hundred-acre minimum lot area. Unless otherwise stated,
any other agricultural use shall require a minimum of 10 acres. Manure
shall not be kept on-site unless it was generated on-site and is actively
awaiting proper disposal or is being actively used on-site.

storage shall be established any closer than 100 feet from any property
line. Further, no manure, compost, or material of similar character may
be bulk stored within 300 feet of the boundary of any property used
and/or zoned for residential purposes.
F. Agricultural runoff.
(1) Runoff from agricultural buildings and other impervious surfaces
shall be directed around areas where manure is stored or otherwise
concentrated.
(2) The property shall be graded or otherwise managed so that runoff
as described in Subsection F(1) above shall be confined to the lot.

§ 170-1612A(3)(a). Applicants are required to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Township that the requirements of
Subsection A(3), Standards for surface land uses affiliated with
transmission pipelines, can be met.
(b) Except as otherwise designated in Subsection A(3) below,
surface land uses affiliated with transmission pipelines shall be
permitted as a principal use in all other zoning districts where
underground pipelines exist as of the date of adoption of this
section on properties owned by Westtown Township when
authorized as a conditional use pursuant to Subsection A(3),
Standards for surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines, and Article XX, § 170-2009, Conditional uses. In

(d) All other uses ancillary to surface land uses affiliated with
transmission pipelines are prohibited unless otherwise
permitted in the zoning district in which the use is located.
(3) Standards for surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines. The following standards will be considered by the
Township prior to permitting surface land uses affiliated with
transmission pipelines:
(a) Setbacks.
[1] Unless otherwise approved by the Board of Supervisors
upon recommendation of the Township Planning
Commission, surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines and all supporting equipment and structures
shall be set back a minimum of 750 feet from residential
buildings and all commercial, industrial and institutional
uses or a minimum of 500 feet from the nearest lot line,
whichever is greater.
[2] Setbacks may be increased by the Board of Supervisors
pursuant to the type of material being managed at the
surface land use affiliated with transmission pipelines and
whether the use is adjacent to areas of high on-site
population. The Township shall, on a case-by-case basis,
determine whether increased setbacks are warranted
consistent with the potential impact radius (PIR), defined
by the relationship between the diameter of the adjacent
pipeline (and appurtenances) and its maximum operating
pressure (see Exhibit 1), 98whether high on-site
§ 170-1612 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1612
1:720
populations are located in close proximity, and whether
more than one transmission pipeline (such as coupled
lines) will be managed at the surface land use affiliated
thereto.
[a] The PIR approach is applicable only to surface land
uses affiliated with "gas" or "petroleum gas"
transmission pipelines as defined by 49 CFR 192.3.
Surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines carrying "hazardous liquids," as defined by
49 CFR 195.2, shall adhere to the setback standards
contained in this subsection.
(b) Landscaping. The applicant shall provide a plan prepared by a
landscape architect licensed in Pennsylvania showing
landscaping proposed to be installed to screen and buffer
surface land uses affiliated with transmission pipelines. The
landscape plan shall incorporate the use of an eight-foot
decorative fence surrounded by a mix of native vegetation,
including evergreens, shrubbery and trees, which shall not be
less than the height of the fence and shall be of sufficient
density to screen the facility. Existing vegetation in proximity
to surface land uses affiliated with transmission pipelines shall
be preserved to the greatest extent possible. All proposed
landscaping shall comply with the requirements of § 149-925 of
Chapter 149, Subdivision of Land. Applicants shall submit a
visual survey from mutually agreed upon vantage points in
order to support the proposed landscaping plan's mitigation of
visual impacts.
(c) Noise. All noise impacts are subject to the standards set forth
under § 170-1515 and sound produced by the surface land use
affiliated with transmission pipelines shall not result in noise or
vibration clearly exceeding the average intensity of noise or
vibration occurring from other causes at the property line; in
no case shall the sound pressure level exceed 60 dB(A)
[according to the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) "a" weighted scale] at the property line closest to the
land use.
(d) Odors. Odor, vapors or particulate matter produced by the
surface land use affiliated with transmission pipelines shall not
exceed the average emission of such substances occurring
from other causes at the property line. Specific contaminants
shall be regulated by Pa. Code Title 25, Environmental
Protection, Part 1, Subpart C, Article III, Air Resources.
(e) Signage. All signs, other than utility identification signs,
appropriate warning signs, or owner identification signs, shall
98.Editor's Note; Said exhibit is on file in the Township offices.

be prohibited. There shall be no antennas, advertising, or other
items or material affixed to or otherwise placed on surface land
uses affiliated with transmission pipelines, except as permitted
by the Township.
(f) Parking. If the surface land use affiliated with transmission
pipelines is fully automated, adequate parking shall be
required for maintenance workers. If the site is not automated,
the number of parking spaces shall be equal to the number of
people on the largest shift. Parking spaces shall be located
within the decorative fence and landscape buffer area so they
are substantially concealed when viewed from surrounding
properties.
(g) Lighting. No surface land use affiliated with pipeline utilities
shall be artificially lighted except as required for emergency
night time access. Any such lights shall be shielded so as to
prevent intrusion upon nearby properties.
(h) Engineered drawing submission. Applications for a land use
affiliated with pipeline utilities shall be accompanied by
engineering drawings prepared by an engineer licensed in
Pennsylvania. The applicant shall show that all applicable
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and United States standards
for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the
proposed facility have been met.
(i) Design. The applicant proposing a surface land use affiliated
with transmission pipelines must demonstrate that the
structure has been designed to blend in with or mimic existing
structures in the landscape such as residential outbuildings,
farm structures, or other uses permitted in the underlying
districts.
(j) Visual impact. Any surface land use affiliated with transmission
pipelines shall be designed and constructed so as to mitigate
the visual impact from public roads and nearby uses. In
addition, the color and other visual features of the land use
affiliated with pipeline utilities shall be designed and installed
in such a manner so as to create the least visual impact
practicable. The applicant shall demonstrate compliance with
this section, by among other things, providing photographic
perspectives of the proposed site from all sides of the property,
adjacent road ways and neighboring properties (with
permission of the owners).
(k) Emergency response. The applicant for a surface land use
affiliated with transmission pipelines is required to provide the
Township with an emergency liaison that may be reached 24
hours a day, seven days a week, in the event of an emergency.

Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(PADEP) and/or the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission
(PA PUC)]. Such documentation is not required as part of the
initial application to the Township, but must be included with
the final as-built plans submitted upon approval by the
Township.
(n) Removal of surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines. Any surface land uses affiliated with transmission
pipelines that are no longer licensed and active shall be
removed and the site restored to its original condition at the
owner's expense within 60 days of the last date that the facility
was licensed by the PADEP and FERC. A bond or escrow
account shall be posted with the Township in an amount
sufficient to ensure such removal and site restoration prior to
the construction of the facility. The applicant shall have
prepared and submit to the Township, to accompany the bond
or escrow account, an estimate of the cost necessary to remove
the surface land use facility associated with the pipeline and
restore the site to its preconstruction condition.

residential use or district, all structures shall be a minimum of
75 feet from that boundary.
(c) The buildings, streets, driveways, and related structures shall
be laid out and constructed with the intent of encouraging an
attractive facility on a large site with the buildings sited as
compactly as is reasonably feasible and in a manner intended
to duplicate the appearance and feel of a small, integrated
community or village. The physical design of the personal care
facility and the appurtenant improvements shall provide for
adequate control of vehicular traffic, make adequate provisions
for public water, public sewer, erosion and sedimentation
control, stormwater management, fire protection and other
public services and further the amenities of light, air, and

To provide refuge for public transit riders from adverse weather conditions,
a bus shelter shall be permitted, provided that all of the following
requirements are satisfied:
protection, safety measures, construction standards, and design
standards to accommodate the handicapped. The Board of
Supervisors may authorize approval of the conditional use
contingent upon the requisite approvals being obtained.
(17) The Board of Supervisors shall consider the proximity of the
proposed use to any other similar institution within the Township
and/or to similar facilities in adjacent municipalities and shall not
approve any such request where resulting proximity might unduly
alter the intended character of the neighborhood through the
relative concentration and scale of such uses.
C. Design standards.
(1) Screening: As required by § 170-1508 of this chapter.
(2) Storage: As required by § 170-1509.
(3) Landscaping: As required by § 170-1507.

Department of Transportation, whichever is more restrictive. Bus
shelters shall be permitted in the street right-of-way.
D. Such shelters shall be durably constructed. For security and safety
purposes, the majority of the bus shelter shall be constructed of clear
lexan, plexiglass, or clear tempered safety glass. In addition, the roof
may be constructed of translucent plexiglass or another suitable
material. The view into a bus shelter may only be obstructed from one
of the bus shelter panels, or sides. Bus shelters shall not exceed 45
square feet and nine feet in height.
E. All lighting of the shelter and the signs shall be installed in such a way
that the source of the light is shielded from direct view of abutting
properties and from traffic along the street(s), and so that noxious glare
is not created. Illumination shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles, a minimum
CRI (Color Rendering Index) of 65, and shall be shielded so as to
minimize the off-site impact of the illumination.
F. The only signs that shall be permitted shall be those that conform to
those in this section and permitted by any written agreement, in
addition to maps and schedules providing information regarding the
public transit service. Off-premises outdoor advertising signage in a bus
shelter, except for route map and schedule information, shall be limited
to one double-faced panel, or side, of the bus shelter. Such advertising
and signage shall conform to § 170-1806D and E of this chapter.
[Amended 6-20-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-4]
A. Purposes. This section is intended to serve the following objectives, in
addition to the overall objectives of this chapter:
(1) To recognize that developments housing older persons typically
generate lower average rates of vehicle traffic, water usage and
wastewater usage than other types of residential development, and
less impacts upon the public school system, and a lower average
number of residents per dwelling unit, and therefore, that a higher
density is justified for this type of development than other types of
residential development;
(2) To provide for residential developments that meet the growing
needs of older persons, including the need for quality housing,
fellowship, oversight, open space and recreation facilities;
(3) To encourage innovations in residential development so that
growing demand for housing may be met by greater variety in type,
design and layout of dwellings, and by conservation of open space
within such a development in a manner that serves important
public purposes;
§ 170-1614 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1615
1:728
(4) To encourage flexibility in site planning which will respect and
conserve natural resources, such as streams, ponds, floodplains,
groundwater, wooded areas, steeply sloped areas, and areas of
significant beauty or importance to the natural ecosystem; to seek
to incorporate key scenic views into site designs;
(5) To encourage more efficient use of land and public services;
(6) To provide for patterns of development around the perimeter of a
tract that are compatible with neighboring development and the
Township's planned trails and greenway system, while allowing
greater flexibility within the interior of the tract;
(7) To recognize that the impacts of higher density developments can
be offset by substantial public improvements by a developer, the
preservation of important open spaces, and careful site design; and
(8) To maintain the scenic and natural character of Westtown Township
as viewed from major roads, scenic roads and trails.

a permitted sign. Where the buffer area is required along a public
street, it shall be measured from the future street right-of-way.
(a) The buffer area plantings shall be shown on an overall
landscaping plan. Such plan shall be prepared and sealed by a
registered landscape architect and shall meet the
requirements of § 149-922 et seq. of Chapter 149, Subdivision
and Land Development. A complete visual screen is not
required, but instead the landscaping is intended to filter and
soften views of new development from adjacent roads and
homes. Such landscaping and any berming shall be designed to
have a naturalistic appearance with a mix of plant species
along existing perimeter public streets.
(b) The Board of Supervisors shall have the authority as part of the
conditional use approval process to reduce the eighty-foot
minimum width buffer to a minimum of 30 feet in specific
locations where the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Board of Supervisors that the reduced buffer would still meet
the purposes of § 170-1615A. The authority to reduce the
buffer width is intended primarily to address specific portions
of the site where unique topographic conditions minimize the
visual impact of the development from the perimeter of the
site.
(c) Fencing that is mostly open (such as split-rail fencing) and is
constructed of wood or materials with a similar appearance
may be used to supplement the landscaping.
(d) The perimeter landscaping provisions of § 149-925 of Chapter
149, Subdivision and Land Development, shall apply. For an
adult community development, those perimeter landscaping
provisions shall be modified as follows:

1:735
(6) Any proposed dwelling unit within 200 feet of a lot line of an
existing single-family detached dwelling on another lot shall be a
single-family detached dwelling. However, this requirement shall
not apply if the proposed dwelling would be separated from the
existing dwelling by a public street.
D. Impact studies.
(1) A traffic study meeting the requirements of § 149-804 of Chapter
149, Subdivision and Land Development, shall be required to be
submitted at the time of the conditional use application. In
addition, such traffic study shall consider accident-prone segments
and other off-site traffic safety hazards that may be worsened by
the proposed development.
(2) A community impact study shall be submitted by the applicant at
the time of the conditional use application. This study shall
consider the impact of the development upon water supply
systems, sewage treatment and collection systems, the school
district, Township finances and services, and fire and emergency
medical services. Improvements to such systems shall be identified
that will be necessary to accommodate the impacts from the
development. Particular attention shall be paid to proving that
adequate access will be possible to all dwellings and principal
buildings by emergency vehicles.
E. Open space and public uses. A minimum of 50% of the gross area of the
tract shall be permanently preserved as common open space.
(1) If so stated by the Board of Supervisors as part of the conditional
use approval, a maximum of 10% of the required common open
space may be required to be dedicated to the Township for use as a
nonrecreation public use.
(2) Except as provided in the above Subsection E(1), all of the required
common open space shall meet the requirements for open space:
(a) The 50% open space required by this section shall be in place
of the amount of open space that would otherwise be required
under § 149-921, or its successor section, of Chapter 149,
Subdivision and Land Development.
(b) The minimum open space shall meet the requirements of the
following sections of Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land
Development: § 149-921C(2) through (4), 149-921C(6)(d)
through (g), 149-921D and E.
(c) To count towards the required open space, land must be
landscaped in trees, shrubs and other vegetation; preserved in
woods or natural vegetation; be developed as active or passive
recreational facilities; or approved under Subsection E(3)
below.

1:736
(d) Open space shall be interconnected with common open space
areas on abutting parcels where possible, including provisions
for pedestrian pathways for general public use to create linked
pathway systems within the Township.
(e) Open space areas are not required to be served by their own
off-street parking, unless they are developed for active
recreation facilities.
(3) A stormwater detention or retention basin shall not be permitted to
be counted towards the minimum open space requirement unless
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors
that such basin shall comply with the provisions of § 170-904A(3)(c)
and would be designed and constructed to serve a recreational use
during the vast majority of weather conditions, or would function as
a scenic open space asset. [Amended 5-2-2005 by Ord. No.
2005-4]
(4) The following areas shall not be permitted to be counted towards
the minimum open space requirement:
(a) Areas within the lot lines of a fee-simple lot;
(b) Areas within 20 feet of the front, rear or side of a principal
building;
(c) Open space with a width of less than 50 feet, except such width
may be reduced to 20 feet if the open space is part of a
interlinked pathway system; and
(d) Areas involving less than 0.25 acres of contiguous open space.
(5) The applicant shall provide a suitable recreation trail easement
that allows pedestrian access by the public where necessary to
complete a link included within Township Comprehensive Plan or
Park, Recreation and Open Space Plan, or where otherwise
required under Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land Development.
(6) If land is proposed for dedication to the Township for recreation
purposes, the applicant may be required by the Board of
Supervisors to provide a professional assessment of such land to
determine whether evidence exists of environmental
contamination. If such contamination is found, the applicant shall
ameliorate the contamination in a manner as to make the land
suitable for its intended use.
F. Site analysis. The provisions of § 170-1617, Conservation design, shall
be applicable to an adult community development. The applicant shall
demonstrate compliance with the conservation design process at the
conditional use hearing. [Amended 5-2-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-4]

2003-2]
Farm-related business meeting the requirements of this § 170-1616 shall be
an accessory use allowed by special exception on a lot or contiguous lot(s)
of at least 10 acres. The lot must include an existing principal agricultural
use. The following regulations shall apply to such nonagricultural activities:
A. A farm-related business shall be defined as a low-intensity commercial
or industrial activity that functions as a customary accessory use to an
on-site principal agricultural activity. Farm-related businesses are
intended to provide supplemental income to farmers to encourage the
continuation of farming, and to provide needed services to other
farmers.
B. A farm-related business shall be conducted by a resident or owner of
the property, his/her immediate relatives, and a maximum total of three
other on-site employees, in addition to employees of the agricultural
operations. In addition, a barn that was constructed for agricultural
purposes prior to the adoption of this chapter may be leased to a
nonresident for a use meeting these standards.
C. To the maximum extent feasible, a farm-related business should use an
existing building. Buildings that existed prior to the effective date of
this section may be used for a farm-related business. Any new building
constructed for a farm-related business and any new parking area for
trucks shall be set back a minimum of 100 feet from any lot line of an
existing dwelling, unless a larger setback is required by another section
of this chapter. A farm-related business shall not occupy more than
4,000 square feet of building floor area that is constructed after the
adoption of this § 170-1616.
D. The farm-related business shall not routinely require the overnight
parking of more than one tractor-trailer truck.
E. The business shall not generate noxious odors, noise or glare beyond
amounts that are typically generated by agricultural operations.
Nonagricultural operations shall not routinely occur in a manner that
generates traffic or noise heard by neighbors between the hours of 9:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
F. Any retail sales shall only be occasional in nature, and shall occur by
appointment or during a maximum of 20 hours per week. This provision
shall not restrict permitted display and sale of farm products as allowed
by § 170-1603B.
G. Only one sign shall advertise a farm-related business, which shall have
a maximum sign area of 12 square feet on each of two sides, and which

A. As part of an application for a flexible development or for any
application for a development of three or more acres of nonresidential
development or for five or more residential lots, the applicant shall
submit the sketches described in this § 170-1617 and shall demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the following
process was followed in designing the proposed development.
B. This process is intended to show how the special features of the
property relate to resource areas on adjacent lands, and how the
development will properly relate to the features of the land that are
most worthy of conservation. The maps required by this § 170-1617 may
be completed at a sketch plan level of detail, which shall be drawn to
scale, provided that more detailed mapping required by other sections
of Township chapters is also submitted as required. This process is
intended to provide guidance in cases where this chapter allows
flexibility in the placement of buildings and lot lines.
C. Process.
(1) Existing resources and site analysis map. This map shall be
prepared and submitted to accurately show the locations of
wetlands, the one-hundred-year floodplains, slopes of 15% to 25%,
and slopes over 25% (in accordance with § 170-402 of this chapter).
These areas are known as "primary conservation areas." This map
shall accurately show the following:
(a) The wetlands shall be based upon a professional analysis, with
identification of the individual who completed such analysis in
accordance with § 170-401B of this chapter.
(b) The delineation of one-hundred-year floodplains based upon
official floodplain mapping or a more accurate professional
analysis in accordance with § 170-401C of this chapter.
(c) Other important existing resources on the site shall be added
to the map, including woodlands, tree lines, large specimen
trees over 18 inches in trunk diameter, scenic views from
inside the site, ridgelines, and scenic views from existing
§ 170-1616 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1617
1:740
streets and trails. These resources are known as "secondary
conservation areas." The Planning Commission may require
the identification of scenic views beyond those identified by the
applicant. This map, or an accompanying map, shall also show:
[1] Uses of properties that are contiguous or across a street.
[2] Approximate locations of natural features and principal
buildings on those properties that are within 150 feet of
the perimeter lot lines.
[3] Approximate location of areas with a seasonally high water
table, based upon the Soil Survey for Chester and
Delaware Counties or a more accurate professional
analysis.
[4] Locations and descriptions of existing buildings, with a
description of any historic architectural significance of
each, if any.
[5] Adjacent private or public open spaces, parklands and
pedestrian or bicycle trails.
(d) The applicant shall then highlight on a plan the areas that are
proposed to be conserved in some form of open space. Where
common open space is required, it shall be shown as such.
Where common open space is not required, the open space
may be proposed as privately owned areas that are intended to
remain unbuilt. The open space areas should be
interconnected.
(2) Potential development areas concept map. Based upon
consideration of the existing features map and the primary and
secondary conservation areas (as described above), the potential
development areas shall be mapped. These potential development
areas are areas that are best suited for the majority of the
development on the tract. Potential development areas shall not
include any primary conservation areas, except that minor
intrusion into primary conservation areas for land development
purposes may be permitted where otherwise permitted in
accordance with Article IV of this chapter or to provide for
regulated activities permitted by the Commonwealth, i.e.,
permitted stream or wetland crossing or other encroachment.
Potential development areas also shall be delineated so as to
minimize intrusion into secondary conservation areas. Land
development activities and associated land disturbance shall not be
permitted within more than 50% of secondary conservation areas,
except where this standard is modified at the discretion of the
Board of Supervisors as a condition of preliminary or final
subdivision/land development plan approval or conditional use
approval as applicable. In consideration of modification of this
standard, the Board shall consider the nature of the intended land
§ 170-1617 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1617
1:741
use and the anticipated scope of land disturbance normally
associated with such use, as well as any planning or design
measures proposed by the applicant to mitigate any environmental,
aesthetic, or other community impacts resulting from land
disturbance within secondary conservation areas.
(3) Location of building sites. In respect of the primary and secondary
conservation areas described above, the approximate proposed
locations of new homes/principal buildings and, in the case of
nonresidential development, associated parking areas and
accessory structures and uses shall then be selected within defined
potential development areas. It is recognized that on-lot septic
system suitability needs to influence these choices when septic
systems are used. It is also recognized that some intrusions into the
secondary conservation areas may be necessary to allow
reasonable uses of the land, provided that such development is
carefully located and designed to minimize impacts upon the most
important resources and features. Building sites and associated
facilities also should be selected so as to maximize views, including
views into the conservation areas.
(a) While the mapping of existing features required by this
§ 170-1617 is required to be accurate and to scale, the
locations of proposed building sites, associated facilities, lot
lines, roads and trails may be at a sketch plan level of detail for
the purposes of complying with this § 170-1617. A more
detailed site plan shall be required to be submitted as part of a
formal conditional use application or subdivision/land
development plan submission, as applicable.
(b) The applicant shall provide a written and graphic analysis of
how the proposed development will respect and incorporate
the important resources of the site and be coordinated with
resources, open space/trail corridors and views on surrounding
properties. This may involve an overlay map that shows
important natural features and proposed development.
(4) Layout of streets and trails. An efficient street layout shall then be
designed to serve the appropriate building sites. Trails should also
be considered to link together common open spaces, clusters of
homes and other destinations (such as nearby stores, parks and
schools). Building sites should be clustered together to minimize
expensive wetland and creek crossings by roads.
(5) Drawing the lot lines. Lot lines should then be drawn on the site to
encompass the proposed building sites, to result in a development
concept plan. Once this sketch is prepared, then more detailed
engineering may be completed.

state or federal agency including emissions of dust and
particulates.
(5) Setback requirements. All OWBs shall be located a minimum
distance of 150 feet from any property line or street right-of-way.
(6) Historic structures. If an OWB is proposed to be located within 100
feet of any historic structure as may be designated by the Township
or determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission or the National Park Service, such OWB shall be
subject to conditional use approval at the sole discretion of the
Township upon a finding that the proposed system will not
adversely impact the historical significance or landscape context of
the subject historic structure or historic resource.
(7) Stack. All OWBs shall have a permanent attached stack. The
minimum height of all stacks shall be 20 feet above the ground, and
stacks shall otherwise installed according to the manufacturer's
specifications.
(8) Abandonment or disrepair. If the OWB is ever abandoned or enters
into a state of disrepair, it shall be the responsibility of the property
owner to remove or properly maintain the OWB within six months
from the date the system enters such a state or immediately in any
case determined to be a safety hazard.
(9) Decommissioning. Any earth disturbance as a result of the removal
of the OWB shall be graded and reseeded.
C. Solar energy systems. Solar energy systems shall be permitted, subject
to the following regulations and with the understanding that when a
provision herein does not specifically refer to either accessory or
principal uses, it shall apply to both:
(1) Principal use. A solar energy system shall be permitted as a
principal use subject to conditional use approval in the T-Township
and A/C Agricultural/Cluster Residential Districts only, subject to
the following and as otherwise provided herein; any solar energy
system not meeting the criteria for an accessory solar energy
system shall be considered a principal use.
(a) The maximum area occupied by a principal solar energy
system on any lot shall be 10 acres;
§ 170-1618 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1618
1:745
(b) Notwithstanding lot coverage limitations set forth in the base
zoning district(s), the maximum impervious coverage for a
principal solar energy system and any accessory or
appurtenant structures shall be 20% of the lot area;
(c) A principal solar energy system shall be set back a minimum of
100 feet from any public right-of-way, any lot line, and any
historic structure as may be designated by the Township or
determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission or the National Park Service;
(d) The entire facility comprising a principal solar energy system
and its appurtenant and accessory structure(s) and equipment
shall be enclosed by a fence, barrier or other appropriate
means to prevent or restrict unauthorized persons or vehicles
from entering the facility. Clearly visible warning signs shall be
placed on the fence, barrier or at the perimeter of the facility to

equipment associated with the facility shall be completely
enclosed by a minimum eight-foot-high fence with a selflocking
gate.
(e) Proper aisleways between panel cluster sections, at least eight
feet in width, shall be provided for safe access to clusters. DC/
AC inverters shall be installed at each cluster, in addition to an
automatic disconnect device.
(f) A principal solar energy system shall not include the colocation
of batteries or other equipment used to store the
energy output from the system except where approved by the
Board of Supervisors as a condition of conditional use approval
upon satisfaction that adequate safety precautions are
included in the design of the system.
(g) A principal solar energy system shall be serviced by an
adequate water supply for firefighting purposes.
(2) Accessory use. A solar energy system shall be permitted in all
zoning districts as a permitted accessory use, subject to the
provisions set forth herein. A system shall be considered an
accessory solar energy system only if it supplies electrical or
thermal power primarily for the use of principal and other
accessory uses permitted on the subject property, or properties in
the case of community or virtual net metering as provided below.
(a) Individual net metering. When a property upon which an
accessory solar energy system is installed also receives
electrical power supplied by a utility company, excess
electrical power generated and not presently needed for onsite
use may be used by the utility company, as long as the
electrical power generated is used primarily for on-site use.
§ 170-1618 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1618
1:746
The owner of the accessory solar energy system shall provide
written confirmation that the public utility company has been
informed of the customer's intent to install an interconnected
customer-owned generator and also approves of such
connection. Systems not connected to the public utility grid
shall be exempt from this requirement.
(b) Community net metering. Community net metering is similar
to individual net metering, but permits the net metering
credits from an accessory solar energy system to be distributed
among two or more electric meters, for example, where several
homeowners cooperatively install a solar energy system. Such
systems shall be permitted subject to conditional use approval,
where all standards set forth herein are met.
(c) Virtual net metering. Virtual net metering may be permitted
subject to conditional use approval where an accessory solar
energy system is installed in a different location from the meter
or meters being credited with the solar energy that is
produced, subject to conformance with all standards set forth
herein. Instead of a direct connection to the accessory solar
energy system, the consumer of electricity is credited with the
amount of electricity that the system offsets through
connection into the grid at its location. Virtual net metering
may apply to individual or community solar energy system(s).
(3) Permitting. In addition to conditional use approval where required,
a zoning permit and building permit, consistent with or
independent of the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code, shall
be required prior to installation of any solar energy system.
Applicable manufacturer specifications shall be submitted to
Westtown Township as part of the application for any permit.
(4) Design. The design and installation of the solar energy system shall
conform to applicable industry standards, such as those of the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), Underwriters
Laboratories, the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM), or other similar certifying organizations, and shall comply
with the Township Building Code101 and with all other applicable
fire and life safety requirements.
(5) Grid interconnection. A solar energy system connected to the utility
grid shall provide written authorization from the local utility
company acknowledging and approving such connection.
(6) Transmission lines. All power transmission lines from the solar
energy system to any building or other structure shall be located
underground, unless it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of
101. Editor's Note: See Ch. 57, Building Construction.
§ 170-1618 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1618
1:747
the Zoning Officer, in consultation with the Township Engineer, that
this is infeasible.
(7) Appurtenances. All or any mechanical equipment (appurtenances)
associated with and necessary for the operation of the solar energy
system shall comply with all accessory setbacks for the zoning
district in which the system is installed.
(8) Hazardous materials. No solar energy system shall contain
hazardous substances as defined in the Pennsylvania Hazardous
Sites Cleanup Act, 35 P.S. § 6020.101 et seq.
(9) Lighting. Solar energy systems shall not be artificially lighted
except to the extent required for safety or by any applicable
federal, state or local authority.
(10)No advertising. Solar energy systems and appurtenant or
accessory structures shall not display any advertising, except for
reasonable identification of the panel or other equipment
manufacturer, and the facility owner.
(11) Vehicular access. All solar energy systems shall be located where
there is a means of vehicular access from a public or private street.
(12) Glare.
(a) Solar collectors shall be installed so as to prevent glare or
concentrated solar radiation as may otherwise be directed onto
other properties or onto roadways such that a nuisance
situation is created. Antireflective surface materials or
coatings shall be used to preclude glare to the extent feasible.
(b) The applicant or the installer or manufacturer of the solar
energy system shall submit with the application for permit or
conditional use approval, as applicable, a signed statement
including the following:
[1] Certification that the proposed system shall not produce
glare or reflect concentrated solar radiation visible beyond
the property lines of the property upon which the solar
energy system shall be located such that a nuisance
situation is created;
[2] Acknowledgement that, should any glare or concentrated
solar radiation produced prove to be visible beyond the
property lines of the property upon which the solar energy
system shall be located, at any time subsequent to the
installation of the system, such that, in the opinion of the
Zoning Officer, a nuisance situation or safety hazard arises
for another property owner or the travelling public, the
Township may at its discretion require mitigative action or
§ 170-1618 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1618
1:748
may require the removal of the system or portion thereof
generating the glare or reflected solar radiation;
[3] Acknowledgement that, should any mitigation or system
removal deemed necessary by the Township fail to be dealt
with in accordance with the Township's determination
within six months of notification of the landowner and/or
system owner, or immediately in any case determined to
be a safety hazard, the Township may implement such
mitigation or remove such systems as it deems necessary,
costs therefor to be reimbursed within 90 days, and, if not,
a commensurate lien shall be placed upon the property;
[4] Acknowledgement that the obligations set forth herein
shall continue so long as the subject solar energy system
remains in operation and that any subsequent property
owner shall be so notified.
(13) Historic structures. If an accessory solar energy system is
proposed to be mounted on or located within 100 feet of any
historic structure as may be designated by the Township or
determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission or the National Park Service, such system shall be
subject to conditional use approval at the sole discretion of the
Township as provided herein and upon a finding that the proposed
system will not adversely impact the historical significance or
landscape context of the subject historic structure.
(14) Solar access easements. A solar energy system shall be located to
ensure solar access without reliance on adjacent properties. Where
any applicant desires to ensure that solar access to a solar energy
system shall not be obstructed over time by permissible uses or
activities on any adjacent property (i.e., by planting or growth of
vegetation, new construction, etc.), it shall be the responsibility of
the owner of the solar energy system to obtain appropriate solar
access easement(s) from neighboring property owner(s) and to
notify the Township upon the recording of any such easement(s).
All solar access easements shall be recorded in the office of the
Chester County Recorder of Deeds.
(15) Roof-mounted systems.
(a) Under no circumstance shall the solar energy system extend
beyond the edge of the roof.
(b) Notwithstanding otherwise applicable height limitations, a
roof-mounted solar energy system may exceed the height of the
ridgeline of any sloping roof upon which it is mounted by no
more than one foot, where the pitch of the roof exceeds a ratio
of 1/3.
§ 170-1618 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1618
1:749
(c) Notwithstanding otherwise applicable height limitations, a
roof-mounted solar energy system on a flat roof, or where the
pitch of the roof is less than a ratio of 1/3, may exceed the
height of the roof at its highest point by no more than four feet,
except where a greater height is approved subject to
conditional use approval.
(d) Roof-mounted solar energy systems shall not be counted as
adding to any impervious coverage calculation.
(e) All roof-mounted systems must have/accommodate safe access
for fire service and maintenance, as deemed appropriate by the
Zoning Officer, Building Code Officer and/or Fire Marshal.
(f) Structural integrity. For any roof-mounted solar energy system,
the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Building Code Officer, by credible evidence, that the structural
integrity of the structure is such that it can adequately support
the roof-mounted system being considered.
(16) Ground-mounted (freestanding) systems.
(a) Principal ground-mounted solar energy systems shall meet the
setback requirements, size, and impervious coverage
limitations set forth in § 170-1618C(1) above.
(b) Accessory ground-mounted solar energy systems shall meet all
setback requirements for an accessory structure for the zoning
district in which installed, and shall be subject to the maximum
impervious coverage limitations of the underlying zoning
district.
(c) Accessory ground-mounted solar energy systems shall not be
installed within the required front yard setback, shall not be
located in the area between the front yard setback and the
principal structure on the lot, nor shall be located along any
street frontage (e.g., in a side yard abutting a street) except
where permitted subject to conditional use approval.
(d) Impervious coverage. For the purposes of this section, all "at
grade" or "above grade" features and facilities relating to
ground-mounted solar energy systems, including
appurtenances, shall be considered impervious surface. The
extent of impervious coverage of sloping panels shall be
measured as equal to their horizontal footprint.
(17) Conditional use approval. In consideration of conditional use
approval where required pursuant to this section, in addition to
review of the standards for conditional use approval set forth in
§ 170-2009D of this chapter, the Board of Supervisors shall be
satisfied that the solar installation will not unduly impact other
property owners or the traveling public or that potential impacts
§ 170-1618 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1618
1:750
are mitigated by design of the system or structure(s) upon which
it is mounted, by distance from points of visibility, by the presence
of intervening topography, vegetation or structures, or will be
mitigated through introduction of landscaping.
(a) Any application for conditional use approval for a principal
solar energy system shall include submission of a visual
analysis demonstrating that the system is designed and located
to meet the objectives stated above.
(b) As a condition of approval, the Board of Supervisors may
require a buffer yard around the perimeter of any facility
comprising a principal solar energy system and its appurtenant
or accessory structure(s) and equipment providing a
continuous visual screen between such facility and any
adjacent property, public right-of-way or historic structure as
viewed by a person standing at ground level.
(18) Abandonment or disrepair. If the solar energy system is ever
abandoned or enters into a state of disrepair, it shall be the
responsibility of the property owner to remove or properly maintain
the solar energy system within six months from the date the system
enters such a state or immediately in any case determined to be a
safety hazard.
(19) Decommissioning. If a ground-mounted solar energy system is ever
removed, any earth disturbance as a result of the removal of the
ground-mounted solar energy system shall be graded and reseeded
to the satisfaction of the Township.
D. Wind energy systems. Wind energy systems shall be permitted in all
zoning districts, subject to the following regulations and with the
understanding that when a provision herein does not specifically refer
to either accessory or principal uses, it shall apply to both:
(1) Principal use. A wind energy system shall be permitted as a
principal use subject to conditional use approval in the T Township
and A/C Agricultural/Cluster Residential Districts only, subject to
the following and as otherwise provided herein; any wind energy
system not meeting the criteria for an accessory wind energy
system shall be considered a principal use.
(a) The maximum area occupied by a principal wind energy system
on any lot shall be 20 acres;
(b) Notwithstanding lot coverage limitations set forth in the base
zoning district(s), the maximum impervious coverage for a
principal wind energy system and any accessory or
appurtenant structures shall be 5% of the lot area;
(c) No principal wind energy system shall be installed at any
location that would substantially detract from or block the view

systems shall be set back a horizontal distance equal to their
height from any property line or residential dwelling, excluding
any dwelling on the lot on which the wind energy system is
located. No accessory wind energy systems shall be installed
within the required front yard setback and shall not be located
along any street frontage (e.g., in a side yard abutting a street).
Additionally, all accessory wind energy systems must be set
back sufficiently from any aboveground utility lines, radio,
television, or telecommunication towers so as to present no
danger to those lines or structures, as certified by the
applicant's engineer. No portion of any accessory wind energy
system shall extend over parking areas, access drives,
driveways or sidewalks.
(e) The footprint of an accessory wind energy system shall be
calculated as part of the overall lot coverage.
(f) For any roof-mounted wind energy systems, such as microturbine

line of the closest neighboring inhabited or occupied structure or
nearest habitable or occupied structure setback line on any
102. Editor's Note: See Ch. 57, Building Construction.
§ 170-1618 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-1618
1:756
abutting property. The ambient sound measurement, known as "Aweighted
sound level," is taken where the noise from the wind
turbine cannot be heard, or with the wind turbine shut down. The
ambient sound level shall be considered the level that is exceeded
90% of the time when the noise measurements are taken. Any
noise exceeding this level may be subject to the nuisance provisions
of Article II of Chapter 168 of the Westtown Township Code.
Notwithstanding the above, the 55 decibel or 10 decibel over
ambient level may be exceeded during short-term events such as
utility outages and/or severe wind storms.

A. Statement of intent. The intent of this section is to provide an
alternative use for a structurally sound, approved, and permitted ADU
whose occupancy was permitted only to related or relative persons as
defined under § 170-201. This section is also intended to increase the
supply of smaller dwelling units and provide for a more efficient use of
the existing housing stock, while protecting the character of sound,
stable residential neighborhoods and preserving the basic character of
dwellings that might otherwise become obsolete.
B. Standards for conversion to residential rental use. An approved,
permitted ADU, either existing on the effective date of this chapter or
approved and permitted thereafter, may be converted into and used as
a dwelling unit for rent, when approved as a special exception by the
Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the terms of Article XXI of
this chapter and with the following stipulations:
(1) The ADU may be located in the principal dwelling or in a structure
which is accessory to the principal dwelling and is located on the
same single-family residential lot.
(2) A detached ADU shall meet setbacks for an accessory structure for
the zoning district in which it is located.
(3) The minimum size of the ADU shall be 500 square feet, the
maximum size shall be no greater than 50% of the footprint of the
principal dwelling.
(4) The height of the ADU shall not exceed the height of the principal
dwelling.
(5) There shall not be more than one accessory dwelling unit created
on any single-family residential lot.
(6) One of the two dwelling units (either the principal or the accessory)
shall be occupied by the owner of the property, or a family member
of the owner of the lot on which both dwelling units are located.

principal dwelling. The additional parking space(s) shall not be
located within any required setback area.
(8) Utility billing for the property shall remain under the name of the
property owner.
(9) No other alterations to the exterior of the structure shall be
permitted unless necessary for health or safety reasons.
(10) Except where public sewer is available, the applicant shall submit
to the Township a permit for an on-site sewage disposal system
issued by the Chester County Health Department, certifying that
the sewage disposal facilities are adequate for the projected
number of residents. Where the existing on-site system is found to
be inadequate, by the Department, to serve the projected demand,
no approval shall be given for the accessory dwelling unit until the
system is improved to meet Health Department requirements and a
permit is issued by the Department.
(11) To ensure compliance with this chapter, a site plan shall be
submitted, accurately drawn to scale, indicating the location and
size of the existing and proposed dwelling units, parking areas and
any proposed exterior alterations.

ARTICLE XIX
Nonconformities
§ 170-1900. Statement of intent.
§ 170-1901. Nonconforming uses or structures.
A. The zoning districts established by this chapter are designed to guide
future use of land in Westtown Township by encouraging the
development of desirable residential and commercial areas, with
appropriate groupings of compatible and related uses.
B. To achieve that end, the following regulations shall apply to existing
uses, structures, lots, and signs which do not conform to the provisions
of this chapter or to the provisions of any subsequent amendment
hereto. It is the policy of Westtown Township to seek the elimination of
such nonconformities to the maximum extent practical, while avoiding
undue burdens on property owners and assuring equitable treatment.
Nonconforming uses and structures, however, generally will be
permitted to remain; the purpose of regulating them is to restrict
further investment in uses or structures which are inappropriate to
their location.
C. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to
require a change in plans, construction, or intended use of any building
on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date, or amendment, of this chapter and on which actual building
construction has been diligently carried on.
A. Continuation. The lawful use of a structure or land existing on the
effective date of this chapter or subsequent amendment, or authorized
by a building permit issued prior thereto and not expired, may be
continued, although such use does not conform with the provisions of
this chapter.
B. Expansion. [Amended 5-2-2005 by Ord. No. 2005-4]
(1) A lot which is nonconforming in regard to building coverage or
impervious coverage shall not be permitted any expansion of such
coverage beyond the existing nonconformity, as applicable.
(2) A nonconforming use of any existing structure may be expanded
throughout such structure up to a maximum expansion equal to
25% of the floor area dedicated to the nonconforming use at the
time it became nonconforming and if no structural alterations are
made therein; provided that such expansion may include structural
alterations when authorized as a special exception by the Zoning
Hearing Board.
(3) A conforming structure housing a nonconforming use may be
expanded upon the lot which it occupied at the effective date of this
chapter, for purposes of the nonconforming use, up to a maximum
§ 170-1900 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1901
1:819
expansion equal to 25% of the building area of the subject structure
as it existed upon the effective date of this chapter, when
authorized as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board.
The Zoning Hearing Board may impose specific requirements on
the expansion of such a building so that the extended building
will continue to conform in all respects to the standards applicable
within the district in which it is located. The applicant shall have
the burden of proof that his application falls within the provisions
of this article and that the granting of his application will not
be contrary to the public interest. It shall also be the applicant's
burden to produce evidence in support of his application which will
assist the Zoning Hearing Board in applying the criteria set forth in
§ 170-2108 of this chapter.
(4) Where expansion of a nonconforming structure for purposes of a
conforming use may be accomplished such that the expanded
portion(s) of the structure are fully conforming to the standards
applicable within the district in which it is located, such expansion
shall be permitted by right.
(5) A nonconforming structure, regardless of use, may be expanded
upon the lot which it occupied at the effective date of this chapter,
when authorized as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board and in accordance with the following:
(a) The Zoning Hearing Board may impose specific requirements
on the expansion of such a structure so that the extended
structure will not increase the degree of nonconformity
relative to the standards applicable within the district in which
it is located.
(b) The portion of the building area (footprint) of any such
structure which is nonconforming relative to yard setback
requirements shall not be increased by more than 25%, except
where such increase in building area shall conform with
applicable standards.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, any portion of any structure which
is nonconforming relative to applicable height limitations shall
not be expanded more than 25% at the same height as existed
at the time the structure became nonconforming. In no case
shall expansion of a nonconforming structure be permitted to
increase any nonconformity relative to height.
(d) The applicant shall have the burden of proof that his
application falls within the provisions of this article and that
the granting of his application will not be contrary to the public
interest. It shall also be the applicant's burden to produce
evidence in support of his application which will assist the
Zoning Hearing Board in applying the criteria set forth in
§ 170-2108 of this chapter.

C. Change of use.
(1) Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure or land has been
changed to a conforming use, such conforming use shall not
thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
(2) Any nonconforming use of a structure or land may be changed to a
use that conforms with this chapter, provided that, where required,
a use and occupancy permit is obtained for such change.
(3) A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use only when the proposed change is a use characterized by the
same or lesser impacts on adjoining properties and the zoning
district in which it is proposed, and only when authorized as a
special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board. In making its
determination, the Board shall employ, among others, the following
criteria:
(a) The applicant shall show that the nonconforming use cannot
reasonably be changed to a use permitted in the district where
it is located.
(b) Proposed structural alterations, if any, shall be deemed the
minimum necessary to facilitate the proposed use, and
generally should not create nor increase any structural or
dimensional nonconformity.
(c) The applicant shall have the burden of showing that the
proposed use will have the same or lesser impact than the
existing nonconforming use with respect to:
[1] On-street parking, traffic generation, and congestion;
[2] Noise, smoke, dust, noxious matter, heat, glare, vibration,
and other nuisance characteristics relative to the
particular use;
[3] Storage and waste disposal;
[4] External appearance;
[5] Fire hazards;
[6] Hours of operation;
[7] Volume of sewage generated;
[8] Demand for water supply; and
[9] Amount of stormwater runoff to be controlled.
D. Restoration. Any lawful nonconforming structure which has been
involuntarily damaged by fire, explosion, flood, windstorm, or similar
cause to an extent of not more than 50% of its fair market value, or
§ 170-1901 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-1901
1:821
§ 170-1902. Nonconforming lots of record.
§ 170-1903. Nonconforming signs.
which has been legally condemned, may be restored within the limits of
the existing foundation, and within its original dimensions. Restoration
shall commence within one year from the date of damage, destruction,
or condemnation, and shall be carried on consistently, without major
interruption, on a time schedule agreed to by the Zoning Officer at
the time of building permit issuance. Where the extent of damage
or destruction exceeds 50% of the fair market value, any restoration,
reconstruction, or new construction shall comply fully with the terms of
this chapter.
E. Discontinuance. If an owner of a building or land which is occupied by a
nonconforming use desires to discontinue such use for an extended
period of time, but intends to resume such use at a later date, he/she
may apply to the Board of Supervisors, in writing, for a certificate of
continuance, stating the reasons for and duration of the discontinuance
and the date upon which such use will be resumed.
F. Abandonment. If a nonconforming use of land or a building ceases or is
discontinued for a continuous period of six months or more and no
certificate has been granted, as stipulated in Subsection E above, such
use shall be considered to have been abandoned and any subsequent
use of such building or land shall conform to the provisions of this
chapter. Similarly, if a certificate and renewal are granted but the
nonconforming use is not resumed within the stipulated time period,
such use shall be considered to have been abandoned and any
subsequent use of such building or land shall conform to the provisions
of this chapter.
A. A lot held, in single and separate ownership, which does not meet the
minimum area or dimensional requirements of the applicable zoning
district, may be used and a structure may be built thereon, provided
that the required minimum yard areas can be complied with.
[Amended 12-5-1994 by Ord. No. 94-6]
B. Where a lot cannot meet all minimum yard requirements, or where
alterations or enlargements would result in further noncompliance with

the applicant as to the prescribed method of appeal or further
application for approval.
B. Upon the granting of a building permit, the Building Inspector shall
issue to the applicant a placard, confirming the granting of such permit,

public for a period of 30 days. Failure to so display said placard shall
result in revocation of the building permit.
A. Statement of intent. This chapter provides for certain uses to be
permitted within the Township as conditional uses. In so providing, the
Board of Supervisors recognizes that these uses may or may not be
appropriate at every location within any specific district and,
accordingly, has established standards and criteria by which it can
evaluate and decide upon applications for such uses. It is intended that
these uses, constituting major uses having the potential for substantial
impact upon the community, shall comply with the standards for
conditional uses hereinafter set forth, in addition to the relevant
stipulations of the district in which the conditional use is authorized. In
the sole discretion of the Board of Supervisors, failure to comply with
these standards may be deemed a basis for the imposition of
appropriate conditions to a grant of approval. Where there is a conflict
between the standards set forth in this section and other standards
elsewhere established by this or other applicable chapters, it is
intended that the more stringent standards shall apply, and it is not the
intent of this section to abrogate or impair any other such standards or
requirements. Where any use or any applicable design criteria subject
to conditional use approval also is a part of an overall land development
plan subject to application for approval of a special exception, such use
or design criteria may be considered for approval by the Zoning
Hearing Board as part of the applicable special exception application in
lieu of separate submission of an application for conditional use
approval. Similarly, where any use or any applicable design criteria
subject to special exception approval also is a part of an overall land
development plan subject to application for conditional use approval,
such use or design criteria may be considered for approval by the Board
of Supervisors as part of the applicable conditional use application in
lieu of separate submission of an application for approval of a special
exception.
B. Submission and content of conditional use applications.
(1) It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate compliance
with the standards for conditional use contained in this section and
with any other relevant stipulations of this chapter, and to indicate
means by which potential impacts from the proposed use will be
mitigated.

analysis, conservation design process (if applicable) and
density requirements.
(4) The scale of the site plan shall be one inch equals 50 feet. If the site
plan is on more than one sheet, then the overall layout shall also be
submitted on a single sheet. If only a portion of a tract is proposed
for development, the submittal shall show how this portion will be
fully coordinated with the development of future portions of the
tract.
(5) Where specific conditional use submission requirements are
contained within another article of this chapter and are applicable
to a particular conditional use authorized by that article, those
requirements shall be adhered to and shall prevail in any instance
of conflict or overlap.
(6) In addition to demonstrating compliance with all standards
applicable to the conditional use being requested, the site plan
shall show the applicant's intentions with regard to the following:
(a) Site access, interior circulation, and parking.
(b) Location, approximate dimension, and arrangement of all
areas devoted to ground cover, trees, screen planting, open
space, recreation, and similar purposes, as applicable.

Building Council. [Added 9-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-1]
(7) Site analysis and the conservation design process.
C. Application review procedures.
(1) The application shall be reviewed by the Zoning Officer. If it is
deficient with regard to any required components, procedures, or
fees, the Zoning Officer shall so notify the applicant. This review
and notification shall occur prior to the scheduling of a public
hearing on the application. If such identified deficiencies are not
remedied in the form of a resubmitted application, such
deficiencies shall constitute grounds for denial of the application by
the Board of Supervisors subsequent to public hearing.
(2) The Board of Supervisors shall schedule and hold a public hearing
on the application pursuant to public notice within 60 days of filing
unless the applicant, in writing, waives or extends the time
limitation.

application shall be furnished to the Township Planning
Commission, together with a request that it submit

requesting the original transcript or a copy of the transcript shall
bear the cost of same.
(5) The plan presented at the public hearing shall be essentially the
same as that reviewed by the Planning Commission. Changes
deemed by the Planning Commission to be substantial may result in
rescheduling the public hearing where the Planning Commission
finds that such changes necessitate a greater period of time for
review and comment.
§ 170-2009 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-2009
1:831
(6) Upon review of the application in terms of the standards and
criteria of this chapter, the Board of Supervisors shall render a
decision within 45 days of completion of the public hearing process.
(7) In approving a conditional use application, where such use is
authorized under this chapter, the Board of Supervisors may, at its
sole discretion, attach such conditions to its approval as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. Such conditions
may include, but need not be limited to:
(a) Specific modifications to area and bulk requirements as might
otherwise be applicable;
(b) Provisions for additional utility or traffic safety facilities;
(c) Securing of additional easements or property to assure proper
site design; or
(d) Modification to the applicable design standards.
(8) If the Board of Supervisors approves the application and
accompanying generalized site plan, such approved plan shall
accompany any application for subdivision or land development as
prescribed by Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land Development, in
addition to the detailed working drawings normally required, and
any application for a building permit. The issuance or rejection of a
building permit shall take place in the regularly prescribed manner
herein pertaining to building permits, but shall be preceded by
compliance with Chapter 149, Subdivision and Land Development.
(9) Any grant of conditional use approval shall be deemed null and void
six months from the date of such approval if, within that period, no
application is made for a building permit, a use and occupancy
permit, or subdivision or land development approval, as
appropriate, unless the Board of Supervisors shall grant an
extension.
D. Standards for conditional use approval. [Amended 5-3-1999 by Ord.
No. 99-2]
(1) In reviewing and acting upon an application for conditional use, the
Board of Supervisors shall evaluate the degree of compliance with
the following standards:
(a) The uses proposed shall be limited to those authorized as
conditional uses within the district in which the lot or parcel is
situated.
(b) The proposal shall be consistent with the Township
Comprehensive Plan and with the purpose of this chapter to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.
§ 170-2009 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-2009
1:832
§ 170-2010. Limited Township and Municipal Authority Exemption.

(c) The appropriate use, and the value, of adjacent property will
be safeguarded.

any stage.
(f) The demand created by the proposed use upon public services
and facilities such as water supply, sewage disposal, police and
fire protection, emergency services, open space and recreation
facilities, and the public school system has been considered
and, where necessary, adequate arrangements for expansion
or improvement are assured.
(g) The design and use of any new construction and the proposed
change of design (if any) and proposed change in use of
existing buildings will be compatible with the existing designs
and uses in the immediate vicinity and that the proposed
design or use shall be compatible with the character of the
neighborhood.
(h) The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to prove to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, by credible evidence,
that the use will not result in or substantially add to a
significant traffic hazard or significant traffic congestion. The
peak traffic generated by the development shall be
accommodated in a safe and efficient manner. Such analysis
shall consider any improvements to streets that the applicant is
committed to complete or fund. [Added 5-3-1999 by Ord. No.
99-2]

by Westtown Township or by a municipal authority created solely by
Westtown Township for uses and structures that are intended for a
public utility, stormwater or public health and safety purpose.

officer, and there has been no stipulation that his decision or findings
are final, the Board shall make his report and recommendations
available to the parties within 45 days, and the parties shall be entitled
§ 170-2103 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-2103
1:837
§ 170-2104. Appeals from the Zoning Officer.
The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant
that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed procedures or has
misinterpreted or misapplied any provisions of a valid ordinance or map
or any valid rule or regulation governing the action of the Zoning Officer,
as stipulated under the terms of Section 909.1(a) of the Municipalities
Planning Code [53 P.S. 10909.1(a)].
§ 170-2105. Challenge to validity of Zoning Ordinance or Map.
The Board shall hear any substantive challenge to the validity of this
chapter or the Zoning Map, except a challenge brought before the Board
of Supervisors under the terms of Section 609.1 or 916.1(a)(2) of the
Municipalities Planning Code [53 P.S. § 10609.1 or 10916.1(a)(2)]. The
Board also shall hear any challenge to the validity of this chapter raising
procedural questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or
adoption, where such challenge is raised by an appeal taken within 30 days
after the effective date of the ordinance. In all such challenges, the Board
shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided in § 170-2102. At
the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions
of interpretation and shall make findings on all relevant issues of fact, which
shall become part of the record on appeal to court.
§ 170-2106. Challenge to flexible development procedures.
Challenges to the validity of the flexible development provisions of Article
IX of this chapter, and appeals from any action of the Zoning Officer
thereunder, shall be governed by § 170-2104 of this article. When the Board
of Supervisors, however, has held a hearing upon an application for
development under Article IX of this chapter, such hearing shall be deemed
to make written representations thereon to the Board prior to final
decision or entry of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered
no later than 30 days after the report of the hearing officer. Where
the Board, or the hearing officer with power to render a decision, fails
to render a decision within the period required by this subsection,
the decision shall be deemed to have been rendered in favor of the
applicant unless the applicant has agreed in writing or on the record to
an extension of time.
J. A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to him/
her by certified mail not later than the day following its date. To all
other persons who have filed their name and address with the Board no
later than the last day of the hearing, the Board shall provide, by mail or
otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a statement of the
place at which the full decision or findings may be examined. Copies of
the decision or findings, provided that the applicant shall also be filed
with the Township Secretary, Planning Commission, and Zoning Officer.
§ 170-2103 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-2106
1:838
in lieu of a hearing by the Board provided for under § 170-2104, and appeal
from any decision or determination of the Board of Supervisors (including a
challenge to the validity of any provision of such ordinance) shall lie directly
to the court.
§ 170-2107. Variances.
A. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of this chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the
applicant. The Board may, by rule, prescribe the form of application.
The procedure shall be as follows:
(1) A preliminary written application shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer, who shall verify that the application is complete, and that
the application is properly filed for a variance and not for a change
to the Zoning Ordinance or Map concerning a use or district. If the
latter is the case, the applicant shall be advised of the proper
procedures, as stipulated by this chapter.
(2) Upon acceptance by the Zoning Officer that the application is
complete, correct, and proper, a formal filing for consideration of
the variance request shall be made by the Zoning Officer to the
Zoning Hearing Board, together with the comments and
recommendations of the Zoning Officer. Copies of the filing and
comments shall be submitted to the Township Planning
Commission and Board of Supervisors.
(3) A public hearing shall be properly advertised in accordance with
the requirements established in § 170-2103 of this chapter.
(4) At least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the Planning
Commission shall submit its written comments and
recommendations on the application to the Zoning Hearing Board,
or a written statement that it chooses to make no comments and
recommendations. The Zoning Hearing Board shall not make a
decision on the application until receipt of the Planning
Commission's comments or its statement of no comment. When
submitted, the comments of the Planning Commission shall be
considered by the Board, but shall not be binding.
(5) Upon completion of the public hearing, the Board may grant a
variance, provided that the procedures specified above are met and
the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
§ 170-2106 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-2107
1:839
§ 170-2108. Special exceptions. [Amended 3-3-2003 by Ord. No.
2003-2]
Where this chapter has stated special exceptions to be granted or denied
by the Board pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board shall
hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance with
such standards and criteria. In granting a special exception, the Board
may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in the chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter. The procedures for acting on a special exception
request shall be the same as those specified for variances under § 170-2107,
except that the findings contained in Subsections A(5)(a) through (e) of
§ 170-2107 shall not be applicable. Where any use or any applicable design
criteria subject to conditional use approval also is a part of an overall land
development plan subject to application for approval of a special exception,
such use or design criteria may be considered for approval by the Zoning
Hearing Board as part of the applicable special exception application in
lieu of separate submission of an application for conditional use approval.
Similarly, where any use or any applicable design criteria subject to special
exception approval also is a part of an overall land development plan subject
to application for conditional use approval, such use or design criteria may
be considered for approval by the Board of Supervisors as part of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located;
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the area and bulk regulations or design
standards of the Zoning Ordinance, and that the authorization
of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable
use of the property, but shall not allow a change in use to one
not permitted by right in that district;
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant;
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, not substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, and not
be detrimental to the public welfare; and
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this chapter. The Board shall require that all other
applicable land development regulations apply.
§ 170-2107 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-2108
1:840
applicable conditional use application in lieu of separate submission of an
application for approval of a special exception.
A. Application shall be made in writing, indicating the section of this
chapter under which an exception is sought. The application shall
include a reasonably exact, dimensional sketch showing the placement
and use of the proposed buildings and details of parking, loading,
lighting, utility systems, sidewalks, and other pedestrian areas,
including those within 250 feet of adjoining properties or structures.
B. Further, a description of the uses proposed shall be included in
sufficient detail so that potentially detrimental impacts, if any, can be
determined.
C. The Board shall hear and decide all requests for special exceptions, as
identified within this chapter, in accordance with the following
standards and criteria:
(1) Relationship to the Comprehensive Plan. Consideration of the size,
scope, extent, and character of the proposed special exception and
assurance that such proposal is consistent with the purposes and
objectives of the Westtown Township Comprehensive Plan,
including protection and promotion of the public health, safety, and
welfare.
(2) Suitability of the tract. Consideration of the suitability of the
proposed tract including, as applicable, environmental conditions,
highway access, and availability of sewer and water service, and of
the extent to which the proposed use is susceptible to regulatory
restriction through the imposition of appropriate conditions.
(3) Impact on existing neighborhood character. Consideration of the
extent to which the proposed special exception will alter unduly the
character of the existing neighborhood and adjacent tracts, and the
effectiveness of proposed or potential mitigation measures;
consideration of the character and type of development in the area
surrounding the location of the proposed special exception, and a
determination that the proposal, if approved, will constitute an
appropriate use in the area.
(4) Impact on circulation. Consideration of the effects the proposed
special exception may have on traffic patterns and volumes, access,
and parking.
(5) Economic impact. Consideration of the character and type of
development proposed in terms of generating revenue for the
Township and imposing demands on municipal services.
D. Persons with disabilities. After the Zoning Officer receives a complete
written application, the Zoning Hearing Board shall grant a special
exception allowing modifications to specific requirements of this
chapter that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning
§ 170-2108 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 170-2108
1:841
§ 170-2109. Expiration of approval for special exception or
variance.
Any approval of a special exception or variance request shall be deemed null
and void six months from the date of such approval if, within that period,
no application is made for a building permit, a use and occupancy permit,
or subdivision or land development approval, as appropriate, unless the
Zoning Officer shall grant a six-month extension.
§ 170-2110. Parties appellant before the Board.
Appeals and proceedings under §§ 170-2104, 170-2105, and 170-2106 may
be filed with the Board in writing by any officer or agency of the Township,
or by any person aggrieved. Request for a variance under the terms of
§ 170-2107, or for a special exception under the terms of § 170-2108, may
be filed by any landowner or any tenant with the permission of such
landowner.
§ 170-2111. Time limitations.
Hearing Board are required under applicable federal law to provide a
reasonable accommodation to serve persons who the applicant proves
have disabilities as defined in and protected by such laws.
(1) Such reasonable accommodations shall be requested in accordance
with the U.S. Fair Housing Act Amendments and/or the Americans
with Disabilities Act, as amended.
(2) If the applicant is requesting a reasonable accommodation under
the United States Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 or the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the applicant shall identify the
disability which is protected by such statutes, the extent of the
modification of the provisions of this chapter necessary for a
reasonable accommodation, and the manner by which the
reasonable accommodation requested may be removed when such
person(s) with a protected disability no longer will be present on
the property.
(3) Any modification approved under this section may be limited to the
time period during which the persons with disabilities occupy or
utilize the premises.
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later
than 30 days after an application for development, preliminary or final,
has been approved by the appropriate Township officer, agency, or body,
if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the
approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he/
she had no notice, knowledge, or reason to believe that such approval
had been given. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such
approval, he/she shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in
interest.
§ 170-2108 WESTTOWN CODE § 170-2111
1:842
B. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an
adverse decision on a tentative plan pursuant to § 170-911 of this
chapter, or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a
challenge to the validity of the Zoning Ordinance or Map, pursuant to
Section 916.2 of the Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10916.2),
shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case where
the final submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative
submission.

expenses in excess of deposits. Any amount deposited in excess of
actual final expenses shall be refunded to the applicant.
B. Miscellaneous expenses. For each certified statement of compliance of
any property with the provisions of this chapter, there shall be a fee
paid in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by resolution of the

cultural significance and the people who worked, farmed, and lived
here.
B. Establishment and membership. There is hereby established a
Historical Commission to be known as the "Westtown Township
Historical Commission," which shall consist of seven members who
shall all be residents of the Township and who shall be appointed by the
Board of Supervisors. The membership of the Commission shall include
individuals who have an interest or expertise in history, archaeology or
historic preservation. Members shall serve without pay, but shall be
reimbursed for any personal expenditure in the conduct of Commission
business when pre-authorized by the Board of Supervisors. [Amended
1-5-2015 by Ord. No. 2015-2]
C. Membership terms. Each Commission member shall serve for a term of
three years which shall be so fixed that no more than two terms shall
expire each year. The Commission shall notify the Board of Supervisors

30 days to afford the Historical Commission the opportunity to
work with the property owner to document the property prior to
work commencing. If the property owner declines to allow for

deny the permit application. [Amended 3-7-2016 by Ord. No.
