APPENDIX A
Design Procedure.
1. The recharge bed will be a subsurface trench which is filled with
stone having a void ratio of at least thirty-five (35%) percent. The maximum
depth of this bed will be at least two (2') feet above the seasonal high
groundwater table. A suitable prefabricated infiltration device can be
substituted, if approved by the Township Engineer.
2. The volume of the bed will be based on the volume of water from one
(1") inch of rainfall on all roof surfaces for the proposed structures,
divided by the void ratio of the stone used. Figure 1 can be used to
estimate runoff volumes or it can be directly calculated using the surface
area of the projection of the roof areas in the y-plane times one (1") inch.
EQUATION 1: VOLUME OF BED = VOLUME OF RUNOFF / VOID RATIO
3. The bed must have at least one (1') foot of cover above the stone
and must have a separation distance of at least twenty-five (25') feet from
wells and on-lot septic systems. All roof surfaces must drain to a recharge
system. All roof surfaces must drain to a recharge system. Separation
distance of ten (10') feet from the foundation of the structure must be
maintained.

(15, §409(1), cont'd (15, §409(1), cont'd)
B. those residential streets are also subjected to a high degree
of commuter traffic which substantially reduces the quality of the
ambient air level; and
C. the establishment of a parking permit program for certain
affected areas should facilitate efficient movement of traffic by
providing for parking preference during certain hours of the day and
days of the week. Therefore, the Township of West Nottingham considers
it to be in the interest of the people of the Township of West
Nottingham to provide for the establishment of a residential permit
parking program to insure primary access to available parking spaces by
neighborhood residents and also to provide a cleaner ambient air level.
2. Definitions: For the purpose of this section, words and terms listed
in this subsection, as follows, shall have the following meanings:
COMMUTER VEHICLE - a motor vehicle parked in a residential area by
a person not a resident of that residential area;
PROPRIETOR - a person who owns or leases real estate within a
residential area of which he is not a resident, but who owns or manages
a business enterprise or professional office maintained at that address;
for the purpose of this Section, a proprietor shall be entitled to one
(1) parking permit for that business or professional office address;
RESIDENT - a person who owns or leases real property within a
residential area and who maintains either a voting residence, or bona
fide occupancy, or both, at that address;
RESIDENTIAL AREA - a contiguous area containing public highways or
parts of public highways primarily abutted by residential property or
residential and nonbusiness property (such as schools, parks, places of
worship, hospitals and nursing homes).
3. Criteria: The residential areas designated in subsection (4) of
this Section are those deemed impacted and hence eligible for residential
parking on the basis of the following criteria:
A. During any period between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 6:30 p.m.,
Monday through Saturday, except legal holidays, the number of vehicles
parked (or standing), legally or illegally, on the streets in the area
is equal to seventy percent (70%) or more of the legal, on-street
parking capacity of the area. For the purpose of this criterion, a
legal parking space shall be twenty (20) linear feet.
B. During the same period as specified in (A), directly above, ten
percent (10%) or more of the vehicles parked (or standing) on the
streets in the area are not registered in the name of a person residing
in the area. For the purpose of this criterion, the latest available
information from the bureau of Motor Vehicles and Licensing of the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regarding registration of
motor vehicles shall be used.

- 104 - Page Revised 4/1/2003
(15, §409(3), cont'd) (15, §409(3), cont'd)
impacted and eligible for residential permit parking is designated as
a residential permit parking area, the following factors are taken into
consideration:
(1) the local and metropolitan needs with respect to clean
air and environment;
(2) the possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles
driven in the Township of West Nottingham;
(3) the likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal
parking and related health and safety hazards;
(4) the proximity of public transportation to the residential
area;
(5) the desire and need of the residents for residential
permit parking and their willingness to bear the administrative
costs in connection with it; and
(6) the need for parking in excess of the residential permit
parking program in proximity to establishments located in the
residential permit parking area and used by the general public for
religious, health or educational purposes.
4. Designation of residential permit parking areas: The following are
designated as residential permit parking areas:
Area Bounded by and Including

Signs shall be erected along the streets in each residential permit parking
area, indicating the days, hours, locations and conditions under which
parking shall be by permit only.

the case may be; the make, model and registration number of the motor
vehicle; and the driver number as taken from the applicant's current driver's

6. Issuance of permit: Upon receipt of the application and the permit
fee, and determination by him that the information upon the application shows
that the applicant is entitled to a residential parking permit, the Chief of
Police shall issue to the applicant a residential parking permit, which shall
be valid for the remainder of the calendar year. The permit shall display
the serial and registration numbers of the motor vehicles, the residential
parking area number, and the expiration date. The permit shall be renewable

and valid permit while standing or parking in a residential permit parking
area at any time when those permits are to be displayed.
7. Temporary and exemption parking permits: Temporary parking permits
may be issued by the Chief of Police, upon payment of a fee established and

permitted in that area. While a vehicle for which a residential parking
permit has been issued is so parked, that permit shall be displayed so
as to be clearly visible through the windshield of the vehicle. A
residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder
a parking space within a designated residential permit parking area.
B. A residential parking permit shall not authorize its holder to
stand or park a motor vehicle in any place where or at any time when
stopping, standing or parking of motor vehicles is prohibited or set
aside for other specified types of vehicles, nor shall the permit exempt
its holder from the observance of any traffic or parking regulation
other than residential permit parking regulation or restriction.
C. No person other than the permit holder whose name appears on
the permit shall use a residential parking permit or display it on a
vehicle operated; any such use or display by a person other than the
permit holder shall constitute a violation of this Section by the permit
holder and by the person who so used or displayed the parking permit.
D. It shall constitute a violation of this section for any person
falsely to represent himself as eligible for a residential parking
permit or to furnish false information in an application to the Chief
of Police in order to obtain a residential parking permit.
(1) Revocation of permits: The Chief of Police shall have
authority to revoke the residential parking permit of any permit
holder found to be in violation of any provision of this Section.

(15, §409(8), cont'd) (15, §409(8), cont'd)

holder shall surrender the permit to the Chief of Police. Failure
to do so, when so requested, shall constitute a violation of this
Section. Provided: any person receiving such a notice may, within
ten (10) days after the date of the notice, appeal to Board of
Supervisors for a hearing on the revocation, and the decision of
Board of Supervisors shall be final.

1. Procedure. The sketch plan procedures are enacted to afford the
applicant the opportunity to submit information for review and informal
discussion with the Township before engaging in the detailed engineering
design for the preparation of preliminary and final plans. Submission of a
sketch plan shall not constitute formal filing of a plan with the Board. As
such, sketch plan submission procedure is voluntary and not subject to the
statutory review period imposed by the Act. It shall be the objective of the
Board, however, to receive comments submitted and to reply to the applicant
as promptly as possible.
Sufficient copies of sketch plans for subdivisions or land development,
as further described in §401, shall be supplied to the designated Township
officer to permit distribution.
2. Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall review
the sketch plan at its earliest possible convenience. Particular attention

the preliminary plan requirements and proceed directly to final plan
submission in the following situations:
A. When the number of lots and/or dwellings do not exceed ten (10)
provided that no new roads, streets, or other public improvements are
proposed.
- 136 -
(22, §308(2)(B)) (22, §308(2)(B))

3. Review by the Chester County Planning Commission. No formal action
shall be taken by the Township Planning Commission with respect to the
preliminary plan until it has received and considered comments by the Chester
County Planning Commission. In the event that these comments are not
forthcoming within thirty (30) days from the date the application was
forwarded to the County, the Township Planning Commission may act without
having considered the review. [Ord. 3-1991]
4. Review by the Township Planning Commission. The Township Planning
Commission shall review the preliminary plan at the first regularly scheduled
public meeting of the Commission following the official filing date as

one of two (2) courses of action. 1) It shall approve the preliminary plan;
2) It shall reject the preliminary plan.

shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the
requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite the
provisions of this Chapter relied upon.
6. Approval of the preliminary plan application shall constitute

and by Ord. 3-1991, 12/30/1991)
§309. Submission and Review of Final Plans.
1. Procedure.
A. Final plan applications for the entire project shall be
submitted within three (3) years after the Board of Supervisors has
approved the preliminary plan application. Final plan applications may
either be submitted in sections, each section covering a portion of the
entire development shown on the preliminary plan application if the
relationship of the part to the whole is clearly shown, or the final
plan can be for the entire project.
B. Unless an extension of time has been granted by the Board of
Supervisors upon written request, a final plan application submitted
after the three (3) year period shall be considered a new preliminary
plan and shall be required to comply with the plan application
requirements listed in §402 of this Chapter.
C. The final plan applications shall conform in all important
respects with the preliminary plan application previously approved by
the Township and shall incorporate modifications and revisions specified
by the Board of Supervisors in its conditional approval of the
preliminary plan application. If the final plan does not so conform,
the developer may in writing request to have the application be
considered as a revised preliminary plan application, in which case it
shall be required to comply with the plan application requirements
listed in §402 of this Chapter.
D. Three (3) copies of the final plan application, including the
final plan and all supporting information required in §403 of this
Chapter, shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Township. The
Township Secretary shall submit all applications to the Planning
Commission for its review and recommendations prior to review and
approval by the Board of Supervisors.
2. Review by the Chester County Planning Commission. Submission of a
final plan to the Chester County Planning Commission shall be required only
when the final plan deviates significantly from the preliminary plan, or at
the request of the Township Planning Commission. In the event that the
County Planning Commission is requested to review the final plan, a second
fee may be required and paid by the applicant, and no formal action shall be
taken by the Township Planning Commission until it has received and
considered the County's comments. Should these comments not be forthcoming
within thirty (30) days from the date of application forwarded to the County,
the Township Planning Commission may act without having considered the
review. [Ord. 3-1991]
3. Review by the Township Planning Commission. Review of the final
plans by the Township Planning Commission shall be in accordance with the
procedures outlined for review of preliminary plans, §308(4) of this Chapter.
- 138 -
(22, §309(4)) (22, §309(4))
4. Review by the Board of Supervisors. Upon receipt of the
recommendations of the Township Planning Commission, the Board shall review
the final plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting, or at a special
meeting called for that purpose and then shall approve or disapprove the
plan. Formal action shall occur before the end of the statutory review
period. The decision of the Board shall be in writing and shall be mailed to
the applicant at his last known address not later than fifteen (15) days
following the decision.
(Ord. 12-12-1983, 12/12/1983, §307; as amended by Ord. 5-9-1988, 5/9/1988;
and by Ord. 3-1991, 12/30/1991)
§310. Phased Development. In the event that a subdivision or land
development is to be constructed in phases, the final plan requirements
shall apply only to those phases for which final approval is being sought.
(Ord. 12-12-1983, 12/12/1983, §308)
§311. Completion of Improvements or Guarantee Thereof Prerequisite to
Final Plat Approval.
1. No plat shall be finally approved unless the streets shown on such
plat have been improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, or improved as may be otherwise required by this Chapter and any
walkways, curbs, gutters, street lights, fire hydrants, shade trees, water
mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and other improvements as may be
required by this Chapter have been installed in accordance with this
Chapter. In lieu of the completion of any improvements required as a
condition for the final approval of a plat, including improvements or fees
otherwise required by this Chapter, the developer may deposit with the
Township of West Nottingham financial security in an amount sufficient to
cover the costs of such improvements or common amenities including basins
and other related drainage facilities, recreational facilities, open space
improvements, or buffer or screen plantings which may be required.
2. When requested by the developer, in order to facilitate financing,
the Board of Supervisors, shall furnish the developer with a signed copy of
a resolution indicating approval of the final plat contingent upon the
developer obtaining a satisfactory financial security. The final plat or
record plan shall not be signed nor recorded until the financial improvements
agreement is executed. The resolution or letter of contingent approval shall
expire and be deemed to be revoked if the financial security agreement is not
executed within ninety (90) days unless a written extension is granted by the
Board of Supervisors; such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld and
shall be placed in writing at the request of the developer.
3. Without limitation as to other types of financial security which the
Township of West Nottingham may approve, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution
irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in such
lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security for the
purposes of this Section.
- 139 -
(22, §311(4)) (22, §311(4))
4. Such financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or
Federal or Commonwealth chartered lending institution chosen by the party
posting the financial security, provided said bonding company or lending
institution is authorized to conduct such business within the Commonwealth.
5. Such bond, or other security shall provide for, and secure to the
public the completion of any improvements which may be required on or before
the date fixed in the formal action of approval or accompanying agreement for
completion of the improvements.
6. The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to one hundred ten (110%) percent of
the cost of completion estimated as of ninety (90) days following the date
scheduled for completion by the developer. Annually, the Township of West
Nottingham may adjust the amount of the financial security by comparing the
actual cost of the improvements which have been completed and the estimated
cost for the completion of the remaining improvements as of the expiration
of the ninetieth (90th) day after either the original date scheduled for
completion or a rescheduled date of completion. Subsequent to said
adjustment, the Township of West Nottingham may require the developer to post
additional security in order to assure that the financial security equals
said one hundred ten (110%) percent. Any additional security shall be posted
by the developer in accordance with this subsection.
7. The amount of financial security required shall be based upon an
estimate of the cost of completion of the required improvements, submitted
by the applicant or developer and prepared by a professional engineer
licensed as such in this Commonwealth and certified by such engineer to be a
fair and reasonable estimate of such cost. The Township of West Nottingham,
upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer, may refuse to accept such
estimate for good cause shown. If the applicant or developer and the
Township of West Nottingham are unable to agree upon an estimate, then the
estimate shall be recalculated and recertified by another professional
engineer licensed as such in this Commonwealth and chosen mutually by the
Township of West Nottingham and the applicant or developer. The estimate
certified by the third (3rd) engineer shall be presumed fair and reasonable
and shall be the final estimate. In the event that a third (3rd) engineer is
so chosen, fees for the services of said engineer shall be paid equally by
the Township of West Nottingham and the applicant or developer.
8. If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
(1) year from the date of posting of the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by
an additional ten (10%) percent for each one (1) year period beyond the
first anniversary date from posting of financial security or to an amount
not exceeding one hundred ten (110%) percent of the cost of completing the
required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the
preceding one (1) year period by using the above bidding procedure.
9. In the case where development is projected over a period of years,
the Board of Supervisors may authorize submission of final plats by sections
or stages of development subject to such requirements or guarantees
- 140 -
(22, §311(9), cont'd) (22, §311(9), cont'd)
as to improvements in future section or stages of development as it finds
essential for the protection of any finally approved section of the
development.
10. As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the
party posting the financial security may request the Board of Supervisors to
release or authorize the release, from time to time, of such portions of the
financial security necessary for payment to the contractor or contractors
performing the work. Any such requests shall be in writing addressed to the
Board of Supervisors, and the Board of Supervisors shall have forty-five (45)
days from receipt of such request within which to allow the Township engineer
to certify, in writing, to the Board of Supervisors that such portion of the
work upon the improvements has been completed in accordance with the approved
plat. Upon such certification the Board of Supervisors shall authorize
release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount as
estimated by the Township Engineer fairly representing the value of the
improvements completed or, if the Board of Supervisors fails to act within
said forty-five (45) day period, the Board of Supervisors shall be deemed to
have approved the release of funds as requested. The Board of Supervisors
may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by
its engineer, require retention of ten (10%) percent of the estimated cost of
the aforesaid improvements.
11. Where the Board of Supervisors accepts dedication of all or some
of the required improvements following completion, the Board of Supervisors
may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity
of said improvements as well as the functioning of said improvements in
accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat
for a term not to exceed eighteen (18) months from the date of acceptance of
dedication. Said financial security shall be of the same type as otherwise
required in this Section with regard to installation of such improvements,
and the amount of the financial security shall not exceed fifteen (15%)
percent of the actual cost of installation of said improvements.
12. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, along with
apparatus or facilities related thereto, are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and pursuant to the rules and regulations of a public utility or
municipal authority separate and distinct from the Township of West
Nottingham, financial security to assure proper completion and maintenance
thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations of the controlling
public utility or municipal authority and shall not be included within the
financial security as otherwise required by this Section.
13. If financial security has been provided in lieu of the completion
of improvements required as a condition for the final approval of a plat as
set forth in this Section, the Township of West Nottingham shall not
condition the issuance of building, grading or other permits relating to the
erection or placement of improvements, including buildings, upon the lots or
land as depicted upon the final plat upon actual completion of the
improvements depicted upon the approved final plat. Moreover, if said
financial security has been provided, occupancy permits for any building or
buildings to be erected shall not be withheld following the improvement of
- 141 -
(22, §311(13), cont'd) (22, §311(13), cont'd)
the streets providing access to and from existing public roads to such
building or buildings to a mud-free or otherwise permanently passable
condition, as well as the completion of all other improvements as depicted
upon the approved plat, either upon the lot or lots or beyond the lot or lots
in question if such improvements are necessary for the reasonable use of or
occupancy of the building or buildings.
(Ord. 12-12-1983, 12/12/1983, §309; as amended by Ord. 3-1991, 12/30/1991)
§312. Release from Improvement Bond.
1. When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall notify the Board of
Supervisors, in writing, by certified or registered mail, of the completion
of the aforesaid improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township
Engineer. The Board of Supervisors shall, within ten (10) days after receipt
of such notice, direct and authorize the Township Engineer to inspect all of
the aforesaid improvements. The Township Engineer shall, thereupon, file a
report in writing, with the Board of Supervisors, and shall promptly mail a
copy of the same to the developer by certified or registered mail. The
report shall be made and mailed within thirty (30) days after receipt by the
Township Engineer of the aforesaid authorization from the Board of
Supervisors; said report shall be detailed and shall indicate approval or
rejection of said improvements, either in whole or in part, and if said
improvements, or any portion thereof, shall not be approved or shall be
rejected by the Township Engineer, said report shall contain a statement of
reasons for such nonapproval or rejection.
2. The Board of Supervisors shall notify the developer, within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the engineer's report, in writing by certified or
registered mail of the action of said Board of Supervisors with relation
thereto.

with the time limitation provisions contained herein, all improvements will
be deemed to have been approved and the developer shall be released from all
liability, pursuant to its performance guaranty bond or other security
agreement.
4. If any portion of the said improvements shall not be approved or
shall be rejected by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall proceed to
complete the same and, upon completion, the same procedure of notification,
as outlined herein, shall be followed.
5. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed in limitation of the
developer's right to contest or question by legal proceedings or otherwise,
any determination of the Board of Supervisors or the Township Engineer.
6. Where herein reference is made to the Township Engineer, he shall
be as a consultant thereto.
7. The applicant or developer shall reimburse the Township of West
Nottingham for the reasonable and necessary expense incurred for the
inspection or improvements according to a schedule of fees adopted by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors and as from time to time amended.
Such expense shall be reasonable and in accordance with the ordinary and
- 142 -
(22, §312(7), cont'd) (22, §312(7), cont'd)
customary fees charged by the Township Engineer or consultant for work
performed for similar services in the community, but in no event shall the
fees exceed the rate or cost charged by the engineer or consultant to the
Township of West Nottingham when fees are not reimbursed or otherwise
imposed on applicants.
A. In the event the applicant disputes the amount of any such
expense in connection with the inspection of improvements, the applicant
shall, within ten (10) working days of the date of billing, notify the
Township of West Nottingham that such expenses are disputed as
unreasonable or unnecessary, in which case the Township of West
Nottingham shall not delay or disapprove a subdivision or land
development application or any approval or permit related to development
due to the applicant's request over disputed engineer expenses.
B. If, within twenty (20) days from the date of billing, the
Township of West Nottingham and the applicant cannot agree on the amount
of expenses which are reasonable and necessary, then the applicant and
the Township of West Nottingham shall jointly, by mutual agreement,
appoint another professional engineer licensed as such in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to review the said expenses and make a
determination as to the amount thereof which is reasonable and
necessary.
C. The professional engineer so appointed shall hear such evidence
and review such documentation as the professional engineer in his or her
sole opinion deems necessary and render a decision within fifty (50)
days of the billing date. The applicant shall be required to pay the
entire amount determined in the decision immediately.
D. In the event that the Township of West Nottingham and applicant
cannot agree upon the professional engineer to be appointed within
twenty (20) days of the billing date, then, upon application of either
party, the President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of the judicial
district in which the Township of West Nottingham is located (or if at
the time there be no President Judge, then the senior active judge then
sitting) shall appoint such engineer, who, in that case, shall be
neither the Township Engineer nor any professional engineer who has been
retained by, or performed services for, the Township of West Nottingham
or the applicant within the preceding five (5) years.
E. The fee of the appointed professional engineer for determining
the reasonable and necessary expenses shall be paid by the applicant if
the amount of payment required in the decision is equal to or greater
than the original bill. If the amount of payment required in the
decision is less than the original bill by one thousand ($1,000) dollars
or more, the Township of West Nottingham shall pay the fee of the
professional engineer, but otherwise the Township of West Nottingham and
the applicant shall each pay one-half (1) of the fee of the appointed
professional engineer.

§313. Remedies to Effect Completion of Improvements. In the event that
any improvements which may be required have not been installed as provided in
this Chapter or in accord with the approved final plat the Board of
Supervisors is hereby granted the power to enforce any corporate bond, or
other security by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. If the proceeds
of such bond, or other security are insufficient to pay the cost of
installing or making repairs or corrections to all the improvements covered
by said security, the Board of Supervisors may, at its option, install part
of such improvements in all or part of the subdivision or land development
and may institute appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys
necessary to complete the remainder of the improvements. All of the
proceeds, whether resulting from the security or from any legal or equitable
action brought against the developer, or both, shall be used solely for the
installation of the improvements covered by such security, and not for any
other Township purpose. (Ord. 12-12-1983, 12/12/1983, §311; as amended by
Ord. 3-1991, 12/30/1991)

(90) days of such final approval record such plat in the office of the
recorder of deeds of the county in which the Township of West Nottingham is
located. The recorder of deeds shall not accept any plat for recording unless
such plat officially notes the approval of the Board of Supervisors, and
review by the county planning agency.
2. The recording of the plat shall not constitute grounds for
assessment increases until such time as lots are sold or improvements are
installed on the land included within the subject plat.

of the Act are constructed in accordance with an approved and recorded final
plan within five (5) years after the date of approval by the Board, the
approval shall be null and void. Where preliminary play approval preceded
final plan approval, the five (5) year period shall be measured from the date
of preliminary plan approval by the Board. (Ord. 12-12-1983,

where inlets are not required to handle surface runoff.
5. Storm Water Roof Drains. Storm water roof drains and pipes, wherever
possible, shall discharge water into a storm water runoff dispersion and
absorption control device (roof runoff infiltration bed) and not into storm
sewer or street gutters.
A. Roof Runoff Infiltration Beds Design Procedure
(1) The recharge bed will be a subsurface trench, which is
filled with stone having a void ratio of at least thirty-five
percent (35%). The maximum depth of this bed will be at least two
(2) feet above the bedrock and the seasonal high groundwater table.
A suitable prefabricated infiltration device can be substituted,
if approved by the Township Engineer, Building Inspector or Deputy
Building Inspector.
(2) The volume of the bed will be based on the volume of
water from one (1) inch of rainfall on all roof surfaces for the
proposed structures, divided by the void ratio of stone used.
Figure 1 (page 190) can be used to estimate runoff volumes or it
can be directly calculated using the surface area of the
projections of the roof times one (1) inch.
EQUATION 1: VOLUME OF BED = VOLUME OF RUNOFF/VOID RATIO
(3) The bed must have at least one (1) foot of cover above
the stone and must have a separation distance of at least twentyfive
(25) feet from wells and onlot septage disposal systems. All
roof surfaces must drain to a recharge system. A separation
distance of ten (10) feet from the foundation of the structure to
the seepage bed must be maintained.
(4) Recharge bed shall be completely wrapped with a
geotextile fabric.
(5) Proper construction methodologies must be utilized so
that the bottom of the seepage bed is not compacted.

following the date of the determination of a violation by the district
justice and thereafter each day that a violation continues shall constitute
a separate violation. [Ord. 3-1991]

will impose respectively different rates, the total of which shall not exceed
the maximum rate permitted under "The Local Tax Enabling Act."

passing by testate or intestate succession from a personal representative of
a decedent to the decedent's devisee or heir.
8. A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration to a trustee of

and direct access between the various uses within the Village District and any other nearby
concentrations of development.
2. Sidewalks.
a. Sidewalks shall generally be provided across the frontage of each lot as determined by
West Nottingham Township. Where retention of existing structures is desired or where
significant right-of-way constraints exist, the Board of Supervisors may eliminate or
modify this requirement or accompanying requirements herein (e.g., planting strip,
sidewalk width). In all cases where sidewalks are provided, pedestrian safety shall be
maintained and achieved through measures such as bollards, permanents posts, or other
measures subject to the Board of Supervisors approval.
b. Non-residential uses.
1) East of Route 1. For predominately non-residential uses fronting on any other street
except for those sections of Route 272 west of and passing over Route 1, sidewalks
shall be separated from street curbs by a vegetative strip no less than five (5) feet
wide planted with native grasses or other herbaceous plant materials and that may
include trees, located consistent with Section 606 herein and designed in conjunction
with any street furniture, to provide separation between pedestrians and cars at
appropriate intervals along said streets.
2) Route 1 and West. For predominately non-residential uses fronting on those sections
of Route 272 west of and passing over Route 1, sidewalks located along the right-ofway
shall be separated from the street curb by a vegetative strip no less than five (5)
feet wide, planted with native grasses or other herbaceous plant materials, or trees in
tree islands, located consistent with Section 606 herein, or by a wall or fence
constructed of concrete, stone, or iron no higher than three (3) feet above grade level
at the building entrance. For any of these separation options, existing grades shall be
retained to the extent practicable.
c. Residential Uses. Sidewalks on streets which are fronted by predominately residential
uses shall be separated from street curbs by a planting strip no less than five (5) feet
wide, planted with native grasses or other herbaceous plant materials, and that may
include trees located consistent with this section.

3. Parking Areas.
a. Parking areas within the Village District shall be designed and landscaped so as to
appear broken in mass, in proportion to the scale of structural development.
b. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, coordination of access to parking
areas, provision of non-paved overflow parking areas, and shared parking among
adjacent uses all shall be required in accordance with Part 12.
c. Parking shall not be provided in the front yard.
d. All off-street parking shall be located at the rear of the lot, or if necessary, to the side of
the lot, accessed by alleys or driveways, and shall be screened from view from any public
street, non-motorized accessway, or neighboring residence.
e. To the extent that parking areas are visible from streets, visual impacts shall be mitigated
through introduction of landscape screening, landscape walls, use of pervious paving
materials, or other design means. Off-street parking areas shall utilize pervious paving
materials, bioswales, islands landscaped with native plant materials, and other similar
methods to the greatest extent practicable in order to maximize the potential for
groundwater infiltration.
f. The creation of on-street parking is encouraged; however, on-street parking shall not be
counted towards required off-street parking in accordance with Part 12.
4. Streets shall be designed to calm traffic speeds and promote pedestrian movement,
consistent with the recommendations of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportations
Traffic Calming Handbook (most recent edition).
5. Alleys shall be provided to move vehicular access to the rear of principal structures and
thereby improve the appearance of the streetscape, and shall be at least sixteen (16) feet in
width if designed for two-way travel, with a maximum of eighteen (18) feet in width, and
twelve (12) feet in width if designed for one-way travel. Driveways accessing two (2) or fewer
dwelling units and not dedicated for public use may be nine (9) feet in width.
I. Landscape and Streetscape Design. All lands not utilized to provide for permitted impervious
cover shall be left in their natural state or landscaped with appropriate native vegetation or other
suitable landscape material. In addition:
1. Street trees shall be provided and shall be planted within the street right-of-way and/or as
directed by West Nottingham Township.

adjacent properties. In addition, the following specific requirements apply to the VCOM and
VCTR subdistricts:
a. A minimum of one (1) public trash receptacle in each block; public benches of approved
design at intervals of no greater than one hundred (100) feet on each block.
b. A minimum of one (1) bike rack on each block. West Nottingham Township reserves the
right to require the provision of container(s) for the recycling of accepted materials.

West Nottingham Zoning Ordinance Part 6 - Village District
6-10 August 2012
3. West Nottingham Township may require the above-referenced, or similar, streetscape and
pedestrian amenities as appropriate in the VR subdistrict (e.g., adjacent to or within a
required civic space).
J. Architectural Design. To the extent practicable, all new construction and/or additions to existing
structures within the Village District shall be designed to be consistent with the document,
Nottingham Village Manual of Design Guidelines, with either a traditional architectural character
or as a contemporary expression of traditional styles and forms, respecting the scale, proportion,
roof pitch, character, and materials of age-appropriate examples in and near the Village District;
and/or in accordance with the following standards as applicable:
1. Building Facades.
a. Building arrangements which rely on the repetition of the same building façade element
shall not be approved.
b. Where any individual building façade is visible from any public right-of-way or civic space
(including internal civic spaces within a development) and exceeds forty (40) feet in
length, there shall be both a clear dimensional differentiation of roofline, and an offset in
the façade that is either a perpendicular protrusion away from, or a perpendicular indent
into, the building façade to create effective façades that are no longer than forty (40) feet.
Such offset shall be at least five (5) long by three (3) feet deep. Street furniture,
sculpture/public art, or other desirable streetscape components may be placed within an
indent into the building façade. Protrusions away from the building façade (e.g., columns,
window bays) shall not interfere with pedestrian or bicycle passage adjacent to the
building.
c. Exemptions. Facades greater than forty (40) feet may be approved when in accordance
with the following:
1) West Nottingham Township may allow a building with a façade longer than forty (40)
feet when the proposed design emulates characteristic historical building forms such
as barns, stables, churches, meeting houses, or other public buildings.
2) Where an individual building façade that exceeds forty (40) feet in length is approved,
the building design or use layout shall limit the length of the streetscape frontage
occupied by any one use to the greatest extent practicable by providing for inviting,
interior accessory or independent business uses within the streetscape-fronting
portion of the building (e.g., the café and/or floral operations within a grocery store, or
a small, independent service or retail use).
d. In all cases, it is recommended that blank walls and facades are minimized to the extent
possible. Windows should predominate on facades, particularly those facing streets or
parking areas. Wall treatments such as belt courses, medallions, vertical breaks or
projections, and painted murals are encouraged to provide variation in order to break up
walls where windows are not present.
e. Windows. Windows shall be transparent and glass block, mirror glass, and the like shall
not be permitted.
2. Building Height.
a. Buildings five thousand (5,000) square feet and greater. New buildings containing
principal non-residential use(s) that are five thousand (5,000) square feet and greater
shall have at least two (2) stories of habitable floor area, excluding basements and attics,
over thirty (30) percent of its ground floor footprint, subject to the building height limits in
Section 609 of this Part.

footprint less than five thousand (5,000) square feet shall require a visual presentation of
a second story façade, subject to the review of the West Nottingham Township Planning
Commission and approval of the West Nottingham Township Board of Supervisors. Refer
to the document, Nottingham Village Manual of Design Guidelines for an example.
K. All proposed uses within the Village District shall adhere to the applicable provisions of the West
Nottingham Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.

Where clearly consistent with a provision of this Part, the West Nottingham Township Board of
Supervisors may, with a positive recommendation from the West Nottingham Township Planning
Commission, permit the modification of the standards set in Section 605.D.1 and Section 609. Applicable
standards (e.g., lot area, building size, setbacks, etc.) may be modified a maximum of twenty five (25)

identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) dated September 29, 2006 and the
accompanying maps as prepared for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof. Including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study.

a. FW (Floodway Area). The areas identified as Floodway in the AE Zone in the Flood
Insurance Study prepared by FEMA. The term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of information for those
floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study

determined by using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain area which is
nearest the construction site in question. (See Figure 9-1)
In lieu of the above, the Township may require the applicant to determine the elevation
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, or similar information
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Township.
3. Changes in Identification of Area. The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified
by the Board of Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change, approval
shall be obtained from the FEMA.
4. Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Township Planning Commission and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Board of Supervisors. The burden of proof shall
be on the appellant.

SECTION 1706 PARTIES APPELLANT BEFORE THE BOARD

or agency of the Township of West Nottingham, or any person aggrieved. Requests for a variance under
Section 1707 or for special exception under Section 1708 may be filed with the Board by any landowner

SECTION 1707 VARIANCES
A. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of the Zoning
Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule prescribe the
form of application and may require preliminary application to the Zoning Officer. The Board may
grant a variance provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case. (MPC
910.2(a))
1. That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including irregularity,
narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, including floodplains in accordance
with Section 903.H, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning Chapter in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located. (MPC 910.2(a)(1))
2. That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no possibility that the
property can be developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning Chapter and
that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of
the property. (MPC 910.2(a)(2))
3. That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant. (MPC 910.2(a)(3))
West Nottingham Township Zoning Ordinance Part 17 - Zoning Hearing Board
17-6 August 2012
4. That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(MPC 910.2(a)(4))
5. That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance that will afford relief and
will represent the least modification possible of the regulation in issue. (MPC 910.2(a)(5))
6. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards
as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and the Pennsylvania
Planning Code, 53 P.S. Section 10101 et seq. (MPC 910.2(b))
SECTION 1708 SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS (MPC 912.1)
Where the Board of Supervisors, in this Chapter, has stated special exceptions to be granted or denied
by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to express standards and criteria, the Board shall hear and decide
requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria. In granting a special
exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and the
Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. Section 10101 et seq.
A. Consideration shall be given to the size, scope, and extent of the special exception requested,
and assurances that it is consistent with the development plan, the objectives of this Chapter, and
the Township Comprehensive Plan, may be requested.
B. Consideration shall be given to the suitability of the proposed site for the special exception the
impact the exception may have on surrounding land uses, how the exception may promote
harmonious development within the intent of this Chapter and Township Comprehensive Plan,
and that the proposed exception will not adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of
Township residents.
C. Consideration shall be given to the potential impact on the natural, scenic, and historic resources
on the site of the proposed special exception and its surroundings.
D. The demand for parking, access points onto public roadways, and the anticipated traffic impact of
the proposed special exception shall be considered.
E. Consideration will be given to the need for public services arising from the proposed special
exception.
F. The special exception shall be evaluated in terms of its effect on property values and the general
welfare of the area.
SECTION 1709 EXPIRATION OF VARIANCE AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS
A. Unless otherwise specified by the Board, a special exception, special relief or variance shall
expire within one (1) year from the date of authorization if the applicant fails to obtain the
appropriate permit or fails to file for an extension as per Section 1709.B, below.

SECTION 1710 TIME LIMITATIONS
A. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Zoning Hearing Board later than thirty
(30) days after an application for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by the
Township of West Nottingham if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the
approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge
or reason to believe that such approval had been given. (MPC 914.1(a))
B. If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the
knowledge of his predecessor in interest. (MPC 914.1(a))
C. The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative
plan or from an adverse decision by the zoning officer on a challenge to the validity of this
Chapter or an amendment hereto or map or an amendment thereto shall preclude an appeal from
a final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the
approved tentative approval. ( MPC 914.1(a))
D. All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowner shall be filed by the landowner within
thirty (30) days after notice of the determination is issued. (MPC 914.1(b))
SECTION 1711 STAY OF PROCEEDINGS
A. Upon filing of any appeal proceeding before the Zoning Hearing Board and during its pendency
before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval
of the Zoning Officer or of any agency or body, and all official action hereunder, shall be stayed
unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to the Board facts
indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the
development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which
may be granted by the Board or by the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition,
after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body. When an application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse
or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the applicant, the applicant
may petition the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as
a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board. (MPC 915.1(a))
B. After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the filing of the appeal
is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on the merits of the case. It shall be the
burden of the applicant for a bond to prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all
evidence presented, if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition
for a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may be waived by
the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal is taken from a final decision of
the court. (MPC 915.1(b))
C. The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be
within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a petition for bond shall be
interlocutory. An order directing the responding party to post a bond shall be interlocutory. (MPC
915.1(c))
D. If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of the court
dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate court sustains the order of
the court below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for a bond, upon motion of the
petitioner and after hearing in the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all
reasonable costs, expenses and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner. (MPC 915.1(d))

PART 19 TDR  TRANSFERABLE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS
(Note: Section 1908 consists of the West Nottingham Township TDR Sending Area and Receiving Area Map.)
SECTION 1901 PURPOSE
The primary purpose of the West Nottingham Township transferable development rights (TDR) program
established herein is to permanently preserve prime farmlands and visually significant landscapes that
would be lost if the land were developed from its agricultural or other open uses. In addition, this Part is
intended to protect property rights by allowing landowners whose land is desired for conservation to
voluntarily transfer their right to develop to other areas of West Nottingham Township deemed
appropriate for residential or non-residential development.
SECTION 1902 BASIC CONCEPT AND AUTHORIZATION
A. The provisions of this Part which permit TDRs allow landowners in areas of West Nottingham
Township proposed for conservation, called sending areas, to sell or convey the right to develop
their land to landowners in areas of West Nottingham Township proposed for additional
development, called receiving areas. The TDR provisions set forth below are specifically authorized
under §603(c)(2.2) and 619.1 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act of 1968, PL
805, #247), under the terms of which development rights are acknowledged to be severable and
separately conveyable, or transferable, from a sending area to a receiving area.
B. Landowners or developers interested in buying, selling or conveying TDRs consistent with this Part
may refer to Section 1908, TDR Sending Area and Receiving Area Map, to determine these areas
general locations. A reduced version of this map is found in Section 1908, while the full-size version
is available for review at the West Nottingham Township offices during regular business hours. The
map is also available on the West Nottingham Township website at, http://www.wnt-gov.org/.
General tabulations of TDRs allocated to properties within the sending area are also available at the
West Nottingham Township offices during regular business hours. Landowners within the sending
area are also encouraged to discuss the general tabulations of TDRs with the West Nottingham
Township Planning Commission, prior to the formal TDR tabulation process described in Section
1903.E.
C. When landowners in the sending area sell or convey their right to develop their land, they must
restrict that land against any future development as provided in this Part, although the land may still
be used for purposes, such as agriculture or forestry, that do not involve residential, commercial,
industrial, or institutional development. When landowners in the receiving area buy the TDRs from
landowners in the sending area, they receive the right to develop new uses, build more intensively,
or obtain added flexibility in meeting area and bulk limitations on their land than they would have
been allowed had they not purchased TDRs, as specified herein.
D. The conservation easement (see Section 1903.F.3) used to prevent further development of parcels
from which TDRs have been severed shall not prohibit the landowner's sale of the land after TDR
severance, although such land cannot thereafter be used for residential, commercial, industrial, or
institutional development purposes as stipulated in Section 1903.G. Also, and as subject to the
provisions of Section 1903.G, the afore-mentioned conservation easement shall run in favor of West
Nottingham Township and a bona-fide conservation organization acceptable to the West Nottingham
Township Board of Supervisors.
E. The owner of the tract in the sending area from which the TDRs are severed or any subsequent
purchaser or purchasers of the TDRs may declare the TDRs for sale, may hold the TDRs, or may
resell or convey the TDRs. The only use which may be made of the TDRs is the ultimate transfer to a
landowner or developer with a tract in the receiving area. West Nottingham Township shall have no
obligation to purchase the TDRs which have been severed from a tract in the sending area.
West Nottingham Township Zoning Ordinance Part 19  Transferable Development Rights (TDR)
19-2 August 2012
F. The West Nottingham Township Board of Supervisors may charge a fee, established by
resolution of the Board of Supervisors, to cover the administrative, technical, legal, and/or
informational costs of TDR calculation, severance, and/or related dedication.
SECTION 1903 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF TDRs FROM SENDING AREA
A. Owners of tracts which meet the following requirements may sever and subsequently sell or convey
their TDRs from land which shall:
1. Comprise at least twenty (20) acres in area.
2. Consist of at least twenty (20) percent prime agricultural soils.
3. Be located in the TDR Sending Area which is shown in Section 1908, TDR Sending Area and
Receiving Area Map. It is hereby acknowledged that the lot boundaries within the TDR
Sending Area that exist at the time of adoption of this Part may change due to the subdivision
and land development process. In no case however, shall the outside boundary of the
Sending Area change unless so specifically modified by the West Nottingham Township
Board of Supervisors.
B. The sending area tract from which TDRs are severed must be restricted from future development
in accordance with Section 1903.F.3.
C. The portion of the sending area parcel which contains an existing residence and accessory
buildings, or that portion planned to accommodate a residence and accessory buildings and
which therefore may be excluded from any restrictions, shall meet the use, area, dimensional,
performance and other standards of this Chapter.
D. Calculation of TDRs.
1. The total number of TDRs available on a sending area tract meeting the qualifications listed
in Section 1903.A above shall be determined as follows:
a. One (1) TDR shall be allocated for every acre of prime agricultural soil the tract contains.
b. If said sending area tract also consists of visually significant resources as shown in
Section 1908, TDR Sending Area and Receiving Area Map, one-quarter (¼) of a TDR
shall be allocated for each acre of mapped visually significant resources the tract
contains.
2. The total number of TDRs allocated per sending area tract is cumulative based on the
presence of prime agricultural soils and visually significant resources, regardless of any
overlap. For example, an eligible sending area tract of fifty (50) acres with twenty (20) acres
of prime agricultural soils, all of which are identified in Section 1908, TDR Sending Area and
Receiving Area Map as visually significant, would be allocated a total of twenty-five (25)
TDRs [i.e., (1 TDR x 20 acres) + (¼ TDR x 20 acres)]
3. Previously eased lands and exclusions. Land previously restricted against development by
covenant, easement, or deed restriction shall not be eligible for calculation of TDRs unless
and until such time as said covenant, restriction, or easement is dissolved or rescinded with
written agreement of all beneficiaries of such covenant, restriction, or easement.
4. Any sending area tract that meets the minimum criteria of Section 1903.A. and that is
comprised solely of the land identified on the tracts deed or by its tax parcel (i.e., it is not
joined in a single deed with an adjacent tract or tracts, nor does it have a tax parcel
assignment that includes land outside the sending area) shall be allowed one (1) principal
dwelling unit and up to two (2) accessory dwelling units pursuant to Section 1102 of this
Ordinance. In this case, no TDRs shall be retained for any existing or future principal or
accessory dwelling units. Any other proposed configuration for sending area tracts shall be
subject to the declaration and certification of TDRs pursuant to Section 1903.E.
West Nottingham Township Zoning Ordinance Part 19  Transferable Development Rights (TDR)
19-3 August 2012
5. A sending area tract from which TDRs have been severed pursuant to this Part may be
subdivided for continued agricultural or open space purposes, if the following criteria are met
after subdivision:
a. The residual sending area tract, i.e., the parent tract, remains at least twenty (20) acres in
size and has at least twenty (20) percent of prime agricultural soils to allow for continued
agricultural viability.
b. The newly created parcel(s) or tract(s) is a minimum of twenty (20) acres in size.
c. Notwithstanding Section 1903.D.5.a and b. above, the residual sending area tract, and
the newly created parcel(s), may either, or both, be less than twenty (20) acres in size
when either or both are joined in a single deed with an adjacent tract or tracts to create
parcels that are at least twenty (20) acres in size and that contain at least twenty (20)
percent of prime agricultural soils.
d. Regardless of Section 1903.D.5.a. or b. above, the conservation easement that restricts
the sending area tract from future development (Section 1903.F.3.) shall run with all
subdivided tracts.
e. When a parcel from which TDRs have been severed is joined with a parcel from which no
TDRs have been severed, the added land shall not be eligible for TDR sending, nor used
to compute TDRs allocated by zoning for the parcel from which no TDRs have been
severed.
6. Where calculations result in fractional numbers, a fraction of 0.5 or higher shall be rounded
up to the next highest whole number and a fraction of less than 0.5 shall be rounded down to
the next lowest whole number.
E. Declaration of TDRs and Certification by West Nottingham Township.
1. Any owner of a sending area tract eligible for the allocation of TDRs may officially apply for a
West Nottingham Township determination and certification of the number of TDRs available
on that tract. Upon receiving such a request, the West Nottingham Township Planning
Commission, or a subcommittee thereof, may meet with the applicant based on the initial
calculation of TDRs conducted by the West Nottingham Township Zoning Officer, in
consultation with the West Nottingham Township Engineer. Using the calculation
methodology stipulated in Section 1903.D.1, the parties may compute the number of TDRs
allocable to the subject property. The applicant may present additional supporting information
for the Planning Commission's consideration.
2. Where an applicant and the Planning Commission are in agreement on the number of TDRs
allocated, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the West Nottingham
Township Board of Supervisors regarding the number of TDRs available on the sending area
property.
3. Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors
shall make a final determination of the number of TDRs available on the property and shall
provide a written certification of that number to the applicant.
4. Any applicant dissatisfied with the Board's determination and certification of the number of
TDRs allocated to his or her tract may appeal the action of the Board of Supervisors to the
West Nottingham Township Zoning Hearing Board.
F. Severance of TDRs.
1. When choosing to sever TDRs as provided for herein, a landowner shall sever all TDRs
allocated to his or her tract at one time. No other development rights allocated through these
TDR provisions shall remain after the initial TDR severance.
Change page, March 26, 2013
West Nottingham Township Zoning Ordinance Part 19  Transferable Development Rights (TDR)
19-4 August 2012
2. TDRs which have been severed shall be recorded by a Deed of Transferable Development
Rights (the Deed) duly recorded in the Office of the Chester County Recorder of Deeds.
The Deed of Transferable Development Rights shall specify the tract of land to which the
rights shall be permanently attached or that the rights shall be transferred to West
Nottingham Township, retained by the owner of the sending area tract, or transferred to
another person in gross.
3. The Deed which severs the TDRs from the sending area tract shall be accompanied by a
conservation easement which shall permanently restrict development of the sending tract as
provided below and which shall be recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds at the
same time as, or prior to, recording of the Deed of Transferable Development Rights.
4. The Deed, as well as the conservation easement, shall be endorsed by the West Nottingham
Township Board of Supervisors prior to recording, which said endorsement shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Specifically:
a. Deeds submitted to West Nottingham Township for endorsement shall be preceded by a title
abstract, with copies of all recorded documents representing exceptions to title, of the
sending area tract(s) and a legal review of title affirming that the development right(s) being
transferred by the Deed have not been previously severed from, nor otherwise prohibited
from severance from, the sending area tract.
b. The title abstract and legal review of title shall be submitted at least ten (10) days prior to
submission of the Deed, all of which must meet the reasonable approval of the West
Nottingham Township Solicitor in support of Board of Supervisors endorsement. The title
abstract with accompanying exceptions documents and legal review of title may be
submitted up to forty five (45) days prior to submission of the Deed. In this case, a
notarized statement, certifying that no changes have occurred to the either title abstract
with accompanying exceptions documents and the legal review of title shall be submitted
ten (10) days prior to submission of the Deed.
5. If the agreement of sale of TDRs would entail less than the entire number of TDRs
represented by a recorded Deed of Transferable Development Rights, the applicant shall
indicate the disposition of the remaining TDRs in the Deed.
G. Protection of Sending Area from Future Development.
Any sending tract from which TDRs have been severed shall be permanently restricted from future
development by an appropriate conservation easement, acceptable to the West Nottingham
Township Board of Supervisors and its Solicitor. Said conservation easement used to permanently
restrict the TDR sending tract from future development must meet the following requirements:
1. Except as permitted herein, the conservation easement shall permanently restrict the land
from future subdivision or development for any purpose other than principal or accessory
agricultural uses, one (1) or more single family detached residential dwelling units which
existed at the time of adoption of this Part, public park land, conservation areas, or other
similar uses. The conservation easement shall allow the erection of one single family
detached dwelling, principal, residential dwelling unit on the tract, and up to two (2) accessory
dwelling units pursuant to Section 1102 of this Ordinance, if none existed at the time of
adoption of this Part. Structural development for such permitted uses shall be permitted
subject to the applicable provisions of this Chapter.
2. The conservation easement shall be approved by the West Nottingham Township Board of
Supervisors, subject to prior review and approval by the West Nottingham Township Solicitor.
3. The conservation easement shall designate West Nottingham Township, and/or a bona fide
conservation organization acceptable to the West Nottingham Township Board of
West Nottingham Township Zoning Ordinance Part 19  Transferable Development Rights (TDR)
19-5 August 2012
Supervisors at its sole discretion, as the beneficiary/grantee, but shall also designate the
following parties as having separate and independent enforcement rights with respect to the
conservation easement:
a. All future owners of any portion of the sending parcel.
b. All future owners of any portion of any parcel to which the TDRs shall be permanently
attached.
4. The conservation easement shall apply to the tract of land from which TDRs are severed (i.e.,
the sending area tract), and shall specify the number of TDRs to be severed.
5. All owners of all legal and beneficial interest in the tract from which TDRs are severed shall
execute the conservation easement. All lienholders of the tract from which TDRs are severed
shall execute a joinder and/or consent to the conservation easement.
6. Final approval for any subdivision or land development plan utilizing TDRs shall not be
granted prior to the recording of appropriate restrictions at the Chester County Recorder of
Deeds.
SECTION 1904 RECEIVING AREA QUALIFICATIONS AND CALCULATIONS
TDRs severed from sending area tracts may be transferred and received for development on eligible tracts;
i.e., within the Village District as established in Part 6 of this Chapter. Specifically, otherwise applicable

through the use of TDRs as part of a proposed subdivision or land development plan, prepared in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Chapter and of the Village District, as reviewed by the
West Nottingham Township Zoning Officer in consultation with the West Nottingham Township Engineer,
and as follows:
A. Uses Eligible through TDR Receipt.

satisfying the provisions of Section 1904.B.2 and B.3, as applicable.
B. Increase in Permitted Density or Intensity of Development.
1. Where TDRs are proposed to be used as part of a subdivision or land development plan in
the Village District, the otherwise applicable maximum number of dwelling units or maximum

expanded or increased in accordance with the limits stipulated in the applicable subdistrict.
The expanded limits shall be based upon the number of TDRs to be conveyed, as specified
in Section 1904.C herein.
2. Actual increases in the number of dwelling units or intensities of use permissible on any tract
shall be specifically determined by the number of TDRs planned for use on the property, the
type or types of uses proposed, and compliance with all other applicable standards of this
Part, Part 6, and all other applicable provisions.
3. The incremental increase in density or intensity of use above that otherwise provided without
the use of TDRs must be fully accounted for through proof of purchase and conveyance of

1907.A. above, TDRs, which have been legally severed pursuant to this Part prior to the effective
date of such change or termination, may be attached to any eligible tract in the receiving area after
the effective date of such West Nottingham Township action when:
1. An application for development in the receiving area was filed prior to the effective date of such
West Nottingham Township action and thereafter is continuously processed to approval.
2. An application for zoning approval in connection with such development was filed prior to the
effective date of such West Nottingham Township action and thereafter is continuously
processed to approval.
C. Determination of an incomplete and/or unacceptable subdivision or land development application
by West Nottingham Township shall not result in the loss of any legally severed TDRs provided
that such application is wholly revised and resubmitted within six (6) months of the date of such
West Nottingham Township determination. Additional extension requests, each for a period not
exceeding six (6) months, may be granted at the discretion of the West Nottingham Township
Board of Supervisors.

Update
August 2012
ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
The following documents have been adopted or accepted by the Township in
conjunction with the August 2012 zoning ordinance. Note these documents are not part
of the zoning ordinance and are not subject to the same adoption process as the zoning
ordinance required by Act 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, but are
included here as referenced by the zoning ordinance:
? Nottingham Village Manual of Design Guidelines. This document was adopted
by resolution as referenced by Part 6, Village District, of the zoning ordinance.
The document provides guidance for new development within the Village.
? Chapter 13, Part 2 of the Township Code of Ordinances in relation to Junkyards.
This document was adopted as a replacement for an existing ordinance in the
Township Code of Ordinances.
? Demolition Permit: Delay of Demolition for Historic Resources. This is adopted
as a new part of the existing demolition permit that applies to the demolition of
structures within the Township. This permit complements the existing permit but
will applies to Class I or Class II historic resources within the Township as
defined by the Township Historic Resource Atlas. The primary objective of this
permit is to assist in educating property owners about the importance of historic
resources and the opportunities provided by the zoning update to owners of
historic resources in hopes to mitigate any demolition of such resources. In the
case of demolition this permit assists the historical commission in gaining the
opportunity to properly document the resource before demolition to serve a
record and history for the Township.
? Historic Resource Atlas. The Atlas and Map are on file at the Township office.
The Atlas, Map, and the included supporting document was adopted by
resolution by the Township to provide backing for the zoning ordinance and
recognition of the hard work put forth by the Historical Commission, the
Township, and residents in the creation of this important document.

36 inches or greater The equivalent number of 3
caliper trees or greater needed to
equal the DBH of the removed
tree.
f. Replacement trees shall have been grown within the same USDA hardiness zone as the lot
or tract and shall be nursery grown, except those deemed by the Township to be acceptable
for transplanting from other disturbed portions of the lot or tract.
g. Species of replacement plantings shall reflect careful site evaluation, including:
(1) Existing and proposed site conditions and their suitability for the tree species, based on
geology, hydrology, soil, and microclimate.
(2) Specific functional and design objectives, including replacement of the woodlands being
removed, enhancement of existing woodlands, reforestation of riparian buffers,
landscape buffering, visual screening, noise abatement, energy conservation, wildlife
habitats, and maximizing aesthetic values.
(3) Maintenance considerations such as hardiness, resistance to insects and disease,
longevity, and availability.
(4) Because of the many benefits of native species (ease of maintenance, longevity, wildlife
habitat, etc.), the use of nursery grown, free-fruiting native trees is strongly encouraged.
Selection should reflect species diversity characteristic of the native deciduous landscape
of Chester County.
h. The planting of replacement trees shall be done by or supervised by a person with
horticultural training in tree care and planting methods.
i. Newly planted replacement trees shall be monitored for a period of one (1) year to ensure the
health of the trees. If a replacement tree(s) dies or is dying within the one (1) year period, the
applicant shall replace the dead tree(s) at no cost to the Township.
3) Tree Protection Zone.(Protection of Trees to Remain on Site) In order to prevent injury to those
trees which have been designated for protection, a Tree Protection Zone shall be established, prior
West Nottingham Township SLDO Amendments
SLDO-4 August 2012
to any land disturbance, where trees or woodlands on the site are to be retained. (See Figure 6-4)
In this Zone, the following standards shall apply:
a. Grade changes and excavations shall not encroach upon the Tree Protection Zone.
b. Trees being removed shall not be felled, pushed, or pulled into a Tree Protection Zone or into
trees to be retained.
c. No toxic materials, including petroleum based and derived products, shall be stored within
one hundred (100) feet of a Tree Protection Zone.
d. The area within the Tree Protection Zone shall not be built upon, nor shall any materials be
stored there either temporarily or permanently. Vehicles and equipment shall not be parked
in the Tree Protection Zone to avoid soil compaction.
e. Sediment, retention and detention basins shall not be located within the Tree Protection
Zone, nor shall they discharge into the Tree Protection Zone.
f. When tree stumps are located within ten (10) feet of the tree protection zone, the stumps
shall only be removed by means of a stump grinder to minimize the effect on the surrounding
root systems.
g. Tree roots which must be severed shall be cut by a backhoe or similar equipment aligned
radially to the tree. (This method reduces the lateral movement of the roots during
excavation, which if done by other methods, could damage the intertwined roots of adjacent
trees.)
h. Within four (4) hours of any severance of roots, all tree roots that have been exposed and/or
damaged shall be trimmed cleanly and covered temporarily with moist peat moss, moist
burlap or other biodegradable material to keep them from drying out until permanent cover
can be installed.
i. If there is no alternative but to locate a utility line through a Tree Protection Zone, tunneling
shall be used instead of trenching, except where in the opinion of the Township, survival of
the tree would not be affected by either method. The Township shall determine the most
desirable location for the utility line. Trenches shall be filled as soon as possible, and tamped
lightly to avoid air spaces.

j. Marking the Tree Protection Zone on the Site. Prior to construction, the Tree Protection Zone
shall be delineated by the following methods:
(1) The tree protection zone that is delineated on the site prior to construction shall conform
to the approved development plans.
(2) All trees scheduled to remain shall be marked; where groups of trees exist, only the trees
on the edge need to be marked.
(3) A suitable fence mounted on steel posts, located eight feet on center, shall be placed
along the boundary of the Tree Protection Zone. The fencing along the zone shall be
maintained until all construction and other work has been completed. Any damages to the
protective fencing shall be replaced and repaired before further construction commences.
(4) In addition to the Tree Protection Zone, trees may be left standing as protection between
the trunks of the trees to be retained and the limits of grading. When additional trees are
used as protection, the tree protection zone on the approved plan shall be marked in the
field so that the additional buffer area is delineated. When this method of protection is
used, these additional trees shall be removed at the time of completion of the project.
#13: The following shall be added as Section 624.1.C:
C. Landscaping and Buffering from Historic Resources.
1) Landscaping. When a Class I or II historic resource is located within a tract proposed for
subdivision or land development, a landscape plan for the grounds surrounding the Class I or II
historic resource shall be required in accordance with Section 1004 of Chapter 27, the Township
Zoning Ordinance.
a. The plan shall be prepared by a registered landscape architect, or by a nurseryman or other
individual deemed qualified by the Historical Commission or Board of Supervisors.
b. The plan shall show all pertinent information, including the location, size and species of all
individual trees and shrubs to be removed, relocated, planted or preserved.
c. Through screening, buffering and selection of plant material, the plan should strive to
minimize the impact of the proposed development on the Class I or II historic resource and
protect its integrity of setting and any significant vegetation.
West Nottingham Township SLDO Amendments
SLDO-6 August 2012
d. The plan shall be reviewed by the Historical Commission and submitted by them with written
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors prior to any decision by the Board of
Supervisors on the subdivision or land development plan.
2) Buffering. When any major subdivision or land development, or any non-residential use is
proposed on a property, any boundary of which is within one hundred (100) feet of an exterior
wall of a Class I or II historic resource, the applicant shall be required to submit a buffering plan.
a. The plan must depict how the Class I of II historic resource will be buffered against the
detrimental impacts of the proposed development. Buffering may include, but need not be
limited to vegetative screening and fencing in accordance with Section 1004 of Chapter 27,
the Township Zoning Ordinance.
b. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed buffering shall be reviewed by the
Historical Commission to the Board of Supervisors prior to any decision by the Board of
Supervisors on the subdivision, land development or non-residential use proposal.
#14: The following shall be added as Section 625:
Section 625. Riparian Buffers.
1. Purpose. In addition to the purposes listed in Section 901 of Part 9 of Chapter 27 of the West
Nottingham Code of Ordinances (Zoning Ordinance), it is the purpose of these riparian buffer
standards to: reduce the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter, pesticides, and other harmful
substances that reach watercourses and wetlands from adjacent land uses; reduce nitrogen and
dentrification in surface and groundwater and trap phosphorus-laden and other pollutants from
adjacent land use; provide stream bank stability which protects fish habitat and controls sediment and
erosion.
2. Applicability. The protection of riparian buffers and associated buffer establishment standards apply
to all watercourses, as specified herein, when an application for subdivision or land development is
submitted in accordance with the West Nottingham Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance. However, the Township recommends that all land owners with watercourses on their
property implement the protection standards specified in the zoning ordinance and herein.
3. Delineation of Riparian Buffer. For the purposes of this Chapter, the riparian buffer begins at the top
of each stream bank of a watercourse and occupies a margin of land a minimum width of thirty-five
(35) feet measured horizontally on a line perpendicular to the edge of the water at the top of the
defined bank (at bankfull), as reviewed and approved by the Township Engineer and illustrated in
Figure 6-5. A generalized map of riparian buffers is available at the Township building for viewing
and initial identification of riparian buffers.
A. Where prohibitive slopes (twenty five (25) percent and greater) are located within thirty five (35)
feet of a watercourse, the riparian buffer shall extend the entire distance of the sloped area.
Where wetlands and watercourses overlap, the riparian buffer standards shall also apply to the
outer perimeter of the identified wetlands.
B. Where the watercourse is part of a watershed that has been identified as High Quality (HQ) or
Exceptional Value (EV) or where a stream has been identified as impaired, the minimum width
for the riparian buffer shall be increased to fifty (50) feet.
C. The riparian buffer shall not be designated along industrial ponds, sewerage treatment
lagoons, man-made irrigation ditches, stormwater management basins and other artificial
features with similar water quality or storage facility unless deemed necessary by the
Township Engineer.
West Nottingham Township SLDO Amendments
SLDO-7 August 2012
Figure 6-5: Riparian Buffer
Source: Chester County Planning Commission, 2007.
4. Resource Protection Standards. Riparian buffers shall be preserved in their natural state whenever
possible. In no case shall the total riparian buffer width be reduced to less than thirty five (35) feet in
width in accordance with 625.3, above.
A. Permitted Uses within a Riparian Buffer. With the exception of those uses or activities listed
below, no woodland disturbance or other land disturbance shall be permitted within the Riparian
Buffer:
1) Regulated activities permitted by the Commonwealth, Army Corps of Engineers or other
Federal Agency (i.e. permitted stream or wetland crossing.)
2) Provision for unpaved trail and trail access.
3) Selective removal of hazardous or invasive alien vegetative species.
4) Vegetation management in accordance with an approved landscape plan or open space
management plan.
5) A soil conservation project approved by the Chester County Conservation District.
6) Removal of hazardous material or septic system, junk material, overhanging tree or diseased
tree.
B. Buffer Composition. A riparian buffer shall consist of a dense ground cover of grasses,
shrubbery, and trees preserved with no buildings, structures, or impervious surface. This buffer
shall not be cleared, regraded, filled, built upon, or otherwise altered; with the exception to restore
such area to its natural state or for those uses or activities listed in Section 625.4.A, above.
C. Buffer Establishment. When a subdivision or land development is proposed where there is no
established vegetated or wooded buffer (such as those areas previously cultivated for agriculture)
a thirty five (35) foot buffer shall be established and maintained in accordance with Section 625.3,
Figure 6-5, and the following guidelines:
1) Vegetation may be established through natural succession. Selective planting may be
incorporated on sites devoid of vegetation to stimulate native species and discourage
invasive plant species.
2) Planting Plans. Planting plans may be prepared jointly by a PA registered Landscape
Architect in consultation with other professionals having a practical knowledge of riparian
ecosystems (such as horticulturists, wetland specialists, wildlife biologists, ecologists) such
West Nottingham Township SLDO Amendments
SLDO-8 August 2012
as the Chester County Conservation District, PaDEP, or USDA-NRCS. All planting plans
shall include a planting schedule that summarizes the quantity, size, type, and root condition
of all plantings. All Riparian Buffer enhancements shall be installed using practices accepted
by the American Association of Nurserymen. (The applicant is encouraged to involve local
volunteer groups in the buffer planting.)
3) Preparation and Planting. The preparation and planting procedures may include, but shall not
be limited to:
a. Invasive plant removal and control.
b. Stream bank stabilization.
c. The provision of animal browse protection, such as plastic tubes for seedling trees.
d. Erosion control matting.
e. The provision of any markers or signs identifying the riparian buffer.
f. Mowing schedules for meadow grass establishment.
D. Erosion and Sedimentation Control Plan. An erosion and sedimentation control plan, consistent
with the requirements of Chapter 9, Grading and Excavating, of the West Nottingham Township
Code of Ordinances, shall be required for any land disturbance proposed within five hundred (500)
feet of any watercourse.
#15: The following shall be added as Section 626:
Section 626. Mobile Home Parks.
1. General Regulations.
A. Erection of Mobile Homes.
1) Mobile Home Pad. Every mobile home shall be erected upon a concrete pad, with proper
sub-grade, shall be placed and compacted so as to be durable and adequate for the support
of the maximum anticipated loads during all seasons, shall be used for all mobile homes, and
