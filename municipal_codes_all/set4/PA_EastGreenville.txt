§ 9-15. Procedure for filing appointments.
§ 9-16. Provisional appointments.
B. If any applicant or person believes he or she is aggrieved by refusal of
the Commission to examine or certify the applicant as eligible after
examination, the Commission shall, at the request of the applicant,
within 10 days of said request, appoint a time and place for a public
hearing, where applicant may appear with or without counsel, at which
time the Commission shall review its refusal to make such examination
or certification and take testimony as may be offered. The decision of
the Commission shall be final.
A. Except as provided in Subsection B of this section, every original
position or employment in the police force, except that of Chief of
Police, shall be filled in the following manner:
(1) Borough Council shall notify the Commission of any vacancy which
is to be filled and shall request the certification of a list of eligible
candidates.
(2) The Commission shall certify, for each existing vacancy from the
eligible list, the names of three persons, or a lessor number where
three are not available, who have received the highest average.
(3) Borough Council shall make a conditional appointment from the
three names certified, based solely on the merits and fitness of the
candidates, unless Borough Council makes objections to the
Commission regarding one or more of the certified persons for any
of the reasons provided in this chapter. Should such objections be
sustained by the Commission, the Commission shall strike the
name of such candidate from the eligible list and certify the next
highest name for each name stricken off. As each subsequent
vacancy occurs in that same or another position, precisely the same
procedure shall be followed.
B. Any vacancy in an existing position in the police force which occurs as a
result of retirement, resignation, disability or death may be filled by
Borough Council by the reappointment or reinstatement of a former
employee of the police force who had previously complied with the
provisions of this section. No examination other than a physical
examination as directed by the Commission shall be required in any
case of reappointment or reinstatement.
C. In the case of a vacancy in the office of Chief of Police or equivalent
official, Borough Council may nominate a person to the Commission. It
shall become the duty of the Commission to subject that person to a
noncompetitive examination, and if such person shall be certified by the

thereafter shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter.

§ 9-17. Physical examinations.

the supervision of a physician appointed by the Borough Council. No person
shall be eligible for appointment until that physician certifies that the
applicant is free from any bodily or mental defect, deformity or disease that
might incapacitate him for the discharge of the position desired.
§ 9-18. Promotions.
Promotions of any officer of the police force shall be based on examinations
as prescribed by the Commission. All questions relative to the promotion
shall be practical in character and shall fairly and reasonably test the
distinction and fitness of persons seeking promotion. Only the Borough
Council shall have the authority to determine in each instance whether an
increase in salary shall constitute a promotion.
§ 9-19. Removals.
A. Whenever there are urgent reasons for the filing of a vacancy in any
position in the police force and there are no names on the eligible list
for such appointment, Borough Council may nominate a person to the
Commission for noncompetitive examination, and if such nominee shall
be certified by the Commission as qualified after such noncompetitive
examination, he may be appointed provisionally to fill such vacancy.
B. Within three weeks of the provisional appointment, the Commission
shall hold a competitive examination and certify an eligible list. A
regular appointment shall then be made from the name or names
submitted by the Commission. Nothing herein shall be construed to
prevent the appointment, without examination, or persons, temporarily
as police officers in cases of riot or other emergencies.
A. No person employed in the police force of this Borough shall be
suspended, removed or reduced in rank except for the following
reasons:

All appointments to the police force, including the Chief of Police or
equivalent official, prior to the creation of the Commission and adoption
of Ord. No. 2017-05 shall continue to hold their positions and shall not
be required to take any examination under the provisions of this chapter,
except as may be required for promotion, provided that, this section shall
not be construed to apply to persons employed temporarily in emergency
cases.
§ 9-21. Prohibition.
No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened or promised by any person
against or in favor of any application or employee because of political or
religious opinions or affiliations or race, and no offer or promise or reward,
favor or benefit, directly or indirectly, shall be made to or received by any
person for any act done or duty omitted or to be done under chapter.

pursuant to Section 1191(a)9 of the Borough Code. In the event the
Commission shall sustain the charges and order the suspension or
removal or reduction in rank, the person suspended, removed or
reduced in rank shall have immediate right of appeal to the Court of

to reduce the number of paid officers of the police force, the Borough
shall furlough the person, including a probationer, last appointed to the
police force. The removal shall be accomplished by furloughing in
numerical order commencing with the person last appointed until the
reduction shall have been accomplished. In the event the police shall
again be increased, the employees furloughed shall be reinstated in the
order of their seniority in the service. This subsection as to reductions
in force shall not be applicable to a chief of police.
A. The term "police force" as used in this chapter, shall mean a police force
organized and operating as prescribed by law, the members of which

Upper Perkiomen Valley Regional Planning Commission
[Adopted 9-2-1997 by Ord. No. 97-4]
§ 12-7. Creation; membership; and terms.
East Greenville Borough shall join with the municipalities of Pennsburg
Borough, Red Hill Borough, Green Lane Borough, Upper Hanover
Township, and Marlborough Township to create the Upper Perkiomen Valley
Regional Planning Commission (Commission) as per the guidelines set forth
under Section 1102 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Code, Act 247 of
July 31, 1968, as reenacted and amended. Each participating municipality
shall appoint two members. The term of each member shall be two years;
however, initially each municipality shall appoint one member for a oneyear
term and a second member for a two-year term so that the term
of membership of the members appointed by the individual municipalities
shall be on a staggered basis. Qualification of members, the removal of
members, the conduct of business, etc., shall be governed by Article II and
Article XI of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Code.
§ 12-8. Purpose.
A. The six municipalities of the Upper Perkiomen Valley have come to
recognize that the issues associated with growth and development,
such as, but not limited to, traffic congestion, air and water pollution,
and loss of open space, are too large for any one municipality to deal
with. They further recognize that current growth and anticipated
growth, if not properly managed, will lead to the diminution of the
region's quality of life. They are concerned that current zoning
requirements which call for each and every municipality to provide for a
full range of uses, regardless of historic development patterns, is
inefficient and potentially destructive to the region's economic and
social structure.
B. To this end, the six municipalities of the Upper Perkiomen Valley hereby
embark on a course of action to implement regional planning and
regional zoning. Only through regional planning and regional zoning
can growth and development be rationally and fairly managed.
Therefore, East Greenville Borough empowers the Upper Perkiomen
Valley Regional Planning Commission to undertake the development of
a Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan that shall encompass the six
municipalities of the Upper Perkiomen Valley. Upon the successful
completion of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan, and its adoption
by all the participating municipalities, the participating municipalities
may so instruct the Regional Planning Commission to undertake the
development of a Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map.

Zoning Hearing Board. The participating municipalities agree that for all
matters relating to lot line changes, subdivisions, land developments,
variances, special exceptions and conditional uses, or any other matter of
a planning or zoning nature in which jurisdiction resides in the governing
body of a municipality, shall not be a joint planning or joint zoning activity.
§ 12-11. Officers and terms.
The officers of the Upper Perkiomen Valley Regional Planning Commission
shall consist of a Chairperson, Vice Chairperson and Secretary, all of whom
A. To prepare a Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan pursuant to Article III
and Article XI of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
B. That in the preparation of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan, the
members of the Commission shall represent the interests of their
respective municipalities and shall cast one vote per municipality on all
matters that require action.
C. Any vote taken by Commission members pertaining to regional
planning and regional zoning must be unanimous for it to pass. All other
non-planning and zoning related matters may be approved by simple
majority.
D. Upon the completion of the Joint Municipal Comprehensive Plan by the
Commission, and its adoption by all the participating municipalities, the
Commission may be instructed by the participating municipalities to
prepare a Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map which
shall be presented to the participating municipalities for their
consideration and adoption.
E. If so directed by the participating municipalities to develop a Regional
Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map, the Regional Zoning Ordinance and
Zoning Map shall be prepared pursuant to Article VI and Article VIII-A
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.
F. Should joint municipal zoning be formally adopted by the participating
municipalities, the Regional Planning Commission shall review all
proposed changes to the Joint Municipal Zoning Ordinance and Zoning
Map and shall make a formal recommendation to the participating
municipalities regarding said change. The recommendation of the
Commission shall be advisory only.

Any participating municipality may withdraw from the Regional Planning
Commission after one month's formal notice. Upon receiving notice that a
municipality wishes to withdraw from the Regional Planning Commission,
the governing bodies of the remaining municipalities shall promptly
schedule a meeting to consider whether the remaining municipalities wish
to continue with the Regional Planning Commission. Should joint municipal
zoning be enacted, notice of withdrawal shall be pursuant to the standards

Open Records Policy
[Adopted 4-25-2017 by Res. No. 2017-07]
§ 17-1. Policy.
§ 17-2. Procedure for access to public records.
§ 17-3. Response to written requests.
A. Unless otherwise provided by law, a public record shall be accessible
for inspection and duplication by a requester. A public record shall be
provided to a requester in the medium requested if the public record
exists in that medium; otherwise, it shall be provided in the medium in
which it exists. Public records shall be available for inspection and
copying at the Borough Hall during normal business hours, Monday
through Friday, normal business hours, with the exception of holidays.
B. It is the Borough's policy to require the presence of a designated
Borough employee when files are examined by a requester, and to
charge a reasonable and equitable fee for copying Borough files that
are deemed to be a public record. Such fees are set by Pennsylvania's
Office of Open Records and shall be listed in the Borough's official fee
schedule.
A. All requests for access to public records shall be submitted by the
requester, in writing, on an official request for public information form
and delivered via mail, fax, email, or in person. Requests made verbally,
nonverbally and anonymously, and not made in writing on an official
request form by a requester, will not be honored and are not eligible to
be appealed by said requester if the Borough denies the request.
Request forms are available on the Borough's website at
egreenville.org. Acceptable forms are also available at the Pennsylvania
Office of Open Records website at openrecords.state.pa.us.
B. Each request shall be addressed to the Borough's Open Records Officer.
The request form shall include the requester's contact information, the
date of the request and shall identify or describe the records sought
with sufficient specificity to enable the Borough to ascertain which
records are being requested.
C. Creation of a public record. When responding to a request for access,
the Borough shall not be required to create a public record that does
not currently exist nor shall it be required to compile, maintain, format
or organize a public record in a manner in which the Borough does not
currently compile, maintain, format or organize the public record.
D. Record of request. A file shall be maintained for RTKL requests. Such
file shall contain the original request, a copy of the response, a record
of communications with the requester and a copy of other
communications.
§ 17-1 POLICE PROTECTION, INTERLOCAL § 17-3
16:43
A. Redaction. If the Borough determines that a public record contains
information that is subject to access, as well as information that is not
subject to access, the Borough's response shall be to grant access to the
information that is subject to access, and deny access to the information
that is not subject to access. If the information that is not subject to
access is an integral part of the public record and cannot be separated.
the Borough may redact from the public record the information that is
not subject to access.
B. Borough's response to written requests for access. Upon receipt of a
written request for access to a record, the Borough shall make a good
faith effort to determine if the record requested is a public record,
whether the Borough has possession of the same and whether the
public record is otherwise exempt and/or protected pursuant to the
RTKL. The Borough shall respond as promptly as possible under the
circumstances existing at the time of the request, but shall not exceed
five business days from the date the written request is received by the
Open Records Officer unless an extension is appropriate pursuant to
the RTKL. If the Borough fails to send the response within five days of
receipt of the written request for access, the written request for access
shall be deemed denied unless an extension is otherwise established.
C. Extension of time. Upon receipt of a written request for access to a
public record, the Borough shall make a good faith effort to respond as
promptly as possible under the circumstances existing at the time of the
request. The response shall not exceed five business days from the date
of the written request. The failure of the Borough to respond in the
designated time frame shall be deemed a denial of the request unless
one of the following exceptions applies:
(1) The request requires the redaction of information within a public
record;
(2) The request requires the retrieval of the document from a remote
location;
(3) A timely response cannot be accomplished due to legitimate
staffing limitations;
(4) A legal review is necessary;
(5) Requester did not comply with the Borough's policies regarding
public access;
(6) The requester refuses to pay fees; or
(7) The extent or nature of the request precludes a response within the
required time period.
D. The Open Records Officer shall determine if a timely response to the
requested record cannot be made due to one of the above exceptions. In
the event of one or more of the above exceptions, the Borough shall

said Open Records Officer shall receive requests submitted to the Borough
under the RTKL, direct requests to other appropriate persons within the
Borough or to appropriate persons in another agency, track the Borough's
progress in responding to requests and issue interim and final responses.
The Open Records Officer shall also be charged with the responsibility of
providing Borough Council with a copy of each request that is received by
the Borough and each subsequent Borough response to each request.
§ 17-5. Severability.
In the event any provision, section, sentence, clause or part of this
resolution shall be held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect or
impair any remaining provisions, section, sentence, clause or part of this
send written notice to the requester within five business days of the
request stating the request is being reviewed, the reason for review
and the exception that applies, and a reasonable date that a response
can be expected, not to exceed 30 days from such notice. If a response
is expected more than 30 days after the five-day period, the request is
deemed denied unless otherwise agreed to by the requester in writing.
E. Denial of request. The Borough may grant a request, partially grant and
partially deny a request, or deny a request in its entirety. If the request
is denied or partially denied, the following must be included with the
denial:
(1) Description of the record requested;
(2) Specific reasons for the denial, including a citation of supporting
legal authority;
(3) Typed or printed name, title, business address, business telephone
number and signature of the Open Records Officer on whose
authority the denial was issued;
(4) Date of response; and
(5) Appeal procedure.
F. Appeal procedure. If the request is denied, partially denied or deemed
denied, the requester may file an appeal with the Office of Open
Records or judicial, legislative or other appeals officer designated
under the Pennsylvania RTKL, within 15 business days of the mailing
date of the Borough's response or deemed denial. The appeal shall
proceed in accordance with the Pennsylvania RTKL. The appeal shall
state the grounds upon which the requester asserts that the record is a
public record and shall address any grounds stated by the Borough for
denying or delaying the request.

General Provisions
§ 39-1. Title.
This Ordinance No. 3-96 shall be known and may be cited as the "East
Greenville Borough Cable Television Ordinance."
§ 39-2. Purpose.
A. The Borough of East Greenville finds that the development of cable
television and communications systems has the potential of having
great benefit and impact upon the people of East Greenville Borough.
Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated
with cable television, the borough further finds that the public
convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the borough
or such persons as the borough shall designate. It is the intent of this
chapter and subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the
means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in
these matters, and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall
be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to
the borough's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband,
interactive communications services to institutions and individuals.
C. For these purposes, the following goals underlie the regulations
contained herein:
(1) Cable communications services should be available to all borough
residents.
(2) The system should be capable of accommodating both the present
and reasonably foreseeable future communications needs of the
borough and its residents and be upgraded to correspond to
present state of the Act.
(3) The system shall be constructed and maintained during the
franchise term so that new components may be integrated to the
maximum extent possible with existing facilities.
(4) The communications system authorized by this chapter shall be
responsive to the needs and interests of the local community.

communications system or systems operated by the franchisee
or any affiliated person in the borough or elsewhere and the
franchisee's compliance with and any modifications with respect
thereto; an assessment of the need to scramble signals distributed
over the system in order to prevent theft of service (such
assessment to investigate alternatives to scrambling of signals and
include a cost/benefit analysis of both scrambling and such
alternatives that takes into account significant costs and benefits
both to the franchisee and subscribers); a discussion of additional
technological advances anticipated during the remainder of the
term of the franchise, along with a projection of the costs and
timetable for the franchisee offering such advances as part of or
over the system; a discussion of what improvements the franchisee
anticipates making in its customer service facilities, equipment,
systems and operations during the remainder of the term of the
franchise, along with a projection of the costs and timetable for
the implementation of such improvements; a description of any
technical experimentation which the franchisee or any affiliated
person anticipates undertaking during the remainder of the term
of the franchise; an assessment of the compatibility of the system
with subscribers' televisions and video cassette recorders, the
franchisee's compliance with the rules and regulations
promulgated by the FCC pursuant to Section 624A of the Cable
Act (47 U.S.C. § 544a) and any experimentation the franchisee is
making to enhance such compatibility; and, generally, the steps the
franchisee or any affiliated person is undertaking to continuously
construct, operate, maintain and upgrade the system in accordance
with the state of the art. The state-of-the-art report submitted
by a franchisee may be only one resource that the borough will
consider in evaluating the franchisee's obligation pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the ordinance to continuously construct,
operate, maintain and upgrade the system in accordance with the
state of the art, and the borough may commission third parties,
as necessary, to ascertain the current state of the art in cable
communications systems generally.
(3) Procedures for maintaining state of the art. Upon receiving the
report from a franchisee required pursuant to this section of the
ordinance, the borough will evaluate such report and assemble any
additional data necessary to ascertain whether the franchisee's
system or any aspect thereof needs to be upgraded so that it meets
the state-of-the-art requirement set forth herein.
(4) Directive. Upon completing the evaluation contemplated by this
section of the ordinance and after providing notice to a franchisee
and an opportunity for the franchisee to comment, the borough
may issue a reasonable directive to the franchisee to upgrade the
system so as to incorporate state-of-the-art features. Within 45 days
after receipt of such directive, such franchisee shall submit plans,
as specified by the borough, describing how it intends to complete
§ 39-5 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 39-5
39:86
§ 39-6. Use of public rights-of-way.
For the purpose of operating and maintaining a cable communications
system in the borough, a grantee may erect, install, construct, repair,
replace, reconstruct and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along
the public streets and ways within the borough such wires, cables,
conductors, ducts, conduits, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
pedestals, attachments and other property and equipment as are necessary
to the operation of the cable communications systems; provided, however,
that the grantee complies with all design, construction, safety and
performance provisions contained in this chapter, the franchise agreement
and other applicable laws, including but not limited to the Federal Technical
Performance Standards, National Electrical Safety Code (current edition),
and the power company and telephone company pole contract standards.
§ 39-7. Use of grantee facilities.
No poles shall be erected by a grantee without prior approval of the
borough with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent
aspect. However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested
right, and such poles shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its
own expense whenever the borough determines that the public convenience
would be enhanced thereby. The grantee shall utilize existing poles and
conduits, where possible. The borough shall have the right, during the life
of the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned
such upgrade. Upon approval of such plans by the borough, the
franchisee shall commence and diligently pursue implementation
of the required upgrade.
(5) "State-of-the-art" or "state of the art," as applicable, means that
level of technical or service performance, capacity and capability
(including but not limited to plant or other equipment; access
channel and other production equipment or facilities; construction
techniques; customer service; facilities, equipment, systems and
operations; and performance standards) which have been
developed and demonstrated in the cable industry or any other
comparable industry that provides services to the public under
similar conditions; to be workable and economically and technically
feasible and viable from time to time through the term of the
franchisee.
(6) "Economically and technically feasible and viable" means capable
of being provided through technology which has been
demonstrated in actual applications (not simply through tests or
experiments) to operate in a workable manner and in a manner
which has a reasonable likelihood of generating additional
revenues or other financial benefits for a system, when measured
over the term of the franchise.
§ 39-5 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-7
39:87
by the grantee any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere
with the operations of the grantee.
§ 39-8. Franchise required.
No cable communications system shall be allowed to occupy or use the
streets of the borough or be allowed to operate without a franchise.
§ 39-9. Term of franchise.
The term of any franchise as granted pursuant to this chapter shall be
specified in the franchise agreement in the discretion of the borough.
§ 39-10. Franchise nonexclusive.
Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The
borough specifically reserves the right to grant at any time such additional
franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate and/
or build, operate and own such cable communications system or systems as
it deems appropriate.
§ 39-11. Transfer of ownership or control.
A. Transfer of franchise. No franchise granted hereunder shall be
transferred and no control or controlling interest in any system,
franchise or franchisee shall be transferred without the prior written
consent of the borough and then only under such reasonable conditions
as the borough may establish and only if in compliance with Section 617
of the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. § 537) and regulations promulgated by the
FCC to implement Section 617.
B. The franchisee shall promptly notify the borough by written petition of
any proposed transfer. The petition shall fully describe the proposed
action and shall be accompanied by a justification for the action and, if
applicable, an argument as to why such action would not involve a
change in control or controlling interest. The borough shall notify the
franchisee as soon as all of the information required by the FCC, the
franchise agreement, this chapter and all applicable state and local law
has been received by the borough and that therefore the petition is
complete, after which the borough shall take action within 120 days
following the date such notice is provided by the borough, pursuant to
Section 617(e) of the Cable Act.
C. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer,
the borough may inquire, with the assistance of the grantee, into the
legal, financial, character, technical, customer service and operations
qualifications of the prospective controlling party and the effect that the
proposed transfer and sale price may have on rates being paid by
subscribers. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested by
the borough as part of said inquiry shall be grounds for denial of the
proposed transfer. If the borough finds the results of this inquiry are
§ 39-7 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 39-11
39:88
satisfactory, its consent to such transfer shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
D. Assumption of control. Any financial institution having a pledge of the
franchise or its assets for the advancement of money for the
construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to
notify the borough that it or its designees satisfactory to the borough
will take control and operate the cable television system. Further, said
financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will
ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations
during the term the financial institution exercises control over the
system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the
system for a period exceeding one year, unless extended by the borough
at its discretion, and during said period of time, it shall have the right to
petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the borough
finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character,
technical, customer service and operations qualifications of the
applicant are satisfactory and that the proposed transfer and sale price
will not result in a rate increase to subscribers, the borough will
transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the
public interest. The consent of the borough to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
E. The consent or approval of the borough to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the borough in
and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly
subject to the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise
agreement.
F. The borough reserves the right to review the purchase price of any
transfer or assignment of the cable television system. Any negotiated
sale value which the borough deems unreasonable will not be
considered in the rate base for any subsequent request for rate
increases, if permitted by applicable law and § 39-16 of this chapter.
G. Any approval by the borough of transfer of ownership or control shall be
contingent upon the prospective controlling party becoming a signatory
to the franchise agreement.
H. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection D above, the borough
reserves the right of first purchase in any transfer of the system. Should
the borough exercise this option, it shall do so within 30 days of
notification and thereafter shall make payment therefor under the same
terms and conditions as the proposed transferee or as the parties might
otherwise agree.
I. The transfer of any franchise or the transfer of control or controlling
interest in any system, franchise or franchisee without the prior written
consent of the borough shall be deemed to be an abandonment of the
system by the franchisee under § 39-33C of this chapter and shall
entitle the borough to all of the rights set forth under § 39-33C.
§ 39-11 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-12
39:89
§ 39-12. Franchisee fees.
§ 39-13. Revocation and acceleration of expiration date.
A. Because the borough finds that the streets of the county, state and
borough to be used by the grantee in the operation of its system within
the boundaries of the franchise area are valuable public properties
acquired and maintained by the county, state and borough at great
expense to its taxpayers; and the grant to the grantee to said streets is a
valuable property right without which the grantee would be required to
invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions; and the
administration of this chapter and the franchise imposes upon the
borough additional regulatory responsibility and expense; and the
presence of the grantee and its facilities places additional burdens upon
the Borough Police and Road Departments and the volunteer fire
company serving the area which is supported by the borough, a grantee
of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the borough a franchise fee in
an amount as designated in the franchise agreement up to the
maximum amount permitted under applicable federal, state or local
law. The present maximum franchise fee allowable is 5% of gross
annual revenues.
B. In the event that any franchise fee payment or recomputed amount is
not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement,
the grantee shall pay as additional compensation an interest charge,
computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal to the
commercial prime interest rate of the borough primary depository bank
during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
C. The franchise fee shall be payable as specified in the franchise
agreement and shall commence as of the effective date of the
agreement. The borough shall be furnished at the time of each payment
with a statement certified by the grantee's chief financial officer
reflecting the total amounts of gross revenues for the period conveyed
by the payment.
D. The borough shall have the right to inspect the grantee's income
records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts
determined to be payable under this chapter for a period of five years
from the date of payment. Audits shall be at the expense of the borough
unless the audit discloses an underpayment in any one year of 5% or
more, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the grantee.
Any additional amount due the borough as a result of the audit shall be
paid within 30 days following written notice to the grantee by the
borough, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report unless
written notice of disagreement is filed by the grantee with the borough
within such time.
A. Grounds for revocation or acceleration of expiration date. The borough
reserves the right to accelerate the expiration of the franchise term
and/or revoke any franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights
§ 39-12 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 39-13
39:90
and privileges associated with the franchise in the following
circumstances, each of which shall represent a default and breach
under the ordinance and the franchise agreement:
(1) If the grantee shall default in the performance of any of the
material obligations under this chapter or under such documents,
contracts and other terms and provisions entered into by and
between the borough and the grantee.
(2) If the grantee shall fail to provide or maintain in full force and
effect the liability and indemnification coverage or any
performance bond or security fund as required.
(3) If the grantee shall violate any lawful orders or rulings of any
regulatory body having jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this
chapter or the franchise.
(4) If the grantee practices any fraud upon the borough or any
subscriber.
(5) If it is determined that the grantee underpaid its franchise fee by
15% or more for any year.
(6) If the grantee's construction schedule is delayed later than the
schedule contained in the franchise agreement or beyond any
extended date set by the borough.
(7) If there is an occurrence of any event which may reasonably lead to
the foreclosure or other similar judicial or nonjudicial sale of all or
any material part of the system, including but not limited to any of
the following events:
(a) Default under any loan or any financing arrangement material
to the system or the obligations of the grantee under the
franchise agreement;
(b) Default under any contract material to the system or the
obligations of the grantee under the franchise agreement; or
(c) Termination of any lease or mortgage covering all or any
material part of the system.
(8) If in regards to any grantee:
(a) A grantee shall suspend or discontinue its business, shall make
an assignment for the benefit of creditors, shall fail to pay its
debts generally as they become due, shall become insolvent
(however such an insolvency may be evidenced), shall be
adjudicated insolvent, shall petition or apply to any tribunal
for, or consent to, the appointment of or taking possession by a
receiver, custodian, liquidator or trustee or similar official
pursuant to state or local laws, ordinances or regulations of or
§ 39-13 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-13
39:91
for it or any substantial part of its property or assets, including
all or any part of this system;
(b) A writ or warrant of attachment, execution, distraint, levy,
possession or any similar process shall be issued by any
tribunal against all or any material part of a grantee's property
or assets;
(c) Any creditor of a grantee petitions or applies to any tribunal for
the appointment of, or taking possession by, a trustee, receiver,
custodian, liquidator or similar official for the grantee or of any
substantial parts of the assets of the grantee under the law of
any jurisdiction, whether now or hereinafter in effect, and an
order, judgment or decree is entered appointing any such
trustee, receiver, custodian, liquidator or similar official or
approving the petition in any such proceedings; or
(d) Any order, judgment or decree is entered in any proceedings
against a grantee decreeing the voluntary or involuntary
dissolution of the grantee.
(9) If there is a failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of
total system outage in 40% or more of the system, except when
approval of such interruption is obtained from the borough or is
excused pursuant to Subsection B.
(10) If the grantee transfers the franchise or transfers control or a
controlling interest in any system, franchise or in the grantee itself
without the prior written consent of the borough pursuant to the
provisions set forth in § 39-11 of this chapter.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of grantee. Not withstanding
any other provision of this chapter or the franchise agreement, a
grantee shall not be liable for delay in performance of or failure to
perform in whole or in part its obligations pursuant to the franchise
agreement or this chapter, due to strike, war or act of war (whether an
actual declaration of war is made or not), insurrection, riot, act of
public enemy, accident, fire, flood or other act of God, sabotage or other
events, where a grantee has exercised all due care in the prevention
thereof and to the extent that such causes or other events are beyond
the control of the grantee and such causes or events are without the
fault or negligence of the grantee. In the event that any such delay in
performance or failure to perform affects only part of a company's
capacity to perform, the company shall perform to the maximum extent
that it is able to do so and shall take all steps within its power to correct
such cause or causes. In correcting such cause or causes, a grantee
shall take all reasonable steps to do so in as expeditious a manner as
possible. A grantee shall notify the borough, in writing, of the
occurrence of an event covered by this subsection within five business
days of the date upon which the grantee learns of its occurrence.
Shortage or unavailability of equipment from suppliers shall not be
§ 39-13 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 39-13
39:92
deemed to be beyond the control of the grantee in regards to any
construction delays.
C. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the
performance of its obligations under this chapter or the franchise
agreement. Failure of the grantee to perform such obligations because
of pending litigation or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation
pursuant to the provisions of this section. The borough shall comply
with any related court orders.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The borough shall make written demand that the grantee do so
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule
or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation.
After written demand is made, the borough may place its request
for revocation of the franchise upon a regular Borough Council
meeting agenda. The borough shall cause to be served upon such
grantee, at least seven days prior to the date of such Borough
Council meeting, a written notice of this intent to request such
revocation and the time and place of the meeting, notice of which
shall be published by the borough once, at least seven days before
such meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation within the
borough.
(2) The Borough Council shall hear any persons interested therein and
shall determine, in its discretion, whether or not any failure, refusal
or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as determined by the Borough Council, the Borough Council
shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and
upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
(4) If the Borough Council shall determine such failure, refusal or
neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the Borough
Council may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of the
grantee shall be revoked and the performance bond forfeited.
E. Disposition of facilities. In the event that a franchise expires, is revoked
or otherwise terminated, the borough may, in its sole discretion, do any
of the following:
(1) Order the removal of the system facilities from the borough within
a reasonable period of time as determined by the borough.
(2) Require the grantee to maintain and operate its system for a period
of up to 18 months or such further time as may be mutually agreed
upon. During any time the grantee continues to operate the system,
it shall do so pursuant to the terms of this chapter and its franchise
agreement and shall be entitled to the revenues from the system.
§ 39-13 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-13
39:93
§ 39-14. Receivership and foreclosure.
F. Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made by it and shall leave the prevailing prior to the
grantee's removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the
electrical or telephone cable wires or attachments. The borough shall
inspect and approve the condition of the public ways and public places
and cables, wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability,
indemnity, insurance and performance bond as provided herein shall
continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until
full compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
subsection, this chapter and the franchise agreement.
G. Restoration by borough; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a
failure by the grantee to complete any work required by Subsection E
or F of this section or any other work required by borough law or
ordinance within the time as may be established and to the satisfaction
of the borough, the borough may cause such work to be done and the
grantee shall reimburse the borough the cost thereof within 30 days
after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the borough may
recover such costs through the performance bond or letter of credit
provided by the grantee. The borough shall be permitted to seek legal
and equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section.
A. Termination by insolvency. The franchise granted hereunder shall, at
the option of the borough, cease and terminate 120 days after the
appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take
over and conduct the business of the grantee whether in a receivership,
reorganization, bankruptcy or similar action or proceeding unless such
receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the
expiration of said 120 days or unless:
(1) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and
provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and the
receivers or trustees within said 120 days shall have remedied all
defaults under this chapter or the franchise agreement; and
(2) Such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to
be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the
franchise agreement and the ordinance.
B. Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any
part thereof, including or excluding the franchise, the borough may
serve notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder
at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of
§ 39-13 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 39-14
39:94
§ 39-15. Notices.
All notices from grantee to the borough pursuant to this chapter and the
franchise agreement shall be to the Borough Manager or Borough Secretary
or his designee. The grantee shall maintain with the borough, throughout
the term of the franchise, an address for service of notices by mail. The
grantee shall also maintain with the borough a local office and telephone
number for the conduct of matters related to the franchise during normal
business hours. The grantee shall be required to advise the borough of such
address and telephone numbers and any changes thereof.
the grantee granted hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after
service of such notice, unless:
(1) The borough shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, in
the manner this chapter provides; and
(2) Such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the
borough to assume and be bound by all the terms and conditions of
the franchise agreement.

ARTICLE IV
Regulation of Franchise
§ 39-16. Regulatory authority.

B. The borough reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary
authority, as may at any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the
cable communications system, the franchise and the grantee. Should
applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities at any time
permit regulation not presently permitted to the borough, the borough
may without the approval of the grantee engage in any such additional

(6) Establishment of customer service standards.
B. The borough also reserves the right to perform the following functions
and all other functions allowed by law present or future:
(1) Develop objective and coordinate activities related to the operation

39:98
§ 39-19. Rates and charges.
(2) Serve as advisory body with respect to the public, educational and
local government access channels of cable television and any
institutional programming that may be developed; encourage the
use of the public channels among the widest range of institutions,
groups and individuals within the borough.
(3) Advise the borough government of objectives to be obtained in the

borough can respond to any public inquiries or complaints. If the
borough elects to regulate rates pursuant to the Cable Act, the borough
will comply with all FCC regulations and permit all members of the

included in the customer's bill. A complete schedule of the grantee's
rates shall be mailed to subscribers annually.
B. The grantee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory within the
same general class of subscribers which must be applied fairly and
uniformly to all subscribers in the franchise area for all services.
Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the grantee from offering
discounts to commercial and multiple-family dwelling subscribers billed
on a bulk basis; promotional discounts; senior citizens; and
§ 39-18 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-19
39:99
economically disadvantaged individuals. The grantee's charges and
rates for all services shall be itemized on subscriber's monthly bills.

§ 39-20. Performance bond and/or letter of credit.
A. Performance bond. Upon the effective date of the franchise, the grantee
shall obtain and maintain during the entire term of the franchise and
any extensions and renewals thereof, at its cost and expense, and file
with the borough a corporate surety bond in such sum as specified in
the franchise agreement to guarantee the faithful performance by the
grantee of all its obligations provided under this chapter and the
franchise agreement. Failure to timely obtain, file and maintain said
bond shall constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this
section.
B. Conditions. The performance bond shall provide the following
conditions:
(1) There shall be recoverable by the borough jointly and severally
from the principal and surety any and all fines and liquidated
damages due to the borough, as specified in the franchise
agreement, and any and all damages, losses, costs and expenses
suffered or incurred by the borough resulting from the failure of
the grantee to faithfully comply with the provisions of this chapter
and the franchise agreement; comply with all orders, permits and
directive of any borough agency or body having jurisdiction over its
acts or defaults; pay fees due to the borough; pay any claims, liens
or taxes due the borough which arise by reason of the construction,
operation, maintenance or repair of the cable communication
system. Such losses, costs and expenses shall include, but not be
limited to, attorney's fees and other associated expenses.
(2) The total amount of the bond shall be forfeited in favor of the
borough in the event that the borough revokes the franchise
pursuant to § 39-13 for the two following reasons:
(a) The grantee abandons the cable communication system at any
time during the term of the franchise or any extension thereto;
or
(b) The grantee assigns the franchise without the express written
consent of the borough, provided that the grantee has been
notified of such noncompliance in writing by the borough and
has failed to cure the same within 30 days.
C. Reduction of bond. Upon written application by the grantee, the
borough may, at its sole option, permit the amount of the bond to be
reduced or waive the requirements for a performance bond subject to
the conditions set forth below. Reductions granted or denied upon
application by the grantee shall be without prejudice to the grantee's
§ 39-20 CABLE TELEVISION § 39-20

subsequent applications or to the borough's right to require the full
bond at any time thereafter.
D. Letter of credit. If requested by the borough in lieu of the performance
bond required by this section, the grantee shall obtain, maintain and
file with the borough an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial
institution licensed to do business in the state in any amount specified
in the franchise agreement, naming the borough as beneficiary. The
form and contents of such letter of credit shall be approved by the
borough and shall be released only upon expiration of the franchise and
upon the replacement of the letter of credit by a successor grantee.
Failure to obtain the letter of credit within the time specified herein
shall constitute a substantial violation within the meaning of this
chapter.
E. Use of performance bond or letter of credit. Prior to drawing upon the
letter of credit or the performance bond for the purposes described in
this section, the borough shall notify the grantee in writing specifying
the item for which payment is claimed and the date it was due. The
grantee shall have 10 days from the receipt of such written notice to
make a full and complete payment. If the grantee does not make the
payment, the borough may withdraw the amount thereof, with interest
and penalties, from the letter of credit or the performance bond.
F. Notification. Within three days of a withdrawal from the letter of credit
or performance bond, the borough shall send to the grantee, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the
amount, date and purpose of such withdrawal.
G. Replenishment of letter of credit or performance bond. No later than 30
days after mailing to the grantee by certified mail notification of a
withdrawal pursuant to Subsection F above, the grantee shall replenish
the letter of credit or performance bond in an amount equal to the
amount so withdrawn. Failure to make timely replenishment of such
amount to the letter of credit or performance bond shall constitute a
substantial violation of this chapter.
H. Nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation of letter of credit or
performance bond. The performance bond or letter of credit required
herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the borough and shall require
30 days' written notice of any nonrenewal, alteration or cancellation to
both the borough and the grantee. The grantee shall, in the event of any
such cancellation notice, obtain, pay all premiums for and file with the
borough written evidence of the issuance of replacement bond or letter
of credit within 30 days following receipt by the borough or the grantee
of any notice of cancellation.
I. To offset the effects of inflation, the amounts of the bond or letter of
credit provided for herein are subject to reasonable increases at the
end of every three-year period of the franchise, applicable to the next
three-year period, upon the determination of the borough.

deposit with the grantor at the expiration of the term of this franchise,
provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the
grantee.
D. The rights reserved to the grantor with respect to the security funds are
in addition to all other rights of the grantor, whether reserved by this

thereafter continuously through the duration of the franchise and any
extensions or renewals thereof, the grantee shall furnish to the borough
certificates of insurance, approved by the borough, for all types of

inappropriate to deny it a franchise under Subsection C(3)(b)
or (e), by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding

applicant's principals or the remoteness of the matter from the
operation of cable television systems.
(4) A statement prepared by a certified public accountant regarding

the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable
franchise for the borough.

like, has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the
communities served.

qualifications to provide cable service.

cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into
account the cost of meeting such needs and interests.
(5) Whether, to the extent not considered as part of Subsection C(4),
the applicant will provide adequate public, educational and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial
support.
(6) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest
considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-ofway
and private property which would be used by the cable system,
including the extent to which installation or maintenance as
planned would require replacement of property or involve
disruption of property, public services or use of the public rights-ofway;
the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of cable to
meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community.
(7) Whether the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant owns or
controls any other cable system in the borough or whether grant of
the application may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery
of cable service in the borough.
E. If the borough finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise
considering the factors set forth above, it shall issue a franchise,
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise
agreement. If the borough denies a franchise, it will issue a written
decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding
whether to issue or not to issue a franchise, the borough may hold one
or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which
contends from the public on an applicant's proposal may be received.
The borough also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on
its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject
any application which is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This
chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any

extended for good cause by the borough. If agreement is not reached
with the borough within 30 calendar days from the date of the borough
resolution granting the franchise or if the period is not extended by the

or electric utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation,
the grantee may install its service above ground, provided that at such
time as both those facilities are required to be placed underground by
the borough or are placed underground, the grantee shall likewise
place its services underground. Where not otherwise required to be
placed underground by this chapter or the franchise agreement, the
grantee's system shall be located underground at the request of a
property owner, provided that the excess cost over the aerial location

restoration shall be undertaken within no more than 10 business days
after the damage is incurred and shall be completed within 30 business
days unless otherwise authorized by the borough.
E. Relocation of the facilities. In the event that, at any time during the
period of the franchise, the borough, county or state shall lawfully elect
to alter or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways or

conflict with existing borough ordinances, to trim any trees upon or
overhanging the public right-of-way so as to prevent the branches of
such trees from coming in contact with system facilities, except that at
the option of the borough, such trimming as may be required by the
grantee may be done by the borough or under its supervision and

borough prior to trimming any trees in the right-of-way.

be determined by the Borough Manager or Borough Secretary or his
designee and may be modified at his discretion.
B. Such written progress reports shall be submitted to the borough on a
monthly basis throughout the entire initial construction or rebuild
process. The Borough Manager or Borough Secretary or his designee
may require more frequent reporting if he determines it is necessary to
better monitor the grantee's progress.

General Provisions
§ 81-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of East
Greenville MS4 Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 81-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 81-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 81-2 of this chapter, through provisions designed
to:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the
carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the
cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines
floodplain management and flood-control efforts in downstream
communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health
and safety, and increases nonpoint source pollution of water resources.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, and
welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth, their
resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.
§ 81-1 (RESERVED) § 81-3
80:205
§ 81-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is also empowered to regulate land use activities that
affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247,
the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.40
§ 81-5. Applicability.
All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff,
including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to
regulation by this chapter.
§ 81-6. Repealer.
Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of the municipality
inconsistent with any of the provisions of this chapter is hereby repealed to
the extent of the inconsistency only.
§ 81-7. Severability.
In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or
provision of this chapter invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this chapter.
§ 81-8. Compatibility with other requirements.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation, or ordinance.
§ 81-9. Erroneous permit.
Any permit or authorization issued or approved based on false, misleading
or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the
necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use
established pursuant to such permit or other authorization is unlawful. No
D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Maintain groundwater recharge to prevent degradation of surface
water and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.
G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all SWM BMPs that are
implemented within the municipality.

§ 81-10. Interpretation.
For the purposes of this chapter, certain terms and words used herein shall
be interpreted as follows:
§ 81-11. Terms defined.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  Activities associated with agriculture such
as agricultural cultivation, agricultural operation, and animal heavy-use
areas. This includes the work of producing crops, including tillage, land
clearing, plowing, disking, harrowing, planting, harvesting crops, or the
pasturing and raising of livestock and installation of conservation measures.
Construction of new buildings or impervious area is not considered an

BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE (BMP)  Activities, facilities, designs,
measures, or procedures used to manage stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, to meet state water quality requirements, to promote
groundwater recharge, and to otherwise meet the purposes of this chapter.
Stormwater BMPs are commonly grouped into one of two board categories
or measures: "structural" or "nonstructural." In this chapter, nonstructural
BMPs or measures refer to operational and/or behavior-related practices
that attempt to minimize the contact of pollutants with stormwater runoff,
whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riprarian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
A. Words used in the present tense include the future tense; the singular
number includes the plural, and the plural number includes the
singular; words of masculine gender include feminine gender, and
words of feminine gender include masculine gender.
B. The word "includes" or "including" shall not limit the term to the
specific example but is intended to extend its meaning to all other
instances of like kind and character.

Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated activity areas equal
to or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design
the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no preference for either
methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the
basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability
of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other
factors.
M. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the BMP Manual
[NOTE: See the reference in § 81-36A.].
A. Regulated activities that result in cumulative earth disturbances less
than one acre maximum are exempt from the requirements in § 81-14,
§ 81-15 and Article IV of this chapter.
B. Agricultural activity is exempt from the SWM site plan preparation
requirements of this chapter, provided that the activities are performed
according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
C. Forest management and timber operations are exempt from the SWM
site plan preparation requirements of this chapter, provided that the
activities are performed according to the requirements of 25 Pa. Code
102.
D. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 81-12D through K.
E. The municipality may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the municipality believes may
pose a threat to public health and safety or the environment.
A. The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual [NOTE: See the
reference in § 81-36A.]) is applicable to any size of regulated activity.
This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
(1) Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all
storms equal to or less than the two-year twenty-four-hour-duration
precipitation.
(2) For modeling purposes:
(a) Existing (pre-development) nonforested pervious areas must
be considered meadow in good condition.
§ 81-12 (RESERVED) § 81-14
80:217
§ 81-15. Rate controls.
(b) Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when present,
shall be considered meadow in good condition in the model for
existing conditions.
B. The Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual [NOTE: See the
reference in § 81-36A.]) provided below is independent of site
conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not
followed. This method is not applicable to regulated activities greater
than one acre or for projects that require design of stormwater storage
facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two inches of
runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
(2) At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious surfaces
shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, that is, it shall
not be released into the surface waters of this commonwealth.
Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and
infiltration.
(3) Wherever possible, infiltration facilities should be designed to
accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed
runoff; however, in all cases at least the first 0.5 inch of the
permanently removed runoff should be infiltrated.
(4) This method is exempt from the requirements of § 81-15, Rate
controls.
A. Areas not covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
stormwater management plan: Post-development discharge rates shall
not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the one-, two-, five-,
ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour storms.
If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge identified by the postdevelopment
analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of
discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for one-, two-, five-
, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty- and one-hundred-year, twenty-four-hour
storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.
Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary
to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.
B. Areas covered by a release rate map from an approved Act 167
Stormwater Management Plan: For the one-, two-, five-, ten-, twentyfive-,
fifty- and one-hundred-year storms, the post-development peak
discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps.
For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the postdevelopment
discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment
discharge rates.

upon which the floodplain management provisions of this and other
ordinances have been prepared. For the purposes of this chapter, it
shall be the one-hundred-year-flood as referenced in the current Flood
Insurance Study and delineated on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the
Federal Insurance Administration.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION  The one-hundred-year-flood elevation as
referenced in the Flood Insurance Study. Within the approximated
floodplain alluvial soils floodplain or other similarly documented areas,
the one-hundred-year-flood elevation shall be established as a point

§ 85-7 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-8
85:253
on the boundary of the floodplain nearest to the construction site in
question.
FEMA AND FIA  The Federal Emergency Management Agency and
the Federal Insurance Administration, respectively, who have
jurisdiction over the National Flood Insurance Program and its related
studies and regulations. FEMA is the parent agency of the FIA.
FLOOD  A temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP  The official FIA map which shows
special hazard zones and risk areas for insurance rating purposes. For
the purposes of this chapter, it also delineates floodplain areas.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY  The examination and determination of
flood hazards by the FIA. The flood elevations contained in this study
are used for floodplain management purposes as related to this chapter
and other ordinances.
FLOODPLAIN  A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a stream,
river or watercourse, which is subject to partial or complete inundation
during a one-hundred-year flood, or any area subject to the unusual and
rapid accumulation of surface water from any source; also referred to
as "flood-prone area."
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT  The application of a program or
activities which may consist of both corrective and preventive measures
for reducing flood damages.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water
and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. Such measures
are set forth in Flood Proofing Regulations, published by the Office
of the Chief Engineers, United States Army, publication number EP
1165 2 314 (June 1972, and as subsequently amended). Floodproofing
measures for all new construction and substantial improvements of
structures shall satisfy the requirements of the Completely Dry Spaces
(W1) and Essentially Dry Spaces (W2) classes referenced in these

85:254
of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or
repair is started or, if the structure has been damaged and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this
definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include either
any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of
a structure listed on a National Register of Historic Places or a State
Inventory of Historic Places.

ARTICLE III
Plan Submission Requirements; Processing Procedures
§ 85-9. Applicability.
The standards, requirements and procedures contained in this article shall
govern the submission and processing of all applications for subdivisions
and/or land developments in the borough, as defined in this chapter, which
applications shall be subject to review by the Borough Council and Borough
Planning Commission, as defined in Article II herein.
§ 85-10. Types of plans.
All applications for subdivision and/or land development shall be classified
as tentative sketch plans, preliminary plans, final plans or minor plans, as
further regulated herein.
§ 85-11. Tentative sketch plan submission requirements.
A. Tentative sketch plans.
(1) Optional. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit tentative
sketch plans for any subdivision or land development proposal, in
accordance with the requirements of § 85-11, Tentative sketch plan
submission requirements, and § 85-12, Tentative sketch plan
submission and review procedure.
(2) Required. Applicants are required to submit tentative sketch plans
as a part of the preliminary plan submission where only a portion of
a property is proposed as a currently active proposal. The tentative
sketch plan shall show how the immediate proposal can fit logically
into an overall plan for the entire site.
B. Preliminary plans. A preliminary plan is required to be submitted for all
proposals for subdivision and/or land development, except for those
which qualify as minor plans, in accordance with the requirements of
§ 85-13, Preliminary plan submission requirements, and § 85-14,
Preliminary plan submission and review procedure.
C. Final plans. A final plan is required to be submitted for all proposals for
subdivision and/or land development, except for those which qualify as
minor plans, in accordance with the requirements of § 85-15, Final plan
submission requirements, and § 85-16, Final plan submission and
review procedure.
D. Minor plans. Applications which qualify as minor plans may be
submitted for concurrent preliminary and final plan processing and
approval, in accordance with the standards and requirements of
§ 85-18, Minor plan submission requirements and review procedure.
A. Purposes. The purposes served by a tentative sketch plan are as
follows:
§ 85-9 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-11
85:261
(1) To inform the borough of an applicant's intent to subdivide and/or
develop a property and graphically show the concepts and extent of
the proposal.
(2) For the borough to provide advice and guidance to an applicant so
that:
(a) Major issues can be resolved prior to preparation of
preliminary plans.
(b) The preliminary plan approval process may then be able to
proceed faster and more efficiently.
(3) To show how a tract of land may be further subdivided or developed
in cases where only a portion of a property is currently under an
active proposal.
(a) This plan shall show a logical and efficient pattern of roads,
lots and/or buildings, as appropriate for the type of plan
proposed, and shall not be acceptable if it proposes lotting or
development which is obviously impractical or questionable for
reasons of floodplains, steep slopes, relationships to other
properties or other site planning constraints.
(b) This plan shall be shown on the preliminary plan for the subject
site in the form of a reduced-scale inset drawing, although
larger scale drawings are encouraged for review and
discussion purposes.
(c) This plan shall have no legal standing with regard to future
plan approvals but shall be considered as a guide for future
development.
B. It is to the applicant's advantage to show as much of the requested
information as possible. Although the Borough Planning Commission
will discuss any plan presented, a lack of significant information may
result in little useful guidance to the applicant.
C. Tentative sketch plan information. A tentative sketch plan should be
drawn legibly and to scale, but it need not be a precisely surveyed or
engineered plan, and it should show the following information:
(1) The entire tract boundary and total acreage.
(2) Existing and proposed streets, lots and buildings.
(3) Approximate building envelopes.
(4) Significant physical features such as floodplains, steep slopes,
woodlands and existing structures.

§ 85-12. Tentative sketch plan submission and review procedure.
This review procedure is intended to facilitate a cooperative effort between
the borough and the applicant to resolve significant subdivision and/or land
development issues prior to the preparation of preliminary plans.
(7) Location plan showing the relationship of the subject tract to the
surrounding road network and major physical features.
(8) The North point and scale.
(9) The name and address of the owner.
(10) The name and address of the engineer, surveyor or architect, as
applicable.
(11) Any additional information which the applicant believes will help
explain the proposal.
A. The applicant shall make a request to the Borough Code Enforcement
Officer at least seven days prior to next regularly scheduled meeting to
be scheduled on the meeting agenda of the Borough Planning
Commission for an informal discussion of the tentative sketch plan.
B. The applicant or his representatives shall appear as scheduled at the
meeting to explain the plan and to discuss the issues identified by the
Planning Commission. The applicant should be prepared to discuss
significant issues including, but not limited to:
(1) The land use proposed (i.e., residential, commercial, industrial).
(2) The density or intensity of proposal.
(3) Access to the subject site:
(a) Intersection locations.
(b) Road realignments.
(4) Site plan design:
(a) Lotting.
(b) Roads.
(c) Buildings.

§ 85-13. Preliminary plan submission requirements.
This section contains the requirements for preliminary plans for
subdivisions and/or land developments in terms of drafting standards, basic
information, existing features and proposed features and is written in a
checklist format.
(1) Recommendations regarding noncompliance with borough
ordinance requirements and/or planning policies must be
implemented by the applicant in the form of plan revisions.
(2) Recommendations and suggestions in the form of preferences or
alternatives should be seriously evaluated by the applicant prior to
further plan processing.
D. If a proposal is large or complex, the Borough Planning Commission
may defer completing its comments and recommendations until it has
consulted its technical advisers. However, the Planning Commission
will try to expedite this informal review process.
E. Applicants may present alternative tentative sketch plans at one
meeting or may present alternatives at subsequent meetings, provided
that appropriate agenda time has been scheduled in advance.
F. When the borough and applicant have resolved the major concepts
involved in the proposal, the applicant should proceed to preliminary
plan submission.

plan submission purposes. It does not signify compliance with any
other requirement of this chapter.
(2) "X" means the required item has been omitted or is incorrectly or
inadequately represented on the plan. These items must be added
to the plan in order to qualify the plan for submission.
(3) "NA" means the required item is not applicable to the subject plan
and need not be shown. This response is intended for features
which are not found on the subject site, not proposed as part of the
improvements or which specify more detail than is necessary for
review of the plan. The governing body shall have final authority to
determine whether or not the NA response is appropriate in any
particular case.

procedure.
Minor plans may be submitted and processed only for lot line adjustments,
simple conveyances and minor subdivision, as characterized herein, in
accordance with the standards and requirements in this section.
A. Characteristics.
(1) Lot line adjustment.
(a) A lot line adjustment is a proposal between two abutting,
existing, legally approved and recorded lots.
(b) A common lot line is proposed to be adjusted in terms of its
location or configuration.
(c) The land area of each lot may be different after adjustment, but
the total lot area of the two lots will be unchanged.
(d) No alteration will occur to the perimeter boundary lines.
(e) Neither lot will violate the applicable dimensional
requirements of Chapter 95, Zoning, as a result of the lot line
adjustment.
(f) Possible reasons for lot line adjustments include, but are not
necessarily limited to:
[1] To correct errors regarding locations of existing
improvements (e.g., if the driveway for Lot No. 1 is located
on Lot No. 2).
[2] To relate the line to definitive physical characteristics
(e.g., to adjust the line to run along an existing hedgerow).
[3] Preferences of the landowners involved.
(2) Simple conveyance.
(a) A simple conveyance is a proposal between two abutting,
existing, legally approved and recorded lots.
(b) A portion of one lot is being divided off to be conveyed to the

in terms of the applicable dimensional requirements of
Chapter 95, Zoning, so that after conveyance it will remain in
compliance with those requirements.
§ 85-18 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-18
85:281
(e) The land area being conveyed need not satisfy any of the
dimensional requirements applicable to lotting in the district in
which it is located, nor the street frontage requirements of
Chapter 95, Zoning, provided that:
[1] It is combined in common deed with the abutting lot to
which it is being added; or
[2] If not combined in common deed, it shall be deed
restricted to the extent that it may not be transferred
independently, but must be transferred together with the
lot to which it is being functionally added by the process of
simple conveyance.
(3) Minor subdivision.
(a) A minor subdivision is a subdivision proposal which would
divide one existing lot into two lots, both of which will comply
with the applicable dimensional requirements of the zoning
district in which the existing lot is located.
(b) The existing lot has sufficient frontage on an existing,
improved public street to satisfy the applicable borough
requirements for lot frontage and/or access to a public street
for both proposed lots.
(c) The existing lot has not been a part of an approved subdivision
proposal during the five years previous to the current
application.
(d) The subdivision will not require new road construction, road
improvements or the extension of existing utility lines.
(e) The proposal will not involve significant stormwater and/or
erosion control issues, as determined by the Borough Engineer.

§ 85-19 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-21
85:287
§ 85-21. Requirements for new and existing streets.
All new streets and extensions and widenings of existing streets shall:
§ 85-22. Street classifications and requirements; street names.
A. Be offered for dedication to the authority having jurisdiction over the
street at the time of plan approval. The borough may accept dedication
of lands which are not accepted by other jurisdictions.
B. Conform to the circulation element of the Borough Comprehensive
Plan, as amended, the Borough Ultimate Right-of-Way Map and county
or state highway plans and be coordinated with existing streets.
C. Provide appropriate access between abutting tracts of land for
immediate or future use.
D. Create a road hierarchy among interior subdivision and land
development streets and exterior streets to ensure proper throughtraffic
flow, local access and internal traffic distribution and flow.
E. Be related closely to existing topography to assure reasonable grades,
alignment and drainage and appropriate access to lots and to minimize
regrading and removing of vegetation.
F. Be designed to continue existing streets at equal or greater right-of-way
and cartway width, as recommended by the Borough Engineer and
Planning Commission.
A. Every street within the borough shall be classified by its function as one
of the following and shall comply with the requirements for its
classification as contained herein.
(1) Principal arterial streets are the major traffic routes which carry
the highest volumes of traffic on an intercommunity, regional or
higher level. Route 29 (Main Street) is the only principal arterial
street in the borough.
(a) Minimum right-of-way: 70 feet.
(b) Minimum cartway width: 40 feet.
(c) Construction requirements: Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation (PADOT) standards. (See § 85-45.)
(2) Collector streets are those which collect, carry and feed medium
volumes of traffic and connect areas within and adjacent to the
borough. Fourth Street, Sixth Street, State Street, Third Street and
Washington Street are collector streets.
(a) Minimum right-of-way: 60 feet.
(b) Minimum cartway width: 40 feet.
§ 85-21 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-22
85:288
§ 85-23. Street alignment.
Sight distance, horizontal and vertical curvature, superelevation and
maximum and minimum street grades shall be determined by the Borough
Engineer in compliance with the standards contained in A Policy on
Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, published by the American
Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), most
recent edition, or PADOT standards and guidelines shall be complied with.
(c) Construction requirements: PADOT standards. (See § 85-45.)
(3) Local access streets are the minor streets which carry the lowest
volumes of traffic and serve primarily to provide vehicular access
and parking for adjacent land uses. All borough streets that are not
principal arterial or collector are local access streets.
(a) Minimum right-of-way: 50 feet.
(b) Minimum cartway width: 30 feet.
(c) Construction requirements: PADOT standards. (See § 85-45.)
B. All street names shall be subject to the approval of Borough Council.
A. Horizontal curvature for all local access streets shall be not less than
150 feet radius, measured along the street center line.
B. Long-radius, gentle curves are encouraged rather than shorter radius
curves connected by tangents.
C. Curve-tangent relationships shall follow accepted engineering
guidelines for safety and efficiency. For example, minimum-radius
curves shall not be used at the ends of long tangents.
D. Street grades shall be measured along the center line in accordance
with the following:
(1) Minimum for all streets shall be 1%.
(2) Maximum grades for local access streets shall be 10% for distances
less than 1,500 feet.
(3) Street grades in excess of 5% should be avoided wherever possible.
(4) Curve-grade combinations shall follow accepted engineering
guidelines for safety and efficiency. For example, minimum-radius
horizontal curves will not be permitted in combination with
maximum grades.
(5) At all approaches to intersections, street grades shall not exceed
4% for a minimum distance of 50 feet.
§ 85-22 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-24
85:289
§ 85-24. Street intersection design.
All street intersections shall be governed by the standards of this section.
A. Number of streets. Not more than two streets shall intersect at the
same point.
B. Three-way/four-way intersections. Three-way or T intersections should
be used instead of four-way intersections unless the four-way
intersection can be justified in terms of necessary and desirable traffic
movements.
C. Angle of intersections.
(1) All intersection approaches shall be designed at right angles unless
sufficient reason exists to justify a lesser angle. However, no angle
shall be less than 75° for intersections with principal arterial or
secondary streets or 60° for intersections between local access
streets, measured at the center-line intersections.
(2) Where angled intersections are used, it is preferable to design
them so that the heavier traffic flow will make the obliquely angled
turn rather than the acutely angled turn.
D. Corrective changes to existing intersections. When existing streets
intersect at odd angles or have more than four approaches, the
applicant shall contribute to corrective changes to bring the
intersections into compliance with this chapter, as required by the
Borough Council, who shall first seek the advice of the Borough
Engineer and Planning Commission and other technical advisers or
agencies, as appropriate. For state and county highways, corrective
changes shall comply with the requirements of the appropriate agency.
The extent of contribution shall depend on the proposal's use of the
intersection.
E. Waiver of corrective changes. The Borough Council may waive the
above requirements for corrective changes under one or more of the
following conditions:
(1) When changes made on the applicant's land will not improve the
intersection's deficiencies.
(2) When other road improvements are already planned which would
correct the problem without changes required of the applicant.
(3) When not required by PADOT on state roads.
F. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, culde-
sac streets are prohibited unless designed for future extension
to access adjoining properties.
§ 85-24 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-24
85:290
§ 85-25. Street intersection spacing.
Street intersection spacing shall be done in compliance with the regulations
contained in this section, measured from center line to center line.
§ 85-26. Single-access street regulations.
(2) Any temporarily dead-ended street shall be provided with an allweather
turnaround within the subdivision or land development,
and the use of such turnaround shall be guaranteed to the public
until such time as the street is extended.
(3) Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the
turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to the tract
boundary with sufficient additional width provided along the
boundary line to permit extension of the street at full width.
G. Approaches to intersections. Approaches to intersections shall follow a
straight course for a minimum of 50 feet for local access streets. All
other streets shall follow a straight course in accordance with accepted
engineering standards, but in no case less than 50 feet.
A. The spacings listed in this section shall be considered minimum
spacings. Where greater spacing is required in compliance with
AASHTO or PADOT standards, the greater spacing distances shall be
applied, as determined by the Borough Engineer.
B. Principal arterial streets.
(1) The following intersection spacings shall apply wherever
practicable, whether on the same or opposite sides of the street:
(a) Principal arterial streets: 400 feet.
(b) Collector streets: 400 feet.
(c) Local access streets: 300 feet.
(2) For intersections that would have to be spaced a lesser distance
apart, first preference should be given to locating the streets
opposite one another as a four-way intersection; otherwise the best
solution should be sought in terms of accepted traffic safety
standards.
C. Offset intersections. In any case where the center lines of street
intersections are or would be within 150 feet of each other, they shall be
made to coincide by relocating the street within the applicant's land,
unless additional problems of sight distance or other safety-related
problems would be created. As an alternative, relocation further away
from the offset intersection may be done in compliance with the
intersection spacing requirements contained herein, when approved by
the Borough Council.
§ 85-24 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-26
85:291
A. Any street which is served by only one intersection with a through
street shall be considered a single-access street, regardless of the
street's configuration within the proposed subdivision or land
development. Included in this classification of streets are:

beyond the width of the street's cartway.
(b) Installation of new sidewalk, curbing and cartway paving to
complete the street connection.
(c) Extension of utilities as necessary.
(d) Repair of any improvements damaged in this process.
(3) Temporary cul-de-sac streets shall be built to the standards for the
classification of streets they will have when extended.
D. Single-access loop streets:

A. Clear-sight triangles shall be measured along street and driveway
center lines from their point of intersection.
B. Where differing classifications of streets intersect, the higher
classification of street shall determine the dimensions used.
C. For driveways, the dimensions used shall be determined by the
classification of street being intersected.
D. The clear sight triangle legs shall each measure as follows:
(1) Principal arterial streets: 125 feet.
(2) Collector streets: 100 feet.
§ 85-26 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-27
85:293

(3) Local access streets: 75 feet.
E. Obstructions to visibility.
(1) Within the area of clear-sight triangles, obstructions to visibility
shall not be permitted within the following ranges of height:
(a) For all streets, between 2 1/2 feet and 12 feet above the edge
of paving.
(2) Any plant materials placed within clear-sight triangles shall be
properly maintained to continually comply with the height
restrictions herein. If not properly maintained, the borough
reserves the right to trim or remove the plant materials, upon due
notice to the property owner.
(3) Exceptions may be made by the Borough Council to permit the
following items in a clear-sight triangle:
(a) One private sign or lamp post, provided that the post does not
exceed one foot square or diameter and that the sign or lamp

§ 85-27 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-28
85:294
§ 85-29. Driveway intersections with streets.
Driveway intersections with streets shall be subject to the PADOT permit
process for state roads, the borough's permit process for borough roads and
the additional requirements of this chapter.
(3) For all proposals whose driveways would generate 25 or more
vehicular trips per day, based on I.T.E. trip generation standards.
B. The Borough Planning Commission shall review the proposal in
accordance with the procedures of Article III of this chapter.
C. Following evaluation by the Borough Planning Commission, the
applicant may submit plans to the state or borough for formal review
and, as appropriate, approval and issuance of permits.
D. No driveway location, classification or design shall be considered finally
approved by the borough unless permits have been granted by the state
and/or borough and preliminary plan approval has been granted by the
Borough Council for the subdivision and/or land development which the
driveway(s) will serve.
A. Driveway intersections with streets:
(1) Shall provide adequate sight distance in compliance with AASHTO
or PADOT standards.
(2) Shall not cause or contribute to:
(a) Hazards to the free movement of normal street traffic.
(b) Traffic congestion on the street.
(c) Interference with the design, maintenance and/or drainage of
the street.
(3) Shall be designed and constructed in compliance with PADOT
standards when intersecting a state street.
(4) Shall be designed and constructed in compliance with the
borough's engineering standards when intersecting a borough
street.
B. In order to facilitate safe and efficient access between streets and
driveways, the number of driveways permitted to serve individual
parcels of land shall be kept to the minimum needed to adequately
serve the parcel in question.
(1) Properties with frontages of 100 feet or less may be permitted not
more than one driveway intersection with a street.
(2) Not more than two driveway intersections with the same street may
be permitted for any parcel of land unless anticipated traffic
§ 85-28 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-29
85:295
volumes warrant more than two, and then only when supported by
a traffic study prepared by a qualified engineer.
C. Driveway intersections serving individual parcels of land may be
prohibited by the Borough Council where such intersections would
create congestion, interference and/or hazards to traffic flow and safety
by reason of street grades, land forms, vegetation, frequency of
driveway intersections, limited sight distances and/or high speed traffic
flow. In such cases, the Borough Council may permit reasonable
alternative forms of vehicular access to the parcel of land by means of:
(1) Marginal access streets or driveways.
(2) Shared driveways.
(3) Reverse frontage lotting.
(4) Other means which are legally and technically suitable in the
opinions of the Borough Solicitor and Engineer.
D. Where driveway intersections are prohibited by the Borough Council
and alternative forms of vehicular access would cause an undue burden
upon an applicant, the Borough Council may permit an alternative
interim access solution in compliance with the following:
(1) It is the safest feasible alternative, acceptable to the Borough
Engineer and/or PADOT.
(2) Suitable provisions are made for a preferable permanent access
solution, consistent with Subsection C above, including legal
agreements to enable implementation of the permanent solution.

(2) Multifamily residential and nonresidential: 100 feet.
F. Choice of streets. When streets of different classes are involved, the
driveway shall provide access to the street of lesser classification unless
this requirement is waived by the Borough Council for reasons of sight
distance, incompatibility of traffic, grading, drainage or other major
reasons.
G. Stopping areas. Regardless of the driveway classification, all driveways
shall be provided with a stopping area within which the grade shall not
exceed 6%. The stopping area shall be measured as follows:
(1) The length of stopping area shall be a minimum of 20 feet or the
length of the longest vehicles anticipated to use the driveway,
whichever is greater.
§ 85-29 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-29
85:296
§ 85-30. Sidewalks, curbs and storm sewers.
Sidewalks, curbs and storm sewers shall be installed along all proposed
streets, common driveways and common parking areas except when this
requirement is waived at the discretion of the Borough Council upon
recommendation of the Borough Planning Commission and Engineer.
Engineering design and construction standards shall be those contained in
the borough's engineering standards.
(2) Stopping areas shall be measured from the ultimate right-of-way
line for principal arterial and collector streets and from the edge of

driveways intersect streets, in compliance with the standards of
§ 85-27, Clear-sight triangles.
A. The Borough Council may waive the sidewalk requirement under one or
more of the following conditions:
(1) Where proposed residential lot widths will be 125 feet or greater.
(2) There is clearly no destination to be reached by pedestrians (e.g.,
shopping center, bus stop, employment, schools) or none
anticipated in the foreseeable future.
(3) The sidewalk(s) would not be an extension of an existing network
which provides neighborhood or village circulation.
(4) An alternative pedestrian circulation concept can be shown to be
more desirable, especially when using open space areas, provided
that appropriate walks are provided between the open space
walkways and the pedestrian origins and destinations.
(5) The character, density of the area and/or small size of the proposal
preclude the purposeful use of sidewalks.
B. The Borough Council may waive the curb and/or storm sewer
requirement under one or more of the following conditions:
(1) The curbs and storm sewer would not be an extension of existing
curbs and storm sewers.
(2) When an alternative system of protecting the pavement edge and
collecting and handling stormwater can be shown to be equal or
superior to the use of curbs and storm sewers.
(3) When topographic conditions and/or low intensity of development
do not require their use.
C. Regardless of the small size of a land development or subdivision
proposal, sidewalks, curbs and storm sewers shall be required
wherever they fill a gap in an existing network.

Borough Council may require additional width in commercial,
industrial, office or higher density residential areas where higher
volumes of pedestrian traffic are anticipated.
F. The edge of sidewalks shall be located six inches from the right-of-way
line, toward the street, with the sidewalk extending toward the streets.
G. Sidewalks shall be provided in appropriate locations to provide safe and
efficient pedestrian access between parking areas and buildings.
H. Additional sidewalks shall be required, where deemed necessary by the
Borough Council, to provide access to schools, churches, parks,
community facilities and commercial or employment centers and to
provide necessary pedestrian circulation within land development and/
or subdivisions where otherwise required sidewalks would not be
sufficient for public safety and convenience. Such additional sidewalks
may be constructed of alternative materials, in compliance with the
borough's engineering standards.
I. Sidewalks shall be designed to facilitate access and use by the
handicapped, in compliance with the borough's engineering standards.

§ 85-33. Parking space and lot dimensions.
Parking spaces shall be a minimum of 10 feet by 20 feet, except that where
vehicles may overhang a planting strip, a three-foot widening of the planting
strip shall permit a three-foot reduction of parking space length to 17 feet.
Parking lot dimensions shall be as shown in Figure 2 herein.59
§ 85-34. Rear lotting.
Rear lots, as defined herein, may be permitted by the Borough Council, in
accordance with the following standards and criteria.
G. One-way driveways and/or parking at less than right angles may be
permitted only when:
(1) Right-angled parking and two-way driveways are not feasible
because of site characteristics; or
(2) Proven by the applicant to be superior for the particular
development proposal.
H. Wherever feasible, internal circulation driveways shall extend from
access drives in locations which permit and encourage entering traffic
to turn and enter the parking aisles without first traveling along a
building-front driveway. This feature is intended to reduce the volume
of vehicular traffic along the building-front driveway to make it safer for
pedestrian traffic. Refer to Figure 1 for an illustration of this concept.58
A. Purposes of rear lotting. The purposes of rear lotting shall be to:
(1) Permit reasonable subdivision of land which is physically
constrained by unusual configuration of the tract or limited road
frontage and which could not be subdivided in a desirable manner
using conventional streets and lotting patterns.
(2) Permit an alternative to the use of local access streets where such
streets cannot be justified in terms of the number of lots served,
volumes of traffic generated and/or the need to extend, supplement
or otherwise support or reinforce an established road pattern or
traffic circulation plan for the area surrounding the proposed
subdivision:
(a) As an interim alternative where future subdivision will result in
appropriate street construction.
(b) As a permanent alternative.
B. Parts of a rear lot. Rear lots shall be comprised of two parts, the access
strip and the body of the lot, in compliance with the following
standards:
58.Editor's Note: Figure 1 is included at the end of this chapter.
59.Editor's Note: Figure 2 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 85-32 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-34
85:302
(1) The all-weather access strip shall be a minimum of 25 feet wide for
its entire length, including that portion which abuts a public street
right-of-way for access.
(2) When necessary or desirable for grading, drainage or preservation
of natural features, such as trees, the access strip shall be widened
beyond the twenty-five-foot minimum as necessary. Fifty feet is
suggested as a maximum width.
(3) When the body of the rear lot is capable of being further subdivided
into additional lots, the minimum width for its access strip shall be
50 feet, for future use as a road right-of-way, unless further
subdivision is prohibited by a deed restriction or other legal
instrument approved by the Borough Solicitor.
(4) The access strip shall be a fee-simple part of the rear lot and shall
not be a separate parcel or easement.
(5) The body of a rear lot shall comply with all the minimum
dimensional requirements of the zoning district in which it is
located. The area of the access strip shall not be counted toward
the minimum lot area requirement.
C. Review factors. In reviewing applications for rear lots, the following
factors will be considered by the Borough Council, Planning
Commission and Engineer:
(1) The amount of road frontage and configuration off the property
being subdivided.
(2) The sizes and number of lots proposed, including both the total
number of lots and the number of rear lots.
(3) The type and character of road which the tract abuts.
(4) The topography of the parcel being subdivided, with an emphasis
on trees and slopes.
(5) The physical characteristics of the surrounding area and whether
or not the subdivision site is distinguishable from it.
(6) The development status of the surrounding sites.
(7) The visual character preferred for the tract, that is, whether it is
better to see a lot of houses abutting the road or to hide some in
rear areas to reduce the perceivable density of development.
(8) Whether rear lots would set an undesirable precedent for nearby
sites.
(9) The economic impact of requiring road construction as compared
to using rear lots.
§ 85-34 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 85-34
85:303
(10) The visual and physical impacts of road construction as compared
to the use of access strips.
D. Design standards for rear lots.
(1) The length of the access strip shall be kept to a minimum, and, as a
guide, the preferred length is approximately equal to the depth of
one lot which complies with the minimum lot width and area
requirements of the district in which it is located.
(2) The location of the access strip should be logical relative to the
body of the rear lot, surrounding property configurations and
natural features of the land, and it shall intersect the public street
at a safe, visible location.
(3) Turns greater than 60° should be avoided in access strips:
(a) It may be necessary to widen the access strip at such sharp
turns to accommodate grading, drainage or tree preservation.
(b) For access strips that may become roads, the Borough Council
may require turns to be designed to accommodate horizontal
curves required for roads.
(4) Driveways serving access strips shall comply with the borough's
engineering standards for drainage and cartway, from the edge of
road pavement to a distance of 50 feet beyond the ultimate right-ofway
line of the road.
(5) When two access strips abut, they should share a common access
point and driveway from the edge of pavement to a distance of 50
feet beyond the ultimate right-of-way line of the road, from which
point either one common driveway or two individual driveways may
continue. The shared portion shall be a minimum of 18 feet wide.
(6) When more than two access strips would abut one another, the
Borough Council may require, instead, the use of a public street, in
accordance with the standards of this chapter.
E. Provisions for future roads. The Borough Council may permit the use of
rear lots where one or more access strips are intended to serve as a
right-of-way for a road which will serve future lotting. The following
regulations shall apply:
(1) Legal guaranties shall be provided to assure future use of any
access strip proposed for future use as a road, subject to approval
of the Borough Solicitor.
(2) The road shall be constructed or financially guaranteed at the
applicant's expense.
(3) Access strips legally and financially guaranteed for future use as
roads may comprise the legal and physical access to otherwise

§ 85-35. Additional regulations for floodplain areas.
The regulations contained herein shall apply in those areas identified as
flood prone in Chapter 95, Zoning. The Flood Boundary and Floodway Map
shall be available in the Borough Office for inspection. In regard to the
adopted Floodplain Conservation District, the regulations contained herein
shall apply to those areas defined and established as floodplain and not in
conflict with the information provided in the Flood Insurance Study.
landlocked residual parcels only if the access is irrevocably
guaranteed.
(4) An overall tentative sketch plan shall be submitted as part of the
proposed subdivision to show how the rear-lotting and reservation
of access strips for future roads forms a logical and appropriate
first phase in subdivision of the entire tract and/or how it will allow
interconnection with adjacent tracts.
(5) When the road is constructed, any access strips which are no
longer needed shall revert to the owners of the abutting lots, in
accordance with the terms agreed to as part of the original
preliminary plan approval which created the access strips.
A. The regulations contained herein are intended to conform to the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93-234,
and the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act, P.L. 851, No. 166 of
1978,60 and as either is amended. Furthermore, it is the purpose of
these regulations to:
(1) Regulate the subdivision and development of floodplain areas in
order to promote the general health, welfare and safety of the
community.
(2) Require that each subdivision lot or development site in floodplain
areas be provided with a safe building site with adequate access
and that public facilities which serve such sites be designed and
installed to preclude flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
(3) Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for use
because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision and
development of unprotected floodplain areas.
(4) Maintain the certification of East Greenville Borough and the
eligibility of the property owners in the borough for the benefits of
the National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 93-234.

flow without risk to persons or property. The drainage system shall
ensure drainage at all points along streets and ensure conveyance of
drainage away from buildings.
F. The Borough Council may require in a floodplain an underground
system to accommodate a one-hundred-year flood and a secondary
surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods. Drainage
plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage plans. The
facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of increased runoff
onto adjacent properties.
G. All new or replacement sanitary sewer systems, whether public or
private, located in floodplain areas shall be floodproofed, and all
appurtenances thereto (including but not limited to pumping stations)
shall be floodproofed up to a point 1 1/2 feet above the base flood
elevation.
H. All new or replacement water systems, whether public or private, in
floodplain areas shall be floodproofed up to a point 1 1/2 feet above the
base flood elevation.
I. All other new or replacement public or private utilities and facilities in
floodplain areas shall be elevated or floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet
above the base flood elevation.
J. Waivers. Guidelines for relaxation from the requirements set forth in
this section are as follows:
(1) A waiver shall not be issued within any designated regulatory
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood
discharge would result.
(2) A waiver shall only be issued if there is:
(a) A determination that failure to relax the requirements would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(b) A determination that the relaxing of a requirement will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety or extraordinary public expense or create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
§ 85-35 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-35

is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard to afford
relief.
(4) The borough shall maintain a record of all waivers, including
justification for their issuance, and report such decisions issued in
its annual report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administrator.
K. Where the subdivision or land development lies partially or completely
in a floodplain or where the subdivision or land development borders on
a floodplain, the plan shall include detailed information identifying the
following:
(1) Location and elevation of existing and proposed streets, water
supply and sanitary facilities and any other permitted
improvements, soil types and proposed floodproofing measures.

existing, permanent, natural or man-made features.
A. No proposal will be approved with a property line extending through
any portion of an existing building, except where that property line
follows a party wall separating semidetached or attached units, in
accordance with the Chapter 95, Zoning.
B. When existing buildings are retained:
(1) Minimum building setbacks shall be met or exceeded, in respect to
all new lot lines created, for the district in which the buildings are
located, even if this results in a lot area or dimensions in excess of
the otherwise applicable minimums.
§ 85-36 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 85-38
85:308
(2) Building setbacks in excess of the applicable minimums are
encouraged, in respect to all new lot lines created, when the height
and/or bulk of the existing building significantly exceeds that of

limitations.63
D. Buffer and screen planting. Along property lines separating the
applicant's proposal from lands owned by others, buffer planting shall
be provided in compliance with the following:
(1) Where development on both sides of the property line is or will be
of essentially the same type and intensity, no additional buffer
planting is required.
(2) Where development on both sides of the property line is or will be
of essentially the same type but of significantly different intensities,
the buffer area shall be planted in accordance with Subsection C
herein, including additional planting.
(3) Where the applicant's proposal is nonresidential and the abutting
properties are residential, buffer planting shall be as follows:
(a) Parking lot planting as required by Subsection C herein,
including additional planting; plus
(b) Screen planting sufficient to substantially obscure the least
desirable views from the residential property onto the
applicant's property. Screening plants shall be chosen from the
list in § 85-40C(4).
[1] Suggested minimum screen planting is a double row of
evergreen trees, six feet in height, planted 10 feet on

The following regulations shall apply to mobile home parks:
A. Individual mobile homes. Individual mobile homes, as defined in § 85-64
herein, may be erected on any lot where the use is permitted, provided
that compliance is made with zoning requirements and all sections of
this chapter which apply to subdivisions and development of singlefamily
detached dwellings.
B. Mobile home parks. The provisions of this article shall be followed in
the construction or alteration of all mobile home parks, as defined in
§ 85-64 herein. These provisions are in addition to other applicable
regulations of this chapter. Compliance with Chapter 95, Zoning, is
required.
A. Arrangement of structure and facilities. The tract, including mobile
home stands, patios, other dwellings and structures and all tract
improvements, shall be organized in relation to topography, the shape
of the plot and common facilities. Special attention shall be given to
new mobile home designs and to common appurtenances that are
available.
B. Adaptation to tract assets. Each mobile home unit or other dwelling or
structure shall be fitted to the terrain with a minimum disturbance of
the land and a minimum elevation difference between the floor level of
the unit and the ground elevation under it. Existing trees and shrubs,
rock formation, streams, floodplains, steep slopes and other natural
features of the tract shall be preserved to the maximum extent
practical. Favorable views shall be emphasized by the plan.
C. Courts and spaces. Groups or clusters of units, so placed as to create
interior spaces and courtyards, shall be incorporated whenever
feasible.
D. Orientation. Mobile homes are encouraged to be arranged in a variety
of orientations and are strongly encouraged to have many units with
their long sides facing the street rather than their ends, in order to
provide variety and interest.
E. Street layout. Street patterns unrelated to the topography of the site
are to be avoided.
F. Roadways.
(1) Standards. All borough standards for the construction of streets
contained in this chapter64 shall be adhered to for all public streets

streets are to be maintained as private internal roadways, owned
and maintained by the mobile home park operator or owned and
maintained in common by the residents/owners of the individual
lots, the standards shall be as follows:
(a) Right-of-way. There shall be an equivalent right-of-way (as
defined herein) reserved along those streets which are
designed to function as feeder or collector streets and which
connect major exterior roadways, form major loops, traverse
the development or provide major or important access to
adjacent parcels. No equivalent right-of-way is required on
other streets. On those streets where an equivalent right-ofway
is required, parallel parking may be permitted, but
perpendicular or angle parking is discouraged.
(b) Pavement. Pavement width of all residential streets serving as
access to mobile home lots shall be not less than 26 feet,
except that this may be reduced to not less than 20 feet on a
street serving as access to no more than 10 mobile home lots
where parking is prohibited along the road and off-street
visitor parking is provided in common areas within 300 feet of
all dwelling units at a rate of 0.3 space per mobile home.

No permanently closed cul-de-sac street shall exceed 500 feet
in length or serve as the only access to more than 20 mobile
home lots.
(2) Access limitations. Mobile home lots may have direct access only
onto streets internal to the development. Direct access from a
mobile home lot shall not be permitted onto the streets from which
the mobile home park gains primary access.
(3) Conversions. Any road built as a private road and later proposed for
conversion to a public road shall be brought up to the applicable
standards for public streets prior to being ordained as a public way,
unless this requirement is waived by the governing body
subsequent to determining that compliance with the requirement
would have a negative effect on the mobile home park.
G. Pedestrian circulation.
(1) General requirements. All mobile home parks shall provide safe,
convenient, all-season pedestrian walkways of adequate width for

voluntarily fixed the habitation of himself and his family, not for a mere
special or limited purpose but with the present intention of making a
permanent home until some event occurs to induce him to adopt some
other permanent home. In the case of businesses or associations, the
"domicile" is that place considered as the center of business affairs and
the place where its functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME  Salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive
payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or
his personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or
through an agent, and whether in cash or in property. However, "earned
income" shall not include wages or compensation paid to persons on
active military service; periodic payments for sickness and disability
other than regular wages received during a period of sickness,
disability or retirement, or payments arising under workmen's
compensation acts, occupational disease acts and similar legislation; or
payments commonly recognized as old-age benefits, retirement pay or
pensions paid to persons retired from service after reaching a specific
age or after a stated period of employment; or payments commonly
known as public assistance, or unemployment compensation payments
made by any governmental agency; or payments to reimburse
expenses; or payments made by employers or labor unions for wage and
salary supplemental programs, including but not limited to programs

compensation.

or private agency designated by the political subdivision to collect and
administer the tax on earned income and net profits.
NET PROFITS  The net income from the operation of a business,
profession or other activity, except by corporations, after provision for
all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined
either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the accounting

(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the tax for
a given calendar year, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
§ 88-33 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 88-33
85:353
§ 88-34. Duty of employers to collect.
withholding of the tax under this subsection is subsequently

subsection that employers shall not be responsible for investigating
exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or
exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. The Borough of East Greenville, in consultation with the
Collector and DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of
refund claims for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for
exemption, which procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the
general municipal law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest
on overpayments. Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or
75 days after the last day the employer is required to remit the tax for
the last quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be
subject to interest. No refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a
calendar year that do not exceed $1. The Borough of East Greenville or
the Collector shall determine eligibility for exemption and provide
refunds to exempt persons.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his employ, whether
said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and whether or not
all such services are performed within the political subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll-period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
§ 88-33 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 88-34
85:354
§ 88-35. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him to an
employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer shall be
responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had been
originally levied against the employer.
§ 88-36. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
In each tax year, each employer shall use his employment records to
determine the number of employees from whom such tax shall be deducted
and paid over to the Collector on or before the 30th day following the end
of each calendar quarter of each such tax year.
§ 88-37. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who performs services of any type or kind
or engages in any occupation or profession within a primary place of
employment within the political subdivision shall be required to comply with
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer, and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of § 88-33B of
this article and this section and remits the amount so withheld in
accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
§ 88-34 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 88-37
85:355
this article and pay the pro rata portion of the tax due to the Collector on or
before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 88-38. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
§ 88-39. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his tax is not paid, the political subdivision shall
have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for
the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 88-40. Duty of Collector; administration and enforcement of tax.
A. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the
person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is,
concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires that the
person work in more than one political subdivision during a payroll
period, the priority of claim to collect the local services tax shall be in
the following order:
(1) First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his
principal office or is principally employed.
(2) Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and
works if the tax is levied by that political subdivision.
(3) Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and
which imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home. In
case of dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that
calendar year declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment
constitutes prima facie certification of payment to all other political
subdivisions.
A. The Collector shall be appointed by resolution of the political
subdivision. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive
payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount
received by him from each employer of self-employed person, together
with the date the tax was received.

this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his custody and control setting forth the number of employees subject

any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation and, upon
conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600
and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to
imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to enforce the penalty
herein prescribed may be instituted against any person in charge of the
business of any employer who shall have failed or who refuses to file a
return required by this article.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to prescribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
consistent with the Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights74 under Act 50 of
1998.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.

occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

[Adopted 7-7-1997 by Ord. No. 8-9781]
§ 94-1. Application for service.
§ 94-2. Fees for installation of service. [Amended 1-5-2004 by Ord.
No. 2004-2]
The Borough shall charge the hereinafter enumerated fees for each gallon
per day of capacity (GPD) as hereinafter determined whenever the owner
of any property, or his or her designated agent, connects such property
with the Borough's public water system, or whenever said owner adds to
or modifies property already connected to that system in such manner as
to increase the GPD as hereinafter determined. The enumerated fees shall
include:
A. Service connections will be made and water will be furnished upon
written application by the prospective customer (or his/her properly
authorized agent) on a form provided by the borough for this purpose
and after approval of such application by the Borough Council. The
application for service shall state clearly the class (R, C, I), scope and
type of use to be made of the service, as well as the purpose for which it
will be used.
B. The application and these rules and regulations constitute the contract
between the customer and the borough; and each customer, by the
taking of water, agrees to be bound thereby.
C. A new application must be made to and approved by the Borough
Council upon any change in the identity of the contracting customer at
a property or in the service as described in the application, and the
Borough Council may, upon five days' notice, discontinue the water
supply until such new application has been made and approved.
D. Each application for service shall be made in conformity with and shall
state the basis of rates applicable to customers under the tariff
provisions.
A. Connection fee: a charge to reimburse the Borough for the cost of the
waterline between the main in the street and the property line. This
cost shall be based upon actual cost or average cost of previous similar
connections. This fee shall include all road openings and restorations as
well as permit fees and engineering fees in connection therewith.
(1) Prior to any work schedule being set for a new connection, or
connections, to the Borough's water system, the property owner or
his designated agent shall:
81.Editor's Note: This ordinance superseded former Ch. 94, Water, adopted 9-6-1988 by Ord.
No. 5-88.
§ 94-1 WATER § 94-2
94:391
(a) Complete a written application requesting connection, or
connections, on forms supplied by the Borough.
(b) Read and execute an agreement with the Borough on forms
supplied by the Borough agreeing to pay to the Borough all
actual costs related to said connection or connections.
(c) Pay in advance for the water connection or connections, $2,332
per connection.
The advanced payments referred to in Subsection A(1)(c)
above shall in no instance be construed as being full payment.
The property owner, or his designated agent, shall be
responsible for all actual costs related to effect the water
connection between the Borough mains and the established
curbline of said property.
(2) The property owner, or his designated agent, shall receive a final
cost bill to be computed from the particular job sheet as filed by the
Borough's Maintenance Supervisor.
(3) The advanced payment shall be deducted from the total actual
costs and the balance will represent the final cost bill. The final
Borough invoice shall be forwarded within 15 days after the street
surface has been properly restored and the said new service
completed between the water main and the established curbline.
(4) In the event that the balance due the Borough is not paid in full
within 15 days of the date of said final cost bill, said services may
be made ineffective by shutting off the water supply. Before service
will be restored, these additional costs plus 10%, an adjusted final
cost bill, must be paid in full.
(5) The Borough reserves the right to adjust and/or waive required
connection fees where their imposition would not be warranted.
For example, if a property owner has entered a development
agreement with the Borough and is undertaking construction of an
on-site water system at his own expense, there may be no need for
connection fees as hereinbefore set forth since there would be no
actual costs to the Borough.
B. Customer facilities fee: a charge to reimburse the Borough for the cost
of line and/or service for connection of the facilities installed between
the property line and the building. This charge shall be based on actual
costs incurred. The Borough may require the owner to install these
facilities. The fee shall include the cost of providing a water meter or
meters. The billing procedure shall be the same as for the connection
fees in Subsection A above.
C. Tapping fee. A charge which includes the following components:
capacity, distribution and collection, special purpose and
reimbursement, to be charged for use of the water systems of the
§ 94-2 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 94-2
94:392
Borough, that shall be in addition to any charges assessed against
the property in the construction of water mains as well as other user
charges or rates charged for rental and use of the water system itself.
(1) The tapping fee for public water service shall be $2,668 per EDU as
hereinafter defined.
(2) The aforementioned tapping fees, as well as any fees set forth to
this section may be altered or changed by Borough Council from
time to time as circumstances may warrant by appropriate
resolution of Council.
(3) The aforestated tapping fees are determined and established by
studies done by Borough Engineer, Cowan Associates, Inc., entitled
"East Greenville Borough Water Distribution System Tapping Fee
Report," dated November 13, 2003. Copies of said report, detailing
itemization of all calculations showing the manner in which the fees
were determined, are available for public inspection at the Borough
Hall.
(4) Tapping fees shall be payable at time of application for connection
to systems or at such other time as the property owner and
Borough may agree upon in writing.
D. Equivalent dwelling unit. Equivalent dwelling unit shall mean any room,
group of rooms, mobile home or other enclosure occupied or intended
for occupancy as separate living quarters by a family or group of
persons living together or by persons living alone. Each dwelling unit in
a double house, townhouse, or connecting houses, in a mobile home or
in an apartment, will be charged as a separate entity or unit.
(1) Each church, chapel or firehouse shall constitute one equivalent
dwelling unit. Each school (public or private) shall constitute one
equivalent dwelling unit for each unit of 20 pupils expected to he
enrolled and occupying said school. Teachers and employees shall
be classified as pupils for purposes of this calculation.
(2) For any improved nonresidential property to be served by the
Borough water system, the number of equivalent dwelling units for
which such property shall be charged shall be in accordance with
the following schedule, with each 350 gallons per day of estimated
water usage equal to one equivalent dwelling unit:

A. The borough will make all connections to its mains and will furnish,
install and maintain all service lines from the main to and including the
curb stop and box, which shall be placed immediately inside the portion
of the customer's property which abuts the street or road, all of which
service line shall be the property of the borough and shall be accessible
to and under its control.
B. All service lines from the curb stop and box to the meter shall be
approved by the borough as to size and installation and shall be kept in
good repair by the customer at his expense. Service lines shall be

effect at the time of the application for service. All service lines shall be
placed at least 3 1/2 feet below the surface of the ground.
C. No service lines shall be laid in the same trench with a gas pipe, sewer
pipe or any other facility of a public service company, except with
written approval of the borough. No line shall be laid within three feet
of any open excavation of vault, except with written approval of the
borough.
D. A stop and waste valve, easily accessible to the occupants, shall be
placed in the service line within the premises supplied with water. Such
vault shall be located so that it will be possible to drain the meter and
all pipes in the building.
E. All leaks in service lines from the curb box to and within the premises
shall be promptly repaired. Failure to make such repairs within a
reasonable time period may cause the borough to turn off the water and
it will not be again turned on until the borough has been reimbursed, in
full, for all proper and necessary expenses incurred in shutting off and
turning on the water.
F. The borough shall in no event be responsible for maintenance of or for
damage caused by water escaping from the service line of any other

thereto and shall make any changes thereon which may be required
because of change of grade, relocation of mains or other such changes
deemed necessary by the borough.
G. The use of water service by a customer shall be in accordance with the
class, scope and type of use and for the purpose stated in the
application and service contract. A customer shall not use or allow the
use of water service through his/her facilities for others or for purposes
other than those covered by his/her application. To make a service
available for other purposes or character of use, a new application and
contract must be approved by the borough.
A. All water service, except for fire-fighting purposes, will be rendered
only through meters.

§ 94-3 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 94-5
94:396
B. Each customer's service shall have a separate meter to register the
amount of water consumed.
C. All meters will be furnished by and remain the property of the Borough.
The Borough reserves the right to establish the size of meter required
by each customer. The Borough will provide a mounting device to be
installed by the customer. All meters will be installed by the Borough.
All customers requiring meters larger than one inch and all customers
outside the corporate limits of the Borough will reimburse the Borough
for the price of the meter. If a meter larger than one inch becomes
defective at any time, the Borough will replace it at the Borough's
expense, and said new meter will remain the property of the Borough.
[Amended 7-3-2000 by Ord. No. 00-3]
D. Upon request by the borough, all customers will allow the borough to
install a remote reading device to permit meter reading from a location
on an outside wall of a residence or other building. All such remote
readers will remain the property of the borough.
E. Meters and remote reading devices will be maintained by the borough
as far as ordinary wear and tear is concerned. The customer, in case of
an inside meter installation or an outside meter installation if the
borough has agreed upon the site and the installation of a meter vault
or meter box, shall be responsible to the borough for any injury to or
loss of any meter arising out of or caused by the customer's negligence
or carelessness, including any loss or damage caused by freezing or
that of his/her servants, employees, members of his/her household or
any person upon his/her premises under or by his/her consent or
sufferance. The customer shall not permit anyone, not an agent of the
borough or otherwise lawfully authorized so to do, to remove, inspect or
tamper with the borough's meter, remote reading device or other
property of the borough on his/her premises. If a meter vault or meter
box becomes unsuitable and the borough so notifies the customer, the
customer shall remedy this condition promptly, at his/her expense.
F. All meters and remote reading devices shall be set at convenient
locations, accessible to the borough and subject to its control. When
possible and if the customer and borough agree, the meter shall be
installed within the premises supplied, at a point approved by the
borough, in order to control the entire supply. A proper place for the
meter and protection therefore shall be provided by the customer.
G. Where it is not convenient or if both the customer and the borough
agree not to place the meter in the building, as provided in Subsection
F, the meter will be placed outside the building in a suitable vault of
concrete or block or in a meter box. The meter vault or meter box shall
be provided with a suitable cover and locking device.
H. The cover and locking device for each outside meter vault or meter box
shall conform to a proper uniform standard established by the borough.
The covers and locking device shall be of uniform design for

convenience and efficiency in the borough's operation. An outside
meter vault or meter box shall be located, at the option of the customer,
either inside the property line or near the curb stop and shall be built at
the expense of the customer. The site shall be a suitable and safe place
for the installation of a meter and it must be accessible to the borough.
A. The quantity of water recorded by the meter and not the remote
reading device shall be conclusive for both the customer and the
borough, except when the meter has been found to be registering
inaccurately or has ceased to register. In either of such cases, the meter
will be promptly repaired or replaced by the borough and the quantity
of water consumed shall be estimated by the average registration of the
meter in previous corresponding periods.
B. In the case of a disputed bill involving the accuracy of a meter, such
meter shall be tested, upon the request of the customer. If the meter so
tested is found to have an error in registration of 4% or more, the bills
will be increased or decreased accordingly as provided by said rules.
C. Each request for the test of a meter for accuracy shall be accompanied
by a deposit, the amount of which shall be determined by the size of the
meter to be tested.
D. If the meter so tested shall be found to have an error in registration of
less than 4%, the deposit shall be retained by the borough as
compensation for such test; if the error in registration is found to be 4%
or more, then the amount of the deposit shall be borne by the borough
and the amount of the deposit shall be returned to the customer.
E. Each request for the test of a meter for accuracy shall be accompanied
by a deposit governed by the size of the meter and the current cost of
testing by a borough-appointed testing company.
F. If for two successive quarters the quantity of water recorded by the
remote reading device reveals consumption that differs by more than
10% from the amount consumed in the same quarters the previous year,
or immediately upon the meter ceasing to register any flow to a
property, the Borough may request an opportunity to test and, if
necessary, to replace the meter. The Borough employee charged with
the duty of conducting quarterly meter readings shall advise the
customer of the Borough's desire to test the meter by leaving a card at
the customer's door asking that he call the Borough office and arrange
for a time at which an employee of the Borough might test the meter. If
the customer fails to arrange for the requested testing within 14 days of
the date on which the card requesting the test was left at his door, the
Borough Secretary shall write to him, again requesting that the
customer call the Borough office to arrange for meter testing and
advising that failure to do so prior to the close of the then-current
quarter will be a violation of the rules and regulations of this article and

10% penalty and turn-on charge of $25 is paid in full by bank check,
money order or cash.
C. All delinquent bills for rentals and charges shall be entered as a lien
against the premises served, and such lien shall be filed and collected in
the manner provided by law for the filing and collection of municipal
claims.
D. The presentation or nonpresentation of a bill shall not be held to be a
waiver of any of the rules or regulations.
E. Water rates shall be payable quarterly, being due and payable on the
first days of March, June, September and December. [Amended
1-6-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-2]
F. The borough will read all meters on a regular schedule. In the event
that a scheduled reading of meters can not be obtained because of
inability to gain access to the meter location, the borough reserves the
right to estimate the amount of the bill. Bills so determined shall have
the same force and effect as if the meter had been read.
G. In all cases where water is served to a building occupied by two or more
establishments, firms or families, only one meter shall be furnished by
the borough to such building. The water rate as registered by the meter
will be equally divided among the individual billing units, and separate
bills for each billing unit shall be calculated and totaled. However, the
owner will be furnished with only one bill. The owner may request that
separate meters be installed for each portion of the building separately
occupied. Cost of installation and meters shall be at the expense of the
owner.
A. Whenever the customer desires to have his/her service contract
terminate or his/her water service discontinued, he shall notify the
borough to that effect in writing. The customer will be responsible for
the payment of all service rendered by the borough prior to receipt of
such written notice and during a reasonable time thereafter to enable

made for unoccupied property when written notice has not been given
as above provided. No refund will be allowed for property unoccupied
for a period of less than one month.
C. In cases of vacancy of a customer's property, the customer must notify
the borough in writing of such vacancy, and upon his failure to do so, he
will become responsible for any damage to the property of the borough
arising from freezing, water damage, injury to meter or any other
failure.
D. Upon written notification from the Upper Montgomery Joint Authority
that a customer is delinquent in payment of sewer rentals, water
service shall be discontinued as if this delinquency was a violation of
these rules and regulations.
E. Service to any customer may be discontinued for violation of any of
these rules and regulations; however, before service may be
discontinued for any violation, the borough shall give written notice to
the customer and a reasonable date after which service will be
discontinued if the violation continues. After service is thus
discontinued for violation of the rules and regulations, service will not
be resumed until reasonable assurance is given that the customer will
comply with the rules and regulations and until the turn-on fee of $25
has been paid to the borough.

ARTICLE II
Cross-Connection Control
[Adopted 3-4-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-3]
§ 94-17. Purpose and policy.
§ 94-18. Definitions.
These definitions will be applicable to the provisions of this article.
AIR GAP SEPARATION  The unobstructed vertical distance through the
free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet
supplying potable water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the
flood level rim of the receptacle. The differential distance shall be at least
double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the top of
the rim of the vessel. In no case shall the air gap be less than one inch.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this article is:
(1) To protect the public water supply system from contamination or
pollution by isolating within the consumer's water system
contaminants or pollutants which could backflow through the
service connection into the public water supply system.
(2) To promote the elimination or control of existing cross-connections,
actual or potential, between the public or consumer's potable water
system and nonpotable water system, plumbing fixtures and
sources or systems containing process fluids.
(3) To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of crossconnection
control which will systematically and effectively
prevent the contamination or pollution of the public and the
consumer's potable water system.
B. Application. This article shall apply to all premises (commercial and
noncommercial) served by the public water supply system of the East
Greenville Borough.
C. Policy. The East Greenville Borough and the consumer have the joint
responsibility for the protection of the public water supply system from
contamination due to backflow of contaminants through the water
service connection. If, in the judgment of the East Greenville Borough
or its authorized representative, an approved backflow prevention
device is required, the East Greenville Borough shall give notice to the
consumer to install such approved backflow prevention device at each
service connection to his premises. The consumer shall immediately
install such approved device or devices at his own expense, and failure,
refusal or inability on the part of the consumer to install such device or
devices shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water service to the
premises until such device or devices have been installed.
§ 94-17 WATER § 94-18
94:407
APPROVED  A backflow prevention device or method that has been
accepted by the public water supplier or by any enforcement entity.
ATMOSPHERIC VACUUM BREAKER (AVB)  A fixture outlet device
containing an optional shutoff valve followed by a valve body containing a
resilient seated float-check, a check seat and an air inlet port. If the shutoff
valve is open, the flow of water causes the float to close the air inlet port.
If the shutoff valve is closed, the float falls and forms a check valve against
backsiphonage and at the same time opens the air inlet port. If no shutoff
valve is provided, the flow of water will determine the opening and closing
of the air inlet port.
AUXILIARY WATER SYSTEM  Any water source or system on the premises
of, or available to, the customer except connections to other approved
community water supply systems.
BACKFLOW  A flow condition, induced by a differential in pressure, that
causes the flow of water or mixtures of water and other substances into
the distribution pipes of a potable water supply system from a source other
than its intended source. Backflow can result from either backsiphonage or
backpressure.
BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY  A device or other means which
will prevent the backflow of water or any other substance into the public
water supply system.
BACKPRESSURE  The backflow of water or a mixture of water and
other substances from a plumbing fixture or other customer source into a
public water supply system due to an increase of pressure in the fixture or
customer source to a value that exceeds the system pressure.
BACKSIPHONAGE  The backflow of water or a mixture of water and
other substances from a plumbing fixture or other customer source into a
public water supply system due to a temporary negative or subatmospheric
pressure within the pubic water supply system.
CONSUMER  The owner or person in control of any premises supplied by
or in manner connected to a public water supply system.
CONSUMER'S WATER SYSTEM  Any water system located on the
consumer's premises supplied by or in any manner connected to a public
water supply system. A household plumbing system is considered to be a
consumer's water system.
CONTAINMENT  Cross-connection control which isolates the customer's
entire facility from the public water supply system so as to provide the
protection necessary to prevent contamination of the public water supply
in the event of backflow from the customer's facility. Though containment
control prevents contamination of the public water supply, it offers no
protection to the water distribution system within the facility. Reduced
pressure zone devices are used for containment control.
CONTAMINATION  The degradation of the quality of the drinking water
by wastewaters, processed fluids, or any water of a quality less than
accepted drinking water quality to a degree which would create an actual
§ 94-18 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 94-18
94:408
hazard to the public health through poisoning or through the spread of
disease.
CROSS-CONNECTION  An arrangement allowing either a direct or
indirect connection through which backflow can occur between the potable
water system and a nonpotable substance.
DEGREE OF HAZARD  An evaluation of the potential risk to health and
the adverse effect upon the public water supply system.
DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY (DCVA)  An assembly composed of
two independently acting spring-loaded check valves connected in series,
two resilient seated shutoff valves, and four properly located resilient
seated test cocks for testing.
FIXTURE OUTLET PROTECTION  Cross-connection control that isolates
all free-flowing fixture outlets (i.e., faucets) from the water distribution
system within a facility. Fixture protection prevents backflow contamination
of both the facility's water system and the public water supply. Examples
of fixture outlet protection devices include atmospheric vacuum breakers,
hose-bibb vacuum breakers, and pressure vacuum breakers.
HEALTH HAZARD  Any condition, device, or practice in a water system
or its operation that creates or may create a danger to the health and wellbeing
of its users. The word "severe" as used to qualify "health hazard,"
means a hazard to the health of the user that could reasonably be expected
to result in significant morbidity or death.
HOSE-BIBB VACUUM BREAKER (HBVB)  A fixture outlet device which
contains a soft-seated, spring-loaded, air inlet valve and is designed to be
attached to an outlet having a hose connection thread.
INTERCHANGEABLE CONNECTION  An arrangement or device that will
allow alternate, but not simultaneous, use of two sources of water.
INTERNAL PROTECTION  Cross-connection control which isolates all
non-outlet, water-use appliances within a facility (e.g., kitchen appliances,
air conditioners, boilers, process tanks, photodeveloping equipment) from
the water distribution system within the facility. Internal protection
prevents backflow contamination of both the facility water system and the
public water supply. Reduced pressure zone devices and double check valve
assemblies are used for internal protection.
NON-HEALTH HAZARD  Any condition, device or practice in a water
system or its operation that creates, or may create, an impairment of the
quality of the water to a degree which does not create a hazard to the public
health but which does adversely and unreasonably affect the aesthetic
qualities of such water for domestic use.
NON-POTABLE WATER  Water not safe for drinking, personal, culinary or
any other type of domestic use.
PERSON  Any individual, partnership, association, company, corporation,
municipality, municipal authority, political subdivision or any agency of
federal or state government. The term includes the officers, employees and

Testing laboratories other than the laboratory listed above will be
added to an approved list as they are qualified by the East
Greenville Borough.
B. Existing backflow prevention devices approved by the East Greenville
Borough at the time of installation and properly maintained shall,
except for inspection and maintenance requirements, be excluded from
the requirement of Subsection A of this regulation, provided the East
Greenville Borough is assured that they will satisfactorily protect the
public water supply system. If the existing device is moved from the
present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when
the East Greenville Borough finds that the maintenance of the device
constitutes a hazard to the public health, the device shall be replaced
by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of these
regulations.
A. Backflow prevention devices required by this article shall be installed at
a location and in a manner approved by the East Greenville Borough
and shall be installed by a person properly qualified and at the expense
of the consumer.
B. Backflow prevention devices installed on the service line to a
consumer's water system shall be located on the consumer's side of the
water meter, as close to the meter as is reasonably practical, and prior
to any other connection.
C. Pits or vaults shall be of watertight construction, be so located and
constructed as to prevent flooding and shall be maintained free from
standing water by means of either a sump pump or a suitable drain.
Such sump pump or drain shall not connect to a sanitary sewer nor
permit flooding of the pit or vault by reverse flow from its point of
discharge. An access ladder and adequate natural or artificial lighting
shall be provided to permit maintenance inspection and testing of the
backflow prevention device.
D. When installing a backflow prevention device the installer must comply
and be aware of all safety considerations when installations are
performed. Major safety considerations are thermal expansion and
device discharge damage. Thermal expansion can cause hot water
tanks and other storage vessels to explode when there are no provisions
made for thermal expansion. The East Greenville Borough strongly
recommends the installation of a thermal expansion tank on hot water
heaters to prevent the hot water heaters relief valve from discharging
§ 94-24 WATER § 94-25
94:415
§ 94-26. Inspection and maintenance.
or, more importantly, from exploding. Many backflow prevention
devices discharge large amounts of water for various reasons. This
discharge of water could obviously pose a hazard when the valves are
discharging onto or around electrical equipment. Equipment damage
or electrocution could occur. The installer must ensure that valve
discharge will not cause safety hazards or property damage. Thermal
expansion is a concern anytime substances are confined (in a closed
system) and are heated.
A. It shall be the duty of the consumer at any premises on which backflow
prevention devices are required by this article, to have inspections,
tests, and overhaul made in accordance with the following schedule, or
more often where inspections indicate a need.
(1) Air separation shall be inspected at the time of installation, and at
least every 12 months thereafter.
(2) Double check valve assemblies shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation, and at least every 12 months
thereafter. These devices shall be dismantled, inspected internally,
cleaned, and repaired whenever needed, and at least every 30
months.
(3) Reduced pressure zone devices shall be inspected and tested for
tightness at the time of installation, and at least every 12 months
thereafter. These devices shall be dismantled, inspected internally,
cleaned, and repaired whenever needed and at least every five
years.
(4) Interchangeable connections shall be inspected at the time of
installation and at least every 12 months thereafter.
B. Inspections, tests, and overhaul of backflow prevention devices shall be
made at the expense of the water consumer and shall be performed by
the East Greenville Borough or a person certified to inspect, test or
overhaul backflow prevention devices.
C. Whenever backflow prevention devices required by these regulations
are found to be defective, they shall be repaired or replaced at the
expense of the consumer without delay.
D. The water consumer must maintain a complete record of each backflow
prevention device from purchase to retirement. This shall include a
comprehensive listing that includes a record of all tests, inspections
and repairs. Records of inspections, tests, repairs and overhaul shall be
submitted to the East Greenville Borough.
E. Backflow prevention devices shall not be bypassed, made inoperative,
removed or otherwise made ineffective without specific authorization
by the water purveyor.

within any premises, such a pump shall be equipped with a lowpressure
cut-off device designed to shut off the booster pump when the
pressure in the service line on the suction side of the pump drops to 10
pounds per square inch gauge or less for a period of 30 seconds or
longer.

§ 95-3. Statement of community development objectives.
The Borough of East Greenville, which has an adopted Comprehensive Plan
to guide the orderly growth and the borough development of the borough,
intends this chapter to implement the following community development
objectives which have been adopted by the Borough Council of East
Greenville in accordance with Section 606 of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code84:
D. To accommodate reasonable overall community growth, including
opportunities for development of a variety of residential dwelling types
along with appropriate nonresidential uses.
A. Intergovernmental cooperation and implementation. The general goal
is to plan for and ensure the maximum future development of the
Borough of East Greenville by coordinating the planning of public and
private enterprises of the borough with the plans and enterprises of the
surrounding areas and region. Public involvement is a fundamental aim.
Planning shall continue to be directed at improving community facilities
and services, particularly where public opinion indicates the need is
greatest. In order to implement planned improvements, diversified land
use, intermunicipal cooperation and the consolidation of operating
agencies are being promoted. The guiding principle continues to be to
assure maximum community benefits consistent with local traditions,
the enlargement of goals and objectives for both public and private
enterprise and appropriate enhancement of human values.
B. Growth. The borough is a developed community with an established
character that should be preserved. All future growth, whether by
infilling of remaining vacant land or by redevelopment, should occur in
an orderly and controlled manner that is consistent with the scale and
character of the borough and which protects the social and economic
stability of each area.
C. Land use. East Greenville Borough has a wide variety of land uses,
including a strong residential character. The borough should preserve
and protect the character, stability and value of land and buildings.
D. Housing. The borough has a diverse housing mix, with many types and
densities and appearances. The integrity of established residential
neighborhoods should be protected. Infill housing should complement
the existing neighborhoods. New development should provide adequate
off-street parking, recreation facilities and open space.
E. Commerce. Future commercial development should respect
surrounding residential neighborhoods. In the borough, small-scale
commercial activities should mix with residences in certain areas such
as Main Street. Larger scale, auto-oriented uses should generally be

It is not intended for this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or interfere
with any existing ordinance or enactment or with any rule, regulations
or permit adopted or issued thereunder, except insofar as the same may
be inconsistent or in conflict with any of the provisions of this chapter,
provided that where this chapter imposes greater restrictions upon the use
of buildings or land or upon the height and bulk of buildings or prescribes
larger open spaces than are required by the provision of such ordinance,
enactment, rule, regulations or permits, then the provisions of this chapter
shall control.
§ 95-5. Validity.
Should any section of this chapter be declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the
chapter as a whole or any other part thereof.
restricted to the shopping center and their deleterious effects (such as
traffic and noise) should be limited.
F. Industry. The existing industry in the borough should be adequately
regulated so that it may remain and its noise, odors or other unwanted
features can be minimized.
G. Institutions. The many institutions in the borough are part of the
community and should be encouraged to remain and yet be respectful
to surrounding residential neighborhoods.
H. Transportation. The borough should strive for the best possible
relationship between land use and transportation. The public
thoroughfares of the borough should be safe and efficient for all
vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists.
I. Community facilities and services. It is desirable to maintain or to
expand and improve the present level of community services. The
borough should have appropriate open space, recreational facilities,
opportunities for education and enrichment and health and safety
services. These regulations should aid in providing a guide for public
policy and action in the efficient provision of public facilities and
services and in the provision of safe and proper sanitary sewage
disposal and for private enterprise in building development, investment
and other economic activity relating to land use.

property identified, the Zoning Officer shall have on file a written
record documenting the evidence and reasoning that led to the
assignment of nonconforming status. If the survey, record and map are
not done or are incomplete, the nonconforming status may be
determined when applications are filed with the borough.
B. Jurisdiction. In all matters pertaining to nonconforming status, the
Zoning Officer shall make the initial determination.
(1) The Zoning Officer may seek the advice of the Borough Solicitor
and/or others in making a determination.

service for children by caregivers in family day-care homes,
group day-care homes and day-care centers, subject to Chapter 11,
Section 8A, 8B and 8C, of the Pennsylvania Department of Public
Welfare (DPW) Social Services Manual Regulations. Day-care

services for part of a twenty-four-hour day for children under 16
years of age by caregivers, excluding care provided by relatives.
Day-care service for children shall not include baby-sitting or day
care furnished in places of worship during religious services.
(2) Registration and licensing. Family day-care homes, as defined in
this chapter, must hold an approved and currently valid DPW
registration certificate. Group day-care homes and day-care
centers, as defined in this chapter, must hold an approved and
currently valid DPW license. In addition, all child day-care facilities
shall comply with all current DPW regulations, including those
standards governing adequate indoor space, accessible outdoor
play space and any applicable state or local building and fire safety
codes.
(3) Borough notification. Each operator of a newly established child
day-care facility shall notify the borough in writing, at least 60 days
prior to the initiation of such use, for the purpose of allowing the
borough to establish a record of the new land use. Already existing
licensed or registered facilities shall be required to notify the

protection from adjoining uses, properties and roadways. The
on-site outdoor play area shall not be located in the front yard.
The outdoor play area should be located immediately adjacent
to the child-care facility.
(b) Off-site outdoor play area. In accordance with DPW
regulations, a child day-care facility may utilize off-site play
areas in lieu of or as a supplement to an on-site play area.
These standards permit the use of off-site play areas which are
located within 1/2 mile distance of the facility, measured from
the property line of the facility. When the use of an off-site play
area is proposed, the applicant shall inform the borough about
the means of transportation that will be used to access the offsite
play area. For reasons of safety, when children will be
walked to an off-site play area, the route to the off-site play
area shall not involve the crossing of arterial or major collector
streets. Pedestrian access on sidewalks or improved walkways
shall be required.
(8) Altering exterior of residential structures. Any addition or
improvement to an existing residential structure or property for
purposes of child day care shall preserve its residential character.

building materials used shall be compatible with the existing
structure. Any improvements to the structure shall be in
compliance with all other applicable borough regulations relating
to building and/or zoning permits.

peak hour shall be required to conduct a traffic impact study. The
traffic impact study shall be prepared in compliance with pertinent
state and borough regulations and ordinances.
§ 95-156 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 95-156
94:526
(a) Objective. The purpose of the traffic impact study is to provide
the local Planning Commission and governing body with
adequate information and data to properly assess:
[1] The impact of the proposed facility on the surrounding
road and street network as well as on streets and roads
providing immediate access to the proposed facility.
[2] The need for capital improvements to the existing
transportation network which will be needed to
accommodate the additional traffic generated by the
proposed facility.
[3] Traffic and/or pedestrian safety issues which may arise
from the proposed facility.
(10) Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area for any proposed child
day-care facility shall comply with the minimum lot area
requirements of the zoning district in which the proposed facility is
located.
C. Family day-care homes. Any proposed family day-care home shall
comply with the following standards in addition to the general
provisions for all types of day-care facilities in § 95-156B.
(1) Where allowed. Permitted by right. Family day-care homes may be
located by right in any zoning district that allows the following
types of dwelling units, subject to the standards of the zoning
district in which the unit is located and the following development
standards in this section, whichever are more restrictive:
(a) Single-family detached dwelling units.
(b) Two-family dwelling units (twins; no duplex apartments).
(c) Townhouse or row house dwelling units.
(2) Development standards. The following standards shall apply to all
proposed family day-care homes.
(a) Dropoff area. One on-site dropoff space for clients shall be
provided. An existing driveway or common parking lot space
may be used as the dropoff area if it can be demonstrated that
there is sufficient space available in the driveway that is not
otherwise occupied or committed to safely accommodate a
parked vehicle. If a driveway is used for the dropoff area and
the proposed use fronts an arterial or major collector street, an
on-site turnaround area shall be provided so that vehicles can
exit the site driving forward. In cases where the existing
driveway cannot function as a dropoff area, an on-site dropoff
space shall be provided. The dropoff area shall conform to the
borough dimensional standards for residential parking spaces.
§ 95-156 WATER § 95-156
94:527
[1] In cases where the dropoff area cannot be accommodated
on the site, the applicant shall demonstrate that there is
on-street parking or some other available parking area
located within 250 feet of the property line of the proposed
facility.
[2] The required dropoff area may be waived by the borough if
the applicant can demonstrate that the clients of the family
day-care home will walk to the facility, thereby eliminating
the need for additional parking.
(b) Fencing. If there are unsafe areas, such as open drainage
ditches, wells, holes, heavy street traffic, etc., in or near to an
outdoor play area, there shall be fencing of adequate height
(four-foot minimum) and sufficient design to restrict children
from these areas.
D. Group day-care home. Any proposed group day-care home shall comply
with the following standards in addition to the general provisions for all
types of child day-care facilities in § 95-156B.
(1) Where allowed. Group day-care homes may be located by special
exception in any zoning district that allows the following types of
dwelling units, subject to the standards of the zoning district in
which the unit is located and the following additional standards in
this section, whichever are more restrictive:
(a) Single-family detached dwelling units.
(b) Two-family dwelling units (twins; no duplex apartments).
(c) Townhouse or row house dwelling units.
(2) Conditional use standards.
(a) Minimum distance between facilities.
[1] Residential zoning districts. In order to avoid a
concentration of individual group day-care homes in
residential neighborhoods, group day-care homes shall be
located a minimum of 300 feet from each other as
measured from the respective property lines. This
dispersion requirement shall not apply in cases where a
proposed group day-care home is located within 300 feet
of a school facility or church which provides child day-care
services.

The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,117 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Borough Council of the Borough of East Greenville
does hereby order as follows.
§ 95-179.2. General provisions.
A. The intent of this article is to:
(1) Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community
by preventing development in areas prone to flooding.
(2) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(3) Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
(4) Permit only those uses in the floodplain that are compatible with
preserving natural conditions and stream flow.
(5) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
(6) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
B. Applicability.
(1) The Floodplain Conservation District is defined and established to
include that area of the Borough of East Greenville, which is
identified as being a Special Flood Hazard Area on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,
as prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), dated March 2, 2016, or the most recent revision thereof.
(2) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be deemed an overlay on
any zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot.
(3) In addition to Subsection B(1), the Borough of East Greenville may
require the applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic
and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic

analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review
by the Borough of East Greenville.
(4) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be delineated according
to FEMA's FIRM for the Borough of East Greenville, which is
hereby made a part of this article. The FIRM is available for
inspection at the Borough Office.

buildings or structures.
C. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions, which may be in effect in the Floodplain
Conservation District. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this article, the more restrictive shall apply.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
this article, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain
Conservation District, or that land uses permitted within such
areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of the Borough of
East Greenville or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this article or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation
and floodway information from other federal, state, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other
acceptable information is not available, the elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of
the Floodplain Conservation District that is nearest the
construction site.
[1] In addition to the above, the Borough of East Greenville
may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken
only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical
methods, used correctly, reflect currently accepted

conditions, including irregularity, narrowness, or
shallowness of lot size or shape, or exceptional
§ 95-179.5 WATER § 95-179.6
94:581
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is
due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which
the property is located;
[2] That because of such physical circumstances or
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be
developed in strict conformity with the provisions of the
Zoning Ordinance and that the authorization of a variance
is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property;
[3] That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by
the appellant; and
[4] That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
(b) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(c) That the granting of the variance will:
[1] Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense;
[2] Nor create nuisances, cause fraud on, or victimize the
public, or conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances and regulations.

itself that the proposed change is consistent with the spirit,
purpose and intent of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) Determine that the proposed change will not substantially injure or
detract from the use of neighboring property or from the character
of the neighborhood and that the use of the adjacent property is
adequately safeguarded.
(3) Determine that the proposed change will serve the best interests of
the borough, the convenience of the community (where applicable)
and the public welfare.
(4) Consider the effect of the proposed change upon the logical,
efficient and economical extension of public services and facilities
such as public water, sewers, police and fire protection and public
schools.
(5) Consider the suitability of the proposed location of use with respect
to probable effects upon highway traffic and assure adequate
access arrangements in order to protect major roads from undue
congestion and hazard.
(6) Be guided in its study, review and recommendation by sound
standards of subdivision and land development practice where
applicable.
(7) Impose such conditions and safeguards in addition to those
required as are necessary to assure that the intent of this chapter
and the Comprehensive Plan are complied with, which conditions
may include (but are not limited to) harmonious design of
buildings, planting and its maintenance as a sight or sound screen,

adequate standards of parking, loading and sanitation.

upon the applicant.
§ 95-198 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 95-200
94:610
§ 95-201. Review of challenges and appeals.
(1) The Board may grant a variance, provided that all of the following
findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood
or district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this chapter and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That the unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
applicant.
(d) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property
is located, nor substantially or permanently impair the
appropriate use or development of adjacent property, nor be
detrimental to the public welfare.
(e) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(2) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter.
B. Special exception. The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide
requests for special exceptions in accordance with the standards and
criteria found in the particular section of this chapter that permits
application for said special exception and with the general standards in
§ 95-199 of this article.
C. Burden of proof. For variances, the burden of proof shall be on the
applicant. For special exceptions, the applicant shall be entitled to the
special exception unless others can prove that it would adversely affect
the public health, safety, morals or welfare.
A. Time limitations on appeals:
(1) All appeals from determinations adverse to the landowners shall be
filed by the landowner within 30 days after notice of the
determination is issued.
§ 95-200 WATER § 95-201
94:611
(2) Appeals designed to secure reversal or limit the approval of any
application for development, preliminary or final, shall be filed with
the Board no later than 30 days after the application is approved by
an appropriate municipal officer or agency, unless the person filing
alleges and proves that he or she had not notice, knowledge or
reason to believe that such approval had been given. If such person
succeeded to his or her interest after such approval, he or she shall
be bound by the knowledge of his or her predecessor in interest.
B. Effect of filing. When an appeal is filed, further development or official
action pursuant to the appealed determination or approval shall be
stayed until issuance of a final decision or findings by the Board. If the
Zoning Officer or other municipal agency presents facts to the Board
indicating that such a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, development or official action can only be stayed by
restraining order granted by the Board or by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
C. Substantive validity challenge. A landowner who desires to challenge,
on substantive grounds, the validity of a map or ordinance provision
which prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
or she has an interest may submit the challenge either to the Zoning
Hearing Board or, with a request for curative amendment, to the
Borough Council.
(1) The written application to the Zoning Hearing Board shall contain
the reasons for the challenge.
(2) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the validity of
the ordinance or map is in question and shall specify the place and
time where a copy of the request and its accompanying materials
may be examined by the public.
(3) Based upon the testimony at the hearing(s), the Board shall
determine whether the challenged ordinance or map is defective,
as alleged. If the challenge is found to have merit, the decision of
the Board shall include recommended amendments to the
challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.
(4) In reaching its decision, the Board shall consider the plans and
explanatory material submitted by the landowner and shall also
consider:
(a) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities;
(b) If the proposal is for residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the
proposal in providing housing units of a type actually available
to and affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully
excluded by the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map;
§ 95-201 EAST GREENVILLE CODE § 95-201
94:612
§ 95-202. Expiration.
