PREFACE
The McMinnville Municipal Code contains the codification and revision
of the ordinances of the City of McMinnville, Tennessee. By referring to the
historical citation appearing at the end of each section, the user can determine
the origin of each particular section. The absence of a historical citation means
that the section was added by the codifier. The word "modified" in the historical
citation indicates significant modification of the original ordinance.
The code is arranged into titles, chapters, and sections. Related matter
is kept together, so far as possible, within the same title. Each section number
is complete within itself, containing the title number, the chapter number, and
the section of the chapter of which it is a part. Specifically, the first digit,
followed by a hyphen, identifies the title number. The second digit identifies the
chapter number, and the last two digits identify the section number. For
example, title 2, chapter 1, section 6, is designated as section 2-106.
By utilizing the table of contents and the analysis preceding each title and
chapter of the code, together with the cross references and explanations included
as footnotes, the user should locate all the provisions in the code relating to any
question that might arise. However, the user should note that most of the
administrative ordinances (e.g. Annual Budget, Zoning Map Amendments, Tax
Assessments, etc...) do not appear in the code. Likewise, ordinances that have
been passed since the last update of the code do not appear here. Therefore, the
user should refer to the city's ordinance book or the city recorder for a
comprehensive and up to date review of the city's ordinances.
Following this preface is an outline of the ordinance adoption procedures,
if any, prescribed by the city's charter.
The code has been arranged and prepared in loose-leaf form to facilitate
keeping it up to date. MTAS will provide updating service under the following
conditions:
(1) That all ordinances relating to subjects treated in the code or which
should be added to the code are adopted as amending, adding, or deleting
specific chapters or sections of the code (see section 8 of the adopting ordinance).
(2) That one copy of every ordinance adopted by the city is kept in a
separate ordinance book and forwarded to MTAS annually.
(3) That the city agrees to reimburse MTAS for the actual costs of
reproducing replacement pages for the code (no charge is made for the
consultant's work, and reproduction costs are usually nominal).
When the foregoing conditions are met MTAS will reproduce replacement
pages for the code to reflect the amendments and additions made by such
iv
ordinances. This service will be performed at least annually and more often if
justified by the volume of amendments. Replacement pages will be supplied
with detailed instructions for utilizing them so as again to make the code
complete and up to date.
The able assistance of Sandy Selvage and Bobbie Sams, the MTAS Word
Processing Specialists who did all the typing on this project, and Tracy Gardner,
Administrative Services Assistant, is gratefully acknowledged.

(4) When a violation of this code of ethics also constitutes a violation
of a personnel policy, rule, or regulation or a civil service policy, rule or
regulation, the violation shall be dealt with as a violation of the personnel or
civil service provisions rather than a violation of this code of ethics. (as added
by Ord. #1539, June 2007)

life-threatening infectious diseases which can be transmitted through job related
activities. It is important that both citizens and employees are protected from
the transmission of diseases just as it is equally important that neither is

and illnesses.
The purpose of this policy is to establish a comprehensive set of rules and
regulations governing the prevention of discrimination and potential
occupational exposure to Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), the Human

increased exposure to body fluids from potentially infected individuals. Those
high risk occupations include but are not limited to:
(1) Police and security personnel;
(2) Firefighters;
(3) Sanitation and landfill workers; and
4-8

at high risk per this policy and an occupational exposure determination. (Ord.
#1036, May 1992)
4-403. Administration. This infection disease control policy shall be
administered by the city administrator or his/her designated representative who
shall have the following duties and responsibilities:
(1) Exercise leadership in implementation and maintenance of an
effective infection disease control policy subject to the provisions of this chapter,
other ordinances, the city charter, and federal and state law relating to OSHA
regulations;
(2) Make an occupational exposure determination for all employee
positions to determine a potential and/or possible exposure to blood or body
fluids;
(3) Maintain records of all employees and incidents subject to the
provisions of this policy;
(4) Conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with the
infection disease control policy by municipal employees which may include
interviews and walkarounds;
(5) Coordinate and document all relevant training activities in support
of the infection disease control policy;
(6) Prepare and recommend to the board of mayor and aldermen any
amendments or changes to the infection disease control policy;
(7) Perform such other duties and exercise such other authority as may
be prescribed by the board of mayor and aldermen. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-404. Definitions. (1) "Body fluids" - fluids that have been recognized
by the Center for Disease Control as directly linked to the transmission of HIV
and/or HBV and/or to which universal precautions apply: such as blood, semen,
blood products, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial
fluid, amniotic fluid, and concentrated HIV or HBV viruses.
(2) "Exposure" - the contact with blood or other body fluids to which
universal precautions apply through contact with open wounds, non-intact skin,
or mucous membranes during the performance of an individual's normal job
duties.
(3) "Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)" - a serious blood-borne virus with
potential for life-threatening complications. Possible complications include:
massive hepatic necrosis, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic active hepatitis, and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
(4) "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)" - the virus that causes
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through
sexual contact and exposure to infected blood or blood components and
perinatally from mother to neonate.

(5) "Tuberculosis (TB)" - an acute or chronic communicable disease
that usually affects the respiratory system, but may involve any system in the
body.
(6) "Universal precautions" - refers to a system of infectious disease
control which assumes that every direct contact with body fluid is infectious and
requires every employee exposed to direct contact with body fluids to be
protected as though such body fluid were HBV-or HIV-infected. (Ord. #1036,
May 1992)
4-405. Policy statement. All blood and other body fluids are infectious
for several blood-borne pathogens and some body fluids can also transmit
infections. For this reason, the Center for Disease Control developed the
strategy that everyone should always take particular care when there is a
potential exposure. These precautions have been termed "universal
precautions."
Universal precautions stress that all persons should be assumed to be
infectious for HIV and/or other blood-borne pathogens. Universal precautions
apply to blood, tissues, and other body fluids which contain visible blood.
Universal precautions also apply to semen, (although occupational risk or
exposure is quite limited), vaginal secretions, and to cerebrospinal, synovial,
pleural, peritoneal, pericardial and amniotic fluids. Universal precautions do
not apply to feces, nasal secretions, human breast milk, sputum, saliva, sweat,
tears, urine, and vomitus unless these substances contain visible blood. (Ord.
#1036, May 1992)
4-406. General guidelines. General guidelines which shall be used by
all employees include:
(1) Think when responding to emergency calls and exercise common
sense when there is potential exposure to blood or other body fluids which
require universal precautions.
(2) Keep all open cuts and abrasions covered with adhesive bandages
which repel liquids.
(3) Soap and water kill many bacteria and viruses on contact. If hands
are contaminated with blood or other body fluids to which universal precautions
apply, then wash immediately and thoroughly. Hands shall also be washed after
gloves are removed even if the gloves appear to be intact. When soap and water
or handwashing facilities are not available, then use a waterless antiseptic hand
cleaner according to the manufacturers recommendation for the product.
(4) All employees shall take precautions to prevent injuries caused by
needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp instruments. To prevent needle stick
injuries, needles shall not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand,
removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After
they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades and other sharp
items shall be placed in puncture resistant containers for disposal. The
4-10
puncture resistant container shall be located as close as practical to the use area
and shall be so constructed that they will not spill their contents if knocked over
and will not themselves allow injuries when handled. The containers should not
be over-filled as to allow used needles to protrude.
(5) The city will provide gloves of appropriate material, (usually intact
latex or intact vinyl) quality and size for each affected employee. The gloves are
to be worn when there is contact (or when there is a potential contact) with
blood or body fluids to which universal precautions apply. The use of gloves is
particularly important in the following circumstances:
(a) While handling an individual where exposure is possible
(especially if the individual has active bleeding or abraded or non-intact
skin);
(b) While cleaning or handling contaminated items or
equipment;
(c) While cleaning up an area that has been contaminated with
one of the above;
(d) If the employee has cuts, abraded skin, chapped hands,
dermatitis or the like;
(e) During all cleaning of body fluids and decontaminating
procedures;
(f) During invasive procedures.
Gloves shall not be used if they are peeling, cracked, or discolored, or if
they have punctures, tears, or other evidence of deterioration. Employees shall
not wash or disinfect surgical or examination gloves for reuse.
General purpose utility (rubber) gloves worn by maintenance,
housekeeping, laundry personnel may be decontaminated and reused.
(6) Resuscitation equipment shall be used when necessary. (No
transmission of HBV or HIV infection during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation has
been documented.) However, because of the risk of salivary transmission of
other infectious diseases and the theoretical risk of HIV or HBV transmission
during artificial resuscitation, bags shall be used. Pocket mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation masks designed to isolate emergency response personnel from
contact with a victims' blood and blood contaminated saliva, respiratory
secretion, and vomitus, are available to all personnel to provide or could
potentially provide emergency treatment. Pocket masks, resuscitation bags, or
other ventilation devices shall be provided in strategic locations as well as to
employees in high risk occupation (as defined by this policy) where the need for
resuscitation is likely. This will minimize the need for emergency mouth-tomouth
resuscitation.
(7) Masks or protective eyewear or face shields shall be worn during
procedures that are likely to generate droplets of blood or other body fluids to
prevent exposure to mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. They are
not required for routine care.
4-11
(8) Gowns, aprons, or lab coats shall be worn during procedures that
are likely to generate splashes of blood or other body fluids to skin or clothing.
Gowns shall be made of, or lined with, fluid-proof or fluid-resistant material and
shall protect all areas of exposed skin.
(9) Areas and equipment contaminated with blood shall be cleaned as
soon as possible. A household (chlorine) bleach solution (1 part chlorine to 10
parts water) shall be applied to the contaminated surface as a disinfectant
leaving it on for a least 30 seconds. A solution must be changed and re-mixed
every 24 hours to be effective.
(10) Contaminated clothing (or other articles) shall be handled carefully
and washed as soon as possible. Laundry and dish washing cycles at 120° are
adequate for decontamination.
(11) Place all disposable equipment (gloves, masks, gowns, etc...) in a
clearly marked plastic bag. Place the bag in a second clearly marked bag
(double bag). Seal and dispose of by placing in a designated "hazardous waste"
dumpster. NOTE: Sharp objects must be placed in an impervious container and
then taken to a hospital for disposal.
(12) Tags shall be used as a means of preventing accidental injury or
illness to employees who are exposed to hazardous or potentially hazardous
conditions, equipment or operations which are out of the ordinary, unexpected
or not readily apparent. Biological hazard tags shall be used to identify the
actual or potential presence of a biological hazard and to identify equipment,
containers, or rooms that contain or are contaminated with hazardous biological
agents. Tags shall be used until such time as the identified hazard is eliminated
or the hazardous operation is completed.
All required tags shall meet the following criteria:
(a) Tags shall contain a signal word and a major message. The
signal word shall be "BIOHAZARD", or the biological hazard symbol. The
major message shall indicate the specific hazardous condition or the
instruction to be communicated to employees.
(b) The signal word shall be readable at a minimum distance of
five (5) feet or such greater distance as warranted by the hazard.
(c) The tag's major message shall be presented in either
pictographs, written text or both.
(d) The signal word and the major message shall be
understandable to all employees who may be exposed to the identified
hazard.
(e) Tags shall be affixed as close as safely possible to their
respective hazards by a positive means such as string, wire, or adhesive
that prevents their loss or unintentional removal.
(f) All employees shall be informed of the meaning of the
various tags used throughout the work place and what special
precautions are necessary.
4-12
(13) Linen soiled with body fluids shall be handled as little as possible
and with minimum agitation to prevent contamination of the person handling
the linen. All soiled linen shall be bagged at the location where it was used. It
shall not be sorted or rinsed in the area. Soiled linen shall be placed and
transported in bags that prevent leakage.
The employee responsible for transported soiled linen should always wear
protective gloves to prevent possible contamination. After removing the gloves,
hands or other skin surfaces shall be washed thoroughly and immediately after
contact with body fluids.
(14) Whenever possible, disposable equipment shall be used to minimize
and contain clean-up. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-407. Hepatitis B vaccinations. The City of McMinnville shall offer
the appropriate Hepatitis B vaccination to employees at risk of exposure free of
charge and in amounts and at times prescribed by standard medical practices.
The vaccination shall be voluntarily administered. High risk employees who
wish to take the HBV vaccination should notify their department head who shall
make the appropriate arrangements through the Infectious Disease Control
Coordinator. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-408. Reporting potential exposure. City employees shall observe
the following procedures for reporting a job exposure incident that may put them
at risk for HIV or HBV infections (i.e., needle sticks, blood contact on broken
skin, body fluid contact with eyes or mouth, etc...):
(1) Notify the Infectious Disease Control Coordinator of the contact
incident and details thereof as soon as possible.
(2) Complete the appropriate accident reports and any other specific
form required by the Infectious Disease Control Coordinator.
(3) Arrangements will be made for the person to be seen by a physician
as with any job-related injury.
Once an exposure has occurred, a blood sample should be drawn after
consent is obtained from the source individual from whom exposure occurred
and tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or antibody to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV antibody). Testing of the source individual should
be done at a location where appropriate pretest counseling is available. Post-test
counseling and referral for treatment should also be provided. (Ord. #1036, May
1992)
4-409. Hepatitis B virus post-exposure management. For an
exposure to a source individual found to be positive for HBsAg or who refuses
testing, the employee who has not previously been given the hepatitis B vaccine
should receive the vaccine series. A single dose of hepatitis B immune globulin
(HBIG) is also recommended, if it can be given within seven (7) days of exposure.
4-13
For exposure from an HBsAg-positive source to workers who have
previously received the vaccine, the exposed worker should be tested for
antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and given one dose of
vaccine and one dose of HBIG if the antibody level in the employee's blood
sample is inadequate (ie., 10 SRU by RIA, negative by EIA).
If the source individual is negative for HBsAg and the worker has not
been vaccinated, this opportunity should be taken to provide the hepatitis B
vaccine series. HBIG administration should be considered on an individual
basis when the source individual is known or suspected to be at high risk of
HBV infection. Management and treatment, if any, of previously vaccinated
workers who receive an exposure from a source who refuses testing or is not
identifiable should be individualized. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-410. Human immunodeficiency virus post-exposure
management. For any exposure to a source individual who has AIDS, who is
found to be positive for HIV infection, or who refuses testing, the exposed
employee should be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluated
clinically and serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after
the exposure. The employee should be advised to report and seek medical
evaluation for any acute febrile illness that occurs within 12 weeks after the
exposure. Such an illness, particularly one characterized by fever, rash, or
lymphadenopathy, may be indicative of recent HIV infection.
Following the initial test at the time of exposure, seronegative workers
should be retested six (6) weeks, twelve (12) weeks, and six (6) months after
exposure to determine whether transmission has occurred. During this
follow-up period (especially the first 6 - 12 weeks after exposure) exposed
workers should follow the U.S. Public Health Service recommendation for
preventing transmission of HIV. These include refraining from blood donations
and using appropriate protection during sexual intercourse. During all phases
of follow-up, it is vital that worker confidentiality be protected.
If the source individual was tested and found to be seronegative, baseline
testing of the exposed worker with follow-up testing twelve (12) weeks later may
be performed if desired by the worker or recommended by the health care
provider. If the source individual cannot be identified, decisions regarding
appropriate follow-up should be individualized. Serologic testing should be
made available by the city to all workers who may be concerned they have been
infected with HIV through an occupational exposure. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-411. Disability benefits. Entitlement to disability benefits and any
other benefits available for employees who suffer from on-the-job injuries will
be determined by the Tennessee Worker's Compensations Bureau in accordance
with the provisions of T.C.A. 50-6-303 and any amendments thereto. (Ord.
#1036, May 1992)
4-14
4-412. Training regular employees. On an annual basis all employees
shall receive training and education on precautionary measures, epidemiology,
modes of transmission and prevention of HIV/HBV infection and procedures to
be used if they are exposed to needle sticks or body fluids. They shall also be
counseled regarding possible risks to the fetus from HIV/HBV and other
associated infectious agents. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-413. Training high risk employees. In addition to the above, high
risk employees shall also receive training regarding the location and proper use
of personal protective equipment. They shall be trained concerning proper work
practices and understand the concept of "universal precautions" as it applies to
their work situation. They shall also be trained about the meaning of color
coding and other methods used to designate contaminated materials or
infectious waste. Where tags are used, training shall cover precautions to be
used in handling contaminated material as per this policy. Employees shall
receive training about procedures to be used if they are exposed to needle sticks
or to body fluids. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-414. Records and reports. (1) Reports. Occupational injury and
illness records shall be maintained by the infectious disease control coordinator.
Statistics shall be maintained on the OSHA-200 form. Only those work-related
injuries that involve loss of consciousness, transfer to another job, restriction of
work or motion, or medical treatment are required to be put on the OSHA-200
form.
(2) Needle sticks. Needle sticks, like any other puncture wound, are
considered injuries for recordkeeping purposes due to the instantaneous nature
of the event. Therefore, any needle stick requiring medical treatment (i.e.
gamma globulin, hepatitis B immune globulin, hepatitis B vaccine, etc...) shall
be recorded.
(3) Prescription medication. Likewise, the use of prescription
medication (beyond a single dose for minor injury or discomfort) is considered
medical treatment. Since these types of treatment are considered necessary,
and must be administered by physician or licensed medical personnel, such
injuries cannot be considered minor and must be reported.
(4) Employee interviews. Should the city be inspected by the U.S.
Department of Labor Office of Health Compliance, the compliance safety and
health officer may wish to interview employees. Employees are expected to
cooperate fully with the compliance officers. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)
4-415. Legal rights of victims of communicable diseases. Victims
of communicable diseases have the legal right to expect, and municipal
employees, including police and emergency service officers are duty bound to
provide, the same level of service and enforcement as any other individual would
receive.
4-15
(1) Officers assume that a certain degree of risk exists in law
enforcement and emergency service work and accept those risks with their
individual appointments. This holds true with any potential risks of contacting
a communicable disease as surely as it does with the risks of confronting an
armed criminal.
(2) Any officer who refuses to take proper action in regard to victims
of a communicable disease, when appropriate protective equipment is available,
shall the subject to disciplinary measures along with civil and/or criminal
prosecution.
(3) Whenever an officer mentions in a report that an individual has or
may have a communicable disease, he shall write "contains confidential medical
information" across the top margin of the first page of the report.
(4) The officer's supervisor shall ensure that the above statement is on
all reports requiring that statement at the time the report is reviewed and
initiated by the supervisor.
(5) The supervisor disseminating newspaper releases shall make
certain the confidential information is not given out to the news media.
(6) All requests (including subpoenas) for copies of reports marked
"contains confidential medical information" shall be referred to the city attorney
when the incident involves an indictable or juvenile offense.
(7) Prior approval shall be obtained from the city attorney before
advising a victim of sexual assault that the suspect has, or is suspected of
having a communicable disease.
(8) All circumstance, not covered in this policy, that may arise
concerning releasing confidential information regarding a victim, or suspected
victim, of a communicable disease shall be referred directly to the appropriate
department head or city attorney.
(9) Victims of a communicable disease and their families have a right
to conduct their lives without fear of discrimination. An employee shall not
make public, directly or indirectly, the identity of a victim or suspected victim
of a communicable disease.
(10) Whenever an employee finds it necessary to notify another
employee, police officer, firefighter, emergency service officer, or health care
provider that a victim has or is suspected of having a communicable disease,
that information shall be conveyed in a dignified, discrete and confidential
manner. The person to whom the information is being conveyed should be
reminded that the information is confidential and that it should not be treated
as public information.
(11) Any employee who disseminates confidential information in regard
to a victim, or suspected victim of a communicable disease in violation of this
policy shall be subject to serious disciplinary action as well as civil and/or
criminal prosecution. (Ord. #1036, May 1992)

five days after such conviction. The city, in turn, shall inform the granting or
contracting agency within ten days of such notification by the affected employee.
(Ord. #1058, Nov. 1992)
4-606. Violation of chapter. Failure to comply with the provisions or

systems, hardware, software, tools and information are provided for the purpose
of conducting business for the city.
(1) Allowable uses of electronic systems and information include the
following, to the extent that these uses are for the purpose of conducting City of
McMinnville business:
(a) To facilitate performance of job functions.
(b) To facilitate the communication of information in a timely

4-909. Employee responsibility. The city imposes certain
responsibilities and obligations on employees when using city equipment. The
following serves as a guide for employees when using e-mail.
(1) Employees are expected to maintain the confidentiality of city
information when using the city's computer system to transmit messages.
Employees should protect their individual user ID and passwords from
unauthorized use.
(2) Because the security of electronic messages cannot be guaranteed,
employees should be aware that making a message "confidential" or "private"
in the computer system must be done with the expectation that others may have
access to all messages, including those marked as "confidential" or "private."
Thus, in certain cases, e-mail may not be the proper means of communication.
(3) Employees are expected to demonstrate courtesy and good
judgment in the messages they choose to transmit via e-mail. In general, e-mail
is most appropriate for short informal messages that include some detail
intended for the receiver to keep, for example, to communicate a schedule of
events. Telephone or voice mail are recommended for shorter, less detailed
communication; hard copy letters or memoranda are recommended for longer,
formal communications.
(4) When using the city's computer system, employees are expected to
demonstrate the same high standards that apply to other forms of city
communication. Employees are prohibited from sending messages containing
offensive, abusive, threatening, or other inappropriate language.
(5) Messages that are no longer needed should be deleted from the
system on a regular basis. (Ord. #1311, Feb. 1999)
4-910. Monitoring of electronic mail and Internet use. Electronic
messages transmitted or received (whether current or deleted) information used
or downloaded from the city's computer system, the Internet, or other sources,
may be subject to review and investigation. The city may override any
4-26
applicable password if necessary. Supervisors are responsible for monitoring
performance of employees using e-mail or Internet. E-mail correspondence may
be disclosable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and/or Tennessee
Public Records Law (Tennessee Code Annotated, § 10-7-512). (Ord. #1311, Feb.
1999, as amended by Ord. #1361, Sept. 2000)
4-911. Access to electronic system. All systems may be required to
have only "password" access and any employee using the system shall be
required to have a "password" to use the system. The system shall be restricted
to all other personnel. (Ord. #1311, Feb. 1999)
4-912. Violations of policy. Violations of this policy will be reviewed
on a case-by-case basis and can result in disciplinary action as listed in
Article VII--Disciplinary Actions, § 2., Types of disciplinary actions in the City
of McMinnville's Personnel Rules and Regulations.
Copies of this policy shall be provided to each city department head,
personnel office and shall be posted on the various department's bulletin boards
for a period of ten (10) days before becoming effective. (Ord. #1311, Feb. 1999)

4-1101. Purpose. In providing services to the citizens of the City of
McMinnville, employees may come in contact with life-threatening infectious
diseases which can be transmitted through job related activities. The purpose
of this policy is to have an exposure control plan to assist the City of
McMinnville in implementing and ensuring compliance with the standard,
thereby protecting our employees. (as added by Ord. #1581, Oct. 2008)
4-1102. Coverage. It is the responsibility of the City of McMinnville to
provide all city employees, including but not limited to: full time, part time,
seasonal, temporary, and public safety unit volunteers, a place of employment
which is free from recognized hazards that may cause death or serious physical
harm. (as added by Ord. #1581, Oct. 2008)
4-1103. Program administration. The human resource office is
responsible for the implementation of the exposure control plan. The human
resource office will maintain, review, and update the exposure control plan at
least annually, and whenever necessary to include new or modified tasks and
procedures.
Those employees who are determined to have occupational exposure to
blood or Other Potentially Infectious Materials (OPIM) must comply with the
procedures and work practices outlined in this exposure control plan.
The City of McMinnville will maintain and provide all necessary Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) as required by the standard. The City of
McMinnville will ensure that adequate supplies of the aforementioned
equipment are available in the appropriate sizes.
The human resource office will be responsible for training,
documentation of training, and making the written exposure control plan
available to employees and TOSHA representatives.
Based on tasks employees perform which could result in exposure to
bloodborne pathogens, the determination is made without regard to the use of
PPE.
(1) Tasks. The following tasks and procedures have been determined
to have actual or potential exposure to blood or other potentially infectious
material:
Change 5, February 16, 2011 4-30
(a) Procedures involving direct patient contact at a police or fire
call;
(b) The loading/unloading of garbage;
(c) Work performed around the sewer system;
(d) Assisting an injured person.

routine or reasonably anticipated tasks or procedures performed include actual
or potential exposure to blood or potentially infectious material: firefighters,
police officers, water maintenance employees, wastewater plant employees;
water plant employees, solid waste collection and disposal employees, public
works employees, and parks and recreation employees.
Occupations/positions in which routine or reasonably anticipated tasks
or procedures performed include little or no risk of exposure to blood or other
potentially infectious material: clerical works in all departments. (as added by
Ord. #1581, Oct. 2008)
4-1104. Procedure. (1) Engineering and work practice controls. Used
to prevent or minimize exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Safety devices are
reviewed and evaluated as needed to determine effectiveness and adopted when
appropriate based on exposure occurrences or new safety products available.

have the potential for contact with blood and other potentially infectious
materials. Procedures involving blood or other potentially infectious materials
are to be performed in such a manner as to minimize splashing, spraying, and
aerosolization of these substances.
(a) All body fluids shall be considered potentially infectious.
(3) Hand washing. The single most important means of preventing
transmission of infection. Employees shall use antimicrobial soap provided for
fifteen (15) seconds, applying friction. Rinse under warm water and dry with

or other potentially infectious materials shall be examined prior to servicing or
shipping and decontamination as necessary. If decontamination is not feasible,
a readily observable label must be attached to the equipment stating which
portions are contaminated.
(7) Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Where occupational
exposure remains after institution of engineering and work practice controls,
appropriate personal protective equipment will be used. PPE will be considered
appropriate only if it does not permit blood or other potentially infectious
materials to pass through to each employee's work clothes, street clothes,
undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes under normal
conditions of use.
(a) PPE is provided by the City of McMinnville at no cost to the

appropriate written schedule for cleaning and method of disinfection based
upon the location within the facility, type of surface to be cleaned, type of soil
present, and task or procedures being performed.
(a) Cleaning and disinfection. All equipment and
environmental surfaces are properly cleaned and disinfected after contact
with blood or other potentially infectious materials; work surfaces are
decontaminated with a germicide after completion of procedures, when
surfaces are overtly contaminated, immediately after any spill of blood or
other potential infectious materials; a tuberculocidal disinfectant is used
to clean blood spills; equipment which may have become contaminated
with blood or other potentially infectious materials is checked, cleaned
and decontaminated; reusable items contaminated with blood or other
potentially infectious material are cleaned and decontaminated prior to

full-time employees are offered the vaccination series at no charge to the
employee. A consent or waiver for the vaccine must be signed by employees. If
an employee initially declines the vaccination, but at a later date decides to
receive the series, it will be provided at no cost to the employee. Employees may
contact the human resource office for more information.
(a) Education regarding the risk of bloodborne pathogens and
hepatitis B vaccine is provided to all employees at the time of orientation
and annually.
(11) Post-exposure evaluation and follow-up. In the event of an
exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material (ex. body fluids), or any
puncture wound (ex. needle sticks), notify your department head or supervisor
and contact the human resource office at (931) 473-1209 immediately.
(a) The employee involved should go, as soon as possible, to
River Park ER or a designated medical facility.
(b) The employee and/or his supervisor should contact human
resources as soon as possible (it is preferable, but not required, that the
exposed employee contact human resources).
(c) As with any infectious disease/bloodborne pathogen issue,
appropriate reports should be completed and forwarded to human
resources as soon as the next business day. The employee should contact
human resources to schedule any follow-up doctor's appointments.
(d) If the source is another person he/she should be requested
to subject to a blood chemistry profile that would determine any
communicable disease he/she may have, known or unknown. The City of
McMinnville will cover the costs of said procedure. If the subject in
question consents, he/she should then be transported to River Park ER
for the procedure.
(e) In the event that the subject in question will not consent to
the test, it will not be given at that time. As soon as practical, the exposed
employee's department head in conjunction with human resources will
contact the district attorney's office and initiate the process to have the
court order the test. The department head will communicate as needed
with human resources and the employee until the desired outcome is
achieved.
A confidential medical evaluation, treatment and follow-up after an
occupational exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials will be
Change 5, February 16, 2011 4-33
provided at no cost to the employee through the City of McMinnville's workers'
compensation carrier at the emergency room of the hospital or a physician on
the panel of physicians. The evaluation will include a risk analysis of the
exposure, counseling regarding transmission risk associated with exposure,
counseling regarding post-exposure prophylaxis for HAV/HBV/HCV and HIV,
consent/declination for post-exposure prophylaxis, and an evaluation of reported
illnesses associated with exposure. The employee will be provided with proper
treatment, results of the source individual's blood testing if available, and
health records pertinent to appropriate treatment of employee. (as added by

account. (a) Shortly following the notice of a change of address for a
covered account, the municipality receives a request for new, additional,
Change 5, February 16, 2011 4-39
or replacement goods or services, or for the addition of authorized users

(a) Once potentially fraudulent activity is detected, gather all
related documentation and write a description of the situation. Present
this information to the designated authority for determination.
(b) The designated authority will complete additional
authentication to determine whether the attempted transaction was
fraudulent or authentic.

CHAPTER 13
WIRELESS COMMUNICATION DEVICE POLICY
SECTION
4-1301. Purpose.
4-1302. Policy.
4-1303. Violation.
4-1301. Purpose. As part of the City of McMinnville's commitment to
the safe operation of all motor vehicles and moving machinery used by
employees to conduct city business, a Wireless Communication Device
(hereinafter called "WCD") is not to be used while driving motor vehicles or
operating moving machinery or during any time that doing so may cause risk
of injury to the employee or those around.
For the purposes of this policy, WCDs include, but are not limited to,
wireless phones, computers, on-line email, navigation devices, and any other
information or entertainment services or equipment, whether or not such
devices are provided by or paid for by the City of McMinnville. (as added by
Ord. #1585, April 2009)
4-1302. Policy. If an employee must use a WCD while driving, it should
be used only in a life-threatening emergency and when you can not pull to the
side of the road and stop, and only in accordance with the following guidelines:
(1) Place the WCD where it can be easily reached or viewed, while
keeping your eyes on the road. If you receive an incoming call on the wireless
phone at an inconvenient time, let your voice mail answer it for you.
(2) If an employee must take a telephone call while driving while at
work, pull into a parking lot or off the road onto a wide shoulder and park the
vehicle before retrieving the telephone to make the call. Exercise extreme
caution if pulling onto the shoulder of a busy road.
(3) Where possible, the employee must try to make all necessary calls
before setting off on a trip, or after arriving safely at your destination.
(4) Use common sense. End wireless phone conversations and
discontinue the use of any other WCD during hazardous driving conditions,
especially in heavy traffic, ice, snow, sleet, rain, high wind or wind gust. As a
driver, the employee's first responsibility is to pay attention to the road.
(5) Avoid any activity that keeps you from watching where you are.
Don't take notes, look up phone numbers, or try to reprogram any WCD while
driving.
(6) While driving or operating equipment, don't engage in stressful or
emotional conversations on your wireless phone. Doing so can be dangerous.
Inform anyone that you are talking to that you are driving, and, if necessary,
Change 5, February 16, 2011 4-43
1The Personnel Rules and Regulations Policy is available in the office of
the city recorder.
end phone conversations that have the potential to divert your attention from
the road.
(7) The use of text-messaging, instant-messaging and video messaging
while operating a motor vehicle or operating moving machinery is prohibited.
Employees shall turn off cellular telephones or set them to silent or
vibrate mode during meetings, training, and other times when incoming calls
may be disruptive.
Any use of a WCD for personal use should only be done during breaks and
meal periods. Friends and family should be made aware of this policy. The city
will not be responsible for the loss or damage of personal WCDs brought into the
workplace. Department heads have the right to request that the employee
provide personal cellular telephone bills and usage reports for calls made during
working hours if they have reason to believe that work-hour usage is excessive.
(as added by Ord. #1585, April 2009)
4-1303. Violation. Employees who violate this policy are subject to
disciplinary action as stated in article VII, sections 1 and 2 of the Personnel
Rules and Regulations Manual.1 (as added by Ord. #1585, April 2009)

distress warrant against delinquent taxpayers. Any officer collecting such
delinquent taxes shall charge, recover, and collect from the taxpayer the same
fees and commissions as the law provides in the case of collecting state and
county taxes which are delinquent. (1982 Code, § 6-205)
5-206. Costs and penalties on delinquent taxes.2 (1) Delinquent

apply if required.
(4) Every pet quarantined under this section shall be confined at the
expense of its owner or keeper in a veterinary hospital or at the city animal
shelter, if space is available; provided, however, that, if an animal control officer
determines that the owner or keeper of a pet which must be quarantined has
adequate confinement facilities upon his own premises, the animal control

Change 5, February 16, 2011 10-17
inspection purposes on the fifth and tenth day of the confinement period. If the

animal or animal reasonably suspected of having rabies that is not available for
laboratory diagnosis, the pet shall be considered to have been exposed to rabies.
If the pet has a current rabies vaccination and the first vaccination was
administered not less than three (3) weeks prior to the exposure, it must be
given a booster dose of rabies vaccine within three (3) days (seventy-two (72)
hours) of the exposure and may be returned to the owner. If the pet does not
have a current rabies vaccination or does not get a booster dose within three (3)
days (seventy-two (72) hours) of exposure it shall be destroyed immediately. As
an alternative to destruction, the dog or cat may be quarantined at a licensed
veterinary hospital or approved boarding kennel for a period of six (6) months.

animal shall not relieve the owner thereof from any penalty which may be
imposed for violation of this title. (as added by Ord. #1583, March 2009)
10-502. Notice to owner. Immediately upon impounding an animal,
the animal control department shall make reasonable effort to notify the owner
and inform such owner of the conditions whereby the animal may be redeemed.
If the owner is unknown or cannot be located, the animal shall be assigned an
impoundment identification number and release date. The impoundment
identification number and release date shall be posted on the animal's cage or
kennel at the animal shelter for a minimum of three (3) business days and any
information about the animal, including the time and place of the capture of
such animal and the time and date of posting the notice of impoundment, shall
be available at the city animal shelter by reference to the impoundment
identification number. (as added by Ord. #1583, March 2009)
10-503. Redemption by owner generally. (1) The owner of an animal
impounded under this chapter may redeem the animal and regain possession
thereof within seventy-two (72) hours or three (3) business days after notice of
impoundment is given or posted, as required by § 10-502, by complying with all
applicable provisions of this chapter and paying any fines or penalties, and any
fees, including veterinary fees, and costs as may be set, from time to time, by
ordinance or resolution of the board of mayor and aldermen.
(2) No animal owner may be permitted to adopt his own animal under

Change 5, February 16, 2011 10-20
impounded pursuant to state law or this title. (as added by Ord. #1583, March

shall become the property of the city animal shelter and offered for adoption. A
new adult owner who agrees to comply with this title may acquire an impounded
animal; however, any prospective new owner shall not be an animal dealer who
acquires animals for resale. The prospective new owner must pay any required
fees as may be set by the board of mayor and aldermen. The city will not
purposefully release for adoption any animal that is aggressive, dangerous or
vicious. Fees may be waived at the discretion of the public works director or

shall be deemed to violate the provision of this section and must be returned by
the applicant for re-adoption to the city animal shelter. The animal control
department is authorized to obtain an adoption agreement from an applicant to
implement the provisions of this section.
(3) The city animal shelter shall require from the adopter a
sterilization deposit fee established by the board of mayor and aldermen to
insure that sterilization is obtained in addition to the established adoption fee
if the animal has not been sterilized prior to its being adopted.
(4) No animal which has been impounded by reason of it being a stray
and unclaimed shall be allowed to be adopted from the city animal shelter
during a period of emergency rabies quarantine invoked pursuant to chapter 4
of this title except by special authorization of the director of public works.
(5) Any animal that exhibits fierce, aggressive or dangerous behavior
will not be offered for adoption. (as added by Ord. #1583, March 2009)
10-505. Procedure for redemption or adoption of unvaccinated
pet. (1) Unless proof of a current rabies vaccination can be furnished, every
person who either adopts or redeems a pet at the city animal shelter shall have
his animal vaccinated for rabies. If the owner or adopter wishes to receive the
vaccine for his animal at a veterinary practice of his choice, he will be given a
"proof of rabies vaccination card" at the time of the redemption or adoption. This
card will be stamped with a date stating the maximum time limit allowed to
Change 5, February 16, 2011 10-21
take the dog or cat to the veterinarian of such person's choice for rabies
vaccination. The time limit for dogs and cats four (4) months and older will be
seventy-two (72) hours, with Sundays and holidays excluded. For puppies and
kittens under four (4) months, the animal control officer or his designee will
determine the time limit according to their age within seventy-two (72) hours
of the designated date.
(2) The "proof of rabies vaccination card" will be completed and
returned to the animal shelter by the veterinarian. If this card is not returned
to the animal shelter within the time limit specified on the card, an animal
control officer will be dispatched to retrieve the dog or cat.
(3) The adoption agreement will be completed at the time of the
adoption. If the adopter fails to comply with the agreement, an animal control
officer may be dispatched to retrieve the pet if corrective action has not been
taken by the animal's owner.
(4) Payment for the rabies vaccination provided for in this section will
be the responsibility of the person redeeming or adopting the animal. (as added
by Ord. #1583, March 2009)
10-506. Suspected rabid animals not to be redeemed or adopted.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, animals impounded which
appear to be suffering from rabies shall not be redeemed or adopted, but shall
be dealt with in accordance with chapter 4 of this title. (as added by Ord. #1583,
March 2009)
10-507. Destruction of wounded or diseased animals.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any animal impounded,
which is seriously wounded or diseased (not a rabies suspect) and the owner is
not known or reasonably ascertainable, shall be destroyed immediately. If the
animal has identification, the animal control department shall attempt to notify
the owner prior to disposing of such, but if the owner cannot be reached readily,
and the animal is suffering, the animal control department may destroy the
animal at its discretion in a humane manner. The animal control department
has the authority to humanely destroy severely injured livestock upon the
owner's request or when the owner is unknown. (as added by Ord. #1583,
March 2009)
10-508. Immediate placement for adoption or destruction of
animal surrendered by owner. An animal surrendered by its owner to the

the city structures which are unfit for human occupation or use due to
dilapidation, defects increasing the hazards of fire, accident or other calamities,
lack of ventilation, light or sanitary facilities, or due to other conditions
rendering such dwellings unsafe or insanitary, or dangerous or detrimental to

designated and appointed a "public officer," to be the codes enforcement official
of the city, to exercise the powers prescribed by this chapter, which powers shall
be supplemental to all others held by the codes enforcement official. (1982 Code,
§ 11-1303)
13-304. Initiation of proceedings; hearings. Whenever a petition is
filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five (5) residents
of the city charging that any structure is unfit for human occupancy or use, or
whenever it appears to the public officer (on his own motion) that any structure
is unfit for human occupation or use, the public officer shall, if his preliminary
investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served
upon the owner of, and parties in interest of such structure a complaint stating
the charges in that respect and containing a notice that a hearing will be held
before the public officer (or his designated agent) at a place therein fixed, not
less than ten (10) days nor more than thirty (30) days after the service of the
complaint; and the owner and parties in interest shall have the right to file an
answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give
testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint, and the rules of evidence
prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before
the public officer. (1982 Code, § 11-1304)
13-305. Orders to owners of unfit structures. If, after such notice
and hearing as provided for in the preceding section, the public officer
determines that the structure under consideration is unfit for human occupancy
or use, he shall state in writing his findings of fact in support of such
determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof
an order: (1) if the repair, alteration or improvement of the structure can be
made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the structure (not exceeding
fifty percent [50%] of the reasonable value), requiring the owner, within the time
specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such structure to render it fit
for human occupancy or use or to vacate and close the structure as a place for
human occupancy or use; or (2) if the repair, alteration or improvement of said
structure cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the value of the
structure (not to exceed fifty percent [50%] of the value of the premises),
13-7
requiring the owner within the time specified in the order, to remove or
demolish such structure. (1982 Code, § 11-1305)
13-306. When public officer may repair, etc. If the owner fails to
comply with the order to repair, alter, or improve or to vacate and close the
structure as specified in the preceding section hereof, the public officer may
cause such structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and
closed; and the public officer may cause to be posted on the main entrance of any
dwelling so closed, a placard with the following words: "This building is unfit for
human occupancy or use; the use or occupation of this building for human
occupancy or use is prohibited and unlawful." (1982 Code, § 11-1306)
13-307. When public officer may remove or demolish. If the owner
fails to comply with an order, as specified above, to remove or demolish the
structure, the public officer may cause such structure to be removed and
demolished. (1982 Code, § 11-1307)
13-308. Lien for expenses; sale of salvaged materials; other
powers not limited. The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or
improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public
officer shall, upon the filing of the notice with the office of the register of deeds
of Warren County, be a lien on the property in favor of the city, second only to
liens of the state, county and municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality
for special assessments, and any valid lien, right, or interest in such property
duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice. These
costs shall be collected by the municipal tax collector or county trustee at the
same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected. If the owner
fails to pay the costs, they may be collected at the same time and in the same
manner as delinquent property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the
same penalty and interest as delinquent property taxes. If the structure is
removed or demolished by the public officer, he shall sell the materials of such
structure and shall credit the proceeds of such sale against the cost of the
removal or demolition, and any balance remaining shall be deposited in the
Chancery Court of Warren County by the public officer, shall be secured in such
manner as may be directed by such court, and shall be disbursed by such court
to the person found to be entitled thereto by final order or decree of such court;
provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to impair or
limit in any way the power of the City of McMinnville to define and declare
nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement, by summary proceedings or
otherwise. (1982 Code, § 11-1308)
13-309. Basis for a finding of unfitness. The public officer defined
herein shall have the power and may determine that a structure is unfit for
human occupation and use, if he finds that conditions exist in such structure
13-8
which are dangerous or injurious to the health, safety or morals of the occupants
or users of such structure, the occupants or users of neighboring structures or
other residents of the City of McMinnville; such conditions may include the
following (without limiting the generality of the foregoing): defects therein
increasing the hazards of fire, accident, or other calamities; lack of adequate
ventilation; light; or sanitary facilities; dilapidation; disrepair; structural
defects; and uncleanliness. (1982 Code, § 11-1309)
13-310. Service of complaints or orders. Complaints or orders issued
by the public officer pursuant to this chapter shall be served upon persons,
either personally or by registered mail, but if the whereabouts of such person is
unknown and the same cannot be ascertained by the public officer in the
exercise of reasonable diligence, and the public officer shall make an affidavit
to that effect, then the serving of such complaint or order upon such persons
may be made by publishing the same once each week for two (2) consecutive
weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the city. In addition, a copy of
such complaint or order shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises
affected by the complaint or order. A copy of such complaint or order shall also
be filed for record in the Register's Office of Warren County, Tennessee, and
such filing shall have the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices
provided by law. (1982 Code, § 11-1310)
13-311. Enjoining enforcement of order. Any person affected by an
order issued by the public officer served pursuant to this chapter may file a suit
in chancery court for an injunction restraining the public officer from carrying
out the provisions of the order, and the court may, upon the filing of such suit,
issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final
disposition of the cause; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the
posting and service of the order of the public officer, such person shall file such
suit in the court. Hearings shall be had by the court on such suits within 20
days, or as soon thereafter as possible, and shall be given preference over other
matters on the court's calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issues
raised and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require.
In all such proceedings, the findings of the public officer as to facts, if supported
by evidence, shall be conclusive. Costs shall be in the discretion of the court.
The remedy provided herein shall be the exclusive remedy and no person
affected by an order of the public officer shall be entitled to recover any damages
for action taken pursuant to any order of the public officer, or because of
noncompliance by such person with any order of the public officer. (1982 Code,
§ 11-1311)
13-312. Additional powers of public officer. The public officer, in
order to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter,
shall have the following powers in addition to those otherwise granted herein:
13-9
(1) To investigate conditions of the structures in the city in order to
determine which structures therein are unfit for human occupation or use;
(2) To administer oaths, affirmations, examine witnesses and receive
evidence;
(3) To enter upon premises for the purpose of making examination,
provided that such entry shall be made in such manner as to cause the least
possible inconvenience to the persons in possession;
(4) To appoint and fix the duties of such officers, agents and employees
as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and
(5) To delegate any of his functions and powers under this chapter to
such officers and agents as he or she may designate. (1982 Code, § 11-1312)
13-313. Powers conferred are supplemental. This chapter shall not
be construed to abrogate or impair the powers of the courts or any department
of the city with regard to the enforcement of the provisions of its charter or any
other ordinances or regulations, nor to prevent or punish violations thereof, and
the powers conferred by this chapter shall be in addition and supplemental to
the powers conferred by the charter and other laws. (1982 Code, § 11-1313)

13-406. Failure to comply with notice.

13-401. Prohibition. It shall be unlawful for the owner and/or occupant
of any residential or commercial building, structure, or property within the city
limits of the City of McMinnville to utilize or permit the utilization of the
premises of such property for the open display, storage, stacking, piling or
scattering of any refuse, junk, abandoned motor vehicles or rubbish. It shall be
the duty or responsibility of every such property owner and/or occupant to keep
the premises clean and remove all refuse, junk, abandoned motor vehicles or
rubbish from the premises. (Ord. #1292, June 1998)
13-402. Definitions. (1) An abandoned motor vehicle is one which does
not have lawfully affixed thereto any unexpired license plate or plates and is in
the state of disrepair, wrecked, dismantled, partially dismantled, discarded and
is incapable of being moved under its own power.
(2) Motor vehicle is any vehicle which is designed to be self-propelled
and to travel along the ground, and shall include but not be limited to
automobiles, buses, motor bikes, motorcycles, motor scooters, all terrain vehicles
(ATV's), trucks, tractors, go-carts, golf carts, campers and trailers.
(3) Refuse, junk and rubbish shall include, but not be limited to,
abandoned motor vehicles or parts thereof, machinery or parts thereof,
appliances or parts thereof, glass, building materials, building rubbish, old rope,
rags, paper, bottles, iron or other base metals, all articles discarded or no longer
used as a manufactured article composed of any one or more of the materials
mentioned herein, or any residential or commercial refuse, byproduct, waste or
remains. (Ord. #1292, June 1998)
13-403. Exceptions. This chapter shall not apply to the display of new
or used vehicles by a car dealership or to the temporary storage of vehicles being
repaired by a body shop or repair garage. This chapter shall not apply to any
motor vehicle retained by the owner for antique collection purposes and licensed
13-11
by the State of Tennessee as such a vehicle. This chapter shall also not apply
to the orderly stacking of lumber and materials at lumber yards or building
supply businesses or to the temporary storage of building supplies on the site of
commercial or residential building projects. No exceptions shall invite
plundering, or endanger the health or safety of others, or create a fire hazard,
or materially depreciate the value of the real property of others. (Ord. #1292,
June 1998)
13-404. Notice to remove. Whenever a violation of this chapter shall
come to the attention of the Fire Marshall for the City of McMinnville, or his/her
designee, he/she shall serve a notice in writing to remove the violation upon the
occupant and owner of the property where the violation exists. It shall
constitute sufficient notice when a copy of same is posted in a conspicuous place
upon the property alleged to be in violation of this chapter and duplicate copies
are sent by registered mail to the occupant and owner of the property at
his/their last known address. (Ord. #1292, June 1998)
13-405. Consent of notice. The notice shall fully describe the alleged
violation of this chapter and shall allow the occupant and/or owner of the
property thirty (30) days to remove the violation from the premises prior to any
further action by the fire marshall. (Ord. #1292, June 1998)
13-406. Failure to comply with notice. Any person failing to comply
with the notice to remove within thirty (30) days shall be cited into the
Municipal Court for the City of McMinnville at its next regular convening. (Ord.
#1292, June 1998)
13-407. Penalties. Violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction,
result in imposition of a fine up to $500.00 for each offense, plus the imposition
of costs. Each separate day such violation is continued after the conviction shall
constitute a separate offense. After a conviction for violation of this chapter
becomes final, the City of McMinnville may, at its discretion, choose to enter
upon the offending premises and remove the refuse, junk, abandoned motor
vehicles or rubbish. In that event, the occupant and/or owner shall be jointly
liable to the City of McMinnville for all reasonable costs associated with the
removal of the refuse, junk, abandoned motor vehicles or rubbish. (Ord. #1292,
June 1998)
13-408. Procedure for enforcement of chapter. (1) Notice shall be
sent by the fire marshall or his/her designee to the owner and occupant of the
premises.
(2) If the violation persists beyond the 10 day limit announced in the
notice, then citations to city court should be issued and served on the owner and
occupant.
13-12
(3) A hearing will then be held in city court to determine whether a
violation of the ordinance exists.
(4) If a violation is found, then the court, pursuant to T.C.A.
§ 6-54-308, can penalize the violator up to $500.00, plus costs. This is a
continuing offense and the penalty can be increased per day for as long as the
violation continues. The violator has 10 days to appeal.
(5) After the 10 day time period for appeal has passed, pursuant to
T.C.A. § 6-54-303, in all municipal courts where the judge has entered a
judgment for fines and costs, and the same remain unpaid for (30) days
thereafter, the court is authorized by and through its clerk to issue execution.
The city court clerk should be trained to issue execution. Execution may be had
on the bank accounts of the violators. This option will probably not be effective
after the first withdrawal however, and does not ensure that the property will
be cleaned. The clerk can also issue garnishment of the violators' wages and
levy of execution on the violators' personal and real property.
(6) After the judgment is final, the city can enter the premises and
clean the place. The owner and/or occupant can be charged with the clean up
costs. This will require a second citation to city court to determine the
reasonableness of the costs and obtain a judgment for those costs. This will also
involve the risk of civil action against the city if the violator claims that the
refuse, junk, abandoned motor vehicles and rubbish were his personal treasures
and not junk at all. Careful oversight and documentation should be kept if this
option is pursued.
(7) After the judgment is final, if the city does not wish to undertake
the clean up and attempt to recover the costs, the violator may be held in
contempt for failing to abide by the order of the municipal court. Pursuant to
T.C.A. § 29-9-103, the fine for contempt of a municipal court is $10.00. The
municipal court has the power not only to fine, but also to jail violators for
contempt. According to T.C.A. § 29-9-104, if the contempt consists in an
omission to perform an act which it is yet in the power of the person to perform,
he may be imprisoned until he performs it. This option would require an
agreement with the county for housing of inmates jailed by the municipal court.

extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(c) Flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; by uses

which is inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected
from flood damages.
(2) Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas. This chapter is designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are vulnerable to flooding or
erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood
heights, or velocities;
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community
facilities, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the

(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as
water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in floodprone areas;
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of floodprone areas to minimize blight in
flood areas;
(g) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that
property is in a floodprone area;
(h) To maintain eligibility for participation in the NFIP.

least equivalent strength) that are at least three feet (3') in height
above the highest adjacent grade (as defined in § 14-402).
(c) Any manufactured home, which has incurred "substantial
damage" as the result of a flood, must meet the standards of § 14-405(1)
and (2).
(d) All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and
lateral movement.
(e) All recreational vehicles placed in an identified special flood
hazard area must either:
(i) Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180)
consecutive days;
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its
wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached structures or additions); or
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-28
(iii) The recreational vehicle must meet all the
requirements for new construction.
(4) Standards for subdivisions and other proposed new development
proposals. Subdivisions and other proposed new developments, including
manufactured home parks, shall be reviewed to determine whether such
proposals will be reasonably safe from flooding.
(a) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
(b) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(c) All subdivision and other proposed new development
proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
(d) In all approximate A Zones require that all new subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots
or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals
base flood elevation data (see § 14-405(5)).
(5) Standards for special flood hazard areas with established base flood
elevations with floodways designated. Located within the special flood hazard
areas established in § 14-403(2), are areas designated as floodways. A floodway
may be an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, debris
or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in
order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights
and velocities. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply:
(a) Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill
material, new construction, substantial improvements or other
development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be
permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practices that the cumulative effect of the proposed encroachments or
new development shall not result in any increase in the water surface
elevation of the base flood elevation, velocities, or floodway widths during
the occurrence of a base flood discharge at any point within the
community. A Tennessee registered professional engineer must provide
supporting technical data, using the same methodologies as in the
effective flood insurance study for the City of McMinnville, Tennessee and
certification, thereof.
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 14-405(1) and (2).
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-29
(6) Standards for areas of special flood hazard Zones AE with
established base flood elevations but without floodways designated. Located
within the special flood hazard areas established in § 14-403(2), where streams
exist with base flood data provided but where no floodways have been
designated (Zones AE), the following provisions apply:
(a) No encroachments, including fill material, new construction
and substantial improvements shall be located within areas of special
flood hazard, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of
the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the community.
The engineering certification should be supported by technical data that
conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(b) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 14-405(1) and (2).
(7) Standards for streams without established base flood elevations
and floodways (A Zones). Located within the special flood hazard areas
established in § 14-403(2), where streams exist, but no base flood data has been
provided and where a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions
shall apply:
(a) The administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably
utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from any
federal, state, or other sources, including data developed as a result of
these regulations (see § 14-404(2)(b)), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development in
approximate A Zones meet the requirements of § 14-405(1) and (2).
(b) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other
proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home
parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres,
whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation
data.
(c) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
other sources, require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or
floodproofed to a level of at least three feet (3') above the highest adjacent
grade (as defined in § 14-402). All applicable data including elevations or
floodproofing certifications shall be recorded as set forth in § 14-404(2).
Openings sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of § 14-405(2).
(d) Within approximate A Zones, where base flood elevations
have not been established and where such data is not available from
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-30
other sources, no encroachments, including structures or fill material,
shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or twenty
feet (20'), whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream
bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered professional engineer
is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed
development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base
flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the City of McMinnville,
Tennessee. The engineering certification should be supported by technical
data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering principles.
(e) New construction and substantial improvements of
buildings, where permitted, shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of § 14-405(1) and (2). Within approximate A Zones,
require that those subsections of § 14-405(2) dealing with the alteration
or relocation of a watercourse, assuring watercourse carrying capacities
are maintained and manufactured homes provisions are complied with as
required.
(8) Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones).
Located within the special flood hazard areas established in § 14-403(2), are
areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet (1' – 3') where a
clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions, in addition
to those set forth in § 14-405(1) and (2), apply:
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements of
residential and non-residential buildings shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to at least one foot (1') above as many feet
as the depth number specified on the FIRM, in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified on the FIRM, the
lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least three feet
(3') above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate
automatic equalization of hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls shall
be provided in accordance with standards of § 14-405(2).
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements of
non-residential buildings may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The
structure together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities must be
floodproofed and designed watertight to be completely floodproofed to at
least one foot (1') above the flood depth number specified on the FIRM,
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with
structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. If no depth number is
specified on the FIRM, the structure shall be floodproofed to at least three
feet (3') above the highest adjacent grade. A Tennessee registered
professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-31
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of
practice for meeting the provisions of this chapter and shall provide such
certification to the administrator as set forth above and as required in
accordance with § 14-404(2).
(c) Adequate drainage paths shall be provided around slopes to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
(9) Standards for areas protected by flood protection system (A-99
Zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 14-403(2), are areas of the 100-year floodplain protected by a flood protection
system but where base flood elevations have not been determined. Within these
areas (A-99 Zones) all provisions of §§ 14-404 and 14-405 shall apply.
(10) Standards for unmapped streams. Located within the City of
McMinnville, Tennessee, are unmapped streams where areas of special flood
hazard are neither indicated nor identified. Adjacent to such streams, the
following provisions shall apply:
(a) No encroachments including fill material or other
development including structures shall be located within an area of at
least equal to twice the width of the stream, measured from the top of
each stream bank, unless certification by a Tennessee registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing
and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point within the
locality.
(b) When a new flood hazard risk zone, and base flood elevation
and floodway data is available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the standards established in accordance with
§§ 14-404 and § 14-405. (Ord. #1068, March 1993, as replaced by
Ord. #1572, July 2008, and Ord. #1620, July 2010)
14-406. Variance procedures. (1) Municipal board of zoning appeals.

public. The municipal board of zoning appeals shall adopt rules of
procedure and shall keep records of applications and actions thereof,
which shall be a public record. Compensation of the members of the
municipal board of zoning appeals shall be set by the legislative body.
(c) Appeals: how taken. An appeal to the municipal board of
zoning appeals may be taken by any person, firm or corporation aggrieved
or by any governmental officer, department, or bureau affected by any
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-32
decision of the administrator based in whole or in part upon the
provisions of this chapter. Such appeal shall be taken by filing with the
municipal board of zoning appeals a notice of appeal, specifying the
grounds thereof. In all cases where an appeal is made by a property
owner or other interested party, a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for
the cost of publishing a notice of such hearings shall be paid by the
appellant. The administrator shall transmit to the municipal board of
zoning appeals all papers constituting the record upon which the appeal
action was taken. The municipal board of zoning appeals shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof,
as well as due notice to parties in interest and decide the same within a
reasonable time which shall not be more than forty-five (45) days from
the date of the hearing. At the hearing, any person or party may appear
and be heard in person or by agent or by attorney.
(d) Powers. The municipal board of zoning appeals shall have
the following powers:
(i) Administrative review. To hear and decide appeals
where it is alleged by the applicant that there is error in any order,
requirement, permit, decision, determination, or refusal made by
the administrator or other administrative official in carrying out
or enforcement of any provisions of this chapter.
(ii) Variance procedures. In the case of a request for a
variance the following shall apply:
(A) The City of McMinnville, Tennessee Municipal
Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
(B) Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures as defined, herein, upon
a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary deviation from the requirements of this chapter
to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(C) In passing upon such applications, the
municipal board of zoning appeals shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards
specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept
onto other property to the injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to
flooding or erosion;
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-33
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed
facility and its contents to flood damage;
(4) Importance of the services provided by
the proposed facility to the community;
(5) The necessity of the facility to a
waterfront location, in the case of a functionally
dependent use;
(6) The availability of alternative locations,
not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the
proposed use;
(7) The relationship of the proposed use to
the comprehensive plan and floodplain management
program for that area;
(8) The safety of access to the property in
times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(9) The expected heights, velocity, duration,
rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood
waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
(10) The costs of providing governmental
services during and after flood conditions including
maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water
systems, and streets and bridges.
(D) Upon consideration of the factors listed above,
and the purposes of this chapter, the municipal board of
zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting
of variances, as it deems necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this chapter.
(E) Variances shall not be issued within any
designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during
the base flood discharge would result.
(2) Conditions for variances. (a) Variances shall be issued upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum relief necessary,
considering the flood hazard and the factors listed in § 14-406(1).
(b) Variances shall only be issued upon: a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship; or a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud
on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
(c) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure
Change 5, February 16, 2011 14-34
below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for
flood insurance (as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred
dollars ($100.00)) coverage, and that such construction below the base
flood elevation increases risks to life and property.
(d) The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to FEMA upon request. (Ord. #1068,
March 1993, as replaced by Ord. #1572, July 2008, and Ord. #1620, July

practicably be obtained beforehand. The person shall thereafter apply for a
permit on the first regular business day on which the office of the recorder is
open for business and said permit shall be retroactive to the date when the work
was begun. (1982 Code, § 12-401)
16-402. Applications. Applications for such permits shall be made to
the recorder or such person as he may designate to receive such applications,
and shall state thereon the location of the intended excavation or tunnel, the
size thereof, the purpose thereof, the person, firm, corporation, association, or
others doing the actual excavating, the name of the person, firm, corporation,
association, or others for whom the work is being done, and shall contain an

of restoration, the recorder may increase the amount of the deposit to an amount
considered by him to be adequate to cover the cost. From this deposit shall be
deducted the expense to the city of relaying the surface of the ground or
pavement, and of making the refill if this is done by the city or at its expense.
The balance shall be returned to the applicant without interest after the tunnel
or excavation is completely refilled and the surface or pavement is restored.

There are two primary circumstances that may lead to a request for
acceptance of a street for city maintenance. First, a resident or residents of the
City of McMinnville may petition for the acceptance of an existing or new
private street not shown on an approved and recorded subdivision plat. Second,
a developer may petition for the acceptance of a proposed new street shown on
16-17
an approved and recorded subdivision plat. In both circumstances the street
shall meet the construction standards specified in section 16-606 of this Street
Acceptance and Construction Standards Code. (as added by Ord. #1194, § 1,
March 1996)
16-603. Procedure for approval of streets not shown on an
approved and recorded subdivision plat. All existing or new private
streets not shown on an approved and recorded subdivision plat proposed for
acceptance for city maintenance shall first be reviewed and approved by the
McMinnville Regional Planning Commission prior to being submitted to the
McMinnville Board of Mayor and Aldermen for adoption.
In order to secure the review and approval by the McMinnville Regional
Planning Commission a preliminary street plan/survey shall be submitted to the
regional planning commission. Upon completion of the required street
improvements, said street improvements shall be inspected and approved by the
public works department and a final street plan/survey shall be submitted to the
regional planning commission.

practices (BMP) manual the following publications, which are
incorporated by reference in this ordinance as is fully set out herein:
(i) TDEC Sediment and Erosion Control Manual
(ii) TDEC Manual for Post Construction
(b) This manual includes a list of acceptable BMPs including
the specific design performance criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated
and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the governing body
of the municipality, upon the recommendation of the codes enforcement
office, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitory and local
maintenance experience. Stormwater facilities that are designed,
constructed and maintained in accordance with these BMP criteria will
be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards.
(2) General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless
granted a waiver or judged by the codes enforcement office to be exempt, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management
at all sites:
(a) All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of
stormwater discharge associated with design storms specified in this
ordinance or in the BMP manual and reduce the generation of post
construction stormwater runoff to pre-construction levels. These
practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment
and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops,
parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to
provide treatment for both water quality and quantity.

resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches,
recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional
performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater
management practices.
(d) Stormwater discharges from "hot spots" may require the
application of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention
practices.
(e) Prior to or during the site design process, applicants for land
disturbance permits shall consult with the codes enforcement office to
determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
(f) The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the
BMP manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater facilities.

meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage requirements as identified
in the BMP manual unless the codes enforcement office has granted the
applicant a full or partial waiver for a particular BMP under § 16-704(4).
(b) If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater
control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
codes enforcement office may impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
(4) Stormwater management plan requirements. The stormwater
management plan shall include sufficient information to allow the codes
enforcement office to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project
site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present

consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the person responsible for the

desist all such violations and direct those persons in noncompliance to:

(ii) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action
as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened

violation shall constitute a separate violation.
(3) Measuring civil penalties. In assessing a civil penalty, the director
of the codes enforcement office may consider:

economic deterrent to the illegal activity;
Change 4, June 13, 2006 16-42

persons who use the public rights-of-way, including pedestrians, children, the
aged, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, drivers, persons
performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services, and persons
with disabilities; and

noncompliance. In July, 1990, Environmental Protection Agency amended the
General Pretreatment Regulations requiring all POTW's, with approved
pretreatment programs to develop enforcement response plans. An enforcement
response plan specifies criteria by which POTW personnel can determine the
enforcement action most appropriate to the nature of the violation.
The following enforcement response plan will enable the City of
McMinnville to clearly establish enforcement responsibilities so that they can
react decisively and consistently to specific instances of noncompliance. (1982

construction, or attaining final compliance.
(f) Failure to provide, within forty-five (45) days after their due
date, required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90)
day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules.
(g) Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
(h) Any other violation or group of violations, which may include
a violation of best management practices, which the WWF determines
will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
(i) Continuously monitored pH violations that exceed limits for
a time period greater than fifty (50) minutes or exceed limits by more
than 0.5 s.u. more than eight (8) times in four (4) hours. (1982 Code,
§ 13-302, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept. 1995, and amended by
Ord. #1587, April 2009)
18-203. Responsibilities of control authority personnel.
(1) Inspectors/field personnel. Inspectors/field personnel have the
authority to conduct compliance sampling and inspections, screen compliance
monitoring data, detect noncompliance, inform the pretreatment coordinator of
18-12
violations and immediately respond to noncompliance with informal warnings.
NOV's or other similar citations.
(2) Pretreatment coordinator. The pretreatment coordinator is
responsible for ensuring implementation of the Control Authority's pretreatment
program requirements. Consequently, the pretreatment coordinator is also
responsible for issuing NOV's and administrative orders, assessing fines, and
publishing the list of significant violators.
(3) POTW director/superintendent. The wastewater treatment plant
Superintendent is responsible for compliance with the terms and conditions of
the POTW's NPDES permit and for the overall operation and maintenance of
the POTW, including employee safety, protection of the collection system and
the treatment plant, effluent quality, and sludge use and disposal. Given these
responsibilities, the Superintendent will have authority to issue administrative
orders, terminate service, conduct show cause hearings, and initiate judicial
proceedings.
(4) Control authority attorney. The Control Authority attorney advises
technical and managerial personnel on enforcement matters and orchestrates
the judicial responses deemed necessary by the Superintendent. Consequently,
the attorney should be consulted on all matters requiring the interpretation of
the sewer use resolution and the enforcement response plan. Many Control
Authorities have attorneys prepare model NOV's and administrative orders
which may (with simple modifications) be easily issued by technical staff. In
addition, many Control Authorities also routinely copy the attorney with
administrative orders and fine assessments since further responses against the
user may involve judicial action. (1982 Code, § 13-302, as replaced by Ord.
#1169, § 1, Sept. 1995)
18-204. Determining time frames for enforcement actions and
follow-up. In order for an enforcement action to be effective, it must be timely.
For an action to be timely, the violation must be detected and responded to
promptly after its occurrence. Therefore, review of compliance reports (for both
effluent violations and timeliness) shall be a high priority at the time of their
submission. The Control Authority staff shall review industrial user reports
within five (5) days of receipt. Violations observed by Control Authority field
personnel may receive even swifter attention.
No more than thirty (30) days shall be allowed to elapse between the
detection of the violation(s) and the initiation of an enforcement response. If the
appropriate response is an informal warning or an NOV, the response time may
be much shorter. For example, a NOV should be sent to the noncompliant user
within a week of the violation's detection.
After its initial enforcement response, the Control Authority shall closely
track the industrial user's progress toward compliance. For example, the
Control Authority should not wait several weeks to determine whether a
compliance schedule milestone has been met or to verify that a report which was
18-13
to be submitted within ten (10) days of receiving a NOV was in fact submitted.
Instead, the Control Authority shall make this determination on or about the
milestone date. One method to ensure that user compliance is closely tracked
is to increase the frequency of user self-monitoring. For instance, an
administrative order may increase self-monitoring from once per quarter to once
a month. Similarly, the Control Authority is own inspections of the user's
facility may be increased until consistent compliance is demonstrated. These
follow-up compliance activities shall begin no later than thirty (30) to forty five
(45) days after initial enforcement response is taken. When follow-up activities
indicate that the violation persists or that satisfactory progress is not being
made, the Control Authority shall escalate its enforcement response.
These follow-up enforcement actions shall be taken within sixty (60) to
ninety (90) days of the initial enforcement action. The model enforcement
response guide presents time frames in which enforcement actions shall be
taken. (1982 Code, § 13-304, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept. 1995)
18-205. Applying the enforcement response guide. A
comprehensive enforcement response guide designates several alternative
enforcement options for each type (or pattern) of noncompliance. The Control
Authority personnel who detect noncompliance need only select an appropriate
response from the short list of enforcement options indicated. There are a
number of factors to consider when selecting a response from among these
options:
* Good faith of the user.
* Compliance history of the user.
* Previous success of enforcement actions taken against the
particular user (e.g., if NOV's have not previously succeeded in
returning the user to compliance, an administrative order is the
more appropriate response).
* Violation's effect on the receiving waters.
* Violation's effect on the POTW
Since the remedies designated are all considered appropriate, the Control
Authority must weigh each of the above factors in deciding whether to use a
more or less stringent response.
The Control Authority shall consistently follow the response guide. To do
otherwise sends a signal to industrial users and the public that the Control
Authority is not acting in a predictable manner and may subject the Control
Authority to charges of arbitrary enforcement decision making, thereby
jeopardizing future enforcement.
The following pages present a model enforcement response guide for the
Control Authority. This guide identifies types of violations, indicates initial and
follow-up responses and designates personnel and time frames for these
responses. (1982 Code, § 13-305, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept. 1995)
18-14
18-206. Using the model enforcement response guide. The
enforcement guide is used as follows:
(1) Locate the type of noncompliance in the first column and
identify the most accurate description of the violation.
(2) Assess the appropriateness of the recommended response(s) in
column two. First offenders or users demonstrating good faith efforts may merit
a more lenient response. Similarly, repeat offenders or those demonstrating
negligence may require a more stringent response.
(3) Apply the enforcement response to the industrial user. Specify
corrective action or other responses required of the industrial user, if any.
Column three indicates personnel to take each response and the time frame in
which that response shall be taken.
(4) Follow-up with escalated enforcement action if the industrial user's
response is not received or violation continues.
The Control Authority should remember to maintain all supporting
documentation regarding the violation and its enforcement actions in the
industrial user's file. (1982 Code, § 13-306, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept.
1995)

and Show Cause Order.
18-209. Administrative enforcement remedies1.
(1) Notification of violation. Whenever the superintendent finds that
any industrial user has violated or is violating City of McMinnville's Sewer Use
Ordinance, or a wastewater permit or order issued hereunder, the
superintendent or his agent may serve upon said user written notice of the
violation. Within ten (10) days from the receipt date of this notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the
superintendent. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability
for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation.
(2) Consent orders. The Superintendent is hereby empowered to enter
into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for
the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the
industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified
by the order. Consent Orders shall have the same force and effect as
administrative orders.
(3) Show cause hearing. (a) The Superintendent may order any
industrial user which causes or contributes to violation of City of
McMinnville's Sewer Use Ordinance or order or wastewater permit issued
hereunder, to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place
for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action and the reasons for such
action, and a request that the user show cause why this proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall
be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing.
Such notice may be service on any principal executive, general
partner or corporate officer. In the event a duly notified industrial user
does not appear as noticed, immediate enforcement action may be
pursued.
(b) At any hearing held, testimony taken must be under oath
and either audio recorded or stenographically. The transcript, so
recorded, will be made available to any party of the hearing, and any
member of the public upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
(4) Compliance order. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate City of McMinnville's Sewer
Use Ordinance or a permit or order issued thereunder, he may issue an order
to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a
18-22
specified time period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been installed
and are properly operated. Orders may also contain such other requirements
as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional
self-monitoring, and management practices.
(5) Cease and desist orders. When the Superintendent finds that an
industrial user has violated or continues to violate City of McMinnville's Sewer
Use Ordinance or those contained in any permit issued hereunder, the
Superintendent may issue an order to cease and desist, all such violations, and
direct those persons in noncompliance to:
(a) Comply forthwith;
(b) Comply in accordance with a compliance time schedule set
forth in the order;
(c) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may
be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and terminating the discharge.
(6) Administrative penalties. Any user who is found to have violated
any provisions of City of McMinnville's Sewer Use Ordinance, or the orders and
permits issued hereunder, shall be fined in an amount not to exceed one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation. Each day on which noncompliance
shall occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such
assessments may be added to the user's next scheduled sewer service charge and
the Superintendent shall have such other collection remedies as he has to collect
other service charges.
(7) Emergency suspensions. (a) The Superintendent may suspend the
wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit whenever such
suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge
presenting or causing any of the following conditions:
(i) An imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of persons, or the environment.
(ii) An interference or pass through.
(iii) A violation of any condition of the POTW's NPDES
permit.
(b) Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater permit shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. A hearing will be held within fifteen (15)
days of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension
may be lifted or the user's waste discharge permit terminated. In the
event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension
order, the Superintendent shall take such steps as deemed necessary,
including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or
minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any
individuals. The Superintendent shall reinstate the wastewater permit
18-23
and/or the wastewater treatment, service upon proof of the elimination
of the noncomplying discharge.
(c) An industrial user which is responsible, in whole or in part,
for imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence to the Superintendent prior to the
date of the hearing described in paragraph (b) above.
(8) Termination of permit. Any user who violates the following
conditions of the City of McMinnville Sewer User Ordinance or a wastewater
discharge permit or order, or any applicable or State and Federal law, is subject
to permit termination:
(a) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(b) Failure to report significant changes in operations, or
wastewater constituents and characteristics;
(c) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
(d) Intentional violation of permit conditions.
(9) Judicial remedies. If any person discharges sewage, industrial
wastes, or other wastes into the wastewater disposal system contrary to the
provisions of the City of McMinnville Sewer Use Ordinance or any order or
permit issued hereunder, the Superintendent, through the City attorney, may
commence an action for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief in the Chancery
Court for Warren County.
(10) Injunctive relief. Whenever an industrial user has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of the City of McMinnville Sewer Use
Ordinance or an order or permit issued hereunder, the Superintendent, through
the City Attorney, may petition the Court for the issuance of a preliminary or
permanent injunction, or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains or
compels the activities on the part of the industrial user.
In the event the Superintendent chooses to correct the violation
himself, the cost of such correction may be added to the next scheduled sewer
service charge payable by the person(s) causing the violation. The
Superintendent shall have such remedies to collect these fees as it has to collect
other sewer service charges.
(11) Civil penalties. (a) Any industrial user who has violated or
continues to violate City of McMinnville's Sewer Use ordinance or any
order or permit issued hereunder, shall be liable to the Superintendent
for a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) plus
actual damages incurred by the POTW per violation per day for as long
as the violation(s) continues. In addition to the above described penalty
and damages, the Superintendent may recover reasonable attorney's fees,
court costs, and other expenses including his enforcement activities,
special sampling and monitoring expenses.
18-24
(b) The Superintendent shall petition the Court to impose,
assess, and recover such sums. In determining amount of liability, the
Court shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but
not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude
and duration, any economic benefit gained through the industrial user's
violation, corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history
of the user, and, any other factor as justice requires. (1982 Code,
§ 13-310, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept. 1995
18-210. Criminal violations. (1) Violations generally. (a) Any
industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of City
of McMinnville Sewer Use Ordinance, or any orders, or permits issued
hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 per violation, per day, or imprisonment
for not more than one (1) year or both.
(b) In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be punishable
by a fine not to exceed three thousand dollars ($3,0000.00) per violation,
per day, or imprisonment for not more than three (3) years or both.
(2) Falsifying information. (a) Any industrial user who knowingly
makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any
application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be
maintained pursuant to City of McMinnville Sewer Use ordinance, or
Wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under City of
McMinnville's Sewer Use Ordinance shall, upon conviction, be punished
by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation,
per day, or imprisonment for not more than one (1) year, or both.
(b) In the event of a second conviction, the user shall be
punishable by a fine not to exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per
violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than three (3) years, or
both. (1982 Code, § 13-310, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept. 1995)
18-211. Additional enforcement remedies. (1) Additional
enforcement remedies. The Superintendent shall publish, at least annually in
the largest daily newspaper circulated in the service area, a description of those
industrial users which are found to be in significant violation, as defined in this
plan, with any provisions of the City of McMinnville Sewer Use Ordinance or
any order or permit issued hereunder during the period since the previous
publication.
(2) Performance bonds. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
the City of McMinnville Sewer Use ordinance or any order or previous permit
issued hereunder unless such user first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable
18-25
to the POTW, in the sum not to exceed a value determined by the
Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
(3) Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any industrial user which has failed to comply with the provisions of
the City of McMinnville Sewer Use Ordinance or any order or previous permit
issued hereunder, unless the industrial user first submits proof that it has
obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage
caused by its discharge.
(4) Water supply severance. Whenever an industrial user has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of City of McMinnville's Sewer Use
Ordinance or an order or permit issue hereunder, water service to the industrial
user may be severed and service will only recommence, at the user's expense,
after it has satisfactorily demonstrated consistent compliance.
(5) Informant rewards. The Superintendent is authorized to pay up
to $500.00 for information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by an
industrial user. In the event that the information provided results in an
administrative fine or civil penalty, levied against the user, the Superintendent
is authorized to disperse up to ten percent (10%) of the collected fine or penalty
to the informant. (1982 Code, § 13-311, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1, Sept.
1995)
18-212. Affirmative defenses. (1) Operating upsets. (a) Any industrial
user which experiences an upset in operations that places it in a temporary
state of noncompliance, which is not the result of operational error improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation, shall inform the Superintendent
thereof immediately upon first awareness of the upset. Where such information
is given orally, a written report thereof shall be filed by the user within five (5)
days.
The report shall contain:
(i) A description of the upset, its cause(s) and impact on
the discharger's compliance status;
(ii) The duration of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times of noncompliance, and if the noncompliance is
continuing, the time by which compliance is reasonably expected
to be restored;
(iii) All steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of such an upset.
(b) An industrial user which timely complies with the
notification provisions of this section shall have an affirmative defense to
any enforcement action brought by the Superintendent for any
noncompliance with the City of McMinnville Sewer Use Ordinance, or an
order or permit issued hereunder by the user,'which arises out of
violations alleged to have occurred during the period of the documented
18-26
and verified upset. (1982 Code, § 13-312, as replaced by Ord. #1169, § 1,
Sept. 1995)

18-301. Purpose and policy. This chapter sets forth uniform
requirements for users of the City of McMinnville, Tennessee, wastewater
treatment system and enables the city to comply with the Federal Clean Water
Act and the state Water Quality Control Act and rules adopted pursuant to
these acts. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To protect public health;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater treatment facility, which will interfere with the system operation;
(3) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater
treatment facility that will pass through the facility, inadequately treated, into
the receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the treatment facility;
(4) To protect facility personnel who may be affected by wastewater
and sludge in the course of their employment and the general public;
(5) To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and
sludge from the facility;
(6) To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the facility; and
(7) To enable the city to comply with its National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit conditions, sludge and biosolid use and
disposal requirement, and any other federal or state industrial pretreatment
rules to which the facility is subject.
In meeting these objectives, this chapter provides that all persons in the
service area of the City of McMinnville must have adequate wastewater
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-29
treatment either in the form of a connection to the municipal wastewater
treatment system or, where the system is not available, an appropriate private
disposal system. This chapter shall apply to all users inside or outside the city
who are, by implied contract or written agreement with the city, dischargers of
applicable wastewater to the wastewater treatment facility. Chapter 4 provides
for the issuance of permits to system users, for monitoring, compliance, and
enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures for
industrial users or other users whose discharge can interfere with or cause
violations to occur at the wastewater treatment facility. Chapter 4 details
permitting requirements including the setting of fees for the full and equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the operation, maintenance, and capital
recovery of the wastewater treatment system and from other activities required
by the enforcement and administrative program established herein. (1982 Code,

stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing
plants and any other sewer users who discharge applicable waste
shall submit a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively
control the discharge of FOG and food waste.
(ii) Existing structures. All existing restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery
stores, prisons, jails, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing
plants and any other sewer users who discharge applicable waste
shall be required to submit a plan for control of FOG and food
waste, if and when the superintendent determines that FOG and
food waste are causing excessive loading, plugging, damage or
potential problems to structures or equipment in the public sewer
system.
(iii) Implementation of plan. After approval of the FOG
plan by the superintendent the sewer user must:
(A) Implement the plan within a reasonable amount
of time;
(B) Service and maintain the equipment in order to
prevent impact upon the sewer collection system and
treatment facility. If in the opinion of the superintendent the
user continues to impact the collection system and treatment
plan, additional pretreatment may be required, including a
requirement to meet numeric limits and have surcharges
applied.
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-49
(c) Sand, soil, and oil interceptors. All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations and other sources of sand, soil, and oil shall
install effective sand, soil, and oil interceptors. These interceptors shall be
sized to effectively remove sand, soil, and oil at the expected flow rates.
The interceptors shall be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent impact
upon the wastewater collection and treatment system. Owners whose
interceptors are deemed to be ineffective by the superintendent may be
asked to change the cleaning frequency or to increase the size of the
interceptors. Owners or operators of washing facilities will prevent the
inflow of rainwater into the sanitary sewers.
(d) Laundries. Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning,
that prevents passage into the sewer system of solids one-half inch (1/2")

to the system.
(e) Control equipment. The equipment of facilities installed to
control FOG, food waste, sand and soil, must be designed in accordance
with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation
engineering standards or applicable city guidelines. Underground
equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater and easily
accessible to allow regular maintenance. Control equipment shall be
maintained by the owner or operator of the facility so as to prevent a
stoppage of the public sewer, and the accumulation of FOG in the lines,
pump stations and treatment plant. If the city is required to clean out the
public sewer lines as a result of a stoppage resulting from poorly
maintained control equipment, the property owner shall be required to
refund the labor, equipment, materials and overhead costs to the city.
Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit or restrict any
other remedy the city has under this chapter, or state or federal law. The
city retains the right to inspect and approve installation of control
equipment.
(f) Solvents prohibited. The use of degreasing or line cleaning
products containing petroleum based solvents is prohibited. The use of
other products for the purpose of keeping FOG dissolved or suspended

or the city may seek further remedies as needed to protect the collection system,
treatment plant, receiving stream and public health including the issuance of
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-50
discharge permits according to chapter 4. Repeated or continuous violation of this
chapter is declared to be a public nuisance and may result in legal action against
the property owner and/or occupant and the service line disconnected from sewer
main. Upon notice by the superintendent that a violation has or is occurring, the
user shall immediately take steps to stop or correct the violation. The city may
take any or all the following remedies:
(1) Cite the user to city or general sessions court, where each day of
violation shall constitute a separate offense.
(2) In an emergency situation where the superintendent has
determined that immediate action is needed to protect the public health, safety
or welfare, a public water supply or the facilities of the sewerage system, the
superintendent may discontinue water service or disconnect sewer service.
(3) File a lawsuit in chancery court or any other court of competent
jurisdiction seeking damages against the user, and further seeking an injunction
prohibiting further violations by user.

(6) Protection of treatment plant influent. The pretreatment
coordinator shall monitor the treatment works influent for each parameter in
§ 18-309 Table A - Plant Protection Criteria. Industrial users shall be subject to
reporting and monitoring requirements regarding these parameters as set forth
in this chapter. In the event that the influent at the WWF reaches or exceeds the
levels established by Table A or subsequent criteria calculated as a result of
changes in pass through limits issued by the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation, the pretreatment coordinator shall initiate
technical studies to determine the cause of the influent violation and shall
recommend to the city the necessary remedial measures, including, but not
limited to, recommending the establishment of new or revised local limits, best
management practices, or other criteria used to protect the WWF. The
pretreatment coordinator shall also recommend changes to any of these criteria
in the event that: the WWF effluent standards are changed, there are changes
in any applicable law or regulation affecting same, or changes are needed for
more effective operation of the WWF.
(7) User inventory. The superintendent will maintain an up-to-date
inventory of users whose waste does or may fall into the requirements of this
chapter, and will notify the users of their status.
(8) Right to establish more restrictive criteria. No statement in this
chapter is intended or may be construed to prohibit the pretreatment coordinator
from establishing specific wastewater discharge criteria which are more
restrictive when wastes are determined to be harmful or destructive to the
facilities of the WWF or to create a public nuisance, or to cause the discharge of
the WWF to violate effluent or stream quality standards, or to interfere with the
use or handling of sludge, or to pass through the WWF resulting in a violation
of the NPDES permit, or to exceed industrial pretreatment standards for
discharge to municipal wastewater treatment systems as imposed or as may be
imposed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and/or
the United States Environmental Protection Agency. (1982 Code, § 13-501, as
deleted by Ord. #1169, Sept. 1995, and replaced by Ord. #1587, April 2009)
18-402. Discharge permits. (1) Application for discharge of commercial
or industrial wastewater. All users or prospective users which generate
commercial or industrial wastewater shall make application to the
superintendent for connection to the municipal wastewater treatment system.
It may be determined through the application that a user needs a discharge

permit according to the provisions of federal and state laws and regulations.
Applications shall be required from all new dischargers as well as for any
existing discharger desiring additional service or where there is a planned
change in the industrial or wastewater treatment process. Connection to the city
sewer or changes in the industrial process or wastewater treatment process shall
not be made until the application is received and approved by the
superintendent, the building sewer is installed in accordance with § 18-306 of
this title and an inspection has been performed by the superintendent or his
representative.
The receipt by the city of a prospective customer's application for
connection shall not obligate the city to render the connection. If the service
applied for cannot be supplied in accordance with this chapter and the city's rules
and regulations and general practice, the connection charge will be refunded in
full, and there shall be no liability of the city to the applicant for such service.
(2) Industrial wastewater discharge permits. (a) General
requirements. All industrial users proposing to connect to or to contribute
to the WWF shall apply for service and apply for a discharge permit before
connecting to or contributing to the WWF. All existing industrial users
connected to or contributing to the WWF may be required to apply for a
permit within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this
chapter.
(b) Applications. Applications for wastewater discharge permits
shall be required as follows:
(i) Users required by the superintendent to obtain a

Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-58
for wastewater discharge permit submit plans, specifications and
other pertinent information relative to the proposed construction to
the pretreatment coordinator for approval. A wastewater discharge
permit shall not be issued until such plans and specifications are
approved. Approval of such plans and specifications shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the city under the
provisions of this chapter.
(iv) If additional pretreatment and/or operations and
maintenance will be required to meet the pretreatment standards,
the application shall include the shortest schedule by which the
user will provide such additional pretreatment. The completion

Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-60
(d) Permit modification. The terms and conditions of the permit
may be subject to modification by the pretreatment coordinator during the
term of the permit as limitations or requirements are modified or other
just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes in
this permit at least sixty (60) days prior to the effective date of change.
Except in the case where federal deadlines are shorter, in which case the
federal rule must be followed. Any changes or new conditions in the permit
shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
(e) Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five (5) years. A permit may be issued for a period

shall apply for permit renewal a minimum of one hundred eighty (180)
days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit.
(f) Permit transfer. Wastewater discharge permits are issued
to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit
shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user,
different premises, or a new or changed operation without the written
approval of the city. Any succeeding owner or user shall also comply with
the terms and conditions of the existing permit. The permit holder must
provide the new owner with a copy of the current permit.
(g) Revocation of permit. Any permit issued under the
provisions of this chapter is subject to be modified, suspended, or revoked
in whole or in part during its term for cause including, but not limited to,
the following:
(i) Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater
discharge permit or other applicable federal, state, or local law or
regulation.
(ii) Obtaining a permit by misrepresentation or failure to

(iii) A change in: (A) Any condition that requires either a
temporary or permanent reduction or elimination of the
permitted discharge;
(B) Strength, volume, or timing of discharges;
(C) Addition or change in process lines generating
wastewater.
(iv) Intentional failure of a user to accurately report the
discharge constituents and characteristics or to report significant
changes in plant operations or wastewater characteristics.
(3) Confidential information. All information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspection shall be available to the public or any
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and
is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the pretreatment coordinator that the
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-61
release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the users.
When requested by the person furnishing the report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available to
governmental agencies for use; related to this chapter or the city's or user's
NPDES permit. Provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be
available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.
Information accepted by the pretreatment coordinator as confidential shall
not be transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the
pretreatment coordinator until and unless prior and adequate notification is
given to the user. (1982 Code, § 13-502, as deleted by Ord. #1169, Sept. 1995,
and replaced by Ord. #1587, April 2009)
18-403. Industrial user additional requirements. (1) Monitoring
facilities. The installation of a monitoring facility shall be required for all
industrial users. A monitoring facility shall be a manhole or other suitable
facility approved by the pretreatment coordinator.
When in the judgment of the pretreatment coordinator, there is a
significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced
by different operations of a single user the pretreatment coordinator may require
that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate source of
discharge.
Monitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed
and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable
inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewater produced by a user.
If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the pretreatment
coordinator, it shall be provided and installed at the user's expense.
The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the
user's premises outside of the building. The pretreatment coordinator may,
however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on
the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street right-of-way with
the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction of that right-of-way and
located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility,
sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition at the expenses of the user.
(2) Sample methods. All samples collected and analyzed pursuant to
this regulation shall be conducted using protocols (including appropriate
preservation) specified in the current edition of 40 CFR 136 and appropriate EPA
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-62
guidance. Multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period
may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenol, and
sulfide the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the control authority, as appropriate.
(3) Representative sampling and housekeeping. All wastewater
samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring
and flow measuring facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and in good
working order at all times. The failure of the user to keep its monitoring facilities
in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(4) Proper operation and maintenance. The user shall at all times
properly operate and maintain the equipment and facilities associated with spill
control, wastewater collection, treatment, sampling and discharge. Proper
operation and maintenance includes adequate process control as well as adequate
testing and monitoring quality assurance.
(5) Inspection and sampling. The city may inspect the facilities of any
user to ascertain whether the purpose of this chapter is being met and all
requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where
wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city or its representative
ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose
of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance
of any of its duties. The city, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to
set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling
inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. The city will
utilize qualified city personnel or a private laboratory to conduct compliance
monitoring. Where a user has security measures in force which would require
proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibility.
(6) Safety. While performing the necessary work on private properties,
the pretreatment coordinator or duly authorized employees of the city shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the company
and the company shall be held harmless for injury or death to the city employees
and the city shall indemnify the company against loss or damage to its property
by city employees and against liability claims and demands for personal injury
or property damage asserted against the company and growing out of the
monitoring and sampling operation, except as such may be caused by negligence
or failure of the company to maintain safe conditions.
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-63
(7) New sources. New sources of discharges to the WWF shall have in
full operation all pollution control equipment at start up of the industrial process
and be in full compliance of effluent standards within ninety (90) days of start
up of the industrial process.
(8) Slug discharge evaluations. Evaluations will be conducted of each
significant industrial user according to the state and federal regulations. Where
it is determined that a slug discharge control plan is needed, the user shall
prepare that plan according to the appropriate regulatory guidance.
(9) Accidental discharges or slug discharges. (a) Protection from
accidental or slug discharge. All industrial users shall provide such
facilities and institute such procedures as are reasonably necessary to
prevent or minimize the potential for accidental or slug discharge into the
WWF of waste regulated by this chapter from liquid or raw material
storage areas, from truck and rail car loading and unloading areas, from
in-plant transfer or processing and materials handling areas, and from
diked areas or holding ponds of any waste regulated by this chapter.
Detailed plans showing the facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the pretreatment coordinator before the facility is
constructed. The review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility to provide the protection necessary to meet the
requirements of this chapter.
(b) Notification of accidental discharge or slug discharge. Any
person causing or suffering from any accidental discharge or slug
discharge shall immediately notify the pretreatment coordinator in
person, or by the telephone to enable countermeasures to be taken by the
pretreatment coordinator to minimize damage to the WWF, the health and
welfare of the public, and the environment. This notification shall be
followed, within five (5) days of the date of occurrence, by a detailed
written statement describing the cause of the accidental discharge and the
measures being taken to prevent future occurrence. Such notification shall
not relieve the user of liability for any expense, loss, or damage to the
WWF, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed by this chapter or state or federal law.
(c) Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted
on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees
whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall
ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous
discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
(1982 Code, § 13-503, as deleted by Ord. #1169, Sept. 1995, and replaced
by Ord. #1587, April 2009)
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-64
18-404. Reporting requirements. Users, whether permitted or
non-permitted may be required to submit reports detailing the nature and
characteristics of their discharges according to the following subsections. Failure
to make a requested report in the specified time is a violation subject to
enforcement actions under § 18-405.
(1) Baseline monitoring report. (a) Within either one hundred eighty
(180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard,
or the final administrative decision on a category determination under
Tennessee Rule 1200-4-14-.06(1)(d), whichever is later, existing categorical
industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the
WWF shall submit to the superintendent a report which contains the
information listed in subsection (b), below. At least ninety (90) days prior
to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that
become categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an
applicable categorical standard, shall submit to the superintendent a
report which contains the information listed in subsection (b), below. A
new source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to
meet applicable categorical standards. A new source also shall give
estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be
discharged.
(b) Users described above shall submit the information set forth
below.
(i) Identifying information. The user name, address of
the facility including the name of operators and owners.
(ii) Permit information. A listing of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.
(iii) Description of operations. A brief description of the
nature, average rate of production (including each product produced
by type, amount, processes, and rate of production), and standard
industrial classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such
user. This description should include a schematic process diagram,
which indicates points of discharge to the WWF from the regulated
processes.
(iv) Flow measurement. Information showing the
measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other
streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream
formula.
(v) Measurement of pollutants. (A) The categorical
pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process
and any new categorically regulated processes for existing
sources.
(B) The results of sampling and analysis identifying
the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-65
by the standard or by the superintendent, of regulated
pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process.
(C) Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term
average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be
reported.
(D) The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with
procedures set out in 40 CFR 136 and amendments, unless
otherwise specified in an applicable categorical standard.
Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or
pollution prevention alternative, the user shall submit
documentation as required by the superintendent or the
applicable standards to determine compliance with the
standard.
(E) The user shall take a minimum of one (1)
representative sample to compile that data necessary to
comply with the requirements of this paragraph.
(F) Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist, or
immediately downstream from the regulated process if no
pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the
regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the user should
measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use
of the combined wastestream formula to evaluate compliance
with the pretreatment standards.
(G) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR 136 or other approved methods.
(H) The superintendent may allow the submission
of a baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long
as the data provides information sufficient to determine the
need for industrial pretreatment measures;
(I) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date
and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall
certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of
normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the
WWF.
(c) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
duly authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional,
indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent
basis, and, if not, whether additional Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(d) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or
O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-66
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment
and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall
not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable
pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section
must meet the requirements set out in § 18-404(2) of this chapter.
(e) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring
reports must be certified in accordance with § 18-404(14) of this chapter
and signed by the duly authorized representative.
(2) Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to the compliance schedule required by § 18-404(1)(d) of this chapter:
(a) The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form
of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include,
but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and
final plans, executing contracts or major components, commencing and
completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
(b) No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
(c) The user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent
no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule;
(d) In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between
such progress reports to the superintendent.
(3) Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the WWF, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the superintendent a report containing the information described in
§ 18-404(1)(b)(iv) of this chapter. For all other users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the
user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection (14) of this
section. All sampling will be done in conformance with subsection (11).
(4) Periodic compliance reports. (a) All significant industrial users
must, at a frequency determined by the superintendent submit no less
than twice per year (April 10 and October 10) reports indicating the
nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-67
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best Management
Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the superintendent or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
(b) All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified
in accordance with this title.
(c) All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall
be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order
at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
(d) If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the superintendent, using the
procedures prescribed in subsection (11) of this section, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
(5) Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
superintendent of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least sixty
(60) days before the change.
(a) The superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 18-401 of this chapter.
(b) The superintendent may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under § 18-402 of this chapter or modify an existing
wastewater discharge permit under § 18-402 of this chapter in response
to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(6) Report of potential problems. (a) In the case of any discharge,
including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a
nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, a slug
discharge or slug load, that might cause potential problems for the POTW,
the user shall immediately telephone and notify the superintendent of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken
by the user.
(b) Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
might be incurred as a result of damage to the WWF, natural resources,
or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-68
relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this chapter.
(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event
of a discharge described in subsection (a), above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised
of the emergency notification procedure.
(d) Significant industrial users are required to notify the
superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
(7) Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain
an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to
the superintendent as the superintendent may require to determine users status
as non-permitted.
(8) Notice of violations/repeat sampling and reporting. Where a
violation has occurred, another sample shall be conducted within thirty (30) days
of becoming aware of the violation, either a repeat sample or a regularly
scheduled sample that falls within the required time frame. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.
The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of
the repeat analysis to the superintendent within thirty (30) days after becoming
aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the
city performs sampling at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city
performs sampling at the user's facility between the time when the initial
sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the city receives the
results of this sampling, or if the city has performed the sampling and analysis
in lieu of the industrial user.
(9) Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. (a) Any user who
commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the
EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous
waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous
waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If
the user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents
contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of
such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar
month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-69
notifications must take place no later than one hundred eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.
However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under
§ 18-404(5) of this chapter. The notification requirement in this section
does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to
categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring
requirements of §§ 18-404(1), 18-404(3), and 18-404(4) of this chapter.
(b) Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of
subsection (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes
are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires
a one (1) time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.
(c) In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such
substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
(d) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.
(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a
permit issued there under, or any applicable federal or state law.
(10) Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application
or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40
CFR part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not
contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where
the EPA determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
(11) Sample collection. Samples collected to satisfy reporting
requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-70
analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that
is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
(a) Except as indicated in subsections (b) and (c) below, the user
must collect wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour
flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the superintendent.
Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the city, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior
to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the
samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile
organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies
may be authorized by the city, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
(b) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using
grab collection techniques.
(c) For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
ninety (90) day compliance reports required in subsections (1) and (3) of
this section, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the
superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required
by subsection (4) of this section, the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
(12) Date of receipt of reports. Written reports will be deemed to have
been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, the
date of receipt of the report shall govern.
(13) Recordkeeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records
of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established under
§ 18-408. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-71
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or
the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention
period by the superintendent.
(14) Certification statements. Signature and certification. All reports
associated with compliance with the pretreatment program shall be signed by the
duly authorized representative and shall have the following certification
statement attached:
I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in
accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel
properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my
inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons
directly responsible for gathering the information, the information
submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and
complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting
false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for
knowing violations.
Reports required to have signatures and certification statement include,
permit applications, periodic reports, compliance schedules, baseline monitoring,
reports of accidental or slug discharges, and any other written report that may
be used to determine water quality and compliance with local, state, and federal
requirements. (1982 Code, § 13-504, as deleted by Ord. #1169, Sept. 1995, and
replaced by Ord. #1587, April 2009)
18-405. Enforcement and abatement, complaints and orders.
Under the authority of Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-123, et seq.:
(1) Complaints; notification of violation; orders. (a) (i) Whenever the
local administrative officer has reason to believe that a violation of
any provision of the McMinnville Wastewater Regulations,
pretreatment program, or of orders of the local hearing authority
issued under it has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur, the
local administrative officer may cause a written complaint to be
served upon the alleged violator or violators.
(ii) The complaint shall specify the provision or provisions
of the pretreatment program or order alleged to be violated or about
to be violated and the facts alleged to constitute a violation, may
order that necessary corrective action be taken within a reasonable
time to be prescribed in the order, and shall inform the violators of
the opportunity for a hearing before the local hearing authority.
(iii) Any such order shall become final and not subject to
review unless the alleged violators request by written petition a
hearing before the local hearing authority as provided in
§ 18-405(2), no later than thirty (30) days after the date the order
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-72
is served; provided, that the local hearing authority may review the
final order as provided in Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-123(a)(3).
(iv) Notification of violation. Notwithstanding the
provisions of subsections (i) through (iii), whenever the
pretreatment coordinator finds that any user has violated or is
violating this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment requirements, the city
or its agent may serve upon the user a written notice of violation.
Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of this notice, the user shall
submit to the pretreatment coordinator an explanation of the
violation and a plan for its satisfactory correction and prevention
including specific actions. Submission of this plan in no way
relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section limits
the authority of the city to take any action, including emergency
actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
(b) (i) When the local administrative officer finds that a user
has violated or continues to violate this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, any order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, he may issue one (1) of the
following orders. These orders are not prerequisite to taking any
other action against the user.
(A) Compliance order. An order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not
come into compliance within the specified time, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and
properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including
additional self-monitoring, and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline
for compliance established for a federal pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order release
the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation.
(B) Cease and desist order. An order to the user
directing it to cease all such violations and directing it to
immediately comply with all requirements and take needed
remedial or preventive action to properly address a
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-73
continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
(C) Consent order. Assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other documents establishing an agreement
with the user responsible for noncompliance, including
specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified in the order.
(D) Emergency order. (1) Whenever the local
administrative officer finds that an emergency exists
imperatively requiring immediate action to protect the
public health, safety, or welfare, the health of
animals, fish or aquatic life, a public water supply, or
the facilities of the WWF, the local administrative
officer may, without prior notice, issue an order
reciting the existence of such an emergency and
requiring that any action be taken as the local
administrative officer deems necessary to meet the
emergency.
(2) If the violator fails to respond or is
unable to respond to the order, the local
administrative officer may take any emergency action
as the local administrative officer deems necessary, or
contract with a qualified person or persons to carry
out the emergency measures. The local administrative
officer may assess the person or persons responsible
for the emergency condition for actual costs incurred
by the city in meeting the emergency.
(ii) Appeals from orders of the local administrative officer.
(A) Any user affected by any order of the local
administrative officer in interpreting or implementing the
provisions of this chapter may file with the local
administrative officer a written request for reconsideration
within thirty (30) days of the order, setting forth in detail the
facts supporting the user's request for reconsideration.
(B) If the ruling made by the local administrative
officer is unsatisfactory to the person requesting
reconsideration, he may, within thirty (30) days, file a
written petition with the local hearing authority as provided
in subsection (2). The local administrative officer's order
shall remain in effect during the period of reconsideration.
(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided, any notice,
complaint, order, or other instrument issued by or under authority of this
section may be served on any named person personally, by the local
administrative officer or any person designated by the local administrative
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-74
officer, or service may be made in accordance with Tennessee statutes
authorizing service of process in civil action. Proof of service shall be filed
in the office of the local administrative officer.
(2) Hearings. (a) Any hearing or rehearing brought before the local
hearing authority shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
(i) Upon receipt of a written petition from the alleged
violator pursuant to this subsection, the local administrative officer
shall give the petitioner thirty (30) days' written notice of the time
and place of the hearing, but in no case shall the hearing be held
more than sixty (60) days from the receipt of the written petition,
unless the local administrative officer and the petitioner agree to a
postponement;
(ii) The hearing may be conducted by the local hearing
authority at a regular or special meeting. A quorum of the local
hearing authority must be present at the regular or special meeting
to conduct the hearing;
(iii) A verbatim record of the proceedings of the hearings
shall be taken and filed with the local hearing authority, together
with the findings of fact and conclusions of law made under
subsection (a)(vi). The recorded transcript shall be made available
to the petitioner or any party to a hearing upon payment of a charge
set by the local administrative officer to cover the costs of
preparation;
(iv) In connection with the hearing, the chair shall issue
subpoenas in response to any reasonable request by any party to
the hearing requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses
and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in
the hearing. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a notice of
hearing or subpoena issued under this section, the Chancery Court
of Warren County has jurisdiction upon the application of the local
hearing authority or the local administrative officer to issue an
order requiring the person to appear and testify or produce evidence
as the case may require, and any failure to obey an order of the
court may be punished by such court as contempt;
(v) Any member of the local hearing authority may
administer oaths and examine witnesses;
(vi) On the basis of the evidence produced at the hearing,
the local hearing authority shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law and enter decisions and orders that, in its
opinion, will best further the purposes of the pretreatment
program. It shall provide written notice of its decisions and orders
to the alleged violator. The order issued under this subsection shall
be issued by the person or persons designated by the chair no later
than thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing;
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-75
(vii) The decision of the local hearing authority becomes
final and binding on all parties unless appealed to the courts as
provided in subsection (b).
(viii) Any person to whom an emergency order is directed
under § 18-405(1)(b)(i)(D) shall comply immediately, but on petition
to the local hearing authority will be afforded a hearing as soon as
possible. In no case will the hearing be held later than three (3)
days from the receipt of the petition by the local hearing authority.
(b) An appeal may be taken from any final order or other final
determination of the local hearing authority by any party who is or may
be adversely affected, including the pretreatment agency. Appeal must be
made to the chancery court under the common law writ of certiorari set
out in Tennessee Code Annotated, § 27-8-101, et seq. within sixty (60) days
from the date the order or determination is made.
(c) Show cause hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of
subsections (a) or (b), the pretreatment coordinator may order any user
that causes or contributes to violation(s) of this chapter, wastewater
discharge permits, or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirements, to appear before the local administrative officer
and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken.
Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for the action, and
a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or
by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10)
days prior to the hearing. The notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user. Whether or not the user appears as ordered,
immediate enforcement action may be pursued following the hearing date.
A show cause hearing shall not be prerequisite for taking any other action
against the user. A show cause hearing may be requested by the
discharger prior to revocation of a discharge permit or termination of
service.
(3) Violations, administrative civil penalty. Under the authority of
Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-125:
(a) (i) Any person including, but not limited to, industrial
users, who does any of the following acts or omissions is subject to
a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for
each day during which the act or omission continues or occurs:
(A) Unauthorized discharge, discharging without a
permit;
(B) Violates an effluent standard or limitation;
(C) Violates the terms or conditions of a permit;
(D) Fails to complete a filing requirement;
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-76
(E) Fails to allow or perform an entry, inspection,
monitoring or reporting requirement;
(F) Fails to pay user or cost recovery charges; or
(G) Violates a final determination or order of the
local hearing authority or the local administrative officer.
(ii) Any administrative civil penalty must be assessed in
the following manner:
(A) The local administrative officer may issue an
assessment against any person or industrial user responsible
for the violation;
(B) Any person or industrial user against whom an
assessment has been issued may secure a review of the
assessment by filing with the local administrative officer a
written petition setting forth the grounds and reasons for the
violator's objections and asking for a hearing in the matter
involved before the local hearing authority and, if a petition
for review of the assessment is not filed within thirty (30)
days after the date the assessment is served, the violator is
deemed to have consented to the assessment and it becomes
final;
(C) Whenever any assessment has become final
because of a person's failure to appeal the assessment, the
local administrative officer may apply to the appropriate
court for a judgment and seek execution of the judgment, and
the court, in such proceedings, shall treat a failure to appeal
the assessment as a confession of judgment in the amount of
the assessment;
(D) In assessing the civil penalty the local
administrative officer may consider the following factors:
(1) Whether the civil penalty imposed will be
a substantial economic deterrent to the illegal activity;
(2) Damages to the pretreatment agency,
including compensation for the damage or destruction
of the facilities of the publicly owned treatment works,
and also including any penalties, costs and attorneys'
fees incurred by the pretreatment agency as the result
of the illegal activity, as well as the expenses involved
in enforcing this section and the costs involved in
rectifying any damages;
(3) Cause of the discharge or violation;
(4) The severity of the discharge and its
effect upon the facilities of the publicly owned
treatment works and upon the quality and quantity of
the receiving waters;
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-77
(5) Effectiveness of action taken by the
violator to cease the violation;
(6) The technical and economic
reasonableness of reducing or eliminating the
discharge; and
(7) The economic benefit gained by the
violator.
(E) The local administrative officer may institute
proceedings for assessment in the chancery court of the
county in which all or part of the pollution or violation
occurred, in the name of the pretreatment agency.
(iii) The local hearing authority may establish by
regulation a schedule of the amount of civil penalty which can be
assessed by the local administrative officer for certain specific
violations or categories of violations.
(iv) Assessments may be added to the user's next
scheduled sewer service charge and the local administrative officer
shall have such other collection remedies as may be available for
other service charges and fees.
(b) Any civil penalty assessed to a violator pursuant to this
section may be in addition to any civil penalty assessed by the
commissioner for violations of Tennessee Code Annotated,
§ 69-3-115(a)(1)(F). However, the sum of penalties imposed by this section
and by Tennessee Code Annotated, § 69-3-115(a) shall not exceed ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per day for each day during which the act
or omission continues or occurs.
(4) Assessment for noncompliance with program permits or orders.
(a) The local administrative officer may assess the liability of
any polluter or violator for damages to the city resulting from any person's
or industrial user's pollution or violation, failure, or neglect in complying
with any permits or orders issued pursuant to the provisions of the
pretreatment program or this section.
(b) If an appeal from such assessment is not made to the local
hearing authority by the polluter or violator within thirty (30) days of
notification of such assessment, the polluter or violator shall be deemed
to have consented to the assessment, and it shall become final.
(c) Damages may include any expenses incurred in investigating
and enforcing the pretreatment program of this section, in removing,
correcting, and terminating any pollution, and also compensation for any
actual damages caused by the pollution or violation.
(d) Whenever any assessment has become final because of a
person's failure to appeal within the time provided, the local
administrative officer may apply to the appropriate court for a judgment,
and seek execution on the judgment. The court, in its proceedings, shall
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-78
treat the failure to appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in
the amount of the assessment.
(5) Judicial proceedings and relief. The local administrative officer may
initiate proceedings in the chancery court of the county in which the activities
occurred against any person or industrial user who is alleged to have violated or
is about to violate the pretreatment program, this section, or orders of the local
hearing authority or local administrative officer. In the action, the local
administrative officer may seek, and the court may grant, injunctive relief and
any other relief available in law or equity.
(6) Termination of discharge. In addition to the revocation of permit
provisions in 18-402(2)(g) of this chapter, users are subject to termination of their
wastewater discharge for violations or a wastewater discharge permits, or orders

requested by the pretreatment coordination superintendent.
The user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause, as provided in subsection
(2)(c) above, why the proposed action should not be taken.
(7) Disposition of damage payments and penalties--special fund. All
damages and/or penalties assessed and collected under the provisions of this
section shall be placed in a special fund by the pretreatment agency and allocated
and appropriated for the administration of its wastewater fund or combined
water and wastewater fund.
(8) Levels of non-compliance. (a) Insignificant non-compliance. For
the purpose of this guide, insignificant non-compliance is considered a
relatively minor infrequent violation of pretreatment standards or
requirements. These will usually be responded to informally with a phone
call or site visit but may include a Notice of Violation (NOV).
(b) "Significant noncompliance." Per 1200-4-14-.08(6)(b)8.
(i) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits,
defined here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all

TRC calculations for pH are not required.
(iii) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement (daily maximum of longer-term average, instantaneous
limit, or narrative standard) that the WWF determines has caused,
alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass
through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or
the general public).
(iv) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to human health, welfare or to the environment or

to according to the Enforcement Response Plan Guide Table
included in this chapter as Appendix A.
(9) Public notice of the significant violations. The superintendent shall
publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful
public notice within the jurisdictions served by the WWF, a list of the users
which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The
Change 5, February 16, 2011 18-80
term significant noncompliance shall be applicable to all significant industrial
users (or any other industrial user that violates subsections (C), (D) or (H) of this
section) and shall mean:
(a) Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six
(6) month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric pretreatment
standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits;

other pollutants except pH), TRC calculations for pH are not required;
(c) Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or
requirement as defined by § 18-407 (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the superintendent
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass through, including endangering the health of WWF
personnel or the general public;
(d) Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
superintendent's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent
such a discharge;

all city owned trees and landscaping from irresponsible contractors, a permit
system shall be set up to ensure that all tree care companies and contractors
working within the city limits are insured to acceptable standards. The permit
will check for insurance covering workers compensation, liability, bodily injury,
and property damage.
(1) The permit fee will be evaluated yearly by the aldermanic
committee and the tree advisory board. The initial cost is set at thirty dollars.
Permits must be obtained on a yearly basis from first permit approval. The time
limit to obtain a permit is ninety days from receipt of notification. If permit is
not obtained after ninety days, notice will again be given with a ten-day limit.
Every six months a new list will be created and business owners may apply at
that time.

compensation insurance and public liability insurance in a minimum amount of
$1,000,000 for bodily injury or death, and $100,000 for property damage.

information purposes and provided free to the citizens of Warren Co. Tree care
companies with state or nationally recognized training or certifications will be
recommended.
(5) Any tree work contracted by the city must be with a fully insured
contractor who conforms to all state and federal safety laws. On any public tree
trimming contracts, the department of urban forestry and land management
will hire well-trained tree care professionals with ISA or NAA training and a

(1) Tree, shrub, or any landscape plantings on private property must
meet certain guidelines for public safety. Refer to McMinnville Municipal Code
14-205.71 for obstruction to vision guidelines. Private plantings at time of
establishment and future growth must conform to these regulations.
(2) Trees and landscaping should not be allowed to obstruct street
signs, traffic lights, vision at traffic corners, or streetlights. Unobstructed view
is based on normal approach along road or highway to sign, traffic light, or
intersection. Street lights have defined angles of coverage that will be used to
decide if light coverage is obstructed.

feet.
(b) Public utilities. Above and below ground utility lines are
maintained by managing companies. To maintain reliable and consistent
electrical, phone, cable, water, and gas service, certain guidelines shall
be followed to reduce potential future problems. Any city owned tree that
may affect utility lines, will be removed and replaced with desirable
species for that location. Future plantings will follow certain guidelines.
(i) Large trees may not be planted closer than 50' lateral
feet to overhead electric distribution lines. Medium trees may not
be planted closer than 30' lateral feet to overhead electric
distribution lines. Small trees may be planted under overhead
electric distribution lines. Line height shall be established to
ensure maximum height of planted tree will stay lower than
minimum distance allowed to powerlines.
(ii) No small or medium tree may be planted closer than
five feet to a known underground utility pipeline. No large tree
may be planted closer than ten feet.
(c) Street lighting. Existing tree and landscaping problems will be
handled by the department of urban forestry and land management.

(i) No tree, shrub, or obstruction that would restrict
access of any fire hydrant will be allowed for a ten-foot radius. (as
added by Ord. #1379, May 2001)
20-606. Tree protection and maintenance. Applies to city owned
trees only. These rules will be for the protection of city owned vegetation, public
safety, and any overall city benefit.
(1) No person shall intentionally damage, cut, carve, transplant, or
remove any tree; attach any rope, wire, nails, advertisements, posters, or other
contrivance to any tree, allow any gaseous liquid, or solid substance which is
harmful to such trees to come in contact with them; or set fire or permit any fire
to burn when such fire or the heat thereof will injure any portion of any tree.
(2) No person shall deposit, place, store, or maintain upon any public
place of the city, any stone, brick, sand, concrete, or other materials that may
impede the free passage of water, air, and fertilizer to the roots of any tree
growing therein. This covers all forms of damage whether unintentional or
deliberate.
(3) Sunlight to any public tree cannot be permanently blocked by
placement of materials such as a new building or signs. Blocked sunlight is
defined as loss of more than 1/3 by area or time of existing sunlight.
(4) Unintentional damage (car accident, house fire, etc...) will still be
subject to repair, maintenance, and replacement costs.
(5) All repair, maintenance, and replacement costs to the damaged
vegetation shall be levied to the person(s) or business responsible for the
damage. Repair, replacement, and maintenance will be completed by the
department of urban forestry and land management. The city forester will
establish costs to repair, replace, and maintain vegetation.
(6) Any construction or land disturbing activity in the general area of
any public tree or landscaping or its critical root zone must follow protection
guidelines as specified by the urban forester.
(7) All tree, shrub, and other landscaping maintenance on public land
should be done with the approval of the urban forester or by the urban forestry
department. This maintenance shall meet or exceed International Society of
Arboriculture, ANSI A300 Pruning and Fertilization, or National Arborist
Association standards. Contact the department of urban forestry and land
management for recent copies of these documents.
(8) The practice of topping, tipping, rounding, or other names is
strictly forbidden on any city owned tree. The excessive and arbitrary removal
of all parts of the tree beyond a certain height with no regard for structure or
natural growth pattern is defined as topping. Tipping and rounding is the
cutting back of all limbs to a certain length or shape and creates the same
problems as topping. Any tree damaged to the point of needing more than one
20-18
half of the crown removed, shall be removed and replaced. Topping or shaping
is strongly discouraged on private trees. (as added by Ord. #1379, May 2001)

At minimum, the dripline of the tree canopy (for deciduous, non-columnar trees).
Recommended rule is one foot of radius for every inch diameter measured at 4.5'
off the ground on uphill side of the tree. This is variable based on conditions.
(5) "Critical root zone." The minimum root protection zone for the
survival of the tree. Trees under 6" caliper will be based on nursery guidelines.
Trees over 6" caliper will be based on site and tree condition decided by the city
forester.

expected to fall with no warning at any time or during extreme weather.
(8) "Urgent hazard." A tree with a high chance of failure that would
affect personal health or property. The tree will fall over a small period of time
or when weather conditions are extreme.
(9) "Direct hazard." Any tree with a medium to very high chance of
failure that would affect only the owners health or property.

When an antenna is proposed to be mounted on an existing structure, the report shall indicate the existing structure’s suitability and capability to accept the antenna and the proposed method for affixing the antenna to the structure. Complete details of all fixtures and couplings and the precise point of attachment shall be indicated.
2. Written Report. That adequately reports on the inventory of existing towers and antenna sites within a one-mile (1-mile) radius from the proposed site, outlining the opportunities for shared use as an alternative to the proposed use, shall be submitted to the Codes Enforcement Office. The applicant must illustrate that the proposed tower or antenna can not be accommodated on an existing approved tower or facility due to one or more of the following reasons:
? Unwillingness of the owner to share the facility.
? The equipment would exceed the structural capacity of the existing approved tower and facilities.
? The planned equipment would cause frequency interference with other existing or planned equipment, which can not be reasonably prevented.
? Existing or approved towers or facilities do not have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function effectively.
? Other reasons make it impractical to place the proposed equipment by the applicant on existing towers or facilities.
3. Site Plan. Shall be submitted to the Codes Enforcement Office and approved by the Codes Enforcement Officer prior to the issuance of a permit. The following standards shall be used in the design of the facilities:
(a) Setbacks The minimum setbacks on all sides shall be equal to the height of the tower plus an additional twenty (20) feet, including any antennas or appurtenances, as measured from ground level. This setback shall be considered a fall zone. The fall zone setback requirement may be reduced or waived provided it can be demonstrated in a report prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Tennessee that the communication tower will collapse if it falls and it is determined by administrative review that the tower does not posed a safety threat to adjacent property owners in the event of collapse. In such cases, the setback shall be equal to the distance specified in the engineer report or a minimum of fifty (50) feet, whichever is greater. In addition, no communication tower or shall be located closer than one-hundred (100) feet from an existing residential structure. Setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower, or guy-wire supports for lattice towers, to the property line. For ground structure associated with the tower and located at the same site the minimum setback on all sides shall be fifty (50) feet.
(b) Landscaping and Screening The visual impacts of the facility shall be mitigated from nearby viewers by provision of an opaque screen as defined in Chapter VI, Supplementary Regulations, Section 14-601.2A, within a landscaped strip no less than four (4) feet wide located outside the perimeter fence. Sites may be exempted from these requirements provided the Codes Enforcement Official finds the vegetation or topography of the site provides a natural buffer.
(c) Perimeter Fencing A chain-link fence or solid wall not less than eight (8) feet in height consisting of at least six (6) feet of material plus two (2) feet of barbed wire on the top of fence measured from finished grade of site shall be provided around the facility. Access to the facility shall be limited to a locked gate.
(d) Lighting All artificial lighting deemed necessary or required by federal regulations shall be shielded and oriented inward within the facility so as not to project on the surrounding properties.
(e) Visual Effects All towers shall either maintain galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness.
(f) Standards All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers or antenna arrays. If such standards and/or regulations are changed, the owners of the towers and/or antennas shall bring towers and/or antennas into compliance with revised standards within six (6) months of the effective date of such standards and/or regulations unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring
towers an antennas into compliance shall constitute grounds for removal of the tower or antenna at the owner’s expense.
(g) Removal of Obsolete or Unused Facilities All obsolete or unused communication facilities shall be removed by the property owner within six (6) months of cessation of use. The applicant shall submit an executed Removal Agreement to ensure compliance with this requirement.
(h) Facility Changes Any changes to antenna, reception, or transmitting devices shall require review in the same manner as the existing facility was originally approved.
(i) Signs and Advertising The use of any portion of a tower for signs or advertising purposes including banners, streamers, etc. is prohibited except as needed for warning or identification.
(j) Equipment Storage Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall not be stored or parked on site unless repairs are being made.
(k) Maintenance Adequate inspection and maintenance shall be performed to insure the structural integrity of the facility and to prevent deterious conditions from occurring on the site. An annual report regarding the structural integrity of the facility shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed by the State of Tennessee and submitted to the Codes Enforcement Office.
(l) Road Access All access roads, including necessary drainage facilities, shall be constructed to meet the street construction specifications of the McMinnville Subdivision Regulations, except if allowed to be reduced by administrative review of the Public Works Director or other applicable city official.

OF
THE CITY OF MCMINNVILLE, TENNESSEE
As adopted by Ordinance No. 1068 on March 15, 1993 and as recodified by Ordinance No. 1171 on September 18, 1995. And as recodified by Ordiance No 1572 on July 18, 2008.
CHAPTER 8
FLOODPLAIN ZONING REGULATIONS
These regulations are established as a means to protect life and property from periodic flooding.
SECTION 14-801 FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES
14-801.1 Findings of Fact
A. The Board of Mayor and Aldermen of the City of McMinnville wishes to maintain eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program and in order to do so must meet the requirements of 60.3(d) of the Federal Insurance Administration Regulations found at 44 CFR Ch. 1 (10-1-88 Edition) and subsequent amendments.
B. Areas of McMinnville are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
C. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and by uses in flood hazard areas which are vulnerable to floods; or construction which is inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
14-801.2 Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion, flood heights, or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including community facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage; (at the time of initial construction)
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage, and;
E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards.
14-801.3 Objectives
The objectives of this Chapter are:
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodable areas;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a floodable area; and,
H. To maintain eligibility for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.

These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards.
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
"Flood-related Erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding.
"Flood-related Erosion Area" or "Flood-related Erosion Prone Area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage.

The market value of the structure shall be considered as (1) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvements, or (2) in the case of damage, the appraised value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: (1) Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or; (2) Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
"Substantially Improved Existing Manufactured Home Parks or Subdivisions" is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
"Variance" is a grant of relief from the requirements of this Chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this Chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this Chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

This shall include Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U. S. C. 1334.
C. Notification to adjacent communities and the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Local Planning Office, prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submission of evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
D. Record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level or highest adjacent grade, whichever is applicable) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance with Section 14-804.2B of this Chapter.
E. Record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level or highest adjacent grade, whichever is applicable) to which the new or substantially improved buildings have been flood-proofed, in accordance with Section 14-804.2B of this Chapter.
F. When flood-proofing is utilized, the Building Inspector shall obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with Section 14-804.2B of this Chapter.
G. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the Building Inspector shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 14-806 of this Chapter.
H. When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency then the Building Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal, State, or other source, including data developed as a result of these regulations, as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial improvements, or other development in Zone A on the Community FHBM or FIRM meet the requirements of this Chapter.
I. Within unnumbered A zones, where base flood elevations have not been established and where alternative data is not available, the Building Inspector shall require the lowest floor of a building to be elevated or floodproofed to a level of at least (2) two feet above the highest adjacent grade (lowest floor and highest adjacent grade being defined in Section 14-802 of this Chapter).

SUGGESTED STEPS FOR A DEVELOPER OF A SUBDIVISION
Throughout the following process, the owner/developer is strongly encouraged to
personally participate in consultations and meetings regarding the development.
1. Confer with the Planning Commission and its Staff Planner to become
thoroughly familiar with the subdivision requirements, the major road plan
and other public improvements which might affect the area to be
subdivided.
2. Have preliminary sketch plat prepared by a reputable state-licensed
surveyor.
3. Discuss preliminary plat with staff representative. This pre application
review by a trained land planner may save the subdivider time and costly
revisions as well as possible savings through better design.
4. If development will use individual septic tanks, submit plat to Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation, which may place
restrictions on number, size, and use of lots. The timing of approval by the
McMinnville Regional Planning Commission is dependent on the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation results.
5. Submit required copies of the preliminary plat to the Planning Commission
in advance of its regular monthly meeting.
6. See city engineer or designated approving agent(s) for street and utility
specifications. Obtain Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation approval of water and sewer plans and submit signed plans
to the McMinnville Regional Planning Commission.
7. After preliminary plat approval has been granted, develop subdivision
according to preliminary plat and the required modifications, if any. Install
improvements.
8. Prepare final plat.
9. Obtain signatures on certificates from street and utility officials certifying
that improvements have been made (or that a financial guarantee has
been established).
10. Submit final plat to the Planning Commission for approval. When
approved, the Planning Commission secretary will sign the certificate of
approval for recording.
11. The subdivider records the plat with the county Register of Deeds' office
and is now ready to sell the lots. 


SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
Of
The McMinnville Regional Planning Commission
McMinnville, Tennessee
ARTICLE I GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Purpose
Land subdivision is the first step in the process of community
development. Once land has been cut up into streets, lots, and blocks and
publicly recorded, the correction of defects is costly and difficult.
Subdivision of land sooner or later becomes a public responsibility, in that
roads and streets must be maintained and various public services
customary to urban areas must be provided. The welfare of the entire
community is thereby affected in many important respects. It is therefore
in the interest of the public, the developer, and the future owners that
subdivisions be conceived, designed and developed in accordance with
sound rules and proper minimum standards.
The following subdivision regulations guiding the McMinnville, Tennessee,
Regional Planning Commission (hereafter referred to as the Planning
Commission) are designed to provide for the harmonious development of
the regional area; to secure a coordinated layout and adequate provision
for traffic, light, air, recreation, transportation, water, drainage, sewer, and
other sanitary facilities.
B. Authority
These subdivision regulations are adopted under the authority granted by
Section 13-3-401 through Section 13-3-411 and Section 13-4-301 through
Section 13-4-309 of the Tennessee Code Annotated. The Planning
Commission has fulfilled the requirements set forth in these statutes as a
prerequisite to the adoption of such regulations, having filed on June 28,
1995 a certified copy of the Major Road Plan in Note Book 18, Page 388
and Cabinet B, Slide 134-A in the office of the Register of Deeds of
Warren County, Tennessee.
C. Jurisdiction
These regulations shall govern all subdivisions of land within the corporate
limits of McMinnville, Tennessee, and its planning region, as now or
hereafter established.
Any owner of land within the City of McMinnville or within its planning
region wishing to subdivide land shall submit to the Planning Commission
a plat of the subdivision according to the procedures outlined in Article II,
which plat shall conform to the minimum requirements set forth in Article
III. Improvements shall be installed as required by Article III.

E. Variances
1. General: Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary
hardships or practical difficulties may result from strict compliance
with these regulations and/or the purposes of these regulations
may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may
approve variances to these Subdivision Regulations so that
substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured,
provided that such variance shall not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of these regulations; and further provided
the Planning Commission shall not approve variances unless it
shall make findings based upon the evidence presented to it in
each specific case that:
a. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the
public safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property;
b. The conditions upon which the request for a variance is
based are unique to the property for which the variance is
sought and are not applicable generally to other property;
c. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a
particular hardship to the owner would result, as
distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter
of these regulations are carried out;
d. The variances will not in any manner vary the provisions of
the Zoning Code.
2. Conditions: In approving variances, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially
the objectives of the standards or requirements of these
regulations.
3. Procedures: A petition for any variance shall be submitted in writing
by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
consideration by the Planning Commission. Said petition shall
state fully the grounds for the application. Each request for a
variance shall be specifically applied for in the numerical order of
the subdivision regulations.
F. Relationship to Zoning Code and other Regulations
1. No final plat of land within the force and effect of the McMinnville
Zoning Code shall be approved unless it conforms to such code.

dimensions noted herein and those contained in the zoning
regulations, building code, or other official regulations, the highest
standard shall apply. 
 6
G. Separability
Should any section, subsection, paragraph or provision of these
regulations be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such decision shall in no way affect the validity of any other
provision of these regulations, it being the intention of the McMinnville
Regional Planning Commission to adopt each and every provision of
these regulations separately.
H. Repeal of Previous Regulations
All subdivision regulations previously adopted by the McMinnville Regional
Planning Commission are hereby repealed as of the adoption and
effective date of these regulations.
I. Amendments
Before adoption of any amendments to this document, a public hearing
shall be held by the Planning Commission. Thirty (30) days notice of the
time and place of the hearing shall be given as provided in Section 13-3-
403, Tennessee Code Annotated.

ARTICLE II PROCEDURE FOR PLAT APPROVAL
The procedure for review and approval of a subdivision plat consists of four (4)
basic steps. (1) The initial step is the pre-development conference with the Staff
Planner for the Planning Commission for advice and assistance. (2) The second
step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a
Preliminary Plat of the proposed subdivision. (3) The third step is to construct or
install improvements such as streets, fire hydrants and utility lines. (4) The
fourth step is the preparation and submission to the Planning Commission of a
Final Plat, together with required certificates. This Final Plat becomes the
instrument to be recorded in the office of the Warren County Register of Deeds
when duly signed by the secretary of the Planning Commission.
A. General

Planning Commission who wishes to divide land into two (2) or
more lots, sites, or other divisions requiring any new street or utility
construction, or any division of less than five (5) acres for the
purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building
development, or who wishes to resubdivide an existing subdivision
lot(s) for this purpose, shall submit a plan of such proposed
subdivision to the Planning Commission for approval and shall
obtain such approval prior to the filing of his subdivision plat for
record and prior to selling or giving a deed for any lot.
Any such plat of subdivision shall conform to the minimum
standards of design for the subdivision of land as set forth in Article
III of these standards and shall be presented in the manner
specified in the following sections of this Article. No plat of a
subdivision of land within the area of planning jurisdiction shall be
filed or recorded by the Register of Deeds without the approval of
the Planning Commission as specified herein.
2. In order to secure review and approval by the Planning
Commission of a proposed subdivision, the prospective subdivider
shall, prior to the making of any street improvements or
installations of utilities, meet informally with the Staff Planner for a
pre-development conference. The developer shall then submit to
the Planning Commission a preliminary plat, and other required
information, as provided in Sections D and E of this Article. On
approval of said preliminary plat, the developer may proceed with
the construction of improvements as set forth in Article III, and with
the preparation of the final plat and other documents required in
connection therewith as specified in Sections F and G of this
Article. In no case shall a preliminary plat be presented in sections.
3. Omission of Preliminary Plat
 The preliminary plat may be omitted and only a final plat submitted,
IF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:
a. The proposed subdivision does not contain more than five
(5) lots, sites, tracts, or divisions. 
 8
b. All public improvements as set forth in Article III are already
installed. (Any construction, installation, or improvement of
public improvements shall require the submission of a
preliminary plat.) The Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation has approved the lots for
septic systems, if applicable.
c. The subdivider has consulted informally with the Staff
Planner for advice and assistance, and it is agreed upon by
the Planning Commission that a preliminary plat is
unnecessary prior to submission of the final plat and its
formal application for approval.
4. The owner or his authorized representative must be present at
preliminary plat review and approval and final plat review and
approval. In his absence, the property owner may be represented
by his agent or representative who shall present written
authorization.
5. No final subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning
Commission or accepted for record by the Warren County Register
of Deeds until the required improvements listed shall be
constructed in a satisfactory manner and approved by the local
approving agent. In lieu of such prior construction, the Planning
Commission may accept certain forms of financial guarantees (See
Section G-9 of this Article) in amounts equal to the estimated cost
of installation of the required improvements, whereby
improvements may be made and utilities installed without cost to
the City of McMinnville in the event of default by the subdivider.
B. Filing Fee
At the time of the submittal of a preliminary plat for review, or final plat if a
preliminary plat is not required, a nonrefundable filing fee of one hundred
dollars ($100.00) shall be paid to the City of McMinnville. Said fee shall
be used to help defray the costs of plat review and inspections.
C. Plat Standards
 1. State Standards Shall Apply

 All plats submitted to the McMinnville Regional Planning
Commission for consideration shall meet the accuracy standards
for an Urban and Subdivision Survey (Category 1) as established
by the Tennessee Board of Examiners for Land Surveyors
(January, 1992 Revised). Said regulations state:

 "For Category 1 surveys in Tennessee, the angular
error of closure shall not exceed 15 seconds times
the square root of the number of angles turned. The
linear error of closure shall not exceed 1 foot per
10,000 feet of perimeter of the lot of the land (1 :
10,000). When very small lots are encountered, the 
 9
allowable error shall not exceed 1/10 of a foot of
positional accuracy per corner."
 All plats shall include a statement by the surveyor regarding the
methods used in making the survey and its relative accuracy, as
well as the surveyor's seal and signature.
 2. Sheet Format
 All preliminary and final plats submitted to the McMinnville Regional
Planning Commission for consideration shall be in a format
consistent with the example of the acceptable sheet format
depicted on Illustration 1 in Appendix A and shall:
a. Be generally drawn to a scale of not less than 1" = 100'.
When more than one sheet is required, an index sheet of
the same size drawn at an easily read scale shall be filed
showing the entire subdivision with the sheets lettered in
alphabetical order as a key.
 b. Be either 18" x 24" or 24" x 36" in size.
 c. Contain in the lower right-hand corner a standard title block,
 (See Illustration 2 in Appendix A), which includes:

 (1) Name of subdivision
 (2) Names, addresses, and phone numbers of developer,
 surveyor, and engineer (if applicable)

 (3) Scale of drawing
 (4) Acreage to be subdivided
 (5) Number of lots to be created
 (6) Appropriate reference(s) to the Warren County Tax
 Maps
 (7) Date plat was prepared

 d. Contain in the upper right-hand corner a location map, a
 graphic scale and an approximate north arrow.
D. Preliminary Plat Requirements
 In addition to being prepared to the prescribed format, each Preliminary
Plat shall contain the following information as may be appropriate:
1. The location of all existing and proposed property lines, streets,
water courses, railroads, sewer lines, water lines, drain pipes,
bridges, culverts, and easements for existing utilities (water, sewer,
gas, electricity, etc.) or other features. Existing features shall be
distinguished graphically from those which are proposed. 
 10
2. The present zoning classification (if any) both of the land to be
subdivided and of adjoining lands, the names of adjoining property
owners or subdivisions, the name of the applicable water district,
and the size of existing water and sewer lines.
3. Plans, prepared by the developer's engineer, of proposed sewer
and water systems showing connections to the existing or any
proposed utility systems, including line sizes, location of hydrants
and manholes. When sewer connections are not accessible, as
discussed in Article III, Section H, any land on which an individual
sewage disposal system is proposed must be reviewed by the
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
4. The proposed street names, and the location, width, and other
dimensions of proposed streets, alleys, easements, parks and
other open spaces, reservations, lot lines, and building setback
lines.
5. Topographical contours at vertical intervals of not more than five
(5) feet.
6. Center line profiles for all proposed streets and, where required by
the City Administrator or Public Works Director, cross-sections of
proposed streets based on 50 foot stations.
7. Subsurface conditions on the tract, if required by the Planning
Commission: location and results of tests made to ascertain
subsurface soil, rock, and ground water conditions; depth of ground
water unless test pits are dry at a depth of five (5) feet; and location
and results of soil percolation tests, if individual sewage disposal
systems are proposed.
8. If any portion of the land proposed for subdivision lies within a
floodable area, as determined by an official Flood Hazard
Boundary Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map, that portion shall be
so indicated.
9. A drainage plan showing proposed modifications to the flow of
water across the site or to and from adjoining properties. The City
Administrator or Public Works Director may require the submission
of more detailed information including, but not limited to, a final
grading plan for all or a portion of the site, and calculations
describing the existing and proposed volumes of water to be
discharged from the site.
E. Procedure for Preliminary Plat Review
 The following procedure shall apply for the review of all Preliminary Plats:
1. At least 15 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered,
the subdivider shall submit to the McMinnville Office of Codes
Enforcement eight (8) copies of any required preliminary plat of a
proposed subdivision. If necessary the developer should provide 
 11
copies to the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation. The Office of Codes Enforcement will give copies
of the plat to the Staff Planner for review and distribute copies to all
applicable utilities and departments (water, sewer, fire, telephone,
street, electric, or gas, as necessary).
2. The Staff Planner for the Planning Commission shall review the
preliminary plat for conformance with the specifications and
standards of these regulations.
3. The preliminary plat shall be presented by the developer or his
designated representative to the Planning Commission at its next
meeting for a review period not to exceed 30 days. The developer
should be physically present at the meeting(s) to answer questions
and hear suggestions about his proposed development or be
represented by an authorized agent as discussed in Article II,
Section A(4).
4. Within 30 days after submission of the preliminary plat to the
Planning Commission for consideration, the Planning Commission
shall approve or disapprove said plat. Failure of the Planning
Commission to act on the preliminary plat within the 30 day period
will be deemed approval of this plat. If a plat is disapproved,
reasons for such disapproval shall be stated in writing. If approved
subject to modifications, the nature of the required modifications
shall be indicated.
5. If a plat has been disapproved, a new plat may be presented as
though no previous plat had been submitted. If a plat has been
approved, or approved subject to modifications, and the subdivider
desires to make substantial modifications other than those already
required by the Planning Commission, a new preliminary plat must
be submitted, which is subject to the same regulations and
procedures as though no previous plat had been submitted, except
that a certification to the effect that the previous plat has been
withdrawn must be submitted. If the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation rejects any lot(s) or recommends
any alteration of lot size or shape, the Planning Commission may
require the plat to be resubmitted for preliminary plat review.
6. Two (2) copies of the preliminary plat will be retained in the
Planning Commission files, copies shall be retained by the
applicable utility departments, and one copy shall be returned to
the subdivider with any notations at the time of approval or
disapproval and the specific changes, if any, required.
7. The approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning Commission
shall not constitute acceptance of any final plat.
8. The approval of the preliminary plat shall terminate unless a final
plat based thereon is submitted within one (1) year from the date of
such approval; provided, however, that an extension of time can be
applied for by the developer and granted by the Planning
Commission. If no work has begun to install improvements and if 
 12
an approved final plat has not been financially guaranteed, and the
McMinnville Regional Subdivision Regulations have changed, the
subdivision must meet the new regulations.
F. Final Plat Requirements
1. The final plat shall conform substantially to the approved
preliminary plat. Any alterations or deviation from the preliminary
plat should be discussed with the Staff Planner to determine if the
changes require new preliminary plat review.
2. If the subdivision is to be developed in phases and the final plats
submitted as portions or sections of the preliminary plat, the
sections must be identified by alphabetical characters, following the
name of the subdivision as initially submitted or as approved on
preliminary.
3. A final plat will not be acceptable for submission unless it meets all
required standards of design, and contains all required information,
or contains a written request for a variance for each specific
deviation from requirements.
4. In addition to being prepared in the prescribed format, each Final
Plat shall contain the following information as may be appropriate:
a. The right-of-way and pavement lines of all streets and roads;
the size and location of installed and/or preexisting water
and sewer mains; alley lines; hydrant locations; lot lines;
building setback lines; any easements for rights-of-way
provided for public services, utilities and the disposal of
surface water; the limitation and/or dimensions of all
easements; lots numbered in numerical order; any areas to
be dedicated to public use; and any sites for other than
residential use, with notes stating their purpose and
limitations.
b. A statement of the restrictions for all easements and right-ofways indicating the following:

(1) No permanent structure such as a deck, patio,
garage, carport or other building shall be erected
within the limits of any easement shown on this plat.
(2) No excavation, filling, landscaping or other
construction shall be permitted in any drainage
easement shown on this plat if such excavation,
filling, landscaping or other construction will alter or
diminish the flow of water through said easement.
(3) All driveways, entrances, curb cuts or other points of
ingress or egress to the lots shown on this plat shall
be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
City of McMinnville; contact the Public Works
Department for information. 
 13
(4) The placing of pipe within or otherwise filling of
ditches within the right-of-way shown on this plat is
prohibited without the approval of the City of
McMinnville; contact the Public Works Department for
information.
c. Sufficient data to determine readily and reproduce on the
ground the location, bearing and length of every street line,
lot line, boundary line, block line, and building line whether
curved or straight, and including true north point. This shall
include the radius, central angle, and tangent distance for
the center line of curved streets and curved property lines
that are not the boundary of curved streets.
d. All dimensions to the nearest one-hundredth (100th) of a
foot and angles to the nearest 20 seconds.
e. Location and description of all bench marks, monuments
and corner markers.
f. The names and locations of adjoining subdivisions and
streets and the location and ownership of adjoining
unsubdivided property.
g. If any portion of the land being subdivided is subject to
flooding or is in a FEMA identified flood hazard area, it shall
be indicated on the final plat.
h. If this is a resubdivision of a previously recorded subdivision,
provide plat book and page of last subdivision plat being
amended.
 i. Standard plat certifications as may be appropriate to the
 context of the subdivision (See Article II, Section G (10)
 below).
G. Procedure for Final Plat Review
 The following procedure shall apply for the review of all Final Plats:
1. Final plats should be submitted at least 15 days prior to the
Planning Commission meeting. If the developer has obtained the
signatures of utility and road officials because improvements have
been completed or were not required, he should provide those
utilities with a copy of the plat, and submit four (4) copies to the
McMinnville Office of Codes Enforcement. The submission of the
final plat to the Office of Codes Enforcement shall not constitute
submission of the final plat for consideration by the Planning
Commission.
2. The Staff Planner for the Planning Commission shall review the
final plat for conformance with the specifications and standards of
these regulations. 
 14
3. The official submission of the final plat to the Planning Commission
is considered to be the first Planning Commission meeting at which
the plat is presented for consideration, with the developer or his
authorized representative present to answer questions and provide
information. The Planning Commission may review the plat for a
30 day period.
4. The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the final
plat within 30 days after its submission for consideration. Failure of
the Planning Commission to act on the final plat within this 30 day
period shall be deemed approval of it. If the plat is disapproved, the
grounds for disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the
Planning Commission.
5. When the plat has been approved by the Planning Commission,
the original will be returned to the subdivider with the approval of
the Planning Commission certified thereon, for filing with the county
register of deeds as the official plat of record; two (2) copies will be
retained in the records of the McMinnville Regional Planning
Commission and one (1) copy will be returned to the developer for
his records.
6. Approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission shall not
constitute the acceptance by the public of the dedication of any
streets or other public way or ground.
7. The Planning Commission shall require that an accurate map ("asbuilt" drawings) of all water lines, valves, fire hydrants, sewer lines
and appurtenances be supplied by the developer to the City of
McMinnville as a condition for final approval of any plat. State law
requires that plans and specifications of all water and waste water
facilities shall be prepared by a registered engineer and approved
by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.
A copy of such plans shall be forwarded by the developer to the
City of McMinnville.

8. Approval of the final plat can not be given until completion and
approval of the required improvements. These improvements are to
be installed in accordance with Article III. The required
improvements must be approved by the person(s) designated by
City Administrator and/or a representative of the appropriate utility
or road department, and then be reported to the Planning
Commission. The required improvements include:
a. Monuments and iron pins
b. Storm drainage system
c. Street grading and paving
d. Sidewalks (if required)
e. Water supply system lines and laterals
f. Sewage collection lines and laterals (if applicable)
g. Driveway cuts with culverts (homes to be built by developer)
h. Fire hydrants (if applicable)
i. Any other improvements that may be required by the
Planning Commission 
 15
9. Financial Guarantees in Lieu of Improvements
a. Conditions may exist whereby a developer may be unable to
install all improvements before requesting final plat approval.
In lieu of the installation of all improvements, the Planning
Commission may accept one of the following forms of
financial guarantees, whereby in the event of default by the
developer, improvements and utilities can be made without
cost to the city:
(1) The establishment of cash in a bank escrow account
in the full amount of the estimated cost of required
improvements plus 10% yearly inflation factor.
(2) An Irrevocable Letter of Credit, issued by a Bank or
Savings and Loan, signed by two officers, to cover
the full amount of the estimated cost of improvements
plus 10% yearly inflation factor.
(3) A certified check in the full amount of the estimated
cost of required improvements, plus 10% yearly
inflation factor.
b. In determining the basic cost of improvements the Planning
Commission may use a formula using a base cost per linear
foot for each required improvement, that being a cost
standard in the construction industry that particular year. The
Planning Commission may determine the base cost by
receiving information and/or bids from recognized
contractors. If the developer provides the bid or estimated
cost of improvements, the Planning Commission must
determine that the contractor will guarantee the cost for at
least the term of the guarantee plus two months.
c. At the time of acceptance of a guarantee, the Planning
Commission shall specify the specific length of time before
the city would take legal steps to cash it, but this time cannot
exceed two (2) years.
d. No financial guarantee shall be partially withdrawn by the
developer during the construction period to pay for
development costs except in the case of a final payment
made after final inspection and approval by the Planning
Commission, or except in the case where a developer is
postponing binder surface paving on a street until after a
winter settling period for the completed and approved gravel
base.
10. Certifications (See Appendix B for Forms)
In all cases some or all of the following certificates shall be present
and signed on the original final plat before the Planning
Commission Secretary signs the plat for recording the plat at the 
 16
Register of Deeds' Office. The developer shall check with the Staff
Planner as to which certificates shall be depicted on the final plat.
Form 1) Certificate of Ownership and Dedication-Certification
showing that applicant is the land owner and dedicates streets,
rights-of-way, and any sites for public use.
Form 2) Certificate of Accuracy & Precision-Certification by
surveyor of accuracy of survey and plat and placement of
monuments.
Form 3A) Certificate of General Approval for Installation of
Subsurface Sewage Disposal Systems-This certification to be used
if any lots will use septic tanks, and must be signed by an
appropriate representative of the Tennessee Department of
Environment and Conservation before presentation to Planning
Commission for final approval.
Form 3B) Certificate of Approval of Sewage Collection FacilitiesThis certification is to be used for any lots connected to or
proposed to be connected to McMinnville sewer system. Part (1)
pertains to sewer facilities installed, whereas Part (2) pertains to
acceptance of a financial guarantee in lieu of improvements.
Form 4A) Certificate of Approval of Water Lines-This certification is
to be used for any lots where new water lines or hydrants have
been (or will be) installed. Part (1) pertains to water facilities
installed whereas Part (2) pertains to acceptance of a financial
guarantee in lieu of improvements. This would be signed by an
official of the applicable water service district.
Form 4B) Certification of Existing Water Lines and/or other Utilities- This certification is to be used for any lots served by and connected
to previously existing water and/or sewer lines. This would be
signed by an official of the applicable utility.

certification is to be used for any lots served by new streets,
drainage system, etc., recently installed or to be installed, in
conformance to Planning Commission regulations, with signature
by applicable official.
Form 5B) Certificate of Existing Street(s)-This certification is to be
used for a subdivision which does not involve new street
construction but which fronts on an existing street. That street may
not meet Planning Commission requirements.
Form 6) Certificate of Approval for Recording-Certification by
Planning Commission Secretary that plat has been approved by
the commission. In all cases this certification will be signed only
after all other certificates have been signed and after final approval

 17
H. Inspections Procedures
1. The developer shall notify the City Administrator, Public Works
Director and/or County Road Superintendent and the McMinnville
Water/Waste Water Department and/or Utility District Manager
when work on streets and/or utilities is to begin and the anticipated
schedule for the preparation of subgrade and road base,
installation of drainage and underground utilities, and binder
surfacing of the road. Since the inspections need to be made
periodically during the entire process, communication with the City
Administrator, Public Works Director and/or County Road
Superintendent and the McMinnville Water/Waste Water
Department and/or Utility District Manager are essential to make
the process move as smooth as possible.
2. The developer shall notify the City Administrator, Public Works
Director and/or County Road Superintendent and the McMinnville
Water/Waste Water Department and/or Utility District Manager at
least 24 hours in advance of the needed inspection on:
a. Street grading, preparation of subgrade, and installation of
the drainage system.
b. Installation and pressure testing of water mains, water stubs,
sewer lines, and any other underground utility lines.
c. Pavement base. Inspection includes checking thickness of
gravel every 500 feet at random points across width.
d. Prime coat, binder course and drainage system.
3. Throughout the construction period, the City Administrator, Public
Works Director and/or County Road Superintendent and the
McMinnville Water/Waste Water Department and/or Utility District
Manager will keep a log of findings and periodically report the
status to the Planning Commission Staff Planner. Problems should
be brought to the attention of the Planning Commission
immediately.
4. Upon completion of steps a-d listed above, the inspector(s) will
submit a written report to the Planning Commission. These
inspection reports will become part of the official records of the
Planning Commission.
5. If a guarantee is posted by the developer in lieu of required
improvements, funds shall not be released until all roads and
utilities meet all required standards and the Planning Commission
has received written reports to that effect.
6. No improvements will be accepted by the City of McMinnville that
have not been inspected and deemed acceptable by the
appropriate representatives of the City.
 
 18
I. Warranty of Improvements
1. In addition to the Financial Guarantee in Lieu of Improvements, as
well as in the case of the completion of required improvements, the
developer shall warranty improvements made under the provisions
of these regulations for a period of one (1) year from the date of
acceptance by the City of McMinnville.

2. The Warranty of Improvements shall consist of an escrow account,
letter of credit, or certified check.
3. The amount of the warranty shall be not less than twenty-five
percent (25%) of the cost of the improvements installed under
these regulations nor more than $5,000.
4. The Warranty of Improvements shall be submitted to the City of
McMinnville prior to the submittal of the subdivision plat for final
approval.
J. Recording of Final Plat
Upon approval of the final plat and the signing of the appropriate
certificates affixed thereto, it shall be the responsibility of the developer to
ensure that said plat is placed upon the records of the Register of Deeds'
Office of Warren County, Tennessee.
K. Grounds for Denying Plat Approval
The McMinnville Regional Planning Commission shall deny approval of
any plat submitted to it for review that does not meet or exceed the
minimum requirements set forth in these regulations. In addition, the
Planning Commission may deny approval of a plat for the subdivision of
land for which:
1. The available water supply is inadequate to serve the anticipated
development or the available water supply is inadequate to provide
fire protection;
2. The means of ingress and egress is inadequate to carry the
vehicular traffic projected to be generated by the proposed
subdivision or the means of ingress and egress is inadequate for
use by garbage trucks, fire trucks or other city-owned equipment; or
3. The approval of said plat will in the opinion of the Planning
Commission be detrimental to the health and safety of the public.
 19
ARTICLE III DESIGN AND SPECIFICATIONS
A perfectly prepared and recorded subdivision or plat means little to a
prospective lot buyer until he can see actual physical transformation of raw
acreage into lots suitable for building purposes and human habitation.
Improvements by the subdivider spare the community a potential tax liability.
A. Suitability of the Land
1. Land Physically Unsuitable for Subdivision
a. Land where flooding, bad drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, and other such features which may endanger
health, life, or property, aggravate erosion, increase public
funds for supply and maintenance of services, and
b. Land which other public agencies have investigated and
found in the best interest of the public not suitable for the
type of platting and development proposed shall not be
approved for subdivision unless adequate methods are
formulated by the developer for meeting the problems
created by subdivision of such land. Such land within any
plat shall be set aside for such uses as shall not produce
unsatisfactory living conditions.
2. Land Unsuitably Located for Subdivision
a. The Planning Commission shall not approve what it
considers to be scattered or premature subdivision of land
which would endanger health, safety, or property because of
lack of or adverse effect on water supply, schools, proper
drainage, good transportation, or other public services or
which would necessitate an excessive expenditure of public
funds for the supply or maintenance of such services.
b. Land unsuitable for subdividing is also that located in close
proximity to potentially hazardous commercial operations
which may endanger health, life, or property of the residents
of the proposed subdivision.
B. Special Requirements for Floodable Areas
1. The purpose of this section is for the review of subdivision
proposals to determine whether such proposals will be reasonably
safe from flooding. In order to accomplish this, the following
regulations shall apply:
2. Definition of Land Subject to Flooding
a. For the purpose of these regulations, land subject to flooding
shall be defined as those areas within the McMinnville
Planning Region shown as Special Flood Hazard Areas
(Zone A, AE or X) on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps for 
 20
Warren County dated March 16, 1988, or any subsequent
amendment or revision to said maps.
b. In addition, along all other streams and water courses not
shown as floodable by the Flood Hazard Boundary Maps or
Flood Insurance Rate Maps, all land within 30 feet of the top
of the bank is considered to be subject to flooding.
3. Regulations for Subdivisions Containing Land Subject to Flooding
a. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
b. All creeks, lakes, ponds, sinkholes or other drainage areas
shall be shown on the preliminary and final subdivision plat.
c. Every lot platted shall have a flood-free building site.
d. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
e. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
f. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all
subdivision proposals containing land subject to flooding.
g. Utilities
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the system.
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall
be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration.
(3) If on-site waste disposal septic systems are to be
used, a flood-free site shall be provided on each lot in
order to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding.
h. Fill
(1) Land subject to flooding may be platted for residential
use only if filled to such a height as will secure a
flood-free site based on data submitted by the
subdivider and prepared by registered professional
engineers, provided such use of fill does not
endanger health, life, or property or restrict the flow of
water or increase flood heights. Lots on fill will not
usually be approved for septic tank drain fields. In 
 21
order to be considered for development such lots
must be served by a public sewer system.
(2) No fill shall be placed in the floodway of the stream
and if undetermined no closer than 30 feet from the
top of the bank of any stream or water course unless
the subdivider demonstrates that a lesser distance
(but not less than 15 feet) is adequate based on
watershed area, the probable runoff, and other
topographic and hydraulic data prepared by
engineers.
(3) All bridges, culverts, and other drainage openings
shall be designed so as not to restrict the flow of
water and unduly increase flood heights upstream.
C. Monuments
1. Concrete monuments or other markers approved by the Planning
Commission four (4) inches in diameter square, three (3) feet long,
with a flat top, shall be set at points where the street lines intersect
the exterior boundaries of the subdivision. The top of the
monument shall have a metal plate with an indented cross to
identify properly the location and shall be set flush with the finished
grade.
2. All other lot corners shall be marked with iron pins or pipe not less
than three-fourth (3/4) inches in diameter and 24 inches long and
driven so as to be flush with the finished grade.
D. Streets - Design Standards
The following standards shall apply for the design of all streets in
subdivisions located in the McMinnville Planning Region.
1. General Standards of Design
a. Arrangement
The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide
for the continuation of principal streets of adjoining
subdivision, and for proper projection of principal streets into
adjoining properties which are not yet subdivided, in order to
make possible necessary fire protection, movement of traffic
and the construction or extension, presently or when later
required, of needed utilities and public services such as
sewers, water and drainage facilities. Local streets shall be
so laid out that their use by through traffic will be
discouraged. Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, topographic or other conditions make such
continuance undesirable or impracticable, the above
conditions may be modified. The curvi-linear street layout
will be encouraged by the Planning Commission. 
 22
b. Conformity to the Major Road Plan
The location and width of all streets and roads shall conform
to the official Major Road Plan. The latest Major Road Plan
Map is on file in the Office of the Warren County Register of
Deeds and a copy of said plan is included in the front of this
document
Where a street designated by the Major Road Plan as a
"Proposed Road" crosses the proposed site of subdivision,
right-of-way sufficient to meet the design standards for the
functional classification of said street shall be dedicated to
the public and shown on said plat.
c. Relation to Adjoining Street System
The proposed street system shall extend any adjoining
existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case
less than the required minimum width.
d. Relation to Topography
The street plan of a proposed subdivision shall bear a logical
relationship to the topography of the property, and all streets
shall be arranged so as to obtain as many of the building
sites as possible at or above the grade of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as practicable to
the original topography.
e. Flood Prevention
Streets which will be subject to inundation or flooding shall
not be approved. All streets must be located at elevations
which will make them flood-free in order that portions of the
subdivision will not be isolated by floods. Where flood
conditions are anticipated, profiles and elevations of streets
will be required in order to determine the advisability of
permitting the proposed street layout.
2. Minimum Street Right-of-Way Widths
The minimum width of the street right-of-way, measured from lot
line to lot line, shall be as shown on the Major Road Plan, or if not
shown on such plan, shall be not less than as listed below.
a. Local Streets...........................................50 feet
b. Local Streets with curbs & gutters ..........40 feet
c. Cul-de-sacs (diameter) ...........................120 feet
d. Collector Streets .....................................60 feet
e. Arterial Streets and Highways.................80-150 feet 
 23
3. Minimum Street Surfacing Widths
The minimum street surfacing widths shall be as follows:
a. Local Streets...........................................24 feet
b. Local Streets with curbs & gutters ..........20 feet
c. Cul-de-sacs (diameter) ...........................100 feet
d. Collector Streets
 Minor.....................................................28 feet
 Major.....................................................32 feet
e. Arterial Streets and Highways.................48 feet
Due to the diversity of the development in the planning region,
ranging from sparsely populated agricultural areas to densely
populated urban areas; required surfacing widths may necessarily
vary with the character of building development, the amount of
traffic encountered, and the need to provide space for on-street
parking.
In general, streets through proposed business areas shall be
considered either collector streets or arterial streets and the street
widths of streets so located shall be increased six (6) feet on each
side if needed to provide parking without interference to normal
passing traffic.
4. Additional Right-of-Way on Existing Streets
Plats for subdivisions that abut existing streets shall show the
dedication of additional right-of-way to meet the minimum right-ofway width requirements.
a. The entire right-of-way shall be provided where any part of
the subdivision is on both sides of the existing street.
b. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an
existing street, one-half (1/2) of the required right-of-way,
measured from the center line of the existing roadway, shall
be provided.
5. Substandard Existing Streets

The subdivision of property abutting existing streets that do not
meet the minimum construction standards of these regulations
shall generally be prohibited. Should improvements to the existing
street be required in order to meet the demands of the proposed
subdivision, the cost of said improvements shall be borne by the
developer unless determined otherwise by the City of McMinnville. 
 24
6. Street Grades
a. Grades on major streets shall not exceed seven (7) percent;
grades on other streets shall not exceed 12 percent. No
more than three (3) percent grade within 100 feet of any
intersection with a collector or arterial street will be allowed
and no more than 50 feet of any intersection with a minor
residential or rural street.
b. Upon preliminary plat approval, if the street grade appears
questionable, a street grade profile map may be required for
the questionable area before approval of final plat.
c. Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve
constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of 200
feet, said sight distance being measured from the driver's
eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half (4 1/2) feet
above the pavement surface.
d. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades
drawn to a scale of not less than one (1) inch equals 100
feet horizontal, and one (1) inch equals 20 feet vertical, may
be required by the Planning Commission.
7. Curves
a. Horizontal Curves
Where a deflection angle of more than ten (10) degrees in
the alignment of a street occurs, a curve of reasonably long
radius shall be introduced. On streets 60 feet or more in
width, the center line radius of curvature shall be not less
than 300 feet; on other streets it shall be not less than 100
feet.
b. Tangents
A tangent of at least 100 feet in length shall be introduced
between reverse curves on all streets.
c. Curve radii at street intersections shall not be less than 20
feet (See Illustration 3 in Appendix A) and where the angle
of street intersection is less than 75 degrees the Planning
Commission may require a greater curb radius. To permit
the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without
curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal
width, the property line at such street corner shall be
rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such
construction. 
 25
8. Intersections
a. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is
possible and no intersection shall be at the angle of less
than 60 degrees. (See Illustration 4 in Appendix A).
No street intersection shall have more than four streets
entering it, and the "T" or three-way intersection shall be
used whenever possible. Additional street right-of-way on
local streets may be required at intersections with collector
or arterial streets to permit proper intersection design for
traffic flow.
Local streets intersecting with collector roads shall, in
general, be at least 500 feet apart and at least 1000 feet
apart when opening into an arterial street. Local streets
intersecting with other local streets shall, in general, be at
least 200 feet apart.
b. Street Jogs
Street jogs with centerline off-sets of less than 150 feet shall
not be allowed if the proposed street is to connect with or is
an arterial or collector street. Street jogs on local streets with
centerline off-sets of less than 125 feet shall not be allowed.
(See Illustration 5 in Appendix A).
c. Visibility of Intersections; Steep Grades and Curves
A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
In order to provide visibility for traffic safety, that portion of
any corner lot (whether at an intersection entirely within the
subdivision or of a new street with an existing street) shall be
leveled and cleared of brush (except isolated trees) and
obstructions above the level three feet higher than the
centerline of the street. If directed, the ground shall be
excavated to achieve visibility.
9. Dead-End Streets (Cul-de-sacs)
a. Permanent
Minor terminal streets or courts designed to have one (1)
end permanently closed shall be no more than 1200 feet
long unless necessitated by topography. They shall be
provided at the closed end with a circular turnaround having
an outside pavement diameter of at least 100 feet and a
street right-of-way diameter of at least 120 feet. The circular
turnaround may be centered on the main body of the street
or off-set to either side. When approved by the Planning
Commission, alternate designs, including a "T" or "hammer
head" configuration, may be used in lieu of the circular culde-sac. (See Illustration 6 in Appendix A). 
 26
b. Temporary
Where, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, it is
desirable to provide for street access to adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be extended by dedication to the
boundary of such property. Such dead-end streets shall be
provided with a temporary paved turnaround having a
roadway surface diameter of at least 100 feet.
10. Private Streets or Permanent Vehicular Easements
a. The Planning Commission discourages the platting of private
streets or permanent vehicular easements as every
subdivided property should be served from a publicly
dedicated street.
b. Private streets and permanent vehicular easements shall be
developed to meet all standards required for municipal
streets as provided in these regulations. These include, but
are not limited to, all requirements for street right-of-way
widths, minimum surfacing widths, street grades, curves,
intersections, street names, and street construction
procedures and specifications.
11. Reserve Strips
There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets,
except where the control of such strips is definitely placed with the
municipality under conditions approved by the Planning
Commission.
12. Special Treatment Along Major Arterial Streets
When a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
major arterial street, the commission may require either marginal
access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a
non-access reservation along the rear property line, lots with rear
service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for
adequate protection of residential properties and to afford
separation of through and local traffic.
13. Sidewalks (Optional)
For the safety of pedestrians and of children going to school,
installations of sidewalks on one side or both sides of the street
may be required on certain collector and arterial streets, in the
vicinity of schools, and in other locations where the Planning
Commission considers sidewalks to be needed.
Sidewalks shall be located in the street right-of-way not less than
one foot from the property line to prevent interference or
encroachment by fencing, walls, hedges, or other planting or
structures placed on the property line at a later date. 
 27
In a single family residential area concrete sidewalks shall be five
(5) feet wide and four (4) inches thick. In multi-family or group
housing developments sidewalks shall be five (5) feet wide and
four (4) inches thick. In commercial areas sidewalks shall be ten
(10) feet wide and four (4) inches thick.
14. Streets in Commercial Subdivision Developments
a. Service Streets or Loading Space in Commercial
Developments
Paved rear service streets or alleys of not less than 30 feet
in right-of-way width, or adequate off-street loading space
with a suitable paved surface shall be provided in connection
with lots designed for commercial use. Service streets,
alleys, and off-street loading spaces shall generally not be
dedicated to, nor accepted by the City of McMinnville.
b. Free Flow of Vehicular Traffic Abutting Commercial
Developments
In front of areas designed for commercial use, the street's
width shall be increased by such amount on each side as
may be deemed necessary by the Planning Commission to
assure the free flow of through traffic without interference by
parked or parking vehicles, and to provide adequate and
safe parking space for such commercial or business district.
15. Street Names
a. Proposed streets, which are obviously in alignment with
others already existing and named, shall bear the name of
existing streets.
b. New street names shall be substantially different so as not
to be confused in sound or spelling with present street
names as shown on the McMinnville or Warren County
Official Street/Road Name Maps. The only exception to this
policy is where a proposed street is an extension of (or is in
alignment with) an existing street. Generally, no street
should change direction by more than 90 degrees without a
change in street name.
c. The developer is required to erect street name signs in
subdivisions within The City of McMinnville and its planning
region. These add value to land subdivision and enable
strangers, delivery concerns, emergency vehicles, and even
potential buyers to find their way around. The subdivider
should consult with the McMinnville Public Works Director or
Warren County Road Supervisor for installation standards. 
 28
16. Warning and Regulatory Signs
The developer is required to install warning and regulatory signs at
appropriate locations in the subdivision (stop signs, etc.). The
Public Works Director or Warren County Road Supervisor should
be consulted for proper location and installation standards.
E. Streets - Construction Procedures and Specifications
The following procedures and specifications shall apply for the
construction of all streets in subdivisions located in McMinnville Planning
Region.

depth below the roadbed to avoid dangerous pressure of
impact, and in no case shall the top of the pipe be less than
one (1) foot below the roadbed.
j. The drainage system should be designed based on a storm
frequency of 10 years. However, if the 10 year design flow
is greater than 100 cubic feet per second, the system shall
be capable of accommodating the 100-year design flow
within the drainage easement.
k. In those cases where the drainage system relies on
sinkholes for discharge, it should be capable of accepting
the 100-year design flow within the dedicated easement.
l. The drainage conduits shall maintain a minimum velocity of
2 1/2 feet per second at full flow but shall not exceed 20 feet
per second.

appropriate specifications.
F. Utilities - General Standards
The following general standards shall apply for the construction of utilities
in or for subdivisions located in the McMinnville Planning Region:
1. Easements
The Planning Commission may require easements, not less than
12 feet and not more than 20 feet in width for poles, wires,
conduits, gas, and heat mains, or other utility lines, along all rear lot
lines, along side lot lines if necessary or if, in the opinion of the
Planning Commission, advisable. All easements for water, storm
and sanitary sewers shall be 20 feet in width. Easements of the
same or greater width may be required along lot lines, where
necessary for the extension of existing or planned utilities.
All easements intended for the location of utilities shall be shown
on the final plat of a proposed subdivision and shall be noted on
said plat as a "Utility Easement".
2. Installation
After road grading is completed and approved and before any
gravel or surfacing is applied, all of the underground work [water
mains, sewer lines, and other underground utilities (where
applicable), and all service connections] shall be installed
completely and approved throughout the length of the road and
across the flat section.
G. Water Distribution System
The following standards and specifications shall apply for the design and

Planning Commission to be essential to the public welfare in
developments where homes will be in close proximity to
each other.
b. When a proposed subdivision is not directly adjacent to an
area served by a public water supply system, or should
improvements to the source of water supply be required in
order to meet the demands of the proposed subdivision, the
cost of said improvements shall be borne by the developer
unless determined otherwise by the City of McMinnville.
c. Lands without accessibility to public water supply systems or
developments not capable of the provision of an adequate
supply of water through an approved system of production,
storage, and distribution, capable of providing adequate flow
for domestic use and fire protection shall be deemed
unsuitable for development as a subdivision until such time
as this system can be provided.
3. Construction Standards

a. Water mains properly connected with McMinnville's water
supply system or to the applicable water utility district system
shall be constructed in such a manner as to serve all lots
shown on the subdivision plat for both domestic use and fire
protection.

service to other connections on the system. 
 35
b. Connections to every lot shall include a three-fourths (3/4)
inch copper service line extending at least ten (10) feet onto
the property line with a Ford KV-2 backflow device meter
yoke within a meter box as approved by the McMinnville
Water Department or applicable water utility district.
6. Fire Protection
a. If, as determined by the Fire Chief for the City of
McMinnville, fire protection can be provided at the time of
platting, then fire hydrants shall be spaced not more than
1000 feet apart as measured along a street in residential
areas and no more than 600 feet apart as measured along a
street in commercial areas. They shall be so located that
they will be accessible, protected from traffic hazards, and
will not obstruct walks, roadways, or parking facilities.
b. A minimum fire flow requirement of 500 gallons per minute
and 20 pounds per square inch residual pressure must be
available in all distribution systems. More stringent
standards may be required by the McMinnville Fire

representatives of the City of McMinnville. Prior to the start
of construction, the developer or his representative shall
contact the McMinnville Water/Waste Water Department in
order to develop an inspection schedule.
b. As a minimum, all water systems shall be subjected to
pressure and leakage testing. Pressure tests shall be
performed at a pressure of fifty percent (50%) above the
working pressure at the test point and shall be maintained
for two (2) hours. The leakage test shall be conducted
concurrently with pressure test. The McMinnville
Water/Waste Water Department may require other testing,
including compaction tests prepared by an independent
testing laboratory for back-filled utility trenches.

located in the McMinnville Planning Region shall conform to the
Rules of the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation - Division of Water Pollution Control, Chapter 2,
Design of Waste Water Collection Lines and Pumping Stations.
2. Accessibility
When a proposed subdivision is not directly adjacent to an existing
public sewer system, the Planning Commission shall determine the
accessibility of the nearest system and determine whether the
subdivider must make connections. The Planning Commission may
seek the advice of other government officials, and/or qualified
consultants prior to making this determination.
3. Design Period
In general, sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed for the
estimated ultimate development of the proposed subdivision and
the potential future development of adjoining land.
4. Minimum Size and Construction Standards
 The sanitary sewer lines shall be at least eight (8) inches in size
and in accordance with the instructions and specifications of the
McMinnville Water/Waste Water Department and the Tennessee
Department of Environment and Conservation, and in such a
manner as to serve adequately all lots with connection to the public
system.
5. Service Connections
 Connections to the sewer system shall be installed for every lot in
the subdivision and shall include a four (4) inch lateral extending at 
 37
least ten (10) feet onto the property line with a clean-cut installed
extending to grade and properly capped to prevent infiltration.
6. Protection of Water Supplies
 There shall be no physical connection between a sewer system
and a public or private potable water system which would permit
the passage of any waste water or polluted water into the potable
water supply. The vertical and horizontal separation of sanitary
sewers and water mains shall be as required by the McMinnville
Water/Waste Water Department.
7. Inspections, Testing and Material Certifications
 a. All sanitary sewers and appurtenances are to be inspected
by representatives of the City McMinnville. Prior to the start
of construction, the developer or his representative shall
contact the McMinnville Water/Waste Water Department in
order to develop an inspection schedule.
b. As a minimum, all sanitary sewer construction shall be
subjected to visual, leakage, and where flexible pipe is
permitted, deflection testing. The McMinnville Water/Waste
Water Department may require other testing, including
compaction tests prepared by an independent testing
laboratory for back-filled utility trenches.
c. The contractor(s) and/or supplier(s) furnishing pipe,
manholes, and other appurtenances shall furnish to the City
of McMinnville written certification that the materials used in
the construction of sanitary sewer improvements developed
under these regulations meet or exceed the appropriate
specifications,
8. As-Built Drawings
 Prior to the acceptance of all sanitary sewer collection systems
shown on all plats presented to the McMinnville Regional Planning
Commission and prior to the release of any financial guarantee as
required by these regulations, the developer shall submit to the
McMinnville Water/Waste Water Department a complete set of "asbuilt" drawings for said system.
9. Subsurface Sewerage Disposal Systems
 Where the Planning Commission determines that a subdivision
does not have to connect to the existing sewerage system, lots
must contain adequate area for the installation of approved septic
tank(s) and disposal fields as determined by and approved in
writing by the Tennessee Department of Environment and
Conservation prior to the plat receiving final approval. 
 38
I. Other Utilities (Gas, Electric, Telephone, Cable TV, etc.)
1. Below Ground
The Planning Commission shall encourage the complete use of
underground utilities (including electric, telephone, and cable TV)
wherever practical. These are to be installed in the street right-ofway between the paved roadway and property line to simplify
location and repair of lines. After grading is completed and
approved, and before any pavement base is applied, all of the
instreet underground utility work shall be completely installed and
approved throughout the length of the street and across the flat
section.
2. Above Ground
Where electric, telephone and/or cable TV utilities are to be
installed above ground, they should be provided for in rear lot
easements whenever practicable. These easements shall be
perpetual, unobstructed, a minimum of 20 feet in width and
provided with satisfactory street access. Whenever possible
easements shall be cleared and graded.
3. Underground Service Connections Required
 Underground service connections for all utilities (including electric,
telephone and cable TV) shall be installed for each lot within the
subdivision and all wires and cables shall be enclosed in an
appropriate conduit. This requirement shall be noted on all final
subdivision plats.
J. Lots
1. Lots to be Buildable
The lot arrangement shall be such that in constructing a building
there will be no foreseeable difficulties for reasons of topography or
other natural conditions. Lots should not be of such depth as to
encourage the later creation of a second building lot at the front or
rear. If the subdivision is to be served by public sewer, lots should
be designed so that none will be "below grade" and be rendered
unservable by sewer.
2. Lot Lines
Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to straight street
centerline, and radial to curved street centerline. Rear lot lines
should consist of straight lines with a minimum number of
deflections. 
 39
3. Minimum Lot Size
The size, shape and orientation of lots shall be such as the
Planning Commission deems appropriate for the type of
development and use contemplated.
a. Residential lots served by public water and public sanitary
sewer systems:
Minimum area = 15,000 sq. ft. or as required by the
McMinnville Zoning Code. (Amended 12/9/97)
Minimum width at building setback line = 75 ft.
b. Residential lots served by public water and private sewage
disposal systems:
Minimum area = (amended 4/8/97)
(1) Lots with a soils rating of between 15-60 minutes
shall have a minimum area of 22,000 sq. ft.*
(2) Lots with a soils rating of between 75-106 minutes
shall have a minimum area of 30,000 sq. ft.*
Minimum width at building setback line = 100 ft.*
*Greater minimum area may be required for private sewage
disposal if there are factors of drainage, soil condition or
other conditions to cause potential health problems. The
Planning Commission requires that results from soils tests
be submitted in order to approve subdivisions dependent
upon septic tanks as a means of sewage disposal.
c. Non-residential Lots
The size of lots reserved or laid out for commercial or
industrial properties shall conform with provisions of the
McMinnville Zoning Code and shall be adequate to provide
for the off-street services and parking facilities required by
the type of use and development contemplated. Platting of
individual lots should be avoided in favor of an overall design
of the land, so as to provide insulation against adverse
effects on present or future adjacent residential
development.
4. Building Setback Lines
The minimum depth of building setback lines from the abutting
street right-of-way shall be in accordance with requirements in the
current McMinnville Zoning Code.
5. Minimum Street Frontage
All lots shall have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage on a public
street, except on a permanent dead-end street (cul-de-sac) where
the minimum frontage may be 30 feet. 
 40
6. Off-Street Parking
All residential subdivision lots shall provide sufficient off-street
parking space for at least three (3) vehicles. Non-residential
subdivisions shall provide off-street parking and loading space in
accordance with provisions of the McMinnville Zoning Code.
K. Drainage
An adequate drainage system, including necessary open ditches, pipes,
culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc., shall be provided
for the proper drainage of all surface water. This will include adequate
easements to remove surface water from the buildable portion of lots.
1. Drainage Plan Required

A drainage plan showing proposed modifications to the flow of
water across the site of the proposed subdivision or to and from
adjoining properties shall be prepared and submitted with the
preliminary plat of the subdivision.
2. Removal of Spring and Surface Water
The subdivider may be required by the Planning Commission to
carry away pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previous to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way where
feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width.
3. Other Watercourses
Where a watercourse separates a proposed street from abutting
property, provision shall be made for access to all lots by means of
culverts or other structures of design approved by the Public Works
Director or County Road Superintendent. Where a subdivision is
traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream,
there shall be provided a storm water easement or drainage rightof-way as required, and it shall in no case be less than 20 feet in
width.
4. Storm Drainage Under Streets
Cross drains shall be provided to accommodate all natural water
flow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full width roadway
and the required slopes. All cross drains that are to be laid under
the roadway shall be of concrete construction. The size openings
to be provided shall be determined by the Rational Formula, but in
no case shall the pipe be less than 18 inches in diameter. Cross
drains shall be built on straight line and grade, and shall be laid on
a firm base but not on rock. Pipes shall be laid with the spigot end
pointing in the direction of the flow and with the ends fitted and 
 41
matched to provide tight joints and a smooth uniform invert. Head
walls shall be provided at each end of all cross drains. Drains shall
be placed at a sufficient depth below the roadbed to avoid
dangerous pressure of impact with the top of the pipe at least one
(1) foot below roadbed.
5. Driveway culverts shall be a minimum of 15 inches in diameter.
6. Accommodation of Potential Upstream Development
A culvert or other drainage facility shall, in each case, be large
enough to accommodate potential runoff from its entire upstream
drainage area, whether inside or outside the subdivision.
7. Responsibility for Downstream Drainage
The subdivider's engineer shall also study the effect of each
subdivision on the existing downstream drainage facilities outside
the area of the subdivision. Where it is anticipated that the
additional run-off incident to the development of the subdivision will
overload an existing downstream drainage, provision shall be made
for the improvement of said condition.
8. Storm Water Retention

The Planning Commission may require storm water retention
facilities for subdivisions where the presence of Sinkhole Retention
Areas, Flood Hazard Areas or water courses of limited capacity are
the recipients of storm water discharge from the site of said
subdivision. In general, this requirement will apply only to those
subdivisions planned to contain five (5) or more dwelling units or
commercial and/or other structures which will consists of a total of
10,000 or more square feet of impermeable surface (roof and
parking area).
When it is determined by the Planning Commission that storm
water retention facilities are required, no plat for such subdivision
shall be approved from which storm water run-off is discharged into
public rights-of-way, public drainage structures or natural watercourses at a rate greater than the rate which water is being
discharged from the site prior to the proposed development taking
place.
The drainage plan accompanying the plat for all subdivisions
meeting this criteria shall show all proposed discharge structures
and points of storm water discharge from the site. Said plans shall
be accompanied by a set of calculations which illustrate the flow of
storm water from each existing and proposed discharge point
expressed as cubic feet per second (cfs) and gallons per minute
(gpm). Said calculations shall show this discharge of water under
existing and proposed conditions. 
 42
9. Land Subject of Flooding-See Section B of this Article for Special
Requirements for Floodable Areas.
10. Erosion Reduction
The developer shall utilize grading techniques, subdivision design,
landscaping, sedimentation basins, special vegetation cover, and
other measures to reduce erosion and sedimentation during and
after development.
L. Preservation of Natural Features
The developer shall, wherever possible, attempt to preserve all natural
features which add value to residential developments and to the
community, such as large trees or groves, water courses and falls, historic
spots, vistas and similar irreplaceable assets. 
 43
ARTICLE IV SPECIAL DEVELOPMENTS
A. Planned Unit Development Subdivision Standards
The purpose of the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is to allow flexibility
and innovation in land development and land use. This form of
development, which is also referred to as "cluster development" or "open
space development," usually involves the clustering of dwelling units on
certain portions of the site and generally includes common open space
property owned and maintained by a property owners association. It is an
environmentally sound concept, because it can allow for development in
the most suitable areas while preventing development in unsuitable areas
such as flood plains or areas with steep slopes. Also it is an economically
sound concept; because it can reduce the costs for infrastructure (the
length of street and utility lines can be significantly decreased).
The McMinnville Zoning Code provides for two (2) types of Planned Unit
Developments Districts: (1) PRD-Planned Residential District and (2)
PCD-Planned Commercial District. These zoning districts allow for the
mixture of land uses such as traditional single-family houses, town
houses, apartments, and some commercial and pubic uses. Generally,
the intent of the Planned Unit Development is to permit varied lot sizes
and clustered development while at the same time preserving open space
without increasing overall density and without increasing the effective
impact on the community.
All Planned Unit Developments or similar such developments shall meet
the following standards:
1. The developer shall meet with the City Administrator, Codes
Enforcement Official, and Staff Planner to become familiar with all
applicable requirements.

2. Shall be in compliance with all provisions of Section 11-511 of the
McMinnville Zoning Code.
3. In general, shall meet all requirements and minimum standards of
design required in these regulations.
4. Depending on the design of the development and/or types of
residential units within, some or all of the development may be
required to conform to TCA 66-27-101 through 123, entitled
Horizontal Property Act.
B. Large Scale Development
The requirements of these regulations may be modified in the case of
large scale community or neighborhood units, such as a housing project,
trailer court or shopping center which is not subdivided into customary
lots, blocks, and streets, if the development is approved by the Planning
Commission and if it is in conformity with the purpose and intent of these
regulations. 
 44
C. Condominium Developments
Proposed residential or commercial projects which will offer individual
attached units for sale with or without any land, and with certain elements
in common to all units may be required to conform with requirements of
TCA 66-27-101 to 123, entitled the Horizontal Property Act. 
 45
ARTICLE V ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR
 VIOLATIONS
The enforcement of these regulations and penalties for the unapproved
recordation or transfer of land are provided by state law in the authority granted
by public acts of the State of Tennessee.
A. Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land, transfers or
sells or agrees to sell or negotiates to sell such land by reference to or
exhibition of or by other use of a plat of subdivision of such land without
having submitted a plat of such subdivision to the McMinnville Regional
Planning Commission and obtained its approval and before such plat be
recorded in the office of the county register, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as provided by law, as
provided in Sections 13-4-306 and 13-3-410 Tennessee Code Annotated.
B. The description by metes and bounds in an instrument of transfer or other
document used in the process of selling or transferring a lot in an
unapproved subdivision shall not exempt the transaction from being a
subdivision if two (2) or more lots are being created and does not exempt
such transaction from misdemeanor penalties as provided in Sections 13-
4-306 and 13-3-410 Tennessee Code Annotated.
C. No building permit shall be issued and no building or structure shall be
erected on any lot within the area of jurisdiction of the Planning
Commission unless the street giving access to the lot shall have been
accepted or opened as a public street in accordance with these
regulations, or otherwise had received the legal status of a public street,
or unless such street corresponds to a street shown on an approved plat,
etc., as provided in Sections 13-4-308 and 13-3-411 Tennessee Code
Annotated.
D. Any building or structure erected or to be erected in violation of Section
13-4-308, Tennessee Code Annotated, shall be deemed an unlawful
building or structure, and the building inspector or the city attorney or
other official designated by the McMinnville Board of Mayor and Aldermen
may bring action to enjoin such erection or cause it to be vacated or
removed.
E. No board, public officer, or authority shall light any street, lay or authorize
the laying of water mains or sewers or the construction of other facilities or
utilities in any street located within the area of planning jurisdiction, unless
such street shall have been accepted, opened, or otherwise received the
legal status of a public street prior to the adoption of these regulations, or
unless such street corresponds in its location and lines with a street
shown on a subdivision plat approved by the Planning Commission, or a
thoroughfare plan made and adopted by the commission as provided in
Section 13-4-307, Tennessee Code Annotated. 
 46
F. No county register of deeds shall file or record a plat of a subdivision of
land within the McMinnville Planning Region without the approval of the
McMinnville Planning Commission as required by Section 13-4-302,
Tennessee Code Annotated, and any county register so doing shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable as other misdemeanors as
provided by law. 
 47
ARTICLE VI ADOPTION
A. Before adoption of these subdivision standards, a public hearing as
required by Section 13-4-303 and Section 13-3-403, Tennessee Code
Annotated, was afforded any interested person or persons and was held
on November 14, 1995. Notice of such hearing was announced in the
Southern Standard, being of general circulation within the area of planning
jurisdiction on October 13, 1995 and November 5, 1995 stating the time
and place for the hearing.
B. These regulations shall be in full force and effect from and after their
adoption.
 Adopted: November 14, 1995
