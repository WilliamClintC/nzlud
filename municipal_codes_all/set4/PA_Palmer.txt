The publication entitled the "National Plumbing Code/2000" and its errata
sheets, published by the National Code Council, hereinafter called the
"code," is hereby accepted, adopted and incorporated in its entirety, except
as may be hereinafter otherwise indicated, as the Palmer Township Basic
Plumbing Code. Wherever in said code blanks appear, the obvious required
or indicated insertions are to be considered made; and wherever in said
code the words "municipality" or "name of municipality" appear, the words
"Palmer Township" are to be considered as inserted.
§ 124-3. Floor drains.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, floor drains are prohibited in all uses and
structures unless they are proven necessary to the safe and sanitary
operation of the use to which they service and meet the requirements of
the Plumbing Code. In addition, special separators, traps and filters must
be installed if deemed necessary by the Plumbing Inspector or code official
having jurisdiction.
§ 124-4. Rules and hearings.
In addition to the other penalties contained in this ordinance, the Board,
after giving notice and affording the aggrieved party an opportunity for
a public hearing, may, for cause, revoke or suspend a plumbing license
or permit or recognition of another municipal license and take such other
action as may be proper. In the case of a plumbing license, cause shall
include but is not limited to violation of this ordinance, the code, rules
of the Board or other improper conduct. The Board may also adopt rules
governing plumbing materials and practices, and by applying for a township

any plumbing fixture, pipe or device, other than digging ditches or selling
supplies, unless such person or entity holds a valid Palmer Township master
plumbing license. The Palmer Township Plumbing Inspector may recognize
a master plumbing license from a first (1st), second (2nd), or third (3rd)
class city and issue a Palmer Township master plumber's license which is
renewable at the beginning of each calendar year. Licenses and permits
are nontransferable, and may not be taken out in the name of another.

drains or fixtures and which is unethical or fraudulent in its conduct of the
same.

§ 145-6 SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS, INDIVIDUAL § 145-6
145:213
(1) Seepage pits shall be used for disposal of septic tank effluent only
when the installation of tile disposal trenches is due to unfavorable
soil absorption in topsoil mantle, groundwater level, topography,
and will not reduce the safety of surrounding water supplies. The
pit excavation shall terminate at least four feet above the highest
known or calculated water table.
(2) The location of seepage pits shall be not less than the stated
minimum distances from the following:
(a) Any water supply well or buried water suction pipe: 100 feet.
(b) Occupied buildings: 20 feet.
(c) Property lines and buried pipe distributing water under
pressure: 10 feet.
(d) Other seepage pits: three times the diameter of the largest pit
(edge to edge).
(3) Effective absorption area of a seepage pit is the vertical-wall area
(based on dug diameter) of the impervious strata below the inlet.
(a) Required seepage area shall be determined by the percolation
test made in each vertical stratum penetrated. The weighted
average of the results shall be computed to obtain a design
figure. Soil strata in which the percolation rates are in excess
of 30 minutes per inch shall not be included in computing the
absorption area. No allowance shall be made for impervious
strata or bottom area.
(b) All pits shall have a diameter of at least four feet.
(4) Construction of all seepage pits shall conform to the following
requirements:
(a) To prevent cave-in, the pit shall be lined with brick, stone or
block at least four inches thick, laid in a radial arch to support
the pit walls.
(b) The brick, stone or block shall be laid watertight above the
inlet and with open joints below the inlet to provide adequate
passage of liquids.
(c) A minimum annular space of six inches between the lining and
excavation wall shall be filled with crushed rock or gravel.
(d) The top of the seepage pit shall be constructed to be capable of
supporting the overburden of earth and any reasonable load to
which it is subjected. Access to the pit shall be provided by
means of a manhole or inspection hole equipped with a
watertight cover. The seepage pit may terminate in a
conventional manhole top, frame and cover. The top of the
§ 145-6 PALMER CODE § 145-6
145:214
seepage pit shall be not less than 12 inches below the ground
surface. Where the top is more than 18 inches below the
ground surface, there shall be provided an inspection pipe of
not less than four-inch diameter extending through the cover
to a point above the tank not more than six inches below
finished ground level. The top of the inspection pipe shall be
provided with a removable watertight cap and its location shall
be marked at the ground surface.

water service period immediately preceding the quarter in which the
sewer billing is rendered. Owners of property connected to the sewer
system for only a portion of a calendar quarter shall pay a pro rata
sewer rental based upon the time period actually connected during the
quarter. All sewer rental billings shall be due and payable upon
presentation, and, if not paid within 30 days from the date of billing, a

discharged to a low-pressure sanitary sewer system shall pay, in
addition to the sewer rental charge set forth herein, an additional
monthly fee as set by the Board of Supervisors, payable quarterly. Such
additional fee is to pay the cost of eventual replacement of the grinder
pump units by the Township. The additional monthly fee collected from
property owners connected to a low-pressure sanitary sewer system
shall be deposited into an interest-bearing escrow account to be used
exclusively for the purpose of defraying the costs to the Township for
the replacement of grinder-pump units. [Added 2-10-1981 by Ord.

plans to change its operations so as to materially alter the characteristics
and volumes of wastewaters discharged thereto, shall notify the Township,
in writing, at least 10 days before making such connection or changing its
operations.
§ 147-5. Exclusion of harmful wastes.
A. The Township reserves the right to refuse permission to connect to the
sewer system, to compel discontinuance of use of the sewer system, or
to compel pretreatment of wastewaters in order to prevent discharges
deemed harmful or to have a deleterious effect upon any portion of the
sewer system. No wastewaters shall be discharged to the sewer system:
(1) Having a temperature higher than 140º F.
(2) Containing more than 100 ppm by weight of fats, oils and grease.

right to cut off sewer service or request that water service be
discontinued, or do both, to the delinquent premises and not restore the
same until all delinquent bills against the delinquent premises,
establishment or owner and the cost of cutting off and restoring service
shall have been paid. [Amended 2-7-1972 by Ord. No. 118]
B. The owners of all properties connected to the sewer system must give
the Township their correct address. Failure to receive bills shall not be
considered an excuse for nonpayment nor will it permit an extension of
the period in which bills are payable at face. All property owners shall
be primarily responsible for sewer bills; however, the Township may bill
individual tenants of any property owner at the owner's request. Such
billing shall in no way reduce the primary responsibility of the property
owner for nonpayment and the property owner shall be responsible for
notifying the Township of all changes in occupancy, tenants or address.

Recycling Program
[Adopted 8-20-1990 by Ord. No. 236]
§ 156-10. Short title.
This ordinance shall be known as the "Palmer Township Recycling
Ordinance."
§ 156-11. Intent; purpose.
A. According to the Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste
Reduction Act ("Act 101"), 53 P.S. § 4000.101 through 4000.1904 (1988)
(hereinafter referred to as the "Act"), waste reduction and recycling are
preferable to the processing or disposal of municipal waste. A recycling
program is required to promote and protect the public interest so that
reusable materials may be returned to the economic mainstream in the
form of raw materials or products rather than being disposed of or
processed at the commonwealth's overburdened municipal waste
processing or disposal facilities. The Act requires certain
municipalities, including Palmer Township, to:
(1) Establish and implement a source-separation and collection
program for recyclable materials.
(2) Reach the goal that at least 25% of all municipal waste be recycled
by and continuing after January 1, 1997.
(3) Ensure that two years after the effective date (of the Act) no
municipal waste landfill may accept for disposal and no resource
recovery facility may accept for processing, other than composting,
truck loads composed primarily of leaf waste.
(4) Establish and maintain a comprehensive and sustained public
information and education program concerning recycling program
features and requirements. The intent of such a program is to
notify persons of recycling requirements and encourage, through a
variety of means, participation in such activities.
B. Palmer Township is aware that the success of a recycling program is
dependent upon the availability and use of standardized collection
practices and uniform containers to facilitate separation and pick up.
C. Palmer Township is aware that the recycling program will be more
effective if the household containers provided are protected from theft
and destruction, and if persons are forbidden to scavenge recyclables
from containers once they are placed curbside.
D. Palmer Township is aware that the recycling program will be impaired
without the cooperation and participation of those persons required to
recycle by the Act and this ordinance and the regulations.

A. Outline of program.
(1) Act 101, The Municipal Waste Planning, Recycling and Waste
Reduction Act of 1988, required that municipalities select at least
three items from a list that includes the following: clear glass,
colored glass, aluminum, steel and bimetallic cans, high-grade

§ 156-25 SMOKING § 156-27
153:259
(2) In order to procure the greatest benefit for the community, Palmer
has established a comprehensive recycling list. The recycling
program benefits the community by conserving landfill space and
conserving our natural resources through the reutilization of
recyclable materials. Therefore, as of the effective date of these
regulations, the persons listed under this section shall be required
to exclude the following items from their municipal waste:
aluminum, clear glass, colored glass, corrugated cardboard, thirdclass
mail, magazines, telephone books, brown paper, grey paper,
high-grade office and mixed paper, bimetallic cans consisting of
aluminum and steel, plastics Nos. 1 through 7 excluding styrofoam,
newsprint, leaf waste, and other yard waste. Yard waste and leaf
waste shall be collected by the hauling contractor hired by Palmer
Township and/or Palmer Township employees periodically
throughout the year and be deposited at Palmer Township's
composting facility. Yard waste and leaf waste shall otherwise only
be deposited at Palmer Township's compost facility. [Amended
10-8-2012 by Ord. No. 2012-414]
(3) The persons listed under this section must separate leaf waste from
other municipal waste. However, the Township recognizes that
residents may occasionally include a small amount of leaf waste in
with their municipal waste. Palmer Township may provide leaf
collection at limited times as authorized by the Board of
Supervisors. At other times, persons shall provide their own
transportation of such waste to the composting site provided by
Palmer Township or use the leaf waste for any purpose not
prohibited by law. Specific instructions in regard to the collection
times and preparation of leaf waste for collection shall be set by the
recycling coordinator.
(4) Each licensed hauler collecting municipal solid waste in Palmer
Township shall furnish to the Township each quarter of the
calendar year (unless otherwise instructed by the recycling
coordinator) a recycling report specifying the materials recycled
and the weight of the materials recycled which were collected in
Palmer Township. Haulers shall furnish weight receipts for all
residential recyclables collected with the quarterly recycling report
to the recycling coordinator. The recycling coordinator may require
other information, as needed, to enhance recycling performance
and to comply with DEP requests for information as well as
information needed by the Township to obtain grants for the
recycling program.
(5) Persons participating in a curbside collection program under this
section shall recycle in conjunction with the program of a licensed
hauler of Palmer Township. Once the recyclables are placed
curbside, they become the property of the licensed hauler
58.Editor's Note: See § 156-13A.
§ 156-27 PALMER CODE § 156-27
153:260
authorized to collect them. (See Section 7 of Ordinance 236, the
Palmer Township Recycling Ordinance59). Any licensed hauler
authorized to collect municipal waste for residents in Palmer
Township shall provide a curbside recycling service to its
residential customers within the Township. The licensed hauler
shall collect and market for recycling the recyclable materials
it collects from its residential curbside recycling service to
residential customers. Each licensed hauler shall market for
recycling all of the materials required to be recycled under this
section of these regulations. The licensed hauler shall not pick and
choose among the materials to be recycled. No licensed hauler
shall landfill any recyclables unless they are received at the point
of collection in a contaminated condition which makes them
unmarketable. Failure to comply with any of these provisions is a
separate violation of the regulations and may be construed as a
separate violation for each time the violation occurs or every day
upon which the violation occurs.
(6) Each licensed hauler in the municipality collecting recyclables
curbside shall give notice to his customers of the collection dates,
the recyclables to be collected, and the method of curbside
preparation.
B. Preparation of recyclables.
(1) The recyclables which are to be collected by a licensed Palmer

recyclables at commercial, municipal or institutional establishments
located in Palmer Township shall be required to furnish a quarterly
recycling report to the Township unless otherwise instructed by the
Palmer Township recycling coordinator. The report shall contain the
approximate weights and types of recyclables collected at these
facilities. The licensed hauler shall provide weight receipts to the
recycling coordinator on a quarterly basis to document the materials
recycled. If for any reason the licensed hauler fails to report for his
recycling customer, it shall become the responsibility of the

General Provisions
§ 158-1. Short title.
This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Palmer Township
Bushkill Creek Watershed and Fry's Run Study Area Act 167 Stormwater
Management Ordinance," for portions of the Bushkill Creek Watershed and
Fry's Run Study Area located in Palmer Township.
§ 158-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 158-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this ordinance is to promote the public health, safety and
welfare within the Bushkill Creek Watershed and the Fry's Run Study
A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting
from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and
velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, changes the
natural hydrologic patterns, destroys aquatic habitat, elevates aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings, overtaxes the carrying capacity
of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public
facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines floodplain
management and flood control efforts in downstream communities,
reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated erosion and loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to
the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of the people of
the municipality and all of the people of the commonwealth, their
resources and the environment.
C. Stormwater can be an important resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and baseflow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
E. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
F. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.

§ 158-6. Exemptions.
B. This ordinance shall only apply to permanent stormwater management
facilities constructed as part of any of the activities listed in this
section. Stormwater management and erosion and sedimentation
control during construction involved with any of these activities are
specifically not required by this ordinance, but shall continue to be
regulated under existing laws and ordinances.
C. This ordinance contains only those stormwater runoff control criteria
and standards which are necessary or desirable from a total watershed
perspective. Additional stormwater management design criteria (i.e.,
inlet spacing, inlet type, collection system details, etc.) which represent
sound engineering practice may be regulated either by separate
stormwater ordinance provisions or as part of the general
responsibilities of the Municipal Engineer.
D. The following activities are defined as regulated activities and shall be
governed by this ordinance:
(1) Land development.
(2) Subdivision.
(3) Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces (driveways,
parking lots, etc.).
(4) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
(5) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
(6) Installation of stormwater systems or appurtenances thereto.
(7) Regulated earth disturbance activities.
A. Impervious cover. Any proposed regulated activity, except those defined
in § 158-5D(5) and (6), which would create 10,000 square feet or less of
additional impervious cover is exempt from the drainage plan
preparation provisions of this ordinance. The date of the municipal
ordinance adoption of the original Bushkill Creek Watershed and Fry's
Run Study Area Act 167 Stormwater Management Ordinances (1992
and 1999, respectively) shall be the starting point from which to
consider tracts as parent tracts in which future subdivisions and
respective impervious area computations shall be cumulatively
considered. For development taking place in stages, the entire
development plan must be used in determining conformance with these
criteria. Additional impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to,
additional indoor living spaces, decks, patios, garages, driveways,
storage sheds and similar structures, any roof, parking or driveway
areas and any new streets and sidewalks constructed as part of or for
the proposed regulated activity. Any additional areas proposed initially
to be gravel, crushed stone, porous pavement, etc. shall be assumed to

§ 158-7. Inconsistent ordinances and laws.
In the event that any other ordinance of the municipality is inconsistent with
any of the provisions of this ordinance, this ordinance shall prevail. In the
event that any valid state or federal law or regulation is inconsistent with
any of the provisions of this ordinance, such provisions of this ordinance
shall be preempted by the applicable state or federal law.
be impervious for the purposes of comparison to the exemption criteria.
Any existing gravel, crushed stone or hard-packed soil areas on a site
shall be considered as pervious cover for the purpose of exemption
evaluation. All of the impervious cover added incrementally to a site
above the initial 10,000 square feet shall be subject to the provisions
of this ordinance. If a site has previously received an exemption and is
proposing additional development such that the total impervious cover
on the site exceeds 10,000 square feet, the total impervious cover
on the site proposed since the original ordinance date must meet the
provisions of this ordinance.
B. Prior drainage plan approval. Any regulated activity for which a
drainage plan was previously prepared as part of a subdivision or land
development proposal that received preliminary plan approval from the
municipality prior to the effective date of this ordinance is exempt from
the drainage plan preparation provisions of this ordinance, except as
cited in § 158-6C, provided that the approved drainage plan included
design of stormwater facilities to control runoff from the site currently
proposed for regulated activities consistent with ordinance provisions
in effect at the time of approval and the approval has not lapsed under
the Municipalities Planning Code.62 If significant revisions are made to
the drainage plan after both the preliminary plan approval and the
effective date of this ordinance, preparation of a new drainage plan,
subject to the provisions of this ordinance, shall be required. Significant
revisions would include a change in control methods or techniques,
relocation or redesign of control measures or changes necessary
because soil or other conditions are not as stated on the original
drainage plan.
C. These exemptions shall not relieve the applicant from implementing
such measures as are necessary to protect health, safety, property, and
state water quality requirements. These measures include adequate
and safe conveyance of stormwater on the site and as it leaves the site.
These exemptions do not relieve the applicant from the responsibility to
secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any
other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
D. No exemptions shall be provided for regulated activities as defined in
§ 158-5D(5) and (6).

§ 158-8. Severability.
Should any section or provision of this ordinance be declared invalid by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of
any of the remaining provisions of this ordinance.
§ 158-9. Compliance with other ordinance requirements.
Approvals issued pursuant to this ordinance do not relieve the applicant
of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance.
§ 158-10. Duty of persons engaged in development of land.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this ordinance, including exemption and
waiver provisions, any landowner and any person engaged in the alteration
or development of land which may affect stormwater runoff characteristics
shall implement such measures as are reasonably necessary to prevent
injury to health, safety or other property. Such measures shall include such
actions as are required to manage the rate, volume, direction and quality
of resulting stormwater runoff in a manner which otherwise adequately
protects health and property from possible injury.

on site clearance prior to development, allowing for maximum retention
of existing vegetation (woodlands and other), minimum disturbance
and compaction of existing soil mantle and minimum site application
of chemicals postdevelopment. Typically, MD/MM includes disturbance
setback criteria from buildings as well as related site improvements
such as walkways, driveways, roadways, and any other improvements.
These criteria may vary by community context as well as by type of
development being proposed. Additionally, MD/MM also shall include

with loose stone or similar material and into which surface water is
directed for infiltration into the ground.
SEPARATE STORM SEWER SYSTEM  A conveyance or system of
conveyances (including roads with drainage systems, municipal streets,
catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels or storm
drains) primarily used for collecting and conveying stormwater runoff.
SHEET FLOW  Stormwater runoff flowing in a thin layer over the
ground surface.
SOIL-COVER-COMPLEX METHOD  A method of runoff computation
developed by NRCS which is based upon relating soil type and land use/
cover to a runoff parameter called a "curve number."
SPECIAL GEOLOGIC FEATURES  Carbonate bedrock features,
including, but not limited to, closed depressions, existing sinkholes,
fracture traces, lineaments, joints, faults, caves and pinnacles, which
§ 158-10.1 SMOKING § 158-10.1
153:281
may exist and must be identified on a site when stormwater
management BMPs are being considered.
SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE PROGRAM  A program that
identifies procedures for preventing and, as needed, cleaning up
potential spills and makes such procedures known and the necessary
equipment available to appropriate personnel.
STATE WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS  As defined under state
regulations, protection of designated and existing uses (See 25 Pa.
Code Chapters 93 and 96), including:
STORAGE INDICATION METHOD  A method of routing or moving
an inflow hydrograph through a reservoir or detention structure. The
method solves the mass conservation equation to determine an outflow
hydrograph as it leaves the storage facility.
STORM DRAINAGE PROBLEM AREAS  Areas which lack adequate
stormwater collection and/or conveyance facilities and which present
a hazard to persons or property. These areas are either documented
in Appendix B68 of this ordinance or identified by the municipality or
Municipal Engineer.
STORM SEWER  A system of pipes or other conduits which carries
intercepted surface runoff, street water and other wash waters, or
drainage, but excludes domestic sewage and industrial wastes.
STORMWATER  The surface runoff generated by precipitation
reaching the ground surface.
Each stream segment in Pennsylvania has a designated use, such
as "cold water fishes" or "potable water supply," which are listed in
Chapter 93. These uses must be protected and maintained, under
state regulations.
(1)
"Existing uses" are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
of whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated
earth disturbance activities must be designed to protect and
maintain existing uses and maintain the level of water quality
necessary to protect those uses in all streams and to protect and
maintain water quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by addition of pollutants, such as sediment, and changes
in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates as a result
of changes in land surface area from those activities. Therefore,
permanent discharges to surface waters must be managed to
protect the streambank, streambed and structural integrity of the
waterway to prevent these impacts.

STORMWATER FILTERS  Any number of structural mechanisms, such
as multichamber catch basins, sand/peat filters, sand filters, and so
forth, which are installed to intercept stormwater flow and remove
pollutants prior to discharge. Typically, these systems require periodic
maintenance and clean out.
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN  The plan for managing
stormwater runoff adopted by Northampton County for the Bushkill
Creek Watershed and Fry's Run Study Area as required by the Act of
October 4, 1978, P.L. 864, (Act 167), as amended, and known as the
"Stormwater Management Act."
STREAM  A watercourse.
SUBAREA  The smallest unit of watershed breakdown for hydrologic
modeling purposes for which the runoff control criteria have been
established in the stormwater management plan.
SUBDIVISION  The division or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel
of land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other
divisions of land, including changes in existing lot lines for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of lease, partition by the court for
distribution to heirs or devisees, transfer of ownership or building
or lot development; provided, however, that the subdivision by lease
of land for agricultural purposes into parcels of more than 10 acres,
not involving any new street or easement of access or any residential
dwelling, shall be exempted.
SURFACE WATERS OF THE COMMONWEALTH  Any and all rivers,
streams, creeks, rivulets, impoundments, ditches, watercourses, storm
sewers, lakes, dammed water, wetlands, ponds, springs and all other
bodies or channels of conveyance of surface water, or parts thereof,
whether natural or artificial, within or on the boundaries of this
commonwealth.
SWALE  A low-lying stretch of land which gathers or carries surface
water runoff. See also "vegetated swale."
TECHNICAL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE MANUAL AND
INFILTRATION FEASIBILITY REPORT, NOVEMBER 2002  The report
written by Cahill Associates that addresses the feasibility of infiltration
in carbonate bedrock areas in the Little Lehigh Creek Watershed. The

devices installed in a storm drainage system to capture coarse
pollutants (trash, leaves, etc.).
VEGETATED BUFFERS  Gently sloping areas that convey stormwater
as sheet flow over a broad, densely vegetated earthen area, possibly
coupled with the use of level spreading devices. Vegetated buffers
should be situated on minimally disturbed soils, have low-flow velocities
and extended residence times.
§ 158-10.1 SMOKING § 158-10.1
153:283
VEGETATED ROOFS  Vegetated systems installed on roofs that
generally consist of a waterproof layer, a root-barrier, drainage layer
(optional), growth media, and suitable vegetation. Vegetated roofs store
and eventually evapotranspirate the collected rooftop rainfall;
overflows may be provided for larger storms.
VEGETATED SWALES 

WET DETENTION PONDS  A basin that provides for necessary
stormwater storage as well as a permanent pool of water. To be
successful, wet ponds must have adequate natural hydrology (both
runoff inputs as well as soils and water table which allow for
maintenance of a permanent pool of water) and must be able to support
a healthy aquatic community so as to avoid creation of mosquito and
other health and nuisance problems.
Vegetated earthen channels designed to convey stormwater. These
swales are not considered to be water quality BMPs.
(1)
Broad, shallow, densely vegetated, earthen channels designed to
treat stormwater while slowly infiltrating, evapotranspirating, and
conveying it. Swales should be gently sloping with low flow
velocities to prevent erosion. Check dams may be added to enhance
performance.

ARTICLE III
Requirements and Standards
§ 158-11. General requirements.
A. All regulated activities in the municipality shall be subject to the
stormwater management requirements of this ordinance.
B. Storm drainage systems shall be provided to permit unimpeded flow in
natural watercourses, except as modified by stormwater detention
facilities, recharge facilities, water quality facilities, pipe systems or
open channels consistent with this ordinance.
C. The existing locations of concentrated drainage discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without written approval of the
affected property owner(s).
D. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge onto adjacent property
shall be managed such that, at minimum, the peak diffused flow does
not increase in the general direction of discharge, except as otherwise
provided in this ordinance. If diffused flow is proposed to be
concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property {including flows
from detention basin emergency spillways), the developer's engineer
must document and certify that there are adequate downstream
conveyance facilities to safely transport the concentrated discharge to
the point of predevelopment flow concentration, to the stream reach, or
otherwise prove that no harm will result from the concentrated
discharge. It is recommended that the developer obtain written
permission from the downstream property owner(s) for the proposed
discharges. Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be
subject to any applicable release rate criteria in the general direction of
existing discharge whether they are proposed to be concentrated or
maintained as diffused drainage areas.
E. Where a site is traversed by watercourses, swales, ditches, etc, there
shall be provided drainage easements conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourses swales, ditches, etc. The width of any
easement shall be adequate to provide for unimpeded flow of
postdevelopment storm runoff based either on calculations completed
by the developer in conformance with § 158-17 for the one-hundredyear
return period runoff, Bushkill Creek Watershed and Fry's Run
Study Area Act 167 one-hundred-year return period flows, or Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) one-hundred-year frequency
flood flows and to provide a freeboard allowance of 0.5 foot above the
design water surface level. In all areas, the flow rate to be utilized shall
be the maximum rate identified through either developer's calculations,
the Bushkill Creek Watershed and Fry's Run Study Area Act 167 or (if
applicable) FEMA study flows. In areas where the Act 167 flow rate is
the maximum rate, this rate shall be used unless a reduced flow rate is
determined by the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission to take
precedence over the Act 167 flow rate. This maximum flow rate shall be
§ 158-11 SMOKING § 158-11
153:285
used to determine the one-hundred-year flood elevations with HEC-RAS
modeling (or other modeling method as approved by the municipality).
The terms of the easement shall prohibit excavation, the placing of
fill or structures, and any alterations which may adversely affect the
flow of stormwater within any portion of the easement in the
postdevelopment condition. Also, periodic maintenance of the easement
to ensure proper runoff conveyance shall be required. Watercourses
for which the one-hundred-year floodplain is formally defined by FEMA
studies are also subject to the applicable municipal floodplain
regulations. All proposed buildings within or adjacent to a floodplain
as defined by FEMA studies shall have first floor elevations at least
1.5 feet above the one-hundred-year frequency flood elevation. The
one-hundred-year flood elevation to be used to establish the first floor
elevation shall be determined using the maximum flow rate between
FEMA study flows, Act 167 flows or calculated flows as identified above.
F. When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural
drainage swales on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage,
open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line
and grade of such natural drainage swales. Capacities of open channels
shall be calculated using the Manning Equation.
G. Postconstruction BMPs shall be designed, installed, operated and
maintained to meet the requirements of the Clean Streams Law69 and
implementing regulations, including the established practices in 25 Pa.
Code Chapter 102 and the specifications of this ordinance, so as to
prevent accelerated erosion in watercourse channels and at all points of
discharge.
H. No earth disturbance activities associated with any regulated activities
shall commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with the requirements of this ordinance.
I. Techniques described in Appendix F (Low-Impact Development) of this
ordinance70 are encouraged because they reduce the costs of complying
with the requirements of this ordinance and the State Water Quality
Requirements.
J. Infiltration for stormwater management is encouraged where soils and
geology permit, consistent with the provisions of this ordinance and,
where appropriate, the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D.71
K. Within areas containing soils identified by the Soil Conservation Service
to be sinkhole prone, permanent detention basins shall be lined with a
material, which after installation, attains a maximum permeability rate
as determined by the Township Geotechnical Engineer.

153:286
§ 158-12. Permit requirements by other government entities.
The following permit requirements apply to certain regulated and earth
disturbance activities and must be met prior to commencement of regulated
and earth disturbance activities, as applicable:
§ 158-13. Erosion and sediment control during regulated earth
disturbance activities.
L. Groundwater recharge methods shall not be permitted without written
approval of the Township Geotechnical Engineer.
M. Parking lot ponding depth shall not exceed two inches in areas of
anticipated pedestrian traffic, and six inches in all other areas for a
twenty-five-year frequency storm.
A. All regulated and earth disturbance activities subject to permit
requirements by the DEP under regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter
102.14.
B. Work within natural drainageways subject to permit by the DEP under
25 Pa. Code Chapter 102.
C. Any stormwater management facility that would be located in or
adjacent to surface waters of the commonwealth, including wetlands,
subject to permit by the DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 105.
D. Any stormwater management facility that would be located on a state
highway right-of-way or require access from a state highway shall be
subject to approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
(PennDOT).
E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by the DEP under 25 Pa. Code
Chapter 105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities. Written approval by
the DEP or a delegated County Conservation District shall satisfy this
requirement.
B. An erosion and sediment control plan is required by DEP regulations for
any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under Pa.
Code § 102.4(b).
C. A DEP NPDES stormwater discharges associated with construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities
under Pa. Code Chapter 92.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
§ 158-11 SMOKING § 158-13
153:287
§ 158-14. Postconstruction water quality criteria.
Conservation District must be provided to the municipality before the
commencement of an earth disturbance activity.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any permit, as
required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project site at all
times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with this ordinance. DEP has determined that
this ordinance meets state water quality requirements. Therefore, any
approvals under this ordinance would satisfy the postconstruction
stormwater management requirements associated with an NPDES
permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction
activities.
B. The water quality volume (WQv) shall be captured and treated. The
WQv shall be calculated two ways.
(1) First, WQv shall be calculated using the following formula:
Where
WQv = Water quality volume in acre-feet.
c = Rational Method postdevelopment runoff coefficient
for the two-year storm.
P = 1.25 inches.
A = Area in acres of proposed regulated activity.
(2) Second, the WQv shall be calculated as the difference in runoff
volume from predevelopment to postdevelopment for the two-year
return period storm. The effect of closed depressions on the site
shall be considered in this calculation. The larger of these two
calculated volumes shall be used as the WQv to be captured and
treated, except that in no case shall the WQv be required to exceed
1.25 inches of runoff over the site area. This standard does not limit
the volume of infiltration an applicant may propose for purposes of
water quantity/peak rate control.
C. The WQv shall be calculated for each postdevelopment drainage
direction on a site for sizing BMPs. Site areas having no impervious
cover and no proposed disturbance during development may be
excluded from the WQv calculations and do not require treatment.
D. If an applicant is proposing to use a wet pond, constructed wetland or
other BMP that ponds water on the land surface and may receive direct
§ 158-13 PALMER CODE § 158-14
153:288
sunlight, the discharge from that BMP must be treated by infiltration,
a vegetated buffer, filter strip, bioretention, vegetated swale or other
BMP that provides a thermal benefit to protect the high quality waters
of the Bushkill Creek and/or Fry's Run Study Area from thermal
impacts.
E. The WQv for a site as a result of the regulated activities must either be
treated with infiltration or two acceptable BMPs such as those listed in
§ 158-14O except for minor areas on the periphery of the site that
cannot reasonably be drained to an infiltration facility or other BMP.
F. Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed on fill unless the applicant
demonstrates that the fill is stable and otherwise meets the infiltration
BMP standards of this ordinance.
G. The applicant shall document the bedrock type(s) present on the site
from published sources. Any apparent boundaries between carbonate
and noncarbonate bedrock shall be verified through more detailed site
evaluations by a qualified geo-professional.
H. For each proposed regulated activity in the watershed, the applicant
shall conduct a preliminary site investigation on the portion of the site
that is judged to be the best candidate hydrogeologically for possible
infiltration, including gathering data from published sources, a field
inspection of the site, a minimum of one test pit and a minimum of two
percolation tests, as outlined in Appendix G.72 This investigation will
determine depth to bedrock, depth to the seasonal high water table, soil
permeability and location of special geologic features, if applicable. The
location(s) of special geologic features shall be verified by a qualified
geo-professional. Additionally, the Township Geotechnical Engineer or
its authorized representative shall be notified of the soil testing in order
to observe any such testing as determined to be necessary.
I. Sites where applicants intend to use infiltration BMPs must meet the
following criteria:
(1) Depth to bedrock below the invert of the BMP greater than or equal
to two feet.
(2) Depth to seasonal high water table below the invert of the BMP
greater than or equal to three feet; except for infiltration of
residential roof runoff where the seasonal high water table must be
below the invert of the BMP(If the depth to bedrock is between two
and three feet and the evidence of the seasonal high water table is
not found in the soil, no further testing to locate the depth to
seasonal high water table is required.)
(3) Soil permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15
percolation test in Appendix G) greater than or equal to 0.5 inch
per hour and less than or equal to 12 inches per hour.
72.Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-14 SMOKING § 158-14
153:289
(4) Setback distances or buffers as follows:
(a) One hundred feet from water supply wells.
(b) Fifteen feet downgradient or 100 feet upgradient from building
foundations, except for residential development where that
required setback is 15 feet downgradient or 40 feet upgradient
from building foundations.
(c) Fifty feet from septic system drainfields, except for residential
development where the required setback is 25 feet from septic
system drainfields and should be located downstream from the
septic system where practical.
(d) Fifty feet from a geologic contact with carbonate bedrock
unless a preliminary site investigation is done in the carbonate
bedrock to show the absence of special geologic features
within 50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
(e) One hundred feet from the property line unless documentation
is provided to show that all setbacks from existing or potential
future wells, foundations and drainfields on neighboring
properties will be met, except for one- and two-family
residential dwellings where the required setback is 40 feet
unless documentation is provided to show that all setbacks
from existing or potential future wells, foundations and
drainfields on neighboring properties will be met.
J. For entirely noncarbonate sites, the recharge volume (REv) shall be
infiltrated unless the applicant demonstrates that it is infeasible to
infiltrate the REv for reasons of seasonal high water table, permeability
rate, soil depth or setback distances; or except as provided in
§ 158-14U.
(1) The REv shall be calculated as follows:
REv = (0.25) * (I)/12
Where
REv = Recharge volume in acre-feet.
I = Impervious area in acres.
(2) The preliminary site investigation described in § 158-14H is
required and shall continue on different areas of the site until a
potentially suitable infiltration location is found or the entire site is
determined to be infeasible for infiltration. For infiltration areas
that appear to be feasible based on the preliminary site
investigation, the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G73 shall be completed.
73.Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-14 PALMER CODE § 158-14
153:290
(3) If an applicant proposes infiltration, the municipality may
determine infiltration to be infeasible if there are known existing
conditions or problems that may be worsened by the use of
infiltration.
(4) The site must meet the conditions listed in § 158-14I.
(5) If it is not feasible to infiltrate the full REv, the applicant shall
infiltrate that portion of the REv that is feasible based on the site
characteristics. If none of the REv can be infiltrated, REv shall be
considered as part of the WQv and shall be captured and treated as
described in § 158-14O.
(6) If REv is infiltrated, it may be subtracted from the WQv required to
be captured and treated.
K. Entirely carbonate areas.
(1) In entirely carbonate areas, where the applicant intends to use
infiltration BMPs, the preliminary site investigation described in
§ 158-14H shall be conducted. For infiltration areas that appear
feasible based on the preliminary site investigation, the applicant
shall conduct the additional site investigation and testing as
outlined in Appendix G. The soil depth, percolation rate and
proposed loading rate, each weighted as described in Section 307,
along with the buffer from special geologic features shall be
compared to the Recommendation Chart for Infiltration
Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix
D74 to determine if the site is recommended for infiltration. In
addition to the recommendation from Appendix D, the conditions
listed in § 158-14I are required for infiltration in carbonate areas.
(2) Applicants are encouraged to infiltrate the REv, as calculated in
§ 158-14J but are not required to use infiltration BMPs on a
carbonate site even if the site falls in the recommended range on
the chart in Appendix D. Any amount of volume infiltrated can be
subtracted from the WQv to be treated by noninfiltration BMPs. If
infiltration is not proposed, the full WQv shall be treated by two
acceptable BMPs, as specified in § 158-14O.
L. If a site has both carbonate and noncarbonate areas, the applicant shall
investigate the ability of the noncarbonate portion of the site to fully
meet this ordinance to meet the requirements for REv for the whole site
through infiltration. If that proves infeasible, infiltration in the
carbonate area as described in § 158-14K or two other noninfiltration
BMPs as described in § 158-140 must be used. No infiltration structure
in the noncarbonate area shall be located within 50 feet of a boundary
with carbonate bedrock, except when a preliminary site investigation
has been done showing the absence of special geologic features within
50 feet of the proposed infiltration area.
74.Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-14 SMOKING § 158-14
153:291
M. If infiltration BMPs are proposed in carbonate areas, the
postdevelopment two-year runoff volume leaving the site shall be 80%
or more of the predevelopment runoff volume for the carbonate portion
of the site to prevent infiltration of volumes far in excess of the
predevelopment infiltration volume.
N. Site areas proposed for infiltration shall be protected from disturbance
and compaction except as necessary for construction of infiltration
BMPs.
O. If infiltration of the entire WQv is not proposed, the remainder of the
WQv shall be treated by two acceptable BMPs in series for each
discharge location. Sheet flow draining across a pervious area can be
considered as one BMP. Sheet flow across impervious areas and
concentrated flow shall flow through two BMPs. If sheet flow from an
impervious area is to be drained across a pervious area as one BMP, the
length of the pervious area must be equal to or greater than the length
of impervious area. In no case, may the same BMP be employed
consecutively to meet this requirement. Acceptable BMPs are listed
below along with the recommended reference for design.

streambank destabilization, to satisfy state water quality requirements
by controlling the two-year postdevelopment runoff to a release rate of
30%.
U. The municipality may, after consultation with the DEP, approve
alternative methods for meeting the state water quality requirements
other than those in this section, provided that they meet the minimum
requirements of and do not conflict with state law, including, but not
limited to, the Clean Streams Law.75
A. Mapping of stormwater management districts. To implement the
provisions of the Bushkill Creek Watershed and Fry's Run Study Area
Stormwater Management Plans, the municipality is hereby divided into
stormwater management districts consistent with the Bushkill Creek
and Fry's Run Study Area Release Rate Maps presented in the plans.
The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on
an official map which is available for inspection at the municipal office.
A copy of the official map at a reduced scale is included in Appendix A76
for general reference.
B. Description of stormwater management districts. Four types of
stormwater management districts may be applicable to the
municipality, namely Conditional No Detention I Districts, Conditional
No Detention II Districts, Provisional No Detention Areas and Dual
Release Rate Districts, as described below.
(1) Conditional No Detention I Districts, Fry's Run Study Area. Within
these districts, the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities
(as defined in Article II) must be calculated to determine if
adequate capacity exists. For this determination, the developer
must calculate peak flows assuming that the site is developed as
proposed and that the remainder of the local watershed is in the
existing condition. The developer must also calculate peak flows
assuming that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this ordinance. The larger of the two peak flows
calculated will be used in determining if adequate capacity exists.
If adequate capacity exists to safely transport runoff from the site
to the main channel (as defined in Article II), these watershed areas
may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff without detention
facilities. The Township reserves the right to require one-hundredpercent
release rate controls irrespective of the adequacy of the
downstream capacity where the uncontrolled release could
adversely impact downstream properties. If the capacity
calculations show that the local runoff conveyance facilities lack
adequate capacity, the developer shall either use a one-hundred-
75.Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 691.1 et seq.
76.Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-14 SMOKING § 158-15
153:297
percent release rate control or provide increased capacity of
downstream elements to convey increased peak flows consistent
with § 158-16Q. Any capacity improvements must be designed to
convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the
improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in
§ 158-16D. By definition, a storm drainage problem area associated
with the local runoff conveyance facilities indicates that adequate
capacity does not exist.
(2) Conditional No Detention II Districts, Fry's Run Study Area. Within
these districts, the capacity of the local runoff conveyance facilities
must be calculated in the same manner as the Conditional No
Detention I Districts. In this case, however, adequate capacity must
be demonstrated from the site to the Delaware River or Lehigh
River, as applicable. After determining if adequate capacity exists,
the developer shall use either no detention, a one-hundred-percent
release rate or provide capacity improvements as one-hundredpercent-
release-rate controls irrespective of the adequacy of the
downstream capacity where the uncontrolled release could
adversely impact downstream properties.
(3) Provisional No Detention Districts, Bushkill Creek. These
watershed areas may discharge postdevelopment peak runoff
without detention facilities without adversely affecting the
watershed peak flow. In certain instances however, the local runoff
conveyance facilities, which transport runoff from the site to the
main channel, may not have adequate capacity to safely transport
increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a
proposed development. In these instances, the developer shall
either use a one-hundred-percent release control or provide
increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey
increased peak flows consistent with § 158-16Q. The Township
reserves the right to require one-hundred-percent release-rate
controls irrespective of the adequacy of the downstream capacity
where the uncontrolled release could adversely impact
downstream properties. In determining if adequate capacity exists
in the local watershed drainage network, the developer must
assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current
zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls
specified by this ordinance. Similarly, any capacity improvement
must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas
tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria
specified in § 158-16D.
(4) Dual Release Rate Districts, Bushkill Creek and Fry's Run Study
Area. Within this district, the two-year postdevelopment peak
runoff must be controlled to 30% of the predevelopment two-year
runoff peak. Further, the ten-year, twenty-five-year and onehundred-
year postdevelopment peak runoff must be controlled to
the stated percentage of the predevelopment peak. Release rates

§ 158-16. Stormwater management district implementation
provisions.
associated with the ten- through one-hundred-year events vary
from 50% to 100% depending upon location in the watershed.
A. Applicants shall provide a comparative pre- and postconstruction
stormwater management hydrograph analysis for each direction of
discharge and for the site overall to demonstrate compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance.
B. Any stormwater management controls required by this ordinance and
subject to a dual release rate criteria shall meet the applicable release
rate criteria for each of the two-, ten-, twenty-five- and one-hundredyear
return period runoff events consistent with the calculation
methodology specified in § 158-17.
C. The exact location of the stormwater management district boundaries
as they apply to a given development site shall be determined by
mapping the boundaries using the two-foot topographic contours
provided as part of the drainage plan. The district boundaries as
originally drawn coincide with topographic divides or, in certain
instances, are drawn from the intersection of the watercourse and a
physical feature, such as the confluence with another watercourse or a
potential flow obstruction (e.g. road, culvert, bridge, etc.). The physical
feature is the downstream limit of the subarea and the subarea,
boundary is drawn from that point up slope to each topographic divide
along the path perpendicular to the contour lines.
D. Any downstream capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this
ordinance shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for
accepting increased peak flow rates:
(1) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased runoff associated with a two-year return period event
within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the
channels from erosion.
(2) Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey
the increased twenty-five-year return period runoff without
creating any hazard to persons or property.
(3) Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must
pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in
accordance with DEP Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and,
at minimum, pass the increased twenty-five-year return period
runoff.
E. For a proposed development site located within one release rate
category subarea, the total runoff from the site shall meet the
applicable release rate criteria. For development sites with multiple
directions of runoff discharge, individual drainage directions may be
§ 158-15 SMOKING § 158-16
153:299
designed for up to a one-hundred-percent release rate so long as the
total runoff from the site is controlled to the applicable release rate.
F. For a proposed development site located within two or more release
category subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be
the predevelopment peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the
applicable release rate. The calculated peak discharges shall apply
regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by
subarea. An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from
multiple subareas recombine in proximity to the site. In this case, peak
discharge in any direction may be a one-hundred-percent release rate,
provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average
release rate.
G. For a proposed development site located partially within a release rate
category subarea and partially within a conditional no detention
subarea, a significant portion of the site area subject to the release rate
control may not be drained to the discharge point(s) located in the no
detention subarea except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver
procedure.
H. No portion of a site may be regraded to redirect runoff onto adjacent
property, except as part of a no harm or hardship waiver procedure:or
unless runoff peak flow rate and volume controls are proposed which
limit postdevelopment peak flow rate and volume discharges to
predevelopment levels.
I. Within a release rate category area, for a proposed development site
which has areas which drain to a closed depression(s), the design
release from the site will be the lesser of: a) the applicable release rate
flow assuming no closed depression(s); or b) the existing peak flow
actually leaving the site. In cases where b) would result in an
unreasonably small design release, the design discharge of less than or
equal to the release rate will be determined by the available
downstream conveyance capacity to the main channel calculated using
§ 158-16D and the minimum orifice criteria.
J. Off-site areas which drain through a proposed development site are not
subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff
rates. However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely
convey off-site flows through the development site using the capacity
criteria in § 158-16D and the detention criteria in § 158-17.
K. For development sites proposed to take place in phases, all detention
ponds shall be designed to meet the applicable release rate(s) applied
to all site areas tributary to the proposed pond discharge direction. All
site tributary areas will be assumed as developed, regardless of
whether all site tributary acres are proposed for development at that
time. An exception shall be sites with multiple detention ponds in series
where only the downstream pond must be designed to the stated
release rate.
§ 158-16 PALMER CODE § 158-16
153:300
L. Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity
differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact
area shall be subject to the release rate criteria. The impact area
includes any proposed cover or grading changes.
M. Development proposals which, through groundwater recharge or other
means, do not increase either the rate or volume of runoff discharged
from the site compared to predevelopment are not subject to the
release rate provisions of this ordinance.
N. In any stormwater management district, the Township reserves the
right to require a more stringent design release rate and/or volume
control for a development site or other amendments to a drainage plan
to address problems in the local runoff conveyance system downstream
of the site. Such problems include existing flooding problems,
inadequate conveyance capacity, poorly defined or poorly stabilized
downstream conveyance systems or other factors,
O. No harm water quantity option. For any proposed development site not
located in a conditional no detention district, the developer has the
option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention)
if the developer can prove that special circumstances exist for the
proposed development site and that no harm would be caused by
discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan.
"Special circumstances" are defined as any hydrologic or hydraulic
aspects of the development itself not specifically considered in the
development of the plan runoff control strategy. Proof of no harm would
have to be shown from the development site through the remainder of
the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the creek with
the Delaware River or Lehigh River, as applicable. Proof of no harm
must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in § 158-16D if
downstream capacity analysis is a part of the no harm justification.
(1) Attempts to prove no harm based upon downstream peak flow
versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following
provisions:
(a) The peak flow values to be used for downstream areas for the
design return period storms (two-, ten-, twenty-five- and onehundred-
year) shall be the values from the calibrated Penn
State Runoff Models for the Bushkill Creek or the Fry's Run
Study Area or as calculated by an applicant using an alternate
method acceptable to the municipality. These flow values
would be supplied to the developer by the Lehigh Valley
Planning Commission upon request.
(b) Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system
as documented by a developer may be used by the developer
only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to
the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified
capacity (i.e., if his site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped
§ 158-16 SMOKING § 158-16
153:301
acreage, he may use up to 10% of the documented downstream
available capacity).
(c) Developer-proposed runoff controls which would generate
increased peak flow rates at storm drainage problem areas
would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempts to
prove no harm, except in conjunction with proposed capacity
improvements for the problem areas consistent with
§ 158-16Q.
(2) Any no harm justifications shall be submitted by the developer as
part of the drainage plan submission per Article IV. Developers
submitting no harm justifications must still meet all of the water
quality requirements in § 158-14.
P. Regional detention alternatives. For certain areas within the study
area, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for
more than one development site than to provide an individual control
facility for each development site. The initiative and funding for any
regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective
developers. The design of any regional control basins must incorporate
reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed. The peak
outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis
using the hydrologic model of watershed consistent with protection of
the downstream watershed areas. "Hydrologic model" refers to the
calibrated version of the Penn State Runoff Model as developed for the
stormwater management plan.
Q. Capacity improvements. In certain instances, primarily within the
conditional no detention areas, local drainage conditions may dictate
more stringent levels of runoff control than those based upon protection
of the entire watershed. In these instances, if the developer could prove
that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relieve
the capacity deficiency in the local drainage network, then the capacity
improvements could be provided by the developer in lieu of runoff
controls on the development site. Peak flow calculations shall be done
assuming that the local watershed is in the existing condition and then
assuming that the local watershed is developed per current zoning and
using the specified runoff controls. Any capacity improvements would
be designed using the larger of the above peak flows and the capacity
criteria specified in § 158-16D. All new development in the entire
subarea(s) within which the proposed development site is located shall
be assumed to implement the developer's proposed discharge control, if
any. Capacity improvements may also be provided as necessary to
implement any regional detention alternatives or to implement a
modified no harm option which proposes specific capacity
improvements to provide that a less stringent discharge control would
not create any harm downstream.
R. Compatibility with NPDES requirements. Any proposed regulated
activity for which a permanent stormwater quality control detention

153:302
§ 158-17. Calculation methodology.
basin is required under the NPDES regulations shall use the more
stringent runoff control criteria between this ordinance and the NPDES
requirements.
S. In any stormwater management district, storm sewer piping, swales
and inlet systems shall be designed for a twenty-five-year return period
storm, or a one-hundred-year return period storm where the system is
designed to convey one-hundred-year storm flows to a detention facility.
Bridges and culverts along roadways shall be designed to convey the
one-hundred-year return period storm. Flows from off-site upstream
areas shall be determined in accordance with the procedure identified
in § 158-11E.
A. Stormwater runoff from all development sites shall be calculated using
either the Rational Method or the Soil-Cover-Complex Methodology.
The following requirements apply unless otherwise approved by the
municipality:
(1) For drainage areas of less than 100 acres, the Rational Method
shall be used.
(2) For drainage areas of 100 acres or more, the Soil Conservation
Service Method shall be used.
B. Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages.
(1) Infiltration BMP loading rate percentages in the Recommendation
Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management BMPs in Carbonate
Bedrock in Appendix D77 shall be calculated as follows:
(2) The area tributary to the infiltration BMP shall be weighted as
follows:
(a) All disturbed areas to be made impervious: weight at 100%.
(b) All disturbed areas to be made pervious: weight at 50%.
(c) All undisturbed pervious areas: weight at 0%.
(d) All existing impervious areas: weight at 100%.
C. Soil thickness.
(1) Soil thickness is to be measured from the bottom of any proposed
infiltration system. The effective soil thickness in the
77.Editor's Note: Appendix D is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-16 SMOKING § 158-17
153:303
Recommendation Chart for Infiltration Stormwater Management
BMPs in Carbonate Bedrock in Appendix D is the measured soil
thickness multiplied by the thickness factor based on soil
permeability (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code § 73.15
percolation test in Appendix G78), as follows:
Permeability Range*
(inches/hour) Thickness Factor
6.0 to 12.0 0.8
2.0 to 6.0 1.0
1.0 to 2.0 1.4
0.75 to 1.0 1.2
0.5 to 0.75 1.0
NOTE:
*If the permeability rate (as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code
§ 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G) falls on a break between
two thickness factors, the smaller thickness factor shall be used.
(2) Sites with soil permeability greater than 12.0 inches per hour or
less than 0.5 inch per hour, as measured by the adapted 25 PA Code
§ 73.15 percolation test in Appendix G, are not recommended for
infiltration.
D. The design of any detention basin intended to meet the requirements of
this ordinance shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph
through the proposed basin using the Storage Indication Method or
other methodology demonstrated to be more appropriate. For basins
designed using the Rational Method technique, the design hydrograph
for routing shall be the Universal Rational Hydrograph or as otherwise
reviewed by the municipality.
E. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall be routed using the Storage Indication Method.
F. BMPs designed to store or infiltrate runoff and discharge to surface
runoff or pipe flow shall provide storage volume for the full WQv below
the lowest outlet invert.
G. Wet detention ponds designed to have a permanent pool for the WQv
shall assume that the permanent pool volume below the primary outlet
is full at the beginning of design event routing for the purposes of
evaluating peak outflows. All wet detention ponds shall be subject to
review by the Township Geotechnical Engineer.
H. All stormwater detention facilities shall provide a minimum freeboard
of 1.0 foot above the maximum pool elevation associated with the two-
78.Editor's Note: Appendix G is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-17 PALMER CODE § 158-17
153:304
through twenty-five-year runoff events. A freeboard of 0.5 foot shall be
provided above the maximum pool elevation of the one-hundred-year
runoff event. The freeboard shall be measured from the maximum pool
elevation to the invert of the emergency spillway. The two- through onehundred-
year storm events shall be controlled by the primary outlet
structure. An emergency spillway for each basin shall be designed to
pass the one-hundred-year return frequency storm peak basin inflow
rate with a minimum freeboard of 0.5 foot measured to the top of
basin. The freeboard criteria shall be met considering any off-site areas
tributary to the basin as developed, as applicable. If this detention
facility is considered to be a dam as per DEP Chapter 105, the design
of the facility must be consistent with the Chapter 105 regulations, and
may be required to pass a storm greater than the one-hundred-year
event.
I. The minimum circular orifice diameter for controlling discharge rates
from detention facilities shall be three inches. Designs where a lesser
size orifice would be required to fully meet release rates shall be
acceptable, provided that as much of the site runoff as practical is
directed to the detention facilities. The minimum three-inch diameter
does not apply to the control of the WQv.
J. Runoff calculations using Soil-Cover-Complex Method.
(1) Runoff calculations using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method shall use
the Natural Resources Conservation Service Type II twenty-fourhour
rainfall distribution. The twenty-four-hour rainfall depths for
the various return periods to be used consistent with this ordinance
may be taken from NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2.1, 2004 or the
PennDOT Intensity - Duration Frequency Field Manual ("PDT-IDF")
(May 1986) for Region 4. The following values are taken from the
PDT-IDF Field Manual:
Return Period
(years)

distribution is included in Appendix C.79
79.Editor's Note: Appendix C is on file in the Township offices.
§ 158-17 SMOKING § 158-17
153:305
K. Runoff calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall
intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration and
return periods and NOAA Atlas 14, Volume 2.1, 2004 or the Intensity-
Duration-Frequency Curves as presented in Appendix C.
L. Runoff curve numbers (CN's) to be used in the Soil-Cover-Complex
Method shall be based upon the matrix presented in Appendix C.
M. Runoff coefficients for use in the Rational Method shall be based upon
the table presented in Appendix C.
N. All time of concentration calculations shall use a segmental approach
which may include one or all of the flow types below:
(1) Sheet flow (overland flow) calculations shall use either the NRCS
average velocity chart (Figure 3-1, Technical Release-55, 1975) or
the modified kinematic wave travel time equation (Equation 3-3,
NRCS TR-55, June 1986). If using the modified kinematic wave
travel time equation, the sheet flow length shall be limited to 50
feet for designs using the Rational Method and limited to 150 feet
for designs using the Soil-Cover-Complex Method.
(2) Shallow concentrated flow travel times shall be determined from
the watercourse slope, type of surface and the velocity from Figure
3-1 of TR-55, June 1986.
(3) Open channel flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated by the Manning Equation. Bankfull flows shall be used
for determining velocities. Manning 'n' values shall be based on the
table presented in Appendix C.
(4) Pipe flow travel times shall be determined from velocities
calculated using the Manning Equation assuming full flow and the
Manning 'n' values from Appendix C.
O. If using the Rational Method, all predevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
If using the Rational Method, all postdevelopment calculations for a
given discharge direction shall be based on a common time of
concentration considering both on-site and any off-site drainage areas.
P. The Manning Equation shall be used to calculate the capacity of
watercourses. Manning 'n' values used in the calculations shall be
consistent with the table presented in Appendix C or other appropriate
standard engineering 'n' value resources. Pipe capacities shall be
determined by methods acceptable to the municipality.

BMP Operations and Maintenance Plan Requirements
§ 158-29. Approval of plan required.
No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of the BMP operations and
maintenance plan which describes how the permanent (e.g.,
postconstruction) stormwater BMPs will be properly operated and
maintained.
§ 158-30. Responsibilities for operation and maintenance of BMPs.
A. The BMP operations and maintenance plan for the project site shall
establish responsibilities for the continuing operation and maintenance
of all permanent stormwater BMPs, as follows:
(1) If a plan includes structures or lots which are to be separately
owned and in which streets, sewers and other public improvements
are to be dedicated to the municipality, stormwater BMPs may also
be dedicated to and maintained by the municipality;
(2) If a plan includes operations and maintenance by a single
ownership or if sewers and other public improvements are to be
privately owned and maintained, then the operation and
maintenance of stormwater BMPs shall be the responsibility of the
owner or private management entity.
B. The municipality shall make the final determination on the continuing
operations and maintenance responsibilities. The municipality reserves
the right to accept or reject the operations and maintenance
responsibility for any or all of the stormwater BMPs.
C. The maintenance responsibilities for permanent stormwater BMPs shall
be determined based upon the type of ownership of the property which
is controlled by the BMPs.
(1) In all cases where the permanent stormwater BMPs are designed to
manage runoff from property in a single entity ownership, as
defined below, the maintenance responsibility for the stormwater
BMPs shall be with the single entity owner. The single entity owner
shall enter into an agreement with the Township which specifies
that the owner will properly maintain the facilities consistent with
accepted practice as determined by the Township Engineer. The
agreement shall provide for regular inspections by the Township,
shall contain such provisions as are necessary to ensure timely
correction of any maintenance deficiencies by the single entity
owner, and shall be recorded in the Miscellaneous Docket in the
Office of the Recorder of Deeds of Northampton County,
Pennsylvania. For the purposes of this ordinance, the term "single
entity" shall be defined as an individual, association, public or

an approved BMP operations and maintenance plan unless an exception is
granted in writing by the municipality.
§ 158-32. Agreement for privately owned BMPs.
§ 158-33. Easements.
Stormwater management easements shall be provided by the property
owner if necessary for access for inspections and maintenance or for
preservation of stormwater conveyance, infiltration, detention areas and
private corporation, partnership, firm, trust, estate or any other
legal entity empowered to own real estate.
(2) In cases where the property to be encumbered by the permanent
stormwater BMP is in multiple ownership (many individual owners
of various portions of the property), the developer shall dedicate
the permanent stormwater BMPs to the Township for maintenance
unless, in the opinion of the Board of Supervisors, another
ownership and maintenance alternative will better serve the public
interest. The developer shall pay a fee to the Township
corresponding to the present worth of maintenance of the facilities
for a twenty-five-year period. The estimated annual maintenance
cost for the facilities shall be based on a fee schedule provided by
the Township Engineer and adopted by the Township Board of
Supervisors. The fee schedule must be reasonable.
(3) In certain multiple ownership situations, the public may benefit
should the Township require that maintenance responsibilities be
borne by the individual or other legal entity. In these instances, the
Township and the responsible individual or entity shall, at the
Township's option, enter into a formal agreement regarding such
maintenance obligation.
A. The property owner shall sign an operations and maintenance
agreement with the municipality covering all stormwater BMPs that are
to be privately owned. The agreement shall include the terms of the
format agreement referenced in Appendix E81 of this ordinance.
B. Other items may be included in the agreement where determined by the
municipality to be reasonable or necessary to guarantee the
satisfactory operation and maintenance of all permanent stormwater
BMPs. The agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the
municipality.

(2) Operations and maintenance agreements under § 158-32.
(3) Easements under § 158-33.
B. The municipality may suspend or revoke any approvals granted for the
project site upon discovery of the failure of the owner to comply with
this section.
A. If stormwater BMPs are accepted by the municipality for dedication,
the municipality may require persons installing stormwater BMPs to
pay a specified amount to the Municipal Stormwater BMP Operation
and Maintenance Fund to help defray costs of operations and
maintenance activities. The amount may be determined as follows:
(1) If the BMP is to be owned and maintained by the municipality, the
amount shall cover the estimated costs for operation and
maintenance in perpetuity, as determined by the municipality.
(2) The amount shall then be converted to present worth of the annual
series values.
B. If a BMP is proposed that also serves as a recreation facility (e.g., ball
field, lake), the municipality may adjust the amount due accordingly.

ARTICLE III
Overview of General Procedures
§ 165-25. Purpose.
This Article summarizes the general procedures for the submission and
review of proposed subdivisions and land developments. This Article is only
a general explanation and is not binding on the Township or an applicant.
See the actual provisions of the other Articles of this ordinance. Two
flowcharts are included at the end of this Article107 to show the general
process for major and minor subdivisions.
§ 165-26. General procedure for subdivisions and land
developments.
A. Review and approval stages.
(1) Three types of plan submission are included in the procedure for
filing and approval of subdivision and land development plans:
sketch, preliminary and final.
(2) These plans enable the Planning Commission and the Board of
Supervisors to have an adequate opportunity to review the
submission and to ensure that their formal recommendations are
reflected in the final plan which is recorded in accordance with this
Article.
(3) The table below outlines the stages for the different types of
proposed subdivision or land development.108 See definitions of
each term in Article II.
B. Sketch plan.
(1) While sketch plans are not required for major and minor
subdivisions or land developments, it is strongly recommended that
they be filed to allow the applicant to consult early and informally
with the Planning Commission before preparing a preliminary plan.
An early review will help a developer avoid the need to make major
changes to the plan after the engineering is completed and thereby
avoid unnecessary expenses and delays.
(2) Comments made and not made by Township officials on the sketch
plan are only recommendations and are not binding upon the
Township or the applicant.
C. Preliminary plan. Except where a preliminary plan is not required, the
initial plan filed to the Commission for formal review of a major
subdivision or land development shall be considered the official
107. Editor's Note: The flowcharts regarding generalized processes for major and minor
subdivisions or land developments are included at the end of this chapter.

§ 165-25 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-26
160:357
§ 165-27. General plan submission procedures.
preliminary plan. The preliminary plan is intended to provide for
Township approval of the major facets of the development and to ensure
that the engineering of the project would be workable.
D. Final plan. After approval of the preliminary plan of a major subdivision
or land development, the applicant files a final plan. The final plan
allows the Township to ensure that technical matters are resolved
before the plan is recorded or the buildings can be built.
E. Guaranty of improvements installation. Where improvements are
required by this ordinance and the improvements are not completed in
advance, the applicant is required to enter into a development
agreement, including the posting of financial security to make sure that
the improvements are completed. See Article VIII.
F. Recording of final plan. In most cases, the applicant is required to have
the approved subdivision final plan recorded in the office of the County
Recorder of Deeds within 90 days after final approval. See Article IX.
No lots may be sold or buildings constructed until the plan is approved
and recorded.
A. Submission. Plans should be hand-delivered to a Township staffperson
who is responsible for administering this ordinance. The list of
requirements in this ordinance is in the form of a checklist to make it
easier for the Township and the applicant to determine whether a
submittal is complete.
B. Completeness. The Planning Commission may refuse to accept a
submittal if it is significantly incomplete. In that case, the plans will
have to be resubmitted to the Township.
C. Attendance. The applicant or his/her representative should endeavor to
attend the Commission meeting to discuss the filed plans.
D. Action by the Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The Planning
Commission recommends approval or disapproval to the Board of
Supervisors. The Board of Supervisors then approves or disapproves
the plan within the time limits established by the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code.109

ARTICLE IV
Sketch Plan
§ 165-28. Preplan consultation.
Prior to submission of a sketch plan, applicants for larger developments are
encouraged to informally discuss their intent with the Zoning Officer, Plans
Administrator, Planning Commission and/or the Board of Supervisors.
§ 165-29. Plan submission and drawing requirements.
A. Prior to the submission of a preliminary plan, developers are very
strongly encouraged to submit a sketch plan in person at a regular or
special meeting of the Planning Commission of Palmer Township. A
sketch plan review often allows an applicant to save substantial time
and engineering costs, because many concerns about layout and issues
concerning Township ordinances can be resolved prior to detailed
engineering. This can often reduce the need for future redesign at a
more detailed stage, thereby saving the applicant significant money and
time.
B. Review. Sketch plans shall be subject to review by the Township staff,
the Township Engineer, the Planning Commission and the Board of
Supervisors. No official action shall be required by the Township on a
sketch plan. The Township shall not be bound by comments made or not
made as part of the sketch plan review.
C. Timing of submittal. When submitted, sketch plans and the required
application should be, but are not required to be, submitted to the Plans
Administrator a minimum of 21 days prior to the Planning Commission
meeting at which the applicant desires review. Any plans submitted
after such time limit may be placed at the end of the agenda and may be
tabled until the next meeting if time does not permit adequate review.
D. Prints. When submitted, 15 print copies of the sketch plan shall be
submitted in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
E. Drawing requirements. The sketch plan shall be drafted to scale and
should generally include the following:
(1) Property boundaries (may be obtained from County Tax Map or
similar sources).
(2) General topographic contours [from maps available from the
Township staff or from a United States Geological Survey map
(USGS)] and approximate areas of over 15% slope (such as from
the Northampton County Soil Survey or USGS map).
(3) Proposed lot and street layout with approximate areas of lots and
existing and proposed widths of street rights-of-way and street
cartways.
§ 165-28 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-29

§ 165-30. Sketch plan review procedures.
(4) Site data, including:
(a) Approximate acres of entire tract.
(b) Number of lots and types of dwelling units (if residential).
(c) Zoning district and major applicable requirements (such as
minimum lot area).
(5) North arrow; graphic and written scale. Plans should be drawn to a
scale of one inch equals 100 feet or larger.
(6) Approximate proposed building locations (if known) and proposed
types of uses.
(7) Preliminary name of project (may be owner's name).
(8) A location map showing the general location of the project in
relation to adjacent lots, streets and waterways (such as from the
Township Zoning Map110 or USGS map, preferably at a scale no
smaller than one inch equals 2,000 feet).
(9) Approximate location of any area within the one-hundred-year
floodplain (from Federal Insurance Administration map).
(10) General provisions for stormwater management (such as
approximate location of any detention basin).
(11) If required by Article X, whether the applicant proposes to dedicate
common open space or fees in lieu of land, and the proposed
locations of any such open space.
(12) Description of general methods of providing water and sewer
service, with sufficient information to show the general feasibility
of providing any central water and central sewage service (such as
proximity of existing lines).
(13) Land uses of adjacent lots and any zoning district boundaries in the
area.
(14)Name and address of person responsible for the preparation of the
plans and the date of completion of the plans and any subsequent
revision dates.
(15) Approximate locations of any potential wetlands (which may be
based upon hydric soils from the County Soil Survey).
(16) Approximate locations of any tree with a trunk diameter of over 18
inches measured 4.5 feet above the surrounding average ground
level.
110. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Township offices.

160:360
A. Reviews. The Township should distribute copies of the sketch plan to
the Township Engineer, the relevant Township staffperson(s), the
Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors for any advisory
reviews they may wish to offer.
(1) If the Township staff determines that there are mature trees on the
site, a copy should be provided to the Shade Tree Commission.
(2) Recreation Commission. A copy of the plan should be provided to
the Township Recreation Commission for a review of whether open
space or recreation fees should be required. Recreation
Commission review should especially be sought if the sketch plan
would involve land along a creek or river or more than five dwelling
units or be adjacent to an existing Township park.
(3) JPC. One copy of the sketch plan should but is not required to be
submitted to the Joint Planning Commission for any informal
review.
B. A summary of the comments of such Boards and persons should be
provided to the applicant or his/her representative if such person is not
in attendance.

(3) Adjacent municipalities. If any portion of a major subdivision or
land development is proposed within 200 feet of the boundary of
another municipality or would clearly have a regional impact upon
another municipality as determined by the Township staff, then the
staff should provide a copy of the layout plan to that municipality
for an advisory review.
(4) Zoning variances.
(a) A preliminary or final plan application under the Subdivision

deposited and used after submittal.
(b) Based upon such review, the Planning Commission shall have
the authority to determine whether the submission is
significantly incomplete. The Commission may accept
numerous submittals in one motion or in separate motions. If
the submittal is determined by the Commission to be
significantly incomplete, the submittal shall be considered to
have not been officially accepted by the Township. In such
case, the filing and review fees shall be returned to the
applicant, minus the cost of Township and consultant reviews
up to that point in time. If the Commission does not make a
motion on the matter, then the submittal shall be considered to
be accepted.
(c) Any determination that a plan is significantly incomplete shall

in which the escrow funds are held, and all escrow funds from
sales of lots shall be paid directly to such fund, and a monthly
statement shall be furnished to the Township.
B. Establishing the improvements security amount. [Amended
5-27-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-379]
(1) Subsequent to final plan approval of any land development or
subdivision plan by the Board of Supervisors, the developer shall
prepare an improvements security estimate. If conditional final
plan approval has not been granted by the Board of Supervisors, or
all conditions of final plan approval (if any) have not been fulfilled
prior to the developer's submission of the improvements security
estimate, the Township reserves the right to require a revision of
the estimate to reflect any plan changes. The improvements
security estimate shall be established using pricing consistent with
prevailing wage rates.
(2) Prior to submitting an improvements security estimate, the
developer's project engineer shall consult with the Township
Engineer's office to confirm which plan project improvements are
required to be secured. The developer's engineer shall then submit
an improvements security estimate to the Township for review by
the Township Engineer. Where appropriate, a contingency shall be
included in the construction cost as part of the improvements
security estimate to address unforeseen items (sinkhole
remediation, utility conflicts, etc.).
(3) The amount of financial security to be posted for the completion of
the required improvements shall be equal to 110% of the cost of
completion, estimated as of 90 days following the date scheduled
for completion by the developer in the official development
schedule and within the process for increases to cover inflation as
permitted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.125
(4) The improvements security estimate submitted on behalf of the
developer must be certified by a professional engineer registered
in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
(5) If the Township Engineer does not concur with the submitted
improvements security estimate, those items of disagreement will
be indicated on an annotated copy of the estimate, or on a revised
estimate form, which will be returned to the developer's engineer
for further consideration and resubmission, or for such further
action as acknowledged by the Municipalities Planning Code.126
(6) The final improvements security estimate ultimately acceptable to
the Township Engineer will then be transferred to standard
125. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
126. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 165-47 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-47
160:389
improvements security release certification forms by the Township
Engineer's office and returned to the developer with a standard
cover letter requesting that the developer thoroughly review the
improvements security release certification forms before certifying
their accuracy. The developer shall send the final forms directly to
the Township, as its formal submission, with a copy to the Township
Engineer.
(7) The developer shall be solely responsible for the installation,
construction, erection and/or completion of project improvements.
The developer shall not be relieved of its obligation to provide for
the same, even if the improvement security estimate provided by
the Township Engineer's office fails to include necessary items of
the project or is undervalued. In such event, the Township may
require the developer to post additional security in the required
form and amount to address the deficiency as a condition
precedent to proceeding with the development.
(8) If all or portions of the required improvements are satisfactorily
completed by the developer prior to conditional final plan approval,
the provision of financial security to cover the costs of constructing
said improvements will not be required. However, maintenance
security for those improvements shall still be required once the
Township has accepted all required public improvements.
(9) If the party posting the financial security requires more than one
year from the date of posting the financial security to complete the
required improvements, the amount of financial security may be
increased by a maximum of an additional 10% for each one-year
period beyond the first anniversary date from the posting of the
financial security or to an amount not exceeding 110% of the cost of
completing the required improvements as reestablished on or
about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the
above procedure.
(10) Multiyear or multistage development. In the case where
development is projected over a period of years, the Township
Supervisors may authorize submission of final plans by phases/
stages of development subject to such requirements or
improvements guaranties concerning future improvements as they
find necessary for the proper functioning of each phase and for the
eventual development as a whole.
C. Multiyear or multistage development. In the case where development is
projected over a period of years, the Township Supervisors may
authorize submission of final plans by phases/stages of development
subject to such requirements or improvement guaranties concerning
future improvements as it finds necessary for the proper functioning of
each phase and for the eventual development as a whole.
§ 165-47 PALMER CODE § 165-48
160:390
§ 165-48. Approval of improvements. [Amended 5-27-2008 by Ord.
No. 2008-379]
A. In general. As the work of installing the required improvements
proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the
Township Supervisors to release or authorize the release of, from time
to time, portions of the financial security necessary for payment to the
contractor(s) performing the work.
B. Notice of completion. When the developer has completed an
improvement, the developer shall notify the Township and request
release of related financial security, in writing, to the Township
Supervisors by certified or registered mail. The developer shall send a
copy of the letter to the Township Engineer at the same time.
C. Releasing of improvements security.
(1) Prior to the formal submission of an improvements security release
request to the Township, the developer or its representative shall
first contact the Township Engineer's office and meet at the project
site for an informal preliminary consultation with the Township
Engineer's field representative. The purpose of the consultation is
for the developer and the Township Engineer's field representative
to review the extent of completion of each item of work listed on
the improvements security release certifications forms for the
project. Note that this preliminary consultation shall not be
considered as a submission for improvements security release
process.
(2) The Township Engineer shall then complete a suggested draft of
the improvements security release certification forms (retaining
10% of the total monies to be released, but not less than 15% of the
total costs of improvements offered for dedication to the Township)
and forward the draft forms  which reflect the suggested
security release amount established during the preliminary
consultation  to the developer for its consideration. To begin the
formal request for an improvements security release, the developer
shall review and, if acceptable, sign and submit the improvements
security release certification forms directly to the Township with a
copy to the Township Engineer.
(3) The formal improvements security release submission to the
Township by the developer is to be accompanied by the completed,
reviewed and signed improvements security release certification
forms, which shall be subject to review and approval by the
Township upon review and recommendation by the Township
Engineer.
(4) If an improvements security release that is submitted to the
Township and subsequently forwarded to the Township Engineer is,
in the opinion of the Township Engineer, inconsistent with the
extent of the work completed, improvements security release
§ 165-48 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-48
160:391
certifications forms will be annotated by the Township Engineer
to reflect the extent of improvements believed to have been
constructed and the corresponding security amount recommended
for release by the Township.
(5) The maintenance security, as required by the improvements
agreement, shall be equal to 15% of the total cost of improvements
offered for dedication to the Township. Prior to posting of the
maintenance security by the developer, the Township shall retain
no less than an amount equal to the maintenance security. Upon
posting the maintenance security, the developer may request the
release of all remaining improvements security, as applicable.
D. Engineer's report.
(1) Within 30 days of the receipt of such request, the Township
Engineer shall submit a written report certifying which
improvements have been completed in accordance with the
approved plan to the Township Supervisors.
(2) This report shall be based on the inspections made according to the
approved inspection schedule included in the development
agreement and shall recommend approval or rejection of the
improvements, either in whole or in part.
E. Security; decision by Township Supervisors.
(1) At its first regularly scheduled meeting after receiving the
Engineer's report (but not later than 45 days after receipt of the
request), the Township Supervisors shall review the Township
Engineer's report and shall render a decision on the release
request, upon consideration of the recommendation of the
Township Engineer, based upon the fair value of the improvements
completed.
(2) The Township Supervisors shall be deemed to have approved the
release of funds as requested if the Township Supervisors fail to act
within 45 days of receipt of the developer's request.
(3) The Township Supervisors shall notify the developer, in writing, by
certified or registered mail, of the decision.
F. Completion of unapproved improvements. The developer shall proceed
to complete any improvements not approved by the Township
Supervisors and, upon completion, request approval in conformance
with the procedures specified in this section.
G. Updating the improvements security.
(1) On projects for which the improvements have not been completed
by the expiration of the improvements agreement, concurrent with
any requests to extend the improvements agreement, the
developer's engineer shall recommend suitable adjustments to the
§ 165-48 PALMER CODE § 165-48
160:392
improvements security estimate to reflect increases in construction
costs, where appropriate, and submit the revised security amount
to the Township for review. The Township Engineer shall review the
proposed adjustments and make recommendations to the Township
on the adequacy of said adjustments. If for any reason the revised
amount (or remaining improvements security) is determined to
be inadequate to secure the incomplete portion of the project,
an update to the improvements security estimate and additional
security may be required.
(2) If a developer's improvements security is considered to be
inadequate, the Township Engineer shall annotate the
improvements security release certification forms with the
recommended adjustments based on the then-current construction
prices, thereby maintaining the improvements security estimate
current for the remaining unconstructed improvements.
(3) The Township Engineer shall forward the annotated improvements
security release certification forms, which reflect the
recommended adjustments, to the Township for its consideration.
Additionally, a copy will be sent to the developer for its
consideration.
(4) The Township shall reserve the right to not enter into any extension
of the land development improvements agreement or subdivision
improvements agreement unless the improvements security is
reevaluated in accord with the improvements security procedures
adopted by the Township.
H. Final release.
(1) When the developer has completed all of the necessary and
appropriate improvements, the developer shall request final
release in conformance with this section. See time limitations and
procedures in § 510 of the Municipalities Planning Code.
(2) Such final release shall include all moneys retained under
Subsection C above.
I. Appeal. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the
developer's right to contest or question, by legal proceedings or
otherwise, any determination of the Township Supervisors or the
Township Engineer.
J. Certificates of occupancy and completion of improvements.
(1) A temporary or final certificate of occupancy shall not be issued
and a structure shall not be occupied unless:
(a) The structure is safe and substantially completed in conformity
to all applicable ordinances, laws and plans;
§ 165-48 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-48
160:393
§ 165-49. Remedies to effect completion of improvements.
§ 165-50. Maintenance agreement.
(b) The structure is served by electricity and telephone service
and any required water, fire hydrants and sewage service; and
(c) The structure has access to a clearly permanently passable
street with at least a complete paving binder course and any
required curbing installed.
(2) No final certificate of occupancy shall be issued until the structure
is completed as approved with service by all required utilities and
with approved access onto a street. Any new or improved street
shall be completed to required standards, if applicable.
A. Enforcement of security.
(1) In the event that any improvements which may be required have
not been installed as provided in this ordinance or in accord with
the approved final plan or in the event of the bankruptcy of the
owner or developer, the Board of Supervisors is hereby granted the
power to elect to enforce any security posted under this ordinance
by appropriate legal and equitable remedies. This may include
taking all actions necessary to obtain moneys under said bond,
including but not limited to seizure of undeveloped lots, confession
of judgment, suit on the bond, seizure of escrow funds, revocation
of building permits and prosecution under this ordinance.
(2) Rate of construction. Failure of a developer to construct streets and
other public improvements reasonably at the same time or prior to
the construction of the buildings served by those streets or public
improvements, and at the same rate in time at which buildings are
completed, shall be a violation of this ordinance and a cause for
default.
B. Completion by Township. If the proceeds of such bond or other security
are insufficient to pay the cost of installing or making repairs or
corrections to all the improvements covered by said security, the Board
of Supervisors may, at its option, install part of such improvements in all
or part of the subdivision or land development and may institute
appropriate legal or equitable action to recover the moneys necessary
to complete the remainder of the improvements.
C. Proceeds for installation of improvements. The proceeds from use of the
security and/or from any legal or equitable action brought against the
developer shall be used solely for the installation of the improvements
covered by such security.
A. Maintenance agreement required.
§ 165-48 PALMER CODE § 165-50
160:394
§ 165-51. Maintenance guaranty.
(1) All applicants proposing any subdivision or land development
which provides for the dedication of improvements required by this
ordinance shall be required to enter into a legally binding
maintenance agreement with the Township prior to acceptance of
dedication of the improvements by the Township.
(2) The dedication of any significant improvement, as determined by
the Township Supervisors, shall not be accepted by the Township
prior to the execution of a maintenance agreement and the delivery
of the maintenance guaranty.
B. Terms of maintenance agreement. The maintenance agreement shall be
acceptable in legal form to the Township Solicitor and in content to the
Township Supervisors and shall include all of the following:
(1) That the applicant shall make any repair or reconstruction of any
improvement stipulated in the maintenance agreement which is
specified by the Township Supervisors if needed because of faulty
construction, workmanship or materials, prior to acceptance of
such improvement by the Township.
(2) That the applicant shall maintain at his/her own cost all
improvements stipulated in the maintenance agreement, up to a
maximum period of 18 months from the date of acceptance or
dedication by the Township, except for any special purpose escrow
or maintenance agreements required by the Township.
(3) That the applicant shall post financial security to secure structural
integrity of said improvements as well as the functioning of said
improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as
depicted on the final plan, for a maximum term of 18 months from
the date of acceptance of dedication.
(4) That the developer shall plow snow and maintain all streets until
such time as the Township may accept such streets.
C. Public utilities and authorities. If water mains or sanitary sewer lines,
or both, and related apparatus or facilities are to be installed under the
jurisdiction and under the rules and regulations of a public utility or
municipal authority, financial security to assure proper completion and
maintenance thereof shall be posted in accordance with the regulations
of the controlling public utility or municipal authority. This amount of
financial security shall not also be required by the Township if it is
required by such utility or authority.
A. Security. The maintenance guaranty shall be secured by the credit of
any of the following:
(1) An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit of a federal- or
state-chartered lending institution.
§ 165-50 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-51
160:395
(2) A restrictive or escrow account in a federal- or state-chartered
lending institution.
(3) Such other financial security approved by the Township
Supervisors (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).
B. Terms. Such maintenance guaranty shall be in the form approved by the
Township Solicitor and Township Supervisors, payable to the Township,
to guarantee the maintenance and repair of the streets and other public
improvements in the subdivision or land development for 18 months
from the date of acceptance thereof by the Township.
C. Amount. The amount of the maintenance guaranty shall be determined
by the applicant's engineer, conditioned upon acceptance by Township
Supervisors, but shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation
of such improvements.
D. Release. After a maximum of 18 months from the date of acceptance of
said improvements, the Township shall release the maintenance
guaranty to the developer (or party that posted the guaranty) if all
improvements are in satisfactory condition, as determined by the
Township.

The applicant shall provide to the Township one Mylar copy and four
paper clear and legible copies of the recorded final plan (also known as
the "record plan"), in addition to providing a Mylar copy to the county
(or whatever form is required by the county). The Township copies shall
be made after recording and shall be exact copies of those portions of
the approved final plan that the Township requires to be recorded. Such
recorded final plan, at a minimum, shall include all of the following:
A. Deadline.
(1) The applicant is responsible to ensure that the final plan as
approved by the Township Supervisors is recorded in the office of
the Recorder of Deeds of the county within 90 days of such final
approval. In such case, the applicant shall mail or deliver a receipt
of the recording to the Township offices.
(2) If the final plan approval included official conditions that must be
met prior to recording, then the plan shall be recorded within 90
days following the compliance with such conditions, up to a
maximum total of one year following the final plan approval.
(3) In any case, specific extensions of these time periods may be
granted in writing by the Township Supervisors.
B. At its option, the Township may voluntarily agree in advance to record a
final plan, in which case the applicant shall compensate the Township
for such costs.
C. The final plan shall not be recorded unless the applicant proves that
they have met all required conditions that the Township staff and/or
Township Engineer determine would impact the recorded final plan. No
construction of buildings or sale of lots shall occur until after a plan is
recorded. All subdivisions shall be recorded. In addition, all land
developments shall be recorded if the plan would involve the dedication
of land to the Township or PennDOT or if the Board of Supervisors
require the plan to be recorded.
D. The Board of Supervisors may determine that Township approval has
expired regarding a subdivision plan that was not recorded within the
time limits of this section.
A. Street rights-of-way.

any streets and common open space on the record plan shall be
considered to be part of that Official Map.127
B. Private improvements. Every street, park or other improvement shown
on a subdivision or land development plan that is recorded, as provided
herein, shall be deemed to be a private street, open space or
improvement until such time as it may be offered and officially accepted
for dedication to the Township or is duly condemned.
C. Dedication of improvements. The record plan shall state by formal
notation whether the streets, any common open space and other
proposed improvements are proposed to be offered or not offered for
dedication to the Township.
A. Submission. Simultaneously with the conveyance of the respective
subdivision improvements, the subdivider shall provide one Mylar
reproducible and three clear light background paper prints of the
record final plan. Prior to submitting these plans, one clear light
background paper print shall be submitted to the Township Engineer
for review.
B. Information. The location of improvements and other data shall
conform to the final plan requirements of this ordinance. All
construction changes shall be noted by drawing a line through the

2002-313; 5-27-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-378]
In addition to standards set forth in this article, the Township Standard
Construction Documents apply to any required improvement in the
Township, regardless of whether the improvement is or is not publicly
dedicated. These standards shall be provided to the developer, contractor
or party constructing said improvement(s) prior to commencement of
construction. These standards are made a part hereto of this ordinance as
Appendix F128 and shall be modified from time to time by resolution passed
by the Palmer Township Board of Supervisors.
§ 165-58. Overall requirements.
A. Evaluating plans. The design standards and improvements required in
this Article shall be the minimum requirements applied by the Planning
Commission and the Board of Supervisors in evaluating plans for any
proposed subdivision or land development.
B. Additional improvements. Additional or higher-type improvements may
be required in specific cases where, in the determination of the Board
of Supervisors, they are clearly necessary to protect the public health
and safety.
C. Modifications, waivers and exceptions. See § 165-7 of this ordinance.
A. Land shall be suited to the purpose for which it is to be subdivided or
developed.
B. Hazardous conditions. Land subject to hazardous conditions (such as
open quarries, unconsolidated fill, floods, excessive erosion or unsafe
water supply) shall not be subdivided until the hazards have been
eliminated or overcome by adequate safeguards provided by the
developer and approved by the Board of Supervisors. See the floodplain
requirements of the Township Zoning Ordinance.
C. Comprehensive Plan. The subdivision or land development should
generally be designed in consideration of any applicable provisions of
the Township Comprehensive Plan.
D. Zoning. All aspects of a proposed subdivision or land development shall
conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance and floodplain regulations
and all other Township ordinances and specifications.

§ 165-59. Streets.
(1) Zoning variances. See Sections §§ 165-32C, 165-36D and 165-40D
of this ordinance.
E. Nearby development. A subdivision or land development and its street
pattern shall be coordinated with existing or approved nearby
developments or neighborhoods so that the area as a whole may be
developed harmoniously and to prevent serious conflicts between
neighboring development.
F. Safety. No subdivision or land development shall occur in such a way
that would significantly threaten the public health and safety, including
hazards of toxic substances, groundwater pollution, traffic hazards and
explosive and fire hazards.
A. Access to proposed subdivisions and land developments. All proposed
subdivisions and land developments shall have adequate and safe
access to the public street system.
B. Streets and topography. Proposed streets shall be adjusted to the
contour of the land so as to produce usable lots and streets of
reasonable gradient. See the steep slope regulations in Article XVI of
the Zoning Ordinance.
C. Street continuations.
(1) Where deemed appropriate by the Board of Supervisors, stub
streets shall be extended to the boundary of the tract being
subdivided or developed so as to eventually provide for proper
circulation of traffic within the Township and abutting
municipalities. Also, where a stub street exists on an abutting lot,
that stub street shall be extended into the proposed development
unless the Board of Supervisors determines that such extension
would not serve a valid traffic purpose.
(2) Where a subdivision or land development abuts or contains an
existing street of inadequate right-of-way width, additional right-ofway
width and widening of the cartway shall be required in
conformance with Table 10.1, Design Standards for Streets.129
D. Intersections.
(1) The center lines of streets shall intersect at right angles unless
existing conditions dictate otherwise. In such case, the intersection
shall be as nearly at right angles as possible but not less than 75º at
intersections.
(2) Minimum offset distance.
129. Editor's Note: See Subsection F(1) below.
§ 165-58 PALMER CODE § 165-59
160:402
(a) Intersections of more than two streets at one point shall be
avoided. Where streets intersect other streets, the intersecting
street shall be aligned with any street intersecting on the other
side or be offset by the minimum distance stated in this
subsection. This minimum offset and the minimum distance
between center lines of parallel or approximately parallel
streets intersecting a cross street from opposite directions
shall be:
[1] One hundred fifty feet along a local street.
[2] Four hundred feet along a collector street.
[3] One thousand feet along a minor arterial street. (See
Figures below.)
(b) The distances of this subsection shall be measured between
the intersections of the center lines of the legal rights-of-ways
of the streets.
(3) At street intersections, the property line shall be rounded by arcs
with the radii listed below. For streets other than local streets, the
Township may require a larger radius. (See chart below and above
figures.)

E. Minor arterial street frontage. Where a subdivision or land
development abuts or contains an existing or proposed minor arterial
street, as the Board of Supervisors determines is reasonable, feasible
and necessary to avoid increased traffic congestion and further traffic
safety, based upon recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Township Engineer, any comments from PennDOT and any professional
§ 165-59 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-59
160:403
traffic studies that have been submitted, the Board of Supervisors shall
require one or more of the following methods of layout and site design:
(1) The use of a marginal access or frontage streets or access only onto
side or interior streets to collect traffic from numerous driveways
and direct it to a select few number of entrances to the minor
arterial street.
(2) The minimization of the number and length of driveway cuts or
street intersections onto an arterial or collector street, which may
include requiring the use of shared driveways between adjacent
uses or lots.
(3) The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand turns onto
or off of the minor arterial street.
(4) The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings entering
directly onto a minor arterial street. If there is no alternative to
this, each driveway entering onto a minor arterial street shall have
adequate turnaround space for vehicles provided within the lot so
that vehicles do not back onto the street.
(5) See also § 190-198 of the Township Zoning Ordinance, Access onto
arterial and collector streets.
F. Street design standards.
(1) Minimum street design standards shall be as shown in Table 10.1,

KEY:
NA = Not applicable.
(2) Whenever street lines are deflected in excess of one degree,
connection shall be made by horizontal curves.
(3) Vertical curves shall be used at changes of grade exceeding 1%.
The minimum length of the vertical curve shall be determined by
multiplying the absolute difference in change of percent in grade
by the following factors:
(a) Minor arterial streets: 160 feet.
(b) Collector streets: 80 feet.
(c) Local and marginal access streets: 30 feet.
(4) All approaches to an intersection of two streets shall have a
leveling area not greater than four-percent grade for a distance of
25 feet measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the
intersecting street. The profile of the higher order street shall be
maintained.
(a) If two streets have the same classification (such as both being
collector streets), then the profile of the street with the higher
traffic volume shall be maintained. The Planning Commission
may require submission of traffic volume data to support such
choice.
(5) The maximum grade across the turnaround in a cul-de-sac shall not
exceed 5%.
(6) To provide for adequate drainage, the minimum grade of any street
gutter across an intersection shall be not less than 2.0%, unless
inlets connected to storm drain lines are provided to collect gutter
flow on the upstream sides of the intersection.
(7) Improvements to existing streets. See § 165-59M.
G. Easements. Easements shall be provided adjacent to street rights-ofway,
tract boundaries and lot lines and other required areas, within the
following standards:
§ 165-59 PALMER CODE § 165-59
160:406
(1) Drainage, sanitary or domestic water easements shall be provided
as indicated and required by the plans. The minimum width of
easement shall be 20 feet (which might include 10 feet on each side
of abutting lots within a subdivision) with an additional width of
five feet for each additional utility.
(2) Utility easements of a minimum of 10 feet in width shall be
provided adjacent to all street rights-of-ways and all lot lines. Such
lines are intended for, but not limited to electricity, telephone and
television cable lines so that each lot or dwelling unit can be
served. For natural gas distribution lines, see § 165-66.
H. Sight lines at intersections of streets. See § 190-194C of the Township
Zoning Ordinance.
I. Cul-de-sac streets.
(1) Cul-de-sac streets shall be permitted with a maximum length of
1,000 feet and a minimum length of 250 feet and must be provided
with a turnaround with a minimum cartway radius of 40 feet to the
outside curb, except that such radius may be 35 feet if permitted by
PennDOT at such time to qualify for liquid fuels reimbursement.
The maximum radius of a cul-de-sac shall be 60 feet. Such
maximum and minimum length shall be measured from the
intersecting street's right-of-way line and the center of the cul-desac
bulb. The same width between the edge of the cartway and the
edge of the right-of-way shall be maintained around the cul-de-sac
as is required along the main stem of the street. (See Figure below.)
(2) The circular paving of the cul-de-sac shall be connected to the
approach paving by an arc having a radius of not less than 25 feet
(see Figure below).
(3) The Board of Supervisors, upon the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, may permit acceptable alternative
turnaround designs, including turnarounds of acceptable radii
incorporated into a parking court or a landscaped island (with an
acceptable system for maintenance) within a cul-de-sac.
(4) No street shall dead-end without an approved turnaround at the
end of the street. Temporary stub streets shall be required to
include at least a temporary cul-de-sac, if the stub would be longer
than 150 feet or serve more than three dwellings or lots.
§ 165-59 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-59
160:407
(5) See also the design standards in Table 10.1.
(6) A cul-de-sac street, or a combination of cul-de-sac streets
connected so as to effectively form a system with only one point of
entry, shall serve a maximum of 20 dwelling units.
J. Maintenance. As a condition for final plan approval, the developer must
enter into a legally binding agreement which shall state who is to be
responsible for the improvement and maintenance of any street not
offered for dedication. If an association of lot owners is to be made
responsible, such association must be legally organized prior to plan
approval by an agreement approved by the Township.
K. Street design and traffic improvements.
(1) In general. Streets shall be graded, improved and surfaced to the
grades and dimensions shown on approved plans, profiles and
cross sections and in conformance to the Township street
improvement standards.
(2) Right-of-way grading.
(a) The entire right-of-way shall be graded to the approved cross
section. All trees, stumps and other material deemed
unsuitable by the Township Engineer shall be removed. The
excavation shall be backfilled and suitably compacted to the
satisfaction of the Township Engineer.
(b) The entire street structure shall be crowned in conformance
with the Township street and improvement specifications.
(c) A proper super-elevation (banked curves) shall be provided on
arterial and collector streets and when required by the
Township Engineer. Additional provisions shall be provided to
prevent hazardous surface cross drainage.
(3) Grading beyond right-of-way.
(a) The subdivider or developer may be required to grade beyond
the right-of-way line in order to provide continuous slope from
the right-of-way line to the proposed elevation of the abutting
property.
(b) Such grading beyond the right-of-way shall maintain the
original conditions of slope and contours except where
stormwater runoff designs dictate or warrant improvement or
alteration of the original slope and contours.
(c) Approved plans, either preliminary or final, showing proposed
grading, shall be a covenant running with the land, unless
altered by written permission from the Board of Supervisors in
conjunction with the Northampton County Conservation
District.
§ 165-59 PALMER CODE § 165-59
160:408
(d) In areas of earth excavation or earth fill, such grading shall be
done to a maximum slope of three feet horizontal to one feet
vertical.
(4) Drainage of streets.
(a) Parallel- and cross-drainage facilities shall be properly located,
designed and installed to maintain proper drainage of the
completed streets.
(b) Proper design and construction in accordance with those
requirements may require the use of curb and gutter or paved
drainage swales to prevent erosion. Drainage facilities shall be
designed in accordance with requirements of § 165-63.
(c) The minimum diameter of any cross-drainage or culvert pipe
shall be 15 inches.
(d) Open pipe ends must be fitted with concrete end walls or wing
walls or prefabricated end sections and with protective safety
gratings.
(e) No open pipes shall be allowed to end within the Township
street right-of-way, except in cases where new driveways must
cross existing deep roadside swales adjacent to existing
Township streets. In the case of these exemptions to the
standard, the pipe shall be located as far off the edge of
pavement as possible (at least 20 feet from the street center
line).
(f) Energy dissipators shall be placed at the outlets of all pipes
where flow velocities exceed maximum permitted channel
velocities.
(g) Bridges and culverts shall be designed to support expected
loads in accordance with applicable federal and/or state
standards, to accommodate expected stormwater flows and to
be constructed to adequate width in accordance with PennDOT
standards. The applicant shall apply for and obtain a DER
permit when required.
(h) Consideration shall be given for subgrade drainage of those
soils subject to frost heave. Design of the roadbed in such
locations may require parallel drainage facilities and/or
underdrains to properly stabilize the subgrade. The Board of
Supervisors may require that such drainage facilities be
provided. The design of such subgrade drainage facilities shall
be subject to the review and approval of the Township
Engineer.
(i) Sedimentation and erosion control. See § 165-76.
(j) Stormwater drainage. See § 165-63.
§ 165-59 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-59
160:409
(k) A set of approved design plans shall be maintained on file at
the site during construction, as record drawings.
(5) Street construction standards. See the Township street and
sidewalk standards (Chapter 160).
L. Private streets. Any private street or accessway that will eventually
serve traffic from three or more dwelling units or two or more
industrial, commercial uses and/or institutional uses shall be designed
and constructed to Township construction standards, including the
provision of a street right-of-way.
M. Required traffic improvements.
(1) Purpose. In recognition of the provisions of the Article V-A and
Sections 503(2)(ii) and (3) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code,130 this section is primarily intended to ensure that
streets bordering a subdivision or land development are
coordinated and of such widths and grades and in such locations as
deemed necessary to accommodate prospective traffic and to
facilitate fire protection and to ensure that the access into and out
of subdivisions and land developments is sufficiently safe.
(2) Process. This Subsection M shall be carried out through
determinations of the Board of Supervisors, after considering any
recommendations of the Planning Commission, the Township
Engineer, the applicant, the applicant's professional
representatives, any comments from PennDOT that may be
provided regarding a state road and any professional traffic studies
that may have been submitted.
(3) On-site/abutting traffic improvements. If, in the determination of
the Board of Supervisors, there is a reasonable relationship
between the need for an on-site improvement of a street and the
traffic created by a proposed subdivision or land development, the
applicant for such subdivision or land development shall be
required to complete the needed improvement or fund his/her fair
share of the cost of such traffic improvement and to dedicate
sufficient street right-of-way for needed improvements.
(a) Widening of abutting street. An applicant for any land
development or major subdivision shall be required to widen
the cartway and any shoulders of abutting streets to Township
standards (or other specifications approved by the Board of
Supervisors or PennDOT) and to a width determined to be
adequate by the Board of Supervisors.
[1] The applicant shall only be responsible for improvements
from the center line of the street right-of-way inward
toward the project's lot lines, unless the Board of
130. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10503(2)(i) and (3) and also 53 P.S. § 10501-A et seq.
§ 165-59 PALMER CODE § 165-59
160:410
Supervisors determines that improvements on the other
side of the center line are essential for public safety.
(b) Such improvements and right-of-way shall be required unless
the Board of Supervisors determines:
[1] That there is not a reasonable relationship between the
improvements and the traffic created by the proposed
development;
[2] That widening of right-of-way or other improvements are
not needed or that a lesser improvement is sufficient;
[3] That PennDOT specifically refuses in writing to allow such
improvement to a state road in the foreseeable future, in
which case the Township may still require that abutting
right-of-way be dedicated to the Township or reserved for
future dedication if needed in the future.
(c) Any improvement to a state street shall meet all PennDOT
standards.
(4) Types of required traffic improvements.
(a) The following shall be the definition of "on-site improvement"
(unless this definition is amended by state law): "all street
improvements constructed on the applicant's property, or the
improvements constructed on the property abutting the
applicant's property necessary for the ingress or egress to the
applicant's property."
(b) On-site improvements may include, but are not limited to, a
new or upgraded traffic signal, land dedication to improve an
abutting intersection, realignment of an abutting curve in a
road or the widening of the abutting cartway and right-of-way.
(c) The Township shall not require an applicant to fund or
complete a road improvement that is an "off-site improvement"
as defined by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code,131 unless the Board of Supervisors determines that such
improvement is clearly essential for the physical safety of the
occupants/residents of the proposed development (such as for
emergency vehicle access).
(5) Funding. In place of completing a required street improvement as a
condition of final approval, an applicant may enter into a legally
binding development agreement with the Township for the
applicant to fund the improvement or his/her fair share of such
improvement, as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
131. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 165-59 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-59
160:411
§ 165-60. Blocks.
§ 165-61. Lots.
(6) Accounting. Any such funds may be placed in escrow until such
time as sufficient funds are available for a more comprehensive
improvement, with interest being used toward the cost of the
improvement. Any such funds received under this subsection shall
be accounted for separately.
(7) Staging. Any completion or funding of a required road
improvement may occur in stages in relationship to the stages of
the development, if so stated in a legally binding development
agreement and/or as a condition of final plan approval.
N. Future street right-of-way. Any subdivision or land development shall
comply with § 190-196 of the Township Zoning Ordinance if the Board
of Supervisors determines that the subdivision or land development
would generate need for additional right-of-way.
A. Residential.
(1) Maximum length. Residential blocks shall not exceed 1,500 feet in
length in subdivisions using an average lot size of one acre or
larger and shall not exceed 1,200 feet in length in subdivisions
having an average lot size less than one acre.
(2) Minimum length. Residential blocks shall have a minimum length
of 250 feet.
(3) Blocks shall be of sufficient width to permit two tiers of lots except
where access is limited by virtue of an adjoining arterial street or
by virtue of topographic limitations.
B. Nonresidential. Nonresidential blocks shall not be less than 800 feet in
length.
A. Lots shall conform to the applicable minimum lot sizes, lot widths,
setback and all other requirements as set forth in the Township Zoning
Ordinance.
B. All lots shall front on a public or private street improved to meet
Township standards or for which such improvements have been insured
by the posting of an acceptable performance guaranty under this
ordinance.
C. The depth-to-width ratio of a lot shall generally not be greater than
three to one (3:1).
D. Side lines of lots shall abut and be approximately at right angles to
straight streets and on radial lines to curved streets. Pointed or very
irregularly shaped lots shall be avoided. (See figures below.)
§ 165-59 PALMER CODE § 165-61
160:412
E. Double-frontage lots.
(1) Double-frontage lots shall not be created, except as needed to avoid
direct vehicular access onto a minor arterial street, or a collector
street intended to carry high volumes of through traffic, by
individual driveways.
(2) Planting strips.
(a) On any double-frontage or reverse-frontage lots, each lot shall
include a fifteen-foot-deep planting strip along one of the
streets, with vehicle access across this strip clearly prohibited
by notes on any approved plan.(See figures below.)
(b) In addition to the street trees required by § 165-73 of this
ordinance, this planting strip shall include evergreen plantings
meeting the requirements of § 190-194 of the Township Zoning
Ordinance. Any fencing in the rear of such lots shall be placed
on the inside side of such plantings.
(c) This planting strip shall be placed along the street that the
Planning Commission determines will eventually serve the
most through traffic. (For example, if a lot abuts a collector and
a local street, the planting strip shall be placed along the
collector street and the lot shall only have vehicular access
onto the local street.)
F. If remnants of land (other than rights-of-way) exist after subdividing,
they shall be incorporated into existing or proposed lots. No lot shall be
created that would abut a minor arterial street that would not be
suitable for a use permitted in that zoning district.
G. Bus stops.
§ 165-61 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-61
160:413
§ 165-62. Recreation land, open space and fee requirements.
(1) Residential land developments or subdivisions that involve 15 or
more dwelling units shall contact the School District to seek to
establish one or more acceptable and safe locations for a school bus
stop.
(2) A major subdivision or land development may be required by the
Planning Commission to contact the local public transportation
agency to seek an appropriate location for a public bus stop.
A. Purposes. The purposes of these regulations shall be to:
(1) Provide adequate open spaces, recreational lands and recreational
facilities primarily to serve new inhabitants of new developments,
for both active and passive recreation.
(2) Recognize and work to carry out the Palmer Township Park,
Recreation and Open Space Plan.
(3) Recognize the rationale for these common open space and fee-inlieu-
of-land requirements, as described in the Park, Recreation and
Open Space Plan and associated memoranda to the Township from
the Township's professional recreation planning consultants.
B. Applicability. Subdivision and land development applications submitted
and/or approved prior to this section becoming effective shall be bound
by the previous language of section. This new section shall apply to any
subdivision or land development for which a preliminary plan or a
combined preliminary/final plan is submitted after the effective date of
this amendment, except that this section shall not apply to:
(1) Submittals that the Planning Commission determines only involve
clearly minor adjustments or corrections to a preliminary plan that
was duly submitted and actively under consideration or approved
prior to the effective date of this amendment.
(2) Planned residential development (PRD) only to the extent of active
recreational facilities (see § 165-62J) being provided by the
developer in said PRD. In such an event, for all such facilities so
provided, credit for the value thereof is to be given against the
recreational fee schedule set forth in § 165-62E hereof. If no such
facilities are provided by the developer in said PRD, then the
provisions of the aforesaid § 165-62E are fully applicable to a PRD.
[Amended 4-8-1996 by Ord. No. 263]
(3) Any plan that only involves changes that do not increase the
number of lots.
C. Limitations on use of recreation fees.
(1) Uses and accounting. Any fees collected under this section shall be
placed within an interest-bearing account and shall be accounted
§ 165-61 PALMER CODE § 165-62
160:414
for separately from other Township funds. Such fees shall only
be used for the following: acquisition of public open space for
recreation, development of public recreation facilities, landscaping
of public open space and closely related legal, engineering,
construction document preparation and design work fees.
(2) Locations. The Township should identify the location at which fees
from a subdivision or land development are intended to be
expended. Such location should be reasonably accessible to
inhabitants of the development that paid the fee. If such location is
not specifically identified or if the Board of Supervisors determines
that circumstances have changed, then such fees shall be used for
the acquisition of land or development of facilities at a communitywide
park in the northern portion of the Township or at Riverview
Park or at another recreation area intended to serve the entire
Township.
D. Land dedication. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 283]
(1) Amounts of land. Any applicant for any residential subdivision or
land development shall dedicate common open space that consists
of land suitable for passive and active recreation, at a rate of 2,000
square feet per dwelling unit or lot, unless the Board of Supervisors
determines that such land in that location would not be reasonable
or efficient, in which case recreation fees in lieu of land shall be
required under Subsection E.
(2) The land and fee requirements of this section shall be based upon
the maximum number of new dwelling units granted final approval
within a subdivision or land development. In the case of a
subdivision of single-family detached dwellings, the fee shall be
based on the number of newly created lots.
E. Land or fees for residential development. [Amended 2-15-2000 by
Ord. No. 283]
(1) If the Board of Supervisors determines that a land dedication
within a proposed subdivision or land development would not be
reasonable or efficient, the applicant shall be required to pay fees
in lieu of dedicating open space. A notation stating that such fees
are required shall be stated on the final record plan. This fee shall
be made at a rate as set from time to time by resolution of the
Township Board of Supervisors. NOTE: The current Fee Schedule is
available at the Township Municipal Building. A general guide for
future increases may be increases in the consumer price index. See
§ 165-62I regarding timing of fees.
(2) The Township should consider the following standards when
determining whether or not common open space proposed for
dedication is reasonable or efficient:
§ 165-62 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-62
160:415
(a) Whether common open space in that location would be suitable
for active or passive recreation. (Active recreation would take
place on slopes less than six-percent and support the
construction of recreational facilities. Passive recreation would
take place on land that would accommodate the construction of
trails, picnic areas and other pedestrian amenities.)
(b) Whether common open space could be added to an existing
recreation area that is adjacent or a potential future recreation
area on an adjacent property.
(c) Whether the proposed land would meet the requirements of
this section.
(d) Whether the area surrounding the proposed development has
sufficient existing recreation and open space land and whether
it is possible for pedestrians and bicyclists to safely reach those
lands.
(e) Any relevant policies of the Township Park, Recreation and
Open Space Plan.
(f) Whether the proposed open spaces would preserve important
natural features (such as woodlands or creek valleys) that
might otherwise be negatively altered.
(g) Whether the area will involve a significant concentration of
homes without large yards.
(h) Any recommendations that may be received from the
Recreation Commission, Planning Commission, the Township
Engineer, the Township staff or the School District.
(i) Reference Subsection F for additional items.
F. Land to be dedicated. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 283]
(1) Land required to be dedicated shall be suitable, prior to dedication,
for its intended purpose, in the determination of the Board of
Supervisors, after providing the Recreation Commission with an
opportunity for a review.
(2) The applicant shall state what improvements, if any, that he/she
intends to make to the land to make it suitable for its intended
purpose, such as rough grading, drainage improvements,
landscaping, clearance of undesirable vegetation or development
of rough trails. The applicant shall not be required to actually
construct or install active recreation facilities as part of land
dedication except as part of any agreement under Subsection J, Fee
modification process. Open space shall be free of construction
debris, excavated materials and solid waste prior to dedication.
§ 165-62 PALMER CODE § 165-62
160:416
(3) Ownership. Required common open space shall be deeded to the
Township, unless the Board of Supervisors agrees to allow a
dedication to any of the following: the Easton Area School District,
Northampton County, a property-owner/condominium association
or an environmental organization or other entity acceptable to the
Board of Supervisors. In the case of a rental development, the
Township may permit the common open space to be retained by the
owner of the adjacent residential buildings.
(4) Homeowner association. If required common open space is to be
owned by a homeowner association, such organization shall require
all property owners within the development to annually contribute
to the maintenance of the common open space. Such provisions
regarding required common open space shall be subject to
acceptance by the Board of Supervisors, based upon the review by
the Township Solicitor and generally follow as a model the
provisions of Section 705(f) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities
Planning Code regarding homeowners associations.132
(5) Any required common open space dedication shall include deed
restrictions to permanently prevent the development of buildings,
except buildings for noncommercial recreation or to support
maintenance of the land for recreation.
(6) Priority shall be given to dedication of land in approximate
locations identified by the Township Park, Recreation and Open
Space Plan. The Township may accept the dedication of common
open space that is not contiguous to the development that it relates
to, provided that the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the
Township that the land would clearly serve a valid common open
space purpose.
(7) A minimum of 50% of the required common open space to be
dedicated shall be usable for active recreation. Areas intended for
active recreation shall be well-drained, of less than six-percent
average slope and not require filling in of a wetland for use.
(8) Land used to meet the minimum required amounts of common open
space shall exhibit the following conditions:
(a) Has adequate access for its maintenance and for pedestrians.
Note, a minimum of two access points shall be required from a
public street or land shall adjoin and become part of an
existing open space area that is accessible from a public street.
The width of street frontage shall not be less than the minimum
lot width as established in the zoning district for which the land
to be dedicated is located; and
(b) Is suitable for both active and passive recreation; and
132. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10705(f).
§ 165-62 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-62
160:417
(c) Is not located within a stormwater detention basin; and
(d) Is not required to be provided under another section of this
ordinance or another Township ordinance; and
(e) Is not located within 15 feet of any principal building; and
(f) Is not located within 15 feet of a parking area of six or more
parking spaces (other than parking areas specifically
developed to serve the open space); and
(g) Would not result in a total contiguous tract of common open
space of less than 1/2 acre (including any preexisting adjacent
common open space); and
(h) Is not within the right-of-way of overhead high-voltage
electrical lines; and
(i) Fifty percent of land required to be dedicated has a usable
shape for active recreation; and
(j) Has a minimum width of the lot width established for the
zoning district in which the land to be dedicated is located,
except for developed pathways and except for portions of the
open space needed for maintenance access.
(9) Residual land. If only a portion of a larger tract of land is currently
proposed to be subdivided or the applicant owns one or more
adjacent tracts that not currently proposed to be subdivided, the
applicant shall provide a sketch of a possible future land dedication
on these adjacent lands in case they would be developed in the
future. This is intended to encourage long-term coordination of
open space.
(10) Coordination with future adjacent dedication. The Board of
Supervisors may require that a required land dedication within a
property currently being subdivided shall be placed along an
adjacent undeveloped property so that in the future open spaces on
both sides of the property line may be combined.
(11) Configuration and general siting of land.
(a) Open space shall be configured to serve and be accessible to all
residents of the development.
(b) Common open space shall be arranged to take maximum
advantage of the natural and physical characteristics of the
site, to provide buffer yard provisions for adjacent parcels and
to place common open space within easy access and view of a
majority of dwelling units.
§ 165-62 PALMER CODE § 165-62
160:418
(c) Lands able to support the construction of active recreation
facilities as described above must be incorporated into the
required open space of the development as follows:
[1] Land shall be centrally located so as to conveniently serve
all residents of the development and shall consist of one
parcel of land. Note, active recreational areas shall not be
within 100 feet of a residential building or residential lot.
[2] Land shall be accessible from a public street or shall
become part of an existing park or common open space
that is accessible by a public street. In addition, the active
area shall be access to sewer, water and public utilities.
(d) Environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, onehundred-
year floodplains, rock outcroppings, and sloping areas
over 15% may count toward 25% of the required percentage of
passive common open space. Such environmentally sensitive
areas listed above can be included as part of the lands to be
dedicated but shall be provided above and beyond the acreage
required in Section D.
(e) Land dedicated for passive common open space shall be able to
support the construction or location of pedestrian trails and
amenities along the pathway such as benches and picnic areas.
G. Fees for business development. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No.
283]
(1) Purpose. The purpose of these regulations shall be to recognize
that the development of commercial and industrial uses creates
significant demand for many types of Township recreation facilities,
such as athletic fields, volleyball courts and picnic areas.
(2) Any new commercial or industrial subdivision or land development
shall be required to dedicate 5% of the buildable area of the tract
for recreational purposes. The land to be dedicated shall not
include wetlands, slopes over six-percent, floodplain areas, or
stormwater detention or management areas. Note, the applicant
may pay a recreation fee in lieu of land dedication in an amount as
set from time to time by resolution of the Township Board of
Supervisors. NOTE: The current Fee Schedule is available at the
Township Municipal Building. This fee may be revised by resolution
of the Board of Supervisors. No land shall be required for
dedication or fee shall be charged for a change in use of or
expansion of an existing building.
(3) See possible modifications of these requirements in Subsection J
below.
H. Combination of land and fees. Upon mutual agreement of the Board of
Supervisors and the applicant, the Township may accept a combination
§ 165-62 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-62
160:419
of common open space and fees in lieu of land to meet the requirements
of this section for a residential subdivision or land development. This
combination shall be based upon the common open space requirement
that applies to a certain number of dwelling units and the fee-in-lieuof-
land requirement that applies to the remaining number of dwelling
units.
I. Timing of fees. Fees required under this section shall be due and
payable upon the receipt of the signed and sealed final plan from the
Township and, in any case, shall be paid prior to recording of the final
plan, except as follows:
(1) The payment of fees may be delayed for up to six months after the
recording of the final plans if the applicant provides financial
security acceptable to the Township to ensure the payment of the
fees at such time. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 283]
J. Fee modification process.
(1) An applicant may seek a modification or reduction of requirements
of this section by offering in writing, in a contractually binding form
to:
(a) Construct substantial, permanent recreation facilities within
the proposed subdivision or land development;
(b) Construct substantial, permanent recreation facilities on
existing public open space; or
(c) Donate or sell appropriate land at a reduced market value to
the Township or the county for public recreation, provided that
the applicant proves by evidence from qualified professionals
that such market value is in fact reduced by an amount greater
than or equal to the value of the modification.
(d) Should the applicant/developer agree to construct recreation
facilities, as described in Subsection J(1)(a) and (b) above,
100% of the facilities shall be constructed within six months
from their receipt of the signed and sealed final plan from the
Township, unless otherwise agreed to by the Township.
[Added 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 283]
(e) As part of the contractual binding form, the applicant shall
provide construction drawings, technical specifications and
cost estimate. Note, the construction of facilities shall be at a
minimum equal to the amount of the fee that would have been
generated from in-lieu-of land dedication. [Added 2-15-2000
by Ord. No. 283]
(2) The Township may accept such modification if the applicant clearly
proves to the satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors, after
providing the Recreation Commission with an opportunity for a
§ 165-62 PALMER CODE § 165-62
160:420
§ 165-63. Stormwater management.
review, that such alternative will be substantially equivalent to the
value of the land and/or facilities needed to meet the majority
of the recreation needs that can be expected to be generated
within the Township from the inhabitants of the development. Such
modification shall be based upon an estimate of the market value
of the improvements by the applicant's engineers, which shall be
subject to acceptance by the Board of Supervisors.
(3) The applicant must prove to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission and the Board of Supervisors the cost value of the
proposed permanent recreational facilities in order for the same to
be credited against the applicable recreation fees. Permanent
recreation facilities may include playground equipment, courts,
ball fields, picnic areas, pavilions, bike paths, parking areas, and
other facilities related to or accessory to use by the public as
recreational facilities, as so determined by the Planning
Commission and the Board Supervisors. [Added 4-8-1996 by Ord.
No. 263]
K. Timing of land dedication. [Added 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 283]
(1) Land required to be dedicated shall be due upon the receipt of the
signed and sealed final plan from the Township and, in any case,
shall be dedicated prior to recording of the final plan. In the event
that the subdivision is proposed in phases, the applicant can choose
to dedicate the full area of land required for the total tract as
shown in the preliminary plan or dedicate the open space required
for the approved phase. If the development or subdivision occurs in
phases, the following calculation shall be used:
Required
Phase I
Open
Space
=
Phase I Units or
Lots
Total Units or Lots
x [(Total Required Open Space) + (.1 x Total Required
Open Space)]
Total Required open space = 2,000 square feet total number of units in all phases
(2) Should the applicant/developer elect to dedicate open space by
phase, each open space area to be dedicated shall be contiguous to
the open space area proposed for each subsequent phase. It is the
specific intent of this subsection not to promote location of small
isolated pockets of open space within a subdivision. Further,
acceptable mechanisms of ownership shall be established as
required in Subsection F.
A. General provisions.
(1) Stormwater runoff from any subdivision or land development
(including during construction and earthmoving) shall not occur at
§ 165-62 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:421
a peak rate (measured in cubic feet per second) that is greater after
development than occurred prior to development.
(2) Control of runoff from a site shall occur using appropriate means of
detention of the water on the site and/or other approved types of
stormwater management, within the requirements of this
ordinance.
(3) Runoff that is detained shall be held and released at a
predetermined controlled rate by appropriately installed devices.
The release shall be in the same manner as the natural or
predevelopment means of discharge from a site (such as point
discharge or sheet flow).
(4) Stormwater runoff shall not be increased or redirected in such a
way that it results in hazards to persons or property or interferes
with the normal movement of vehicles.
(5) All stormwater management methods are subject to approval by
the Township Engineer.
(6) Stormwater shall be directed away from buildings and on-lot septic
systems.
(7) All stormwater management plans shall take into account and
provide for existing flow from upstream areas within the entire
watershed.
(8) The existing points of natural drainage discharge onto adjacent
property shall not be altered nor shall the concentration of water
runoff be increased because of development without the written
approval of all affected landowners.
(9) No stormwater runoff or natural drainage water shall be so
diverted as to overload existing drainage systems or create flooding
or the need for additional drainage structures on other private
properties or public lands, without complete approval of provisions
being made by the developer for properly handling such conditions,
including water runoff impoundments, if necessary.
(10) All lots shall be laid out and graded to prevent cross-lot drainage
and to provide positive drainage away from proposed building
locations and any primary or alternate septic system locations.
(11) See regulations concerning setbacks from swales and slopes of
swales in §§ 190-150 and 152 of the Township Zoning Ordinance.
(12) An adequate storm sewer system consisting of inlets and other
underground drainage structures with approved outlets shall be
constructed where the runoff of stormwater and the prevention of
erosion cannot be accomplished satisfactorily by surface drainage
facilities, as determined by the Board of Supervisors, based upon
the recommendation of the Township Engineer.
§ 165-63 PALMER CODE § 165-63
160:422
(13) Outlet locations shall be approved by the Township Engineer.
(14) Sequence of construction. No substantial grading shall occur and
no building permits shall be issued for any building unless any
detention basin, siltation basin or improved major swale approved
to handle the resulting runoff is in place. Any detention basin shall
be seeded and stabilized and have an installed outlet structure
prior to the construction of any streets or buildings within that
drainage basin.
B. Calculations of stormwater runoff.
(1) Stormwater calculations shall be submitted in a clear and legible
manner for any lot or tract that would result in an increase of 3,000
square feet or greater of total impervious cover.
(2) These calculations shall follow a method preapproved by and
acceptable to the Township Engineer. The following methods are
recommended:
(a) Rational method. See description in Appendix D.133
(b) Soil cover complex method. See United States Soil
Conservation Service Technical Release No. 55, Urban
Hydrology for Small Watersheds.
(3) Rainfall data shall be from the National Weather Service or
PennDOT, for the Lehigh Valley.
(4) The stormwater calculations shall include the following:
(a) Pre- and postdevelopment drainage maps, showing existing
and proposed grades and including any off-site tributary area.
(b) Pre- and postdevelopment runoff calculations.
(c) Detention-basin design calculations (as applicable).
(d) Pipe and swale sizing calculations.
(e) All other information that is needed to construct proposed
stormwater drainage facilities, including, but not limited to,
slopes, proposed elevations and typical cross sections and
details.
(f) Such information as the Township Engineer determines is
needed to determine compliance with this ordinance.
(g) If the development occurs in phases, the entire system shall be
shown.
133. Editor's Note: Appendix D is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 165-63 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:423
(5) Where crop farming or disturbed earth exists on the site prior to
development, meadow in good condition shall be used as the
starting base for the calculation.
C. Design storms. The following shall apply unless superseded by
PennDOT or other stricter standards:
(1) At a minimum, the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the
Township Engineer that no increase in peak stormwater discharge
will leave the tract during earthmoving, construction or after
development than occurred prior to any of these activities, under
the following conditions and storm frequencies (considered
individually), unless any more restrictive requirements of an
applicable official stormwater management plan approved by DER
and the county pursuant to State Act 167 of 1978, as amended,
exist:134
(a) Two-year storm.
(b) Five-year storm.
(c) Ten-year storm.
(d) Twenty-five-year storm.
(2) If using the SCS calculation method, a twenty-four-hour Type II
storm shall be used in the calculations required by this subsection.
(3) Storm sewer piping, roadside swales and inlet systems shall be
designed for a twenty-five-year storm. A twenty-four-hour Type II
rainfall shall be used if using the soil complex method. The
openings of culverts and under bridges shall be designed for a fiftyyear,
twenty-four-hour Type II rainfall (except within the onehundred-
year floodplain). Bridges shall be designed with one foot
of freeboard.
(4) Within the one-hundred-year floodplain, any stormwater
management structures and systems shall be designed to handle a
one-hundred-year storm. A twenty-four-hour Type II storm shall be
used if using the soil complex method.
(5) The stormwater management plan shall show that a one-hundredyear,
twenty-four-hour storm can be safely conveyed without
jeopardizing any existing or proposed principal building on the site
or any existing principal building downstream of the site. For
downstream properties, the applicant shall study areas where the
development could have significant impact, considering the size of
drainage areas and the amount of runoff from the development.
D. Design submission.
134. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 680.1 et seq.
§ 165-63 PALMER CODE § 165-63
160:424
(1) All plans showing the proposed storm drainage construction must
be accompanied by a complete design stamped and signed by a
Pennsylvania-registered engineer.
(2) When subdivisions or land developments are submitted to the
Township for approval in sections, a complete general storm sewer
design for the proposed subdivision or land development shall be
submitted at the preliminary plan level. The proposed design must
take into account the entire tract and the watershed.
(3) All stormwater controls shall be designed to function adequately
after the completion of each phase of a development. This may
require the use of temporary structures, which shall be shown on
submitted plans.
(4) A development shall be required to include the construction of
stormwater controls in areas of future phases of a development
prior to construction of earlier phases if the Township Engineer
determines that is necessary to make sure that the system will
work after the completion of each phase. This shall, for example,
include the extension of the main outfall line.
(5) A set of approved design plans shall be maintained on file at the site
during construction, as record drawings.
(6) Drainage structures that are located on state highway rights-of-way
shall be found to be acceptable to PennDOT, and PennDOT approval
shall be a condition of any final approval of the Township.
(7) Submission requirements. The submission requirements for
stormwater management plans for preliminary and final plans
within Articles V and VI of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall apply to all required submissions under this
ordinance.
E. County watershed plans. For areas of a development that are located
within a watershed for which a stormwater management plan has been
approved by DER and the county (pursuant to the State Act 167 Storm
Water Management Act), where specifically provided under state law,
such Act 167 plan shall supersede any conflicting parts of this section.
(NOTE: The Act 167 plans primarily establish differing detention levels
for different areas.) Where necessary for public safety, the Board of
Supervisors may require adjustments to such Act 167 plan provisions,
within the limitations of the Act 167 plan.
F. Joint storm drainage facilities.
(1) Stormwater management facilities may be planned and
constructed in coordination by two or more developments,
provided that all other parts of this section are complied with.
§ 165-63 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:425
(2) The Township may require a development to contribute its fair
share of the costs of a comprehensive regional or subregional
stormwater system in place of requiring an on-site detention basin.
G. Methods of detention and flow delay. The following methods of
detention or flow-delay devices may be found to be acceptable by the
Township Engineer:
(1) Wet or dry ponds and detention basins.
(2) Roof storage and increased roof roughness.
(3) Parking lot detention.
(4) Infiltration trenches.
(5) Porous pavements, grassed channels and vegetated strips.
(6) Cisterns, underground reservoirs or covered ponds.
(7) Increasing the roughness coefficients on the development's surface
area.
(8) Decrease percentage of impervious area.
(9) Groundwater recharge.
(10) Routing flow over lawns in swales within stormwater easements.
(11) Detention storage within the storm sewer.
(12) Another method that may be approved by the Township Engineer.
H. Rooftop storage. If a roof is to be used for detention, a condition of such
use shall be that the applicant shall submit appropriate calculations and
a signed statement from a registered architect or registered engineer
that the structure will be able to support the roof loadings. This
statement shall be required prior to issuance of the building permit.
I. Parking lot storage. A maximum of 30% of paved parking lot may be
found acceptable as a stormwater detention but not retention facility.
Ponding shall be arranged so that pedestrians may cross the parking lot
relatively dryly. There shall be a maximum designed depth of six inches,
and the pavement shall be designed to withstand the effects of ponded
water. The area used for the storage shall be the least used portions of
the parking.
J. Groundwater recharge. In general, all runoff control measures shall be
designed to encourage groundwater recharge, if suitable subsurface
conditions are present. However, in any such recharge, proper
precautions shall be taken to prevent pollution of the groundwater,
prevent the formation of sinkholes and to promote safety.
K. Detention basin standards.
§ 165-63 PALMER CODE § 165-63
160:426
(1) For the purpose of this section, a retention basin shall be required
to meet the same standards as a detention basin.
(2) Emergency spillways. All detention basins shall be designed with
an emergency spillway.
(a) These spillways at a minimum shall be able to handle a onehundred-
year postdevelopment peak discharge of the principal
pipe barrel and the emergency spillway.
(b) Whenever possible, the emergency spillway for detention
basins shall be constructed on undisturbed ground. If the
emergency spillway cannot be constructed on undisturbed
ground, it shall be constructed of suitable material adequately
compacted in accordance with specifications preapproved by
the Township Engineer.
(c) Emergency spillways shall be constructed of reinforced
concrete, mortared-in-place riprap or concrete rubble. All
emergency spillways shall be constructed so that the detention
basin berm is protected against erosion.
(d) The emergency spillway shall be a minimum of two feet below
the adjacent berm elevation. The emergency spillway shall
convey the one-hundred-year storm at a maximum depth of one
foot over the spillway. The downstream slope of the spillway
shall, as a minimum, extend to the toe of the berm
embankment. The edge of the basin grading shall be within the
subject property.
(e) All detention basin outflow structures shall be designed with
trash racks over the outflows.
(3) Slope of detention basin embankment. The maximum inside slope
of earthen detention basin embankments shall be four horizontal to
one vertical. The maximum outside slope shall be three to one (3:1).
The top or toe of any slope shall be located a minimum of five feet
from any property line. Whenever possible, the side slopes and
basin shape shall be amenable to the natural topography. Straight
side slopes are prohibited.
(4) Width of berm. The minimum top width of detention basin berms
shall be 10 feet, unless the Township Engineer determines that a
greater width is needed for maintenance and/or structural
purposes.
(5) Slope of basin bottom. In order to ensure proper drainage of the
detention basin, a minimum grade of 2% shall be maintained for all
sheet flow. A minimum grade of 1% shall be maintained for all
channel flow, provided that a synthetic low-flow channel of suitable
materials is provided.
§ 165-63 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:427
(6) Antiseep collars. Antiseep collars shall be installed around the
principal pipe barrel within the normal saturation zone of the
detention basin berms. Antiseep collars shall not be required on
basins designed to have a depth of water of less than three feet.
The antiseep collars and their connections to the pipe barrel shall
be watertight. The antiseep collars shall extend a minimum of two
feet beyond the outside of the principal pipe barrel. The maximum
spacing between collars shall be 10 times the minimum projection
of the collar measured perpendicular to the pipe.
(7) Fencing.
(a) The Township may require an applicant to surround a
detention basin with galvanized vinyl-clad chain link metal
fencing or an alternative type of fence acceptable to the
Township if any of these conditions are present:
[1] The maximum depth of water in the basin after a twentyfive-
year storm is greater than 30 inches.
[2] The basin is intended to hold water for periods of longer
than three hours after the rainfall subsides.
[3] The basin is to be dedicated to the Township, and the
Board of Supervisors requests fencing.
[4] The earthen inside slopes of the detention basin will be
steeper than four horizontal to one vertical.
(b) Fencing of a detention basin under the above subsection shall
not be required if the nearest residential district, school, daycare
center, existing residence or recreation facility is at least
1,500 feet away in walking distance from the basin.
(8) Landscaped screening of detention basins.
(a) A detention basin shall be screened from view of existing
residences, a residential zoning district or a public street,
unless the basin would meet both of the following conditions:
[1] It would have an average inside slope of less than five to
one (5:1) on the outside of the basin, and both the inside
and outside would be planted in grass and intended to be
mowed or would be designed to closely resemble a natural
pond.
[2] It would not be surrounded by a primarily metal fence.
(b) Any required screening shall meet the standards of § 190-194
of the Township Zoning Ordinance. This landscaping shall not
be required along an area where natural vegetation that will
completely fulfill this purpose will be maintained.
§ 165-63 PALMER CODE § 165-63
160:428
(9) Multiple basins. The use of multiple detention basins should be
investigated over the use of one larger storage facility.
(10) All outflow structures from storage facilities shall be equipped with
a regulatory device that will permit modification to regulate the
amount of outflow. Suitable antivortex and/or velocity retarders
shall be used.
(11) An outflow control structure shall be provided at the outlet of all
detention basins. This structure shall be constructed of metal or
concrete and shall be designed so that the rate of outflow is
controlled by the pipe barrel through the basin berm when the
depth of water within the basin exceeds the height of the structure.
A trash rack or similar device shall be provided to prevent debris
from entering the outflow structure. The crest elevation shall be set
at a minimum of 12 inches below the emergency spillway.
(12) Retention basins. Aeration devices may be required, dependent
upon the quality of the influent and detention time.
(13) Recreation. When reasonable, efforts should be made to allow
suitable recreational uses of portions of detention areas. This might
include designing a detention basin so that only a portion would be
wet after a minor storm, and the remainder would be well-drained
during all except the most serious storms. These areas may be
acceptable at the discretion of the Township as part of any
recreation land that may be required under any other Township
ordinance.
(14) Detention basins shall not be placed within an existing sinkhole or
a location known to be highly vulnerable to sinkholes, without a
suitable liner. The Board of Supervisors may require a clay liner
where deemed necessary, based upon the recommendations of the
Township Engineer and the Township staff. If such liner is required,
it shall have a permeability rate of at least 1 x 10-6 centimeters per
second.
L. Construction standards. Construction and materials of storm drainage
and control facilities (including pipes), erosion control facilities and all
other required improvements shall be in accordance with the approved
plans and any accompanying specifications. The construction details
and standards of the following publications, or their successor
publications, in their most recent revision shall be used:
(1) County Erosion and Sedimentation Control Handbook.
(2) PennDOT, Form 408, specifications.
(3) PennDOT, RC Series, Roadway Construction Standards.
§ 165-63 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:429
(4) In cases where the above documents conflict with Township
specifications, the Township's specifications shall supersede,
except in areas of PennDOT jurisdiction.
M. Storm sewers.
(1) The construction of new storm sewers or the connection into
acceptable existing storm sewers shall be required or allowed by
the Board of Supervisors if the Board of Supervisors determines, on
the basis of the recommendation of the Township Engineer, that
this is the most feasible and reasonable option.
(2) Any storm sewers shall be constructed to Township specifications
and shall not interconnect with sanitary sewers.
N. Drainage pipe, culvert and catch basin design.
(1) The minimum diameter of any cross-drainage or culvert pipe shall
be 15 inches.
(2) Open pipe ends must be fitted with concrete end walls or
prefabricated end sections.
(3) Drainage pipes shall have a minimum slope of 0.5%, and drainage
swales and gutters 2.0%. As a minimum, the tops of all pipes should
be at the same elevation when changing pipe sizes.
(4) Manholes or inlets shall be used at all changes in horizontal
alignment, at changes of vertical grade and at all pipe
intersections. No run of pipe shall exceed 400 feet in length
without appropriate measures to allow cleanout. Trash racks shall
be placed on all stormwater entrance structures.
(5) Bridges and culverts shall be designed and constructed in
accordance with applicable PennDOT standards. The applicant
shall apply for and receive any required DER permits.
(6) Grating. Appropriate safety grates shall be attached to all catch
basins, stormwater inlets, pipe openings and other stormwater
receiving structures, as needed, to ensure that maximum openings
do not exceed 25 square inches. Along streets, bikeways and
pedestrian paths, bicycle-safe grates as specified by PennDOT shall
be used as needed.
(7) Storm sewer outfall. Storm sewer outfalls shall be designed, with
respect to the elevation of the invert or other features, so that when
the receiving watercourse is within a twenty-five-year storm, the
storm sewer will continue to drain the area it is designed to serve.
(8) Street construction; inlet spacing.
(a) To minimize sheet flow of stormwater across lots located on the
lower side of streets and to divert flow away from building
§ 165-63 PALMER CODE § 165-63
160:430
areas, the cross section of the street as constructed shall
provide for parallel ditches or swales or curbing on the lower
side which shall discharge only at drainage easements.
(b) Inlet spacing shall be designed such that in a twenty-five-year
storm, one traffic lane of at least 10 feet in width shall be free
from stormwater.
O. Stormwater easements.
(1) Where a subdivision or development is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel or stream, there shall be provided a drainage
easement conforming substantially with the high-water line of such
watercourse attributable to a flood of one-hundred-year frequency,
in order to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage and to
provide for future possible widening, deepening, relocating,
improving or protecting of such drainage facilities. See also
setbacks from waterways and drainage swales in §§ 190-150 and
190-152 of the Zoning Ordinance.
(2) Obstructions; maintenance easements. Structures and other
obstructions to flow (except fences made of such materials and so
placed as to not obstruct flow) shall be prohibited within
stormwater easements. Such easements shall grant the Township
the right to enter the easement to accomplish maintenance work,
although the Township assumes no responsibility for such work.
(3) It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain all
stormwater easements on, over or through other properties that
are needed to carry out the proposed storm management plan.
(4) Areas where stormwater easements have or will be granted shall
not be obstructed during or after construction.
(5) See format of easements in Appendix B.135
P. Surface waters.
(1) All natural streams, channels, swales, drainage systems and/or
areas of concentration of surface water shall be maintained in their
existing condition unless alteration is approved by the Township
Engineer. The applicant shall be responsible to obtain all necessary
DER permits. (See Chapter 105 of Title 25 of the state regulations.)
(2) Creek alignments. Any change to the alignment of a watercourse or
any blocking, impeding or redirecting of a watercourse shall only
occur with written approval of DER and the Township Engineer.
Q. Ownership and maintenance of stormwater facilities. A system for the
ownership and maintenance responsibilities of all temporary and
permanent stormwater facilities and erosion and sedimentation control
135. Editor's Note: Appendix B is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 165-63 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-63
160:431
facilities that is satisfactory to the Board of Supervisors shall be
established prior to final plan approval, including:
(1) Description of temporary and permanent maintenance
requirements.
(2) Identification of responsible individual, corporation, association or
other entity for ownership and maintenance of both temporary and
permanent stormwater management and erosion and
sedimentation control facilities.
(3) Establishment of suitable easements for access to all facilities.
(4) Where the grading and storm drainage plan proposes Township
ownership and/or maintenance, a description of the methods,
procedures and the extent to which any facilities shall be turned
over to the Township, including a written approval and agreement
from the Township indicating acceptance of responsibilities as
proposed, shall be incorporated as an integral part of the plan.
(5) The Township may, at the complete discretion of the Board of
Supervisors, accept or not accept an offer by the applicant for
Township ownership of stormwater facilities. If the Township
accepts ownership and maintenance responsibilities for
stormwater facilities, the applicant shall be required by the Board
of Supervisors to fund a dedicated account to fund the first 25 years
of such maintenance. This funding shall be based upon a
reasonable estimate by the Township staff or the Township
Engineer.
(6) Stormwater facilities shall be designed to require minimal
maintenance and shall have suitable access for maintenance.
(7) All storm drainage facilities shall be properly maintained by the
party designated as responsible on the final subdivision plan,
unless the Board of Supervisors agrees to accept a change in the
party responsible or the party owning the facility.
(8) Should a facility not be maintained in proper working order, the
Board of Supervisors may, after due notice to the responsible party,
arrange for the needed maintenance to be accomplished with all
such expenses charged to the responsible party. These expenses
shall be collectible as municipal claims are now collected by law.

minimum provide an easement(s) suitable for the future extension
of sewage lines to serve adjacent properties, unless the developer
shows that such extensions would not be physically possible.
C. Nonpublic central sewage service. Nonpublic central sewage service
shall only be permitted where the applicant proves to the satisfaction of
the Board of Supervisors that all three conditions apply:
(1) There are no other reasonable alternatives.
(2) The service would be consistent with the Township's Sewage
Facilities Plan.
(3) There will be an acceptable system to ensure and fund long-term
professional operations and maintenance.

of a street.
C. In extending lines to new subdivisions and/or land developments within
the Township, each cable operator shall accept from the developer only
those easements which provide nonexclusive rights to operate a cable
system within such subdivision and/or land development. No such
easement shall prevent any other cable operator authorized to operate
within the Township, then or in the future, from using such easement to
extend other and further lines to such subdivision and/or land
development. In each new subdivision and each new land development,
the developer shall, upon notifying public utilities of the opportunity to
serve such subdivision or land development, also notify all cable
operators licensed to operate a cable system in the Township of the

request of any person holding a building moving permit, temporarily
raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of said building. The
expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall
be paid by the person requesting the same, and the cable operator shall
have the authority to require such payment in advance. The cable
operator shall be given not less than 15 days' advance written notice of
any move contemplated to arrange for temporary wire changes.

do not front onto the street right-of-way, evergreen trees
meeting the requirements of this section may be substituted
for deciduous trees.
(6) Spacing. The trees required under this section shall be generally
spaced throughout the development but may be clustered at
locations acceptable to the Shade Tree Commission. If trees are to
be planted on both sides of a street, the trees should be planted so
that the trees alternate and are not lined up exactly with the tree on
the other side of the street.
(7) Location of street trees. The proposed location of street trees shall
be shown on plans and shall be subject to approval of the Board of
§ 165-73 PALMER CODE § 165-73

sidewalk, special consideration shall be given to the species of
trees that are planted.
*NOTE: Unless the Board of Supervisors approves or requires
another location (such as outside of the right-of-way) or
another location is needed to ensure adequate sight distance.
(8) Other requirements. The street trees required under this section
shall be in addition to any trees required under other Township
regulations, including the parking lot landscaping requirements of
the Zoning Ordinance.
(9) Credit for existing trees. If existing healthy street trees are to be
preserved that would, in the determination of the Shade Tree
Commission, generally meet the intent and requirements of this
section, they may serve as a credit towards the number of street
trees required to be planted.

("SALDO") of 1994, as amended, then see the tree preservation
requirements of § 190-164 of the Zoning Ordinance. (The tree
provision provisions in this SALDO and the Zoning Ordinance
are identical, as of 1994.)
§ 165-73 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-73
160:447
(b) If these SALDO provisions apply, then waivers or modifications
may be granted by the Board of Supervisors for just cause
without having to meet requirements for a zoning variance.
(2) The provisions of this Subsection D shall not apply to the following
activities:
(a) Bona fide tree nurseries for replanting, bona fide Christmas
tree farms or commercial orchards.
(b) Forestry, commercial, which is regulated as a distinct land use.
(See § 190-210 of the Zoning Ordinance.)
(c) Cutting of trees on a lot of less than two acres that has a
primarily residential use, after a certificate of occupancy has
been granted.
(d) Cutting of trees of less than six inches diameter. [NOTE:
Except trees that were required to be planted by any Township
ordinance, such as § 165-164E(10) below, shall not be cut down
unless replaced by a closely similar tree.]
(3) Purposes. The purpose is to protect wildlife and bird habitats,
encourage groundwater recharge, avoid thermal pollution,
decrease air pollution, maintain the attractive character of areas,
maintain and increase property values, protect water quality and
conserve energy and, through these purposes, to serve the public
health, safety and general welfare.
(4) Measurement. For the purposes of this section, the "width of trees"
shall be the diameter of the trunk at a height of 4.5 feet above the
average surrounding original ground level.
(5) Tree removal. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to
show that tree cutting or removal will be held to a reasonable
minimum. Except as exempted within Subsection D(1),
Applicability, above, trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or
greater may only be cut down, killed or effectively destroyed if such
trees meet one or more of the following standards:
(a) In addition to other provisions of this section, a maximum of
five trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or more on a lot
may be cut down in a one-year period.
(b) The thinning of woods is specifically permitted, provided that
selective cutting is used instead of clear-cutting, and provided
that a maximum of 15% of trees six inches or more in diameter
in a lot are cut down, and provided that the tree cutting is
clearly intended to promote the healthy development of the
remaining trees.
(c) Trees may be cut down if the applicant proves that it is
necessary to allow reasonable development of the lot as part of
§ 165-73 PALMER CODE § 165-73
160:448
an approved development plan or building permit (after
considering reasonable alternatives, such as adjusting the
location of a building, street or driveway). For example, trees
may be cut down where necessary in the following situations:
[1] The trees would be located within 10 feet of an existing or
proposed uncurbed vehicle cartway or stormwater
detention basin or paved area or streetlight or fire
hydrant.
[2] The trees would be located within three feet of an existing
or proposed vehicular cartway, parking area, vehicle
shoulder, utility corridor, sidewalk or driveway.
[3] The trees would be located within 25 feet of a proposed onsite
sewage system or the structural walls of the new or
expanded structure.
[4] The trees would be located within the area of proposed use
that needs to be kept open, such as the fairway of a golf
course.
[5] The locations of the trees would be affected by
unavoidable significant grade changes.
[6] The trees would be an unresolvable hazard to a public
utility.
(d) Trees may be cut down if they are clearly a hazard to the public
safety, such as being a sight distance hazard, an obstruction to
a traffic signal or stop sign or a danger to existing buildings.
(e) Trees may be cut down if they are dead, mostly dead or clearly
not healthy, such as trees that are diseased, unresolvably pestinfected
or clearly near the extreme end of their life span.
(f) Trees may be cut down if the majority of their root system
would need to be destroyed or the root system would need to
be covered by paving or significant grade changes.
(6) Protection of trees during construction.
(a) Reasonable efforts shall be taken during any construction to
ensure that trees protected by this section are not intentionally
or accidentally injured or effectively destroyed, including root
compaction by equipment and materials, mechanical damage
or change in grade level.
(b) Within buffer areas. See § 190-194D of the Zoning Ordinance.
(c) A tree protection area shall be designated on development
plans. This area to be protected shall include the outer limits of
land areas (the dripline) under the branches of trees.
§ 165-73 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-73
160:449
(d) Fencing. The tree protection area shall be separated from all
construction, storage and vehicle areas by a substantial
temporary fence with a minimum four-foot height. Such fence
may include snow fencing or wood planks or strong wires or
ropes attached to metal posts or a similar secure method. The
fence shall be kept in good repair. Such fence shall be removed
only after completion of the work. Trees that are to be removed
may also be used as a temporary buffer to protect trees to be
preserved.
(e) The following shall not occur within the defined tree protection
area:
[1] Paving (other than sidewalks*). (*NOTE: Where practical,
sidewalks should but are not required to curve around
and/or be placed as far from the trunk as possible or be
placed outside of the dripline of a tree. )
[2] Storage of building materials, equipment, debris or fill.
[3] Movement of motorized vehicles or equipment.
[4] Grade changes or unnecessary compaction of soil.
(f) If vehicles will need to cross through areas of trees, a defined,
fenced path shall be established. The tree protection area
should be noted with prominent signs, such as "Tree Protection
Area - Please Keep Out." Such fences and signs shall be
removed upon completion of the work.
(g) Root and limb protection. The cutting of root systems of trees
to be protected shall be minimized. When activity must occur
under the dripline of a tree to be protected, tunneling is
recommended instead of trenching. Limbs should be trimmed
or tied back if likely to be damaged during construction.
(h) A concrete washout area shall not be located in close proximity
to the tree protection area.
(i) Layout. Buildings and other features of a development shall be
laid out to maximize the preservation of healthy mature trees.
For example, building and paving areas should be designed so
that trees are located within islands of sufficient size.
(j) Replacement of trees.
[1] If tree(s) that were required by the Township to be
protected and preserved are killed, removed or otherwise
destroyed, then the Township shall require the applicant
or developer to replace such tree(s) with approved species
of trees with a minimum trunk diameter of four inches
measured at one foot above the average grade level.
§ 165-73 PALMER CODE § 165-73
160:450
§ 165-74. Monuments and lot pins.
§ 165-75. Curbs.
[a] One such tree shall be planted for each tree
destroyed.
[b] These replacement trees shall be in addition to any
trees required by other provisions of this ordinance.
[2] This replacement provision shall not limit the Township's
ability to also seek fines or other enforcement actions and
remedies under this ordinance or the Zoning Ordinance.
(7) If the Township Shade Tree Commission should ever become
inactive, then any responsibilities stated for such Commission in
the Zoning Ordinance or Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance shall be assumed by the Planning Commission.
E. Natural and historic feature preservation. Substantial and sensitive
natural features and historic structures and important archaeological
sites worthy of protection, as determined by the Board of Supervisors
upon the advice of the Planning Commission, shall be respected,
incorporated into and protected in any subdivision or land
development. These features include but are not limited to natural
drainage channels, waterways and falls, large trees or groves, highly
scenic views and important community landmarks.
A. Monuments.
(1) Location. Permanent reference monuments shall be located at each
intersection of street center lines of street(s) constructed by the
developer, at the beginning and ending of all street curves and at
exterior corners of the subdivision. With the approval of the
Township Engineer, the subdivider may install monuments on only
one side of the street, provided that enough monuments are set to
permit a surveyor to stake out accurately any building lot shown on
the record plan.
(2) Type. Reference monuments shall be constructed of steelreinforced
portland cement concrete or other material approved by
the Township Engineer.
(3) Placement. Reference monuments shall be placed so that the top of
the monument is as shown in the accompanying sketch.
B. Lot pins. All lot corner markers shall be permanently located and shall
be at least a three-fourths-inch metal pin or pipe with a minimum length
of 20 inches, located in the ground to existing grade.
A. Curbs shall be provided along both sides of all public streets and all
private streets.
§ 165-73 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-75

B. Waiver. Curbs may be waived by the Board of Supervisors along singlefamily
detached residential lots that have a lot area of greater than two
acres or clearly agricultural lots that have a lot area of greater than two
acres.
C. If curbs are waived, appropriate stabilized drainage channels designed
to handle a twenty-five-year storm shall be required along all streets,
within the street right-of-way or drainage easements.
D. Rolled curbs are not permitted.
E. All required curbs shall meet Township specifications.
A. Any land development or subdivision that will involve the disturbance of
more than 5,000 square feet of earth, or as otherwise provided under
state regulations, shall be required to submit to the County
Conservation District and the Plans Administrator an erosion and
sedimentation control plan that shows how the project will comply with
applicable DER erosion and sedimentation control regulations. (See
Title 25, Chapter 102, as amended.) These DER regulations are hereby
made a part of this ordinance by reference. Any violation of such
regulations or any violation of an approved erosion and sedimentation
control plan shall also be a violation of this ordinance.
B. Compliance with the submitted erosion and sedimentation control plan
(and any revisions officially filed with the Township) shall automatically
be a condition of any final plan approval and any building permit.
C. The County Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, or its successor
publications, shall be used as a resource in soil protection planning and
in the review of such plans.
D. The landowner, developer and builder shall all be responsible for
carrying out the requirements of the erosion and sedimentation control
plan during earthmoving activities.
E. All areas of the subdivision shall be stabilized by seeding or planting.

ARTICLE XII
Sinkhole/Carbonate Regulations
[Added 7-21-2003 by Ord. No. 2003-339]
§ 165-82. Purpose.
Palmer Township's topography may be defined as a karst topography due
to the presence of carbonate rock that generally consists of dolomite and
limestone. The limestone and dolomite are divided into formations. The
carbonate formations present in Palmer Township consist of Epler,
Rickenbach, Allentown, Jacksonburg and Leithsville Formations. These
formations are susceptible to the development of solution cavities and
sinkhole development. Therefore, anyone considering developing property
within the Township should be aware of the potential geological hazards.
The regulations contained herein are intended to minimize the risk of
sinkhole occurrence in areas of new development and on lands adjacent to
these developments.
§ 165-83. Governance.
The regulations established by this ordinance shall apply to all land
development or subdivision applications pertaining to commercial,
governmental (except those owned by Palmer Township) and industrial/
office structures, apartment complexes and multiple single-family home
developments with three or more lots.
§ 165-84. Exemptions.
All single-family homes and the alteration of single-family homes to include
detached structures such as garages, barns and swimming pools shall be
exempt from the regulations established in this article.
§ 165-85. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CARBONATE ROCK  Rock types that are affected by dissolution
weathering process caused by slightly acidic groundwater. The most
common types of rock that are categorized as carbonate rock are limestone
(calcium carbonate) and dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate).
CAVERN  Interconnected solution features within the bedrock surface.
CLAY LINER  Fine-grained soil that is used in the construction of a liner
that limits the rate of surface water intrusion into the subsurface.
CLOSED DEPRESSION  A bowl-shaped depression in the land surface
characterized by internal drainage. A ghost lake is a closed depression
which has visible standing water after a heavy rainfall event.
FAULT  A fracture in bedrock along which movement has taken place.
§ 165-82 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-85
160:457
FINE GRAINED SOIL  Materials that predominantly consist of silt and
clay size particles.
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (CHEMICAL OR BIOHAZARD)  As defined and
regulated by the PADEP or EPA.
IMPERMEABLE LINERS  A liner system that prohibits the infiltration of
surface water into the subsurface.
KARST  The terrain that results from the dissolution of carbonate rock.
KARST PROCESS  The dissolution of carbonate rock by slightly acidic
groundwater. Dissolution weathering, the removal of soluble materials from
intact carbonate rock by slightly acidic groundwater.
LINEAMENTS  Aligned topographic features that locate faults and
fractures.
RESIDUAL SOIL  Soils derived from the in-place weathering of the
underlying bedrock.
SINKHOLE  Localized land surface subsidence or collapse due to karst
processes. Sinkholes are categorized as solution sinkholes, collapse
sinkholes and subsidence sinkholes.
SPRING  Where water flows naturally out of the bedrock or the overlying
soil mantle on to the land surface.
TOXIC AND/OR BIOLOGICAL OR CHEMICAL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 
Biological species or chemical compounds which are deemed to be toxic or
hazardous by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
§ 165-86. Specific regulations.
A. All of the following specific requirements shall apply to land
developments and/or subdivisions covered by this article:
(1) No buildings, structures or stormwater management basin shall be
placed in or over the following features if unremediated in
accordance with the terms of this ordinance: sinkholes, closed
depressions, lineaments, or faults.
(2) Building structures and stormwater management basins shall be
located no closer than 100 feet from the rim of unremediated
sinkholes, and no closer than 50 feet from lineaments, faults, or
closed depressions.
(3) Outflow from a stormwater management basin and/or postdevelopment
stormwater flows shall not be directed to any of the
following carbonate features: sinkholes, closed depressions,
lineaments, or caverns.

Ordinance assessment report, as required by the ordinance, has been
supplied to the Planning Commission and the Township Engineer for
their review and comment.
A. All land developments and/or subdivisions covered by this article shall
be evaluated by a licensed professional civil engineer with expertise in
geotechnical engineering or a licensed professional geologist; each of
said experts being licensed in their field of expertise by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A list of the engineer's/geologist's
qualifications shall be submitted to the Township prior to the
commencement of the site's evaluation. The Township reserves the
right to reject any report that in its opinion was authored by an
individual or firm which does not possess the background to properly
assess the site conditions as they relate to this ordinance. Further, the
Carbonate Ordinance assessment report submitted to the Township
must be signed by the licensed professional civil engineer with
expertise in geotechnical engineering and/or a licensed professional
geologist.
B. The format and content of the Carbonate Ordinance assessment report
shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Statement of purpose. This section shall indicate those specific
Carbonate Ordinance standards being addressed in the report and
whether the applicant is attempting to demonstrate compliance or
justify noncompliance with those specific Carbonate Ordinance
standards.
(2) Description of existing conditions. This section shall present a
description of existing characteristics of the property with respect
to geology, topography, ground and surface water hydrology, soils,
vegetation, and existing improvements and uses of property.
§ 165-86 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-87
160:459
(3) A map, at a scale no smaller than one inch = 100 feet and a contour
interval of two feet, indicating the location of the property and all
proposed improvements.
(4) The developer/applicant shall submit information for the affected
properties, indicating the presence of any of the following
carbonate features: depressions, fissures, lineaments, faults, ghost
lakes, bedrock outcrops, sinkholes, seasonal high water levels, soil
mottling, springs, surface drainage entering the ground,
disappearing lakes or streams and caverns.
(5) A recommended plan for the repair or remediation of surface or
subsurface features that may impact the proposed development as
well as the adjacent improved or unimproved properties.
(6) The information requested above shall be based upon previously
published data and field surveys which may include test borings,
excavation of test pits, air-track probes, and geophysical methods.
C. In addition to the Carbonate Ordinance assessment report, the
developer shall also be required to provide the following information:
(1) A plan indicating the existing and proposed drainage conditions,
locations of all proposed private and public sewage disposal
systems, and the location of existing private and public water
supplies on adjoining properties (within 1,000 feet of applicant
property).
(2) Type, location and phasing of proposed site disturbance and
construction, as well as proposed future ownership, utilization and
maintenance of the property and the proposed improvements.
(3) Proposed measures to control potential adverse environmental
impacts on groundwater quality and stormwater management
resulting from the development and utilization of the property.
(4) Plans describing the design and construction of the proposed
stormwater management facilities proposed for the project. A
description of the minimum requirements are outlined below.
D. Stormwater management.
(1) All submissions for proposed developments must include a
stormwater management plan prepared in accordance with
adopted regulations and which limits surface water runoff and the
intrusion of concentrated flow of surface water into the subsurface.
Facilities that are required as part of the stormwater management
plan include the collection of all runoff from commercial, office and
industrial building roofs into storm drains by watertight gasketed
joint conduits or adequately lined drainage swales and the
collection of surface water flow on pavements into drop inlets
connected to a watertight gasketed joint stormwater conduit or
§ 165-87 PALMER CODE § 165-87
160:460
§ 165-88. Review process.
adequate lined drainage swales. The stormwater conduit must
discharge into lined detention basins.
(2) Approved stormwater conduits include HDPE, PVC, concrete, steel
and cast-iron pipe all with watertight rubber gaskets at each joint.
The use of corrugated metal pipe is not permitted. Construction of
the piping system must follow all other applicable ordinances.
Where rock is encountered at or above the planned conduit design
grade, the rock shall be undercut and over-excavated a minimum of
one foot and backfilled with a compacted fine-grained soil.
(3) All detention basins in areas of sinkhole-prone soil shall be lined.
The liner used in a detention basin may consist of a clay liner, a
composite synthetic and soil liner or a synthetic liner. The type of
liner required shall depend on the condition of the detention basin
bottom and the probability of sinkhole occurrence resulting from
the construction of the detention basin. The use of low-flow channel
may also be required, depending on the duration and frequency of
stormwater discharge into the detention basin. Subsurface
detention systems must be in leakproof tanks or piping which
follows the same standards as in Subsection D(2). The Township's
Geotechnical Engineer shall make the final determination as to
what is an acceptable form of liner for the proposed detention
basins.
(4) Additional items that must be included in the stormwater
management plan include details with regard to the sealing of all
pavement curbs and gutters, manholes and drop inlets.
A. The Carbonate Ordinance assessment report must be received by the
Township when a plan is submitted for preliminary land development or
subdivision approval. However, the report may be submitted at the time
of sketch plan review. Four copies of the report shall be submitted to
the Township. The report shall be reviewed by the Township
Geotechnical Engineer and other consultants as designated by the
Township. Based on this review the Township may require additional
information to be submitted if the Township concludes that such
information would be instrumental in assessing the proposed
development as it relates to the Carbonate Ordinance.
B. Approvals required.
(1) Where compliance with this section is required as part of an
application for subdivision or land development approval, the
Township's decision on whether compliance has been achieved
shall be made as part of its review of the subdivision or land
development application.
§ 165-87 STREET AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION § 165-88
160:461
§ 165-89. Limitations.
In carbonate areas, alteration and development of land may be hazardous
with respect to foundation safety of structures, the creation of unstable
land as a result of changes in drainage, and the contamination of ground
and surface waters. Within the limitations of the information available
at the time of the review of individual applications, the Township shall
attempt to make reasonable judgments as to the applicant's compliance
with the Carbonate Ordinance. Under no circumstances shall the Township
of Palmer or any officer or employee of the Township or consultant to
the Township assume any liability for any damages that may result from
an applicant's or any interested party's reliance upon the regulations of
the Carbonate Ordinance or any decisions made by the Township in the
administration of such regulations by an applicant, developer, and/or any
interested party.
(2) Where the application is part of a request for a zoning permit, the
Zoning Officer shall issue no permit until he/she receives adequate
written substantiation from the appropriate designated experts
referred to above that the terms of this section and any conditions
imposed upon the use of the property at the time of subdivision or
land development approval are satisfied.

year based upon estimated gross business volume for the tax year computed
from prior years or other methods according to § 173-4 of this chapter.
§ 173-4. Business volume computation.
§ 173-5. Exemptions.
A. Every person subject to the tax who commenced his business on or
before January 1 of the calendar year preceding the tax year shall
compute his annual estimated gross volume of business for the tax year
upon the actual gross amount of business transacted by him during
such prior year.
B. Every person subject to the tax who commenced his business after
January 1 and in the calendar year preceding the tax year shall compute
his estimated annual gross volume of business for the tax year upon the
gross volume of business transacted by him during such preceding
calendar year by taking the monthly average during the period and
multiplying the same by 12.
C. Every person subject to the tax who commenced his business after the
beginning of a tax year, if there are less than three months from the
commencement of his business to the end of the tax year, shall compute
his annual gross volume of business upon the actual gross amount of
business transacted by him during the tax year. If there are more than
three months from the commencement of his business to the end of the
tax year, he shall compute his estimated gross volume of business for
such tax year upon the gross volume of business transacted by him
during the period from the commencement of his business to the end of
the tax year, taking the monthly average during the first three months
of business and multiplying the same by the number of months from the
commencement of business to the end of the tax year.
D. Persons subject to the payment of the tax who are engaged in a
business which is temporary, seasonal or itinerant by nature shall
compute the estimated gross amount of business to be transacted
within the Township by a method to be determined by the collection
officer.
E. The collection officer is hereby authorized to accept payment under
protest of the tax where the taxpayer disputes the validity or amount of
the tax. If it is thereafter judicially determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the tax has been overpaid, the amount of the
overpayment shall be refunded to the taxpayer.
A. Persons employed for a wage or salary, nonprofit corporations or
associations organized for religious, charitable or educational
purposes, agencies of the government of the United States or of the

§ 173-3 PALMER CODE § 173-5
160:466
§ 173-6. Deductions.
The gross volume of business upon which the tax is computed shall include
the gross consideration credited or received for or on account of sales made
or services rendered, or both, subject only to the following deductions:
B. State tax or license fee. The fact that a taxpayer receives a certificate or
other document which is designated as a "license" from the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or from some other state for which the
taxpayer pays a sum of money does not exempt the taxpayer from this
business privilege tax. Even though the charge is labeled a "license
fee," it cannot be regarded as such if it is nominal in amount and not
equated to the probable cost of supervision or regulation of the
licensee's activities. Flat annual fees, fees which are not related to
gross income or amount of production or fees that are nominal in nature
are not considered true license fees, and hence, payment of such fees
will not exempt the taxpayer from this business privilege tax.
[Amended 11-27-1990 by Ord. No. 238138]
C. Any person or company whose rates of service are fixed and regulated
by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on any public utility
service rendered by any such person or company or any privilege or
transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service is
exempt from the tax.
D. The privilege of employing such tangible property as is subject to a
state tax, except on sales of admission to places of amusement or sales
or other transfers of title or possession of property, is exempt from the
tax.
E. Goods, articles and products or byproducts of manufacture, or
minerals, timber, natural resources and farm products manufactured,
produced or grown in the Township, or the preparation or processing
thereof for use or market, or any privilege, act or transaction related to
the business of manufacturing, the production, preparation or
processing of minerals, timber and natural resources or farm products,
by manufacturers, producers and farmers with respect to the goods,
articles and products of their own manufacture, production or growth,
or any privilege, act or transaction relating to the business of
processing byproducts of manufacture or the transportation, loading,
unloading, dumping or storage of such goods, articles, products or
byproducts are exempt from the tax.
A. Gross moneys derived from the resale of goods, wares and merchandise
taken as trade-in or as part payment for other goods, wares and
merchandise to the extent that the resale price does not exceed the
trade-in allowance.
138. Editor's Note: Section 5 of this ordinance provided that it go into effect 30 days after its

Where the gross or whole volume of business in its entirety cannot be
subjected to the tax imposed by this ordinance by reason of the provisions
of the Constitution of the United States or any other provision of law, the
collection officer shall establish rules and methods of allocation so that
only that part of the gross volume of business which is taxable shall be
taxed. If any person is liable for the same tax on the same subject imposed
under the Local Tax Enabling Act to the Township and one or more political
subdivisions of the state, the tax shall be apportioned by such percentage as
may be agreed upon by such political subdivisions, but the combined taxes
of both subdivisions shall not exceed the maximum rate of tax.

B. Refunds, credits or allowances given on account of defects in goods,
wares or merchandise sold, or on account of goods, wares or
merchandise returned.

of a purchase or sales contract initiated, executed or cleared with such
other person.
D. Bad debts, where the deduction is also taken in the same year for
federal income taxation purposes.
E. Taxes collected as agent for the United States of America,
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or Township of Palmer.

A. The local services tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for
each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions

calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax
exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the
person of earned income within that political subdivision in an amount
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person as follows:
(1) If a person who claimed an exemption from the local services tax
for a given calendar year becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder
of that calendar year.
(2) The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll
period after receipt of the notification under the above subsection,
a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld
from the person due to the exemption certificate filed by the
person, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first payroll
period.
(3) The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining
payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount
withheld for other employees.
(4) In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of
the local services tax under this exception is severed in that
calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision levying the tax may
pursue collection under this act.
(5) Employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
(6) Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a
minimum of three years. Employers who have failed to withhold the
local services tax from an employee or employees, and do not have
copies of the employee exemption certificate or certificates, will be
held responsible for the payment of the local services tax as if the
tax had been originally levied against the employer.

system.

The Township Board of Supervisors may contract with the Blue Mountain
Consolidated Water Company or any other company for the supply of water
into said water supply system upon such reasonable terms and conditions

ordinance. Such revolving fund may also be begun by the issuance of a
general obligation bond in the nature of a note of said Township.
§ 184-6. Water use rates.

penalty of 5% shall be charged upon all bills for water use which are unpaid
for 30 or more days, and, after notice, the water supply may be shut off to
all premises for which municipal water bills are more than a total of 60 days
delinquent. In addition, municipal liens may be filed for unpaid bills.
§ 184-7. Connection.
All property owners abutting said water supply system shall, within 90 days
after notice by personal service or registered or certified mail from the

those industries and farms not using water for human consumption which
are exempt by law from such connection. In case any owner shall, after
due notice, refuse or fail to connect to such system within said ninety-day
period, such owner shall be in violation of this ordinance, and in addition,
the Township Board of Supervisors, through its agents, may enter upon
said property and construct said connection and send an itemized bill,
which shall be payable forthwith with interest, to such property owners. In
addition, a municipal lien may be duly filed for such construction costs and
collected as provided by law.

terms of this ordinance, or convert water from said system without
paying therefor, or tamper with or abuse or deface any part of the
system without right or duty, shall, upon conviction in a summary
proceeding before any District Magistrate, Alderman or Justice of the
Peace, be sentenced to a fine of not less than $10 nor more than $600 or

ARTICLE IV
RA Rural Agricultural District
§ 190-20. Purpose.
This district is intended to encourage the preservation of agricultural
activities and to avoid sprawled and inefficient development. It also
recognizes the problems of high water table soils and sinkholes throughout
much of this district. This district also recognizes that most of this area
is unlikely to be served by central water and sewer facilities in the near
future. As stated in the Township Comprehensive Plan, in the future, it may
become reasonable to extend public utilities into this area and encourage
light industrial uses, once areas currently zoned for intense uses become
mostly developed. For this reason also, large lot sizes are necessary for
residential uses to buffer against any future industrial uses.
§ 190-21. Permitted by right uses.
The following uses are permitted by right in the RA District, provided that
all other requirements of this ordinance are met:
A. Single-family detached dwelling.
B. Individual mobile/manufactured home.*
C. Crop farming and orchard.
D. Raising of livestock.*
E. Nonhousehold stable, horse barn, riding academy or kennel.*
F. Horticultural use related to the raising, propagating and selling of
trees, shrubs, flowers and other vegetative material, and including
greenhouses and nurseries, but not including commercial forestry.
G. Campground, limited to tent sites.
H. Household swimming pool**, golf course or private picnic grove.***
I. Place of worship.*
J. Publicly-owned park, playground and other Township-owned use.
K. Membership club.
L. Nature preserve.*
M. Emergency services station.*
N. Nonhousehold swimming pool.*
O. Conversion of a nonresidential structure to a single-family residential
use, within the lot area and bulk requirements of this district.*
P. Commercial and noncommercial crop storage.*

the buildable area of the tract.
- _______ acres
____________________
(h) Equals the "buildable area of the tract."
= _______ acres
(i) To determine the maximum total permitted number of new and
existing townhouse or low-rise (garden) apartment dwelling
units permitted within the tract, multiply the buildable area of
the tract by the following:
[1] Low-rise (garden) apartment density: nine dwelling units
per acre of buildable area of the tract.
= _________
permitted dwelling units
[2] Townhouse density: six dwelling units per acre of buildable
area of the tract
= _________
permitted dwelling units
(2) Flexibility in placement. The total number of dwelling units allowed
on the tract may be placed at any appropriate locations within the
buildable area of the tract within the setback and other provisions
of this ordinance. However, no single acre of land shall include
more than 12 dwelling units, once streets and dedicated common
open space are deleted from the lot area.
(3) In calculating the allowable overall density, land which is capable of
further development or subdivision for additional dwellings shall
§ 190-54 PALMER CODE § 190-54
186:648
not be counted unless the possibility of such development or
subdivision is precluded by one of the following methods:
(a) Deed restriction or agreement in form acceptable to the
Township Solicitor and duly recorded in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Northampton County.
(b) Transfer of development rights to the Township.
(c) Dedication for public purposes or permanent open space to
serve the development.
(4) Condominiums and lots. The division of land into individual lots is
not required. This allows the development of condominium garden
apartments and townhouses. However, any condominium
development or conversion to condominium ownership shall follow
the requirements and processes of the Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.
(5) Condominiums and streets. In any development of or conversion to
condominiums, the Township shall reserve the right to require all
roads and major driveways to be constructed or improved to
Township standards and dedicated to the Township. The
responsibility of maintaining interior roads and major driveways
should not be given to a homeowner association, unless there are
adequate safeguards.
F. Maximum height. Maximum building height shall be 35 feet or 2.5
stories, whichever is more restrictive, except that as a conditional use
the Board of Supervisors may allow up to 3.5 stories or 48 feet for lowrise/
garden apartments to allow excellence in architectural design or to
make an allowance for unusual topography. Pitched roofs with a slope
of five inches vertical for every 12 inches horizontal or greater and
variations in rooflines of structures are strongly encouraged for the
purpose of variety. [Amended 12-29-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-389]
G. Buffer yard. A buffer yard with screening shall be required, as
described in § 190-194D, between any townhouse or low-rise apartment
principal building and any abutting existing single-family detached
dwelling that would be within 120 feet of a low-rise apartment or
townhouse building. The buffer yard shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the townhouses or low-rise apartments.
H. Accessory uses and structures.
(1) The accessory use provisions of §§ 190-52 and 190-211 shall apply.
(2) The intent is to carefully avoid incompatible structures in a high
density environment.
(3) Garages or carports for the storage of private automobiles are a
permitted by right accessory use, provided that such structures are
architecturally compatible with the principal buildings.
§ 190-54 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-54
186:649
(4) The developer shall state whether any deed restrictions or similar
restrictions will be established to control the design of any
detached accessory buildings and fences. Such controls are
strongly encouraged.
(5) Accessory structures may be placed a minimum of one foot from
the lot line along which dwellings are attached. Fences may be
located on a lot line.
I. Homeowners' and/or condominium agreements. If any dwelling units
are to be sold under homeowners' and/or condominium agreements,
such agreements or documents shall be reviewed by the Township
Solicitor and approved by the Board of Supervisors prior to recording
and filed with the subdivision or land development plan. It is strongly
recommended that any such agreements include restrictions requiring
any fencing or garages to be compatible with the overall design.
J. Maximum impervious coverage shall be 70%, based upon the entire
tract. For the purpose of this section, active recreational facilities such
as tennis or basketball courts shall not be limited by the maximum
impervious coverage regulation. However, such areas shall still be
considered impervious for the purposes of managing stormwater runoff.
K. Maximum length of building. The maximum length of a townhouse or
low-rise apartment building shall be 160 feet, with no more than four
dwelling units attached. As used in this section, "building length"
means the horizontal measurement of any building length from any one
end to any other end, without regard to offsets but without including
diagonal measurements. As a conditional use, upon review by the
Planning Commission and approval by the Board of Supervisors, the
maximum length of the building may be extended to accommodate up to
eight units attached, provided the applicant demonstrates excellence in
design. At a minimum, factors to be incorporated into design include
articulation in roofline and pitch, the use of dormers or other similar
features, and alternating facade materials (e.g., stone, brick, and
wood). Also, a minimum of 50% of all dwellings shall have a front
entrance articulated with a covered porch entry. The size of the front
porch shall be a minimum of five feet deep from the front wall of the
dwelling to the enclosing porch rail and ten feet long. The applicant
may provide an alternative design as part of the conditional use
application that meets the intent of this standard. [Amended
2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
L. Changes in facade. No more than two adjacent townhouses in any
townhouse building shall have the same front wall plane. The minimum
variation or offset of the front wall plane shall be two feet. A visual
structural break in the roofline or front facade shall be provided
between every two townhouse units. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord.
No. 282; 12-29-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-389]
§ 190-54 PALMER CODE § 190-54
186:650
M. External property line building setback. Townhouse and low-rise
apartment buildings and their permitted accessory structures shall be
setback from all exterior lot lines of a tract a minimum distance of 30
feet, except a minimum distance of 80 feet shall be required from the lot
line of an existing single-family detached dwelling.
N. Building setback from public or private streets. All principal and
accessory buildings and carports of townhouse and low-rise apartment
buildings shall have a minimum of 10 feet setback from the street rightof-
way line of proposed and existing streets where parking is located to
the rear or side of the principal structure. Where parking is proposed to
be located to the front of the principal building, the front yard setback
shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the street right-of-way line of
proposed and existing streets. If right-of-way is not established for a
street, then setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the cartway.
[Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
O. Minimum width of townhouses. Each townhouse dwelling unit shall
have a minimum width of 20 feet, except that a minimum width of 26
feet shall apply if garage doors for two or more vehicles open onto the
front of a townhouse.
P. Minimum private area. For each townhouse, there shall be a yard
immediately adjacent to the front and back of the unit and including the
side for end units. Each dwelling shall be provided an area of not less
than 200 square feet for the exclusive use of the occupants of that
dwelling. Within the yard area described above, a balcony, patio, porch,
deck or other similar outdoor area shall be provided for each dwelling.
If a development is subdivided into lots, the same private area
requirement shall apply in determining the minimum size of the lot;
however, the minimum lot area shall not be less than 3,000 square feet.
Design measures shall be used to seek an appropriate level of privacy in
any rear yards. Such measures might include landscaped screening,
compatible fencing and earth berming. The intent is to avoid the
placement of incompatible fencing by individual lot owners in the
future. If a townhouse includes an individual fee-simple lot of over
1,200 square feet, then such private area is not required to be
specifically designated on plans. Apartments shall provide a terrace,
recessed inside the exterior building wall of the dwelling, for units
above the first level. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
Q. Minimum recreation and open space land. See Article X of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
R. Open space maintenance. See Article X of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
S. Private streets. All interior streets and accessways serving more than
five dwelling units but not including parking courts shall be built to
Township construction standards for public streets, regardless of
whether the streets or accessways will be dedicated to the Township.
§ 190-54 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-54
186:651
However, the Board of Supervisors may allow widths of a cartway and
a right-of-way of any private street or accessway to be narrower than
is required for a public street, provided that a private street providing
direct or indirect access to 20 or more dwellings shall have a minimum
width of 24 feet and garages, carports or parking areas are located to
the side or rear of the principal structure. [Amended 2-15-2000 by
Ord. No. 282]
T. Architectural renderings required. Preliminary architectural
renderings shall be required of the front facades of any low-rise
apartment or townhouse development of more than 10 units.
[Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
U. Preservation of natural buffers. See § 190-194D(3)(c).
V. Architectural variety. A variety of complimentary designs are
encouraged among clusters of buildings within larger developments.
Extreme changes of facades among attached townhouse units are
discouraged.
W. Garages. Any townhouses shall be designed so that garages and/or
carports are not an overly prominent part of the view from public
streets. For this reason, parking courts and combined garage or carport
structures are encouraged instead of individual garages, especially for
narrow townhouse units. If garages are provided, they should be
located to the rear of the structures, with a common driveway system,
provided that adequate provision is made for maintenance through a
homeowners' association. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282;
12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
X. Mailboxes. Due to the density and compact design of apartment and
townhouse developments, mailboxes should be located either on the
facade of the dwelling unit (where permitted by the United States
Postal Service) or within a common kiosk or enclosed structure.
Individual freestanding mailboxes at the curbside are discouraged.
[Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
Y. Trash bins. Common trash receptacles shall be provided in locations
that are convenient for residents and for collection. Trash dumpsters
and similar facilities shall he completely enclosed within a decorative
masonry or wood fence, at least six feet in height, on three sides,
maintaining 100% visual blockage on three sides and a self-closing gate
on the fourth side. These areas shall be screened from view of streets
and dwellings. [Amended 2-15-2000 by Ord. No. 282]
Z. Access. Vehicular access points onto all minor arterial and collector
streets shall be minimized to the lowest number possible.
AA. Visitor/overflow parking areas. [Added 2-15-2000 by Ord. No.
282198]
§ 190-54 PALMER CODE § 190-54
186:652
(1) Design. Off-street parking area(s) shall be provided at a rate of 0.25
space per dwelling unit. The off-street parking area(s) shall be
provided in addition to the minimum off-street parking spaces
required for each individual dwelling unit. The visitor/overflow
parking areas shall be located not greater than 300 feet from any
given dwelling. Off-street parking areas shall not be located
between the public street and the principal building. Such parking
areas shall be located to the side or rear of the principal structure
and in pods of not more than 20 spaces. Each parking area shall be
screened from view from the public right-of-way with a four-foot
decorative masonry fence or evergreen hedgerow, or a combination
of both. The parking areas shall contain internal landscaping. At a
minimum, terminal islands shall be installed at both ends of a
single unbroken row of parking. Terminal islands shall be a
minimum of 15 feet in length and minimum of 10 feet in width.
Each terminal island shall be landscaped with a minimum of one
shade tree, and grass or a vegetative ground cover. In addition, a
landscaped divider strip shall be provided to connect the terminal
islands. The divider strip shall be a minimum of seven feet in width
and be planted with a minimum of one shade tree every 30 feet on
center and grass or a vegetative ground cover. These areas shall
not be used to meet the standard parking requirements.
(2) Use. Boats, campers, trailers and other recreational vehicles shall
be prohibited from said parking areas.
BB. Setback from industrial zoning districts. All buildings including one or
more dwelling units shall have a minimum setback of 100 feet from the
boundary of any HI, LI, PIC or PO/IP District boundary. If a public street
is the zoning boundary, such setback shall be measured from the center
line of the street. [Amended 11-13-1995 by Ord. No. 261;
12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311; 1-29-2013 by Ord. No.
2013-420]
(1) In the case of a conditional use application for a traditional village
(pursuant to § 190-224 et seq.), the Board of Supervisors may
consider allowing, as an additional conditional use, the minimum
setback to be reduced to 50 feet, provided that a minimum fortyfoot-
wide buffer yard with screening, as described in § 190-194D,
shall be required between any newly developed townhouse, lowrise/
garden apartment and/or mid-rise apartment principal use and
any abutting industrial zoning district or existing principal
industrial use.

shall only be deleted once. All land areas shall be stated in
hundredths of an acre. [Amended 1-29-2013 by Ord. No.
2013-420]
(a) The total lot area of all lots within the tract, not including
existing rights-of-way of existing public streets.
= _______ acres
(b) Delete future rights-of-way abutting existing public streets that
are required to be dedicated.
§ 190-58.7 PALMER CODE § 190-58.8
186:662
- _______ acres
Areas voluntarily dedicated for an improvement to a public
street that are not required by PennDOT or the Township
but that the Board of Supervisors determines will serve a
substantial public need are not required to be deleted from
the buildable area of the tract.
Rights-of-way of proposed streets are not required to be

rights-of-way or easements, such as overhead electric
transmission rights-of-way, existing stormwater management
facilities and/or drainage swales. Existing underground utility
and drainage easements are not required to be deleted from
the buildable area of the tract.
- _______ acres
____________________
(h) Equals the "buildable area of the tract."
= _______ acres
(i) To determine the maximum total permitted number of new and
existing dwelling units permitted within the tract, multiply the
buildable area of the tract by the following:
§ 190-58.8 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-58.8
186:663
[1] Townhouse density: six dwelling units per acre of buildable
area of the tract.
= _________
permitted dwelling units
(2) Flexibility in placement. The total number of dwelling units allowed
on the tract may be placed at any appropriate locations within the
buildable area of the tract within the setback and other provisions
of this ordinance. However, no single acre of land shall include
more than 12 dwelling units, once streets and dedicated common
open space are deleted from the lot area.
(3) In calculating the allowable overall density, land which is capable of
further development or subdivision for additional dwellings shall
not be counted unless the possibility of such development or
subdivision is precluded by one of the following methods:
(a) Deed restriction or agreement in form acceptable to the
Township Solicitor and duly recorded in the Office of the
Recorder of Deeds of Northampton County.
(b) Transfer of development rights to the Township.
(c) Dedication for public purposes or permanent open space to
serve the development.
(4) Condominiums and lots. The division of land into individual lots is
not required. This allows the development of condominium
townhouses. However, any condominium development or
conversion to condominium ownership shall follow the
requirements and processes of the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.202
(5) Condominiums and streets. In any development of or conversion to
condominiums, the Township shall reserve the right to require all
roads and major driveways to be constructed or improved to
Township standards and dedicated to the Township. The
responsibility of maintaining interior roads and major driveways
should not be given to a homeowner association, unless there are
adequate safeguards.
E. Maximum height: 35 feet or 2.5 stories, whichever is more restrictive,
except that as a conditional use the Board of Supervisors may allow up
to 3.5 stories or 45 feet to allow excellence in architectural design.
F. Buffer yard. A buffer yard with screening shall be required, as
described in § 190-194D, between any townhouse building and any
abutting existing single-family detached dwelling that would be within
202. Editor's Note: See Ch. 165, Subdivision and Land Development.
§ 190-58.8 PALMER CODE § 190-58.8
186:664
120 feet of a townhouse building. The buffer yard shall be the
responsibility of the developer of the townhouses.
G. Accessory uses and structures.
(1) The accessory use provisions of § 190-52 and § 190-211 shall apply.
(2) The intent is to carefully avoid incompatible structures in a highdensity
environment.
(3) Garages or carports for the storage of private automobiles are a
permitted by right accessory use, provided that such structures are
architecturally compatible with the principal buildings.
(4) The developer shall state whether any deed restrictions or similar
restrictions will be established to control the design of any
detached accessory buildings and fences. Such controls are
strongly encouraged.
(5) Accessory structures may be placed a minimum of one foot from
the lot line along which dwellings are attached. Fences may be
located on a lot line.
H. Homeowners' and/or condominium agreements. If any dwelling units
are to be sold under homeowners' and/or condominium agreements,
such agreements or documents shall be reviewed by the Township
Solicitor and approved by the Board of Supervisors prior to recording
and filed with the subdivision or land development plan. It is strongly
recommended that any such agreements include restrictions requiring
any fencing or garages to be compatible with the overall design.
I. Maximum impervious coverage shall be 70%, based upon the entire
tract. For the purpose of this section, active recreational facilities such
as tennis or basketball courts shall not be limited by the maximum
impervious coverage regulation. However, such areas shall still be
considered impervious for the purposes of managing stormwater runoff.
J. Maximum length of building. The maximum length of a townhouse
building shall be 160 feet, with no more than four dwelling units
attached. As used in this section, "building length" means the horizontal
measurement of any building length from any one end to any other end,
without regard to offsets but without including diagonal measurements.
As a conditional use, upon review by the Planning Commission and
approval by the Board of Supervisors, the maximum length of the
building may be extended to accommodate up to eight units attached,
provided the applicant demonstrates excellence in design. At a
minimum, factors to be incorporated into design include articulation in
roofline and pitch, the use of dormers or other similar features, and
alternating facade materials (e.g., stone, brick, and wood). Also, a
minimum of 50% of all dwellings shall have a front entrance articulated
with a covered porch entry. The size of the front porch shall be a
minimum of five feet deep from the front wall of the dwelling to the
§ 190-58.8 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-58.8
186:665
enclosing porch rail and 10 feet long. The applicant may provide an
alternative design as part of the conditional use application that meets
the intent of this standard.
K. Changes in facade. No more than two adjacent townhouses in any
townhouse building shall have the same front wall plane. The minimum
variation or offset of the front wall plane shall be six feet. A visual
structural break in the roofline or front facade shall be provided
between every two townhouse units. Reference Appendix 1, Design
Guidelines, for example structures that exhibit the intent of this
standard.203
L. External property line building setback. Townhouse buildings and their
permitted accessory structures shall be set back from all exterior lot
lines of a tract a minimum distance of 30 feet, except a minimum
distance of 80 feet shall be required from the lot line of an existing
single-family dwelling. [Amended 4-27-2010 by Ord. No. 2010-392]
M. Building setback from public or private streets. All principal and
accessory buildings and carports of townhouse buildings shall have a
minimum of 10 feet setback from the street right-of-way line of
proposed and existing streets where parking is located to the rear or
side of the principal structure. Where parking is proposed to be located
to the front of the principal building, the front yard setback shall be a
minimum of 30 feet from the street right-of-way line of proposed and
existing streets. If right-of-way is not established for a street, then
setbacks shall be measured from the edge of the cartway.
N. Minimum width of townhouses. Each townhouse dwelling unit shall
have a minimum width of 20 feet, except that a minimum width of 26
feet shall apply if garage doors for two or more vehicles open onto the
front of a townhouse.
O. Minimum private area. For each townhouse, there shall be a yard
immediately adjacent to the front and back of the unit and including the
side for end units. Each dwelling shall be provided an area of not less
than 200 square feet for the exclusive use of the occupants of that
dwelling. Within the yard area described above, a balcony, patio, porch,
deck or other similar outdoor area shall be provided for each dwelling.
If a development is subdivided into lots, the same private area
requirement shall apply in determining the minimum size of the lot;
however, the minimum lot area shall not be less than 3,000 square feet.
Design measures shall be used to seek an appropriate level of privacy in
any rear yards. Such measures might include landscaped screening,
compatible fencing and earth berming. The intent is to avoid the
placement of incompatible fencing by individual lot owners in the
future. If a townhouse includes an individual fee-simple lot of over
1,200 square feet, then such private area is not required to be
specifically designated on plans.
203. Editor's Note: Said Appendix A is on file in the Township offices.
§ 190-58.8 PALMER CODE § 190-58.8
186:666
P. Minimum recreation and open space land. See Article X of the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
Q. Open space maintenance. See Article X of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
R. Private streets. All interior streets and accessways serving more than
five dwelling units but not including parking courts shall be built to
Township construction standards for public streets, regardless of
whether the streets or accessways will be dedicated to the Township.
However, the Board of Supervisors may allow widths of a cartway and a
right-of-way of any private street or accessway to be narrower than is
required for a public street, provided that a private street providing
direct or indirect access to 20 or more dwellings shall have a minimum
width of 24 feet and garages, carports or parking areas are located to
the side or rear of the principal structure.
S. Architectural renderings required. Preliminary architectural
renderings shall be required of the front facades of any townhouse
development of more than 10 units.
T. Preservation of natural buffers. See § 190-194D(3)(c).
U. Architectural variety. A variety of complimentary designs are
encouraged among clusters of buildings within larger developments.
Extreme changes of facades among attached townhouse units are
discouraged.
V. Garages. Garages/carports should be oriented out of the view from
public streets. For this reason, parking courts and combined garage or
carport structures are encouraged instead of individual garages,
especially for narrow townhouse units. If garages are provided, they
should be located to the rear of the structures, with a common driveway
system, provided that adequate provision is made for maintenance
through a homeowners' association.
W. Mailboxes. Due to the density and compact design of townhouse
developments mailboxes should be located either on the facade of the
dwelling unit (where permitted by the United States Postal Service) or
within a common kiosk or enclosed structure. Individual freestanding
mailboxes at the curbside are discouraged.
X. Trash bins. Common trash receptacles shall be provided in locations
that are convenient for residents and for collection. Trash dumpsters
and similar facilities shall be completely enclosed within a decorative
masonry or wood fence, at least six feet in height, on three sides,
maintaining 100% visual blockage on three sides and a self-closing gate
on the fourth side. These areas shall be screened from view of streets
and dwellings.
Y. Access. Vehicular access points onto all minor arterial and collector
streets shall be minimized to the lowest number possible.

required for each individual dwelling unit. The visitor/overflow
parking areas shall be located not greater than 300 feet from any
given dwelling. Off-street parking areas shall not be located
between the public street and the principal building. Such parking
areas shall be located to the side or rear of the principal structure
and in pods of not more than 20 spaces. Each parking area shall be
screened from view from the public right-of-way with a four-foot
decorative masonry fence or evergreen hedgerow, or a combination
of both. The parking areas shall contain internal landscaping. At a
minimum, terminal islands shall be installed at both ends of a
single unbroken row of parking. Terminal islands shall be a
minimum of 15 feet in length and minimum of 10 feet in width.
Each terminal island shall be landscaped with a minimum of one
shade tree and grass or a vegetative ground cover. In addition, a
landscaped divider strip shall be provided to connect the terminal
islands. The divider strip shall be a minimum of seven feet in width
and be planted with a minimum of one shade tree every 30 feet on
center and grass or a vegetative ground cover. These areas shall
not be used to meet the standard parking requirements.
(2) Use. Boats, campers, trailers and other recreational vehicles shall
be prohibited from said parking areas.
AA. Setback from industrial zoning districts. All buildings including one or
more dwelling units shall be set back a minimum of 100 feet from the
boundary of any GI, LI, PIC or PO/IP District boundary. If a public street
is the zoning boundary, such setback shall be measured from the center
line of the street.
BB. Front yard landscaping. All townhouse dwelling units shall have a
clearly defined front yard using landscaping, hedging, fencing or a
brick or stone wall, none of which shall exceed three feet in height.
Front yards of attached duplexes or townhouses may be unified into one
common yard treated as a single yard for the entire building.

ARTICLE VIII
PO/B Planned Office/Business District
§ 190-59. Purpose.
The purpose of this district is to provide highly visible and appropriate
locations for major business developments, including offices and limited
commercial uses. Because the land within this district is within areas of the
Township affected by traffic congestion, special requirements are included
for coordinated circulation improvements to support the permitted
development.
§ 190-60. Review procedures.
Any application for a conditional use in the PO/B District or for any use
involving the subdivision of land into lots smaller than six acres shall
provide a site plan as described in § 190-201 and also the following
information. The submission and review of this information should be
coordinated with the requirements and processes of the sketch or
preliminary plan or land development plan process of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
A. The applicant shall provide a written description of the substance of
covenants, grant of easements or other restrictions to be imposed upon
the use of land, buildings and structures including proposed grants and/
or easements for common open space areas and public utilities, and the
legal form of provision and enforcement thereof.
B. In the case of plans which call for development in stages, a schedule
shall be provided showing the approximate order that applications for
final approval of each stage of the development are intended to be filed
and the approximate number and type of uses planned for each stage.
C. The Zoning Officer or Township Engineer may waive requirements for
information in the application that are cannot be reasonably provided at
this time for areas not scheduled for immediate development within the
tract. For those areas, a sketch plan of likely development shall be
provided. As each further stage occurs, a plan showing all of the
information required by this section shall be submitted or referenced
from previous approved applications.
D. Preliminary architectural renderings. Such renderings of the front
facades of principal buildings shall be submitted for informational
purposes. These plans shall not be used as the basis for a conditional
use or subdivision or land development process decision or any other
regulatory decision of the Township.

centers.
Area and bulk regulations for uses other than life care centers shall be as
follows:
A. Coordinated development. All developments shall be constructed in
accordance with a well-coordinated, integrated overall plan with a

of the existing right-of-way.
§ 190-68 PALMER CODE § 190-69
186:676
D. Separation between buildings. Principal buildings within a lot shall be
separated by a minimum of 35 feet.
E. Lot coverage.
(1) Maximum total building coverage: 40%.

of natural materials in signs, such as relief-cut wood, is strongly
encouraged.
A. Intensity bonuses may be granted as a conditional use up to the limits
listed under § 190-72B for high quality development proposals. Any
decision by the Board of Supervisors to grant a bonus, after a review by

upon the Supervisors' interpretation of the following criteria. No such
bonus shall be granted unless stormwater management of the tract is
completely adequate.
(1) The number of jobs that would be created.
(2) The quality and amount of landscaping in an overall plan that will

and Land Development Ordinance and this Zoning Ordinance,
especially in highly visible locations along major streets. This
especially pertains to feature landscaping as a central focus for a
development, such as a pond.
(3) The quality of the site layout of the proposal, such as use of
attractive, landscaped earth berming. This should include the
screening of bulk parking areas from view of major streets.
(4) The integration of significant recreation facilities for employees
and/or residents into the development.
(5) The respect for sensitive and attractive natural features.
§ 190-69 PALMER CODE § 190-72
186:678
§ 190-73. Site plan review.
A site plan is generally required for every principal nonresidential use. See
§ 190-201.
§ 190-74. Access to minor arterial streets.
(6) Excellence in traffic circulation, within the site and accessing
exterior roads.
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with adjacent uses.
(8) Conformance with the site design guidelines of § 190-201D.
B. The Board of Supervisors may grant bonuses in intensity up to the
following maximum levels, based upon its interpretation of the criteria
of § 190-72A.
(1) Building coverage: up to 45% maximum.
(2) Impervious coverage: up to 75% maximum.
(3) Building floor area ratio: up to 0.9 to 1.0 maximum.
A. Purpose. The PO/B areas in the Township are all located at critical areas
for traffic movement. Extremely carefully designed traffic access will be
essential to avoid added congestion and traffic hazards. The number of
access points onto minor arterial streets needs to be minimized, and
traffic should be steered towards one or two traffic signals.
B. The standards in this section apply both as requirements for all uses in
the PO/B District and also as conditions for any conditional or special
exception use in the PO/B District.
C. PennDOT review. This section is intended to be used in close
cooperation with and not to supersede PennDOT requirements for
highway occupancy permits. In any decision by the Board of
Supervisors regarding access from a PO/B development to a minor
arterial street, the Board of Supervisors should first seek the advice of
PennDOT, the Planning Commission, the Township Police Chief, the
Township Engineer and any traffic studies that are submitted.
D. Access alternatives to minor arterial streets. Access involving left-hand
turns shall be provided from a PO/B tract only onto and off of an
abutting collector street, instead of directly onto a minor arterial street,
wherever practical, as determined by the Board of Supervisors.
E. Access onto minor arterial streets. A maximum of one access point
involving left-hand turns shall be provided from a PO/B tract directly
onto and off of a minor arterial street.
F. Setback of access points from intersections. An "intersection" is defined
as the point of intersecting legal rights-of-way of two streets. Any
§ 190-72 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-74
186:679
access point involving left-hand turns directly onto or off of a minor
arterial street shall be set back a minimum of 300 feet from the
following intersections: two minor arterial streets, a minor arterial and
a collector street or a minor arterial street and a major arterial ramp.
G. Setback of access points within a PO/B District. Any access point
involving left-hand turns onto and off of a minor arterial street within a
PO/B District shall be set back a minimum of 500 feet from any other
access point onto that street from within a PO/B District.
H. Interior streets. All uses within a PO/B tract shall make maximum
possible use of a coordinated interior street system, as opposed to
individual access onto minor arterial streets.
I. Easements for access. The Board of Supervisors may at the time of
approval of a subdivision or land development within a PO/B District,
require a lot or tract to grant an easement for vehicular traffic to
adjoining tracts to allow an efficient interior access system.
J. Subdivision. All subdivision of land within a PO/B District into tracts or
lots shall only occur if it would not result in fragmented patterns of
ownership and development that would prevent a carefully coordinated
interior road system and minimization of access points to minor arterial
streets.
K. Variance reviews. Any request for a variance to the requirements of this
section shall first be reviewed by the Planning Commission and the
Board of Supervisors prior to any hearing on the matter by the Zoning
Hearing Board.

feet to the side.*
[NOTE: Unless the required yard is permitted to be smaller by the
applicable district regulations for that use, such smaller distance
shall apply. For instance, if an eight-feet-wide side yard is
permitted, then the construction area shall be eight feet along the
side from the proposed building location instead of 15 feet.]
(2) The lot and buildings shall be laid out so that the proposed
construction area described above does not include any of the
following features:
(a) Wetlands (as defined by federal and state regulations).
(b) Rights-of-way of underground pipelines.

§ 190-152. Setbacks from waterways and drainage swales.
B. Wetlands.
(1) If the Zoning Officer or the Township Engineer has reason to
believe that a portion of a site proposed to be altered may possibly
meet the state or federal definitions of a "wetland," then the Zoning
Officer may require the applicant to provide a study by a qualified
professional delineating the locations of wetlands. The
qualifications of such expert shall also be submitted. However, the
Township accepts no responsibility to identify all wetlands or to
warn all parties of such possibilities.
(2) All permits of the Township are issued on the condition that the
applicant comply with all federal and state wetland regulations.
Such permits may be revoked or suspended by the Township for
noncompliance with such regulations.
A. Purposes: to protect the water quality of surface waters in the
Township, to preserve opportunities for future recreation use of the
waterways, to minimize erosion and sedimentation, to preserve the
natural stormwater drainage system of the area and to conserve
sensitive wildlife and aquatic habitats.
B. Setbacks from major surface waters.
(1) No structure or paved vehicle parking area or parking aisle shall be
located within 100 feet of the top of the primary bank of a major
surface water.
(2) "Major surface waters" are defined as the entire length of the
Lehigh River and the Bushkill Creek through the Township.
(3) The setbacks required by Subsections B and C shall not apply to a
hydroelectric plant or publicly-owned recreational facilities. See
§ 190-154 regarding whether larger building setbacks are required
by floodplain regulations.
C. Setbacks from minor surface waters. No structure or paved vehicle
parking area or parking aisle shall be located within 60 feet of the
center of any minor surface waters. "Minor surface waters" are defined
as the Schoeneck Creek.
D. Setbacks from major natural drainage swales.
(1) Major natural drainage swales shall, whenever reasonable, be
maintained in open space for a width approximately equal to their
width during a one-hundred-year flood. See § 165-63, Subsection O,
of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance. No buildings
shall be located within 50 feet of the center of a major natural
drainage swale.

§ 190-154. Floodplain management. [Amended 4-16-2001 by Ord.
No. 2001-304]
(2) A major natural drainage swale shall be a stormwater channel
segment that is unpiped and designated on the official Township
Topographic Base Maps as "Drainage and Intermittent Drainage."
(3) The Board of Supervisors may allow a natural drainage swale to be
diverted or piped underground in cases where the applicant proves
to the full satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors that such a
method would be necessary for the reasonable development of the
tract, and that such a method would result in an overall
improvement of stormwater management within the entire area.
E. Setbacks and slopes of drainage swales; setbacks from detention
basins. See § 190-150 above.
F. Stormwater easements and maintenance. See § 165-63, Subsection O,
of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.
A. Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania has, by the passage of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act of 1978,218 delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt floodplain management regulations to
promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its citizenry.
B. Purposes. The purposes of these provisions are as follows:
(1) To promote the general health, welfare and safety of the
community;
(2) To encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices
in order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future;
(3) To minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage;
(4) To reduce financial burdens imposed on the community,
governments and residents by preventing excessive development in
areas subject to flooding;
(5) To protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for
building sites or certain uses because of flooding by prohibiting the
subdivision and/or development of unprotected flood-prone lands;
and
218. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 190-152 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:721
(6) To regulate development in flood hazard areas in accordance with
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. § 4001 et seq.)
and the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act 166 of 1978 (32
P.S. § 679.101 et seq.).
C. Repealer, abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance hereby
repeals and supersedes any prior ordinances and any other similar
provisions currently in effect in identified floodplain areas. However, all
provisions of other ordinances shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict
between any of the provisions of this ordinance, the more restrictive
shall apply.
D. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the ordinance, which shall remain in full force and effect; and for this
purpose the provisions of this ordinance are hereby declared to be
severable.
E. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by
man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings
restricted by debris. This section does not imply, represent, or
suggest that areas outside any identified flood-prone area, or that
land uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding or
flood damages; and every person who proposes to build on or
develop any land within the Township is cautioned to cause his own
independent study to be made to determine the likelihood of
flooding or flood damage occurring on that property.
(2) This section shall not create liability on the part of Palmer
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder. See also § 190-222.
F. Administration.

floodplain administrator shall revoke the permit and report
such fact to the Board of Supervisors for whatever action it
considers necessary.
(f) The floodplain administrator shall maintain in perpetuity all
records associated with the requirements of this ordinance,
including but not limited to finished construction elevation
data, permitting, inspection and enforcement.
(g) The floodplain administrator is the official responsible for
submitting a biennial report to FEMA concerning community
participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(h) The responsibility, authority and means to implement the
commitments of the floodplain administrator can be delegated
from the person identified. However, the ultimate
responsibility lies with the person identified in the floodplain
ordinance as the floodplain administrator/manager.
(i) The floodplain administrator shall consider the requirements
of 34 Pa.Code and the 2009 IBC and the 2009 IRC, or latest
revisions thereof.
(3) Permits required. A Township floodplain development permit is
required for all proposed construction, development and any manmade
change to improved or unimproved real estate within a
special flood hazard area, including but not limited to buildings or
other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavation or drilling operations.
(4) Application procedures. Application for a floodplain development
permit shall be made on forms prescribed and provided by the
Township. If any proposed construction or development is located
within, or adjacent to, any identified floodplain area, applicants for
a building/zoning permit shall, in addition to supplying such
information as may be required by the provisions of other Township
ordinances, supply the following specific information in connection
with such application:
(a) A plan which accurately delineates the area which is subject to
flooding, the location of the proposed construction, the
location of any other floodplain development or structures, and
the location of any existing or proposed stream improvements
or protective works. Included shall be all plans for proposed
subdivision and land development in order to assure that:
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:724
[1] All such proposals are consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage and conform with the
requirements of this and all other applicable codes and
ordinances;
[2] All utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and
water systems, are located, elevated and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage;
[3] Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to
flood hazards;
[4] Structures will be anchored to prevent floatation, collapse,
or lateral movement;
[5] Building materials are flood-resistant;
[6] Appropriate practices that minimize flood damage have
been used; and
[7] Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and airconditioning
equipment and other service facilities have
been designed and located to prevent water entry or
accumulation.
(b) Such plan shall also include existing and proposed contours;
information concerning base flood elevations, velocities, and
other applicable information such as pressures, impact and
uplift forces associated with the base flood; size of structures;
location and elevations of streets; water supply and sanitary
sewage facilities; soil types; and floodproofing measures.
(c) A document, certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect, which states that the proposed construction has
been adequately designed to withstand the base flood
elevations, pressures, velocities, impact, and uplift forces and
other hydrostatic, hydrodynamic and buoyancy factors
associated with the base flood. Such statement shall include a
description of the type and extent of floodproofing measures
which have been incorporated into the design of the structure.
(d) Information showing the proposed lowest floor and basement
elevations in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of
1988.
(5) Review by County Conservation District. A copy of all applications
and plans for any proposed construction or development in any
identified floodplain area to be considered for approval shall be
submitted by the Township to the Northampton County
Conservation District for review and comment prior to the issuance
of a building/zoning permit. The recommendations of the
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:725
Conservation District shall be considered by the floodplain
administrator for possible incorporation into the proposed plan.
(6) Review of application by others. A copy of all plans and applications
for any proposed construction or development in any identified
floodplain area to be considered for approval may be submitted by
the floodplain administrator to any other appropriate agencies and/
or individuals (such as the Planning Commission, Township
Engineer, etc.) for review and comment, and the comments of the
agencies or individuals to whom such submissions are made shall
be considered by the floodplain administrator for possible
incorporation into the proposed plan.
(7) Other permit issuance requirements. Prior to the issuance of any
floodplain development permit, the applicant shall obtain all other
necessary governmental permits, such as those required by state
and federal laws, including but not limited to those required by Act
537, the Pennsylvania Sewage Facilities Act, the Water Obstruction
Act of 1913, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
Amendments of 1972, Section 404, 33 U.S.C. § 1334.
(8) Changes. After the issuance of a floodplain development permit, no
changes of any kind shall be made to the application, permit, or any
of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the
floodplain administrator; and any work done pursuant to such
permit shall be done in accordance with plans, specifications and
other documents and in accordance with any conditions imposed
upon the granting of said permit by the Township. Requests for any
change to the application, permit, plans, specifications or other
documents shall be in writing and shall be submitted by the
applicant to the floodplain administrator for consideration.
(9) Start of construction.
(a) Work on the proposed construction shall begin within 180 days
after the date of issuance of the floodplain development
permit, and work shall be completed within 12 months after
the date of issuance of the permit, or the permit shall expire,
unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the floodplain
administrator. Time extensions shall be granted only if a
written request is submitted by the applicant, who sets forth
sufficient and reasonable cause for the floodplain
administrator to approve such a request and the original
permit is compliant with the ordinance and FIRM/FIS in effect
at the time the extension is granted.
(b) Construction shall be considered to have started with the first
placement of permanent construction on the site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of
excavation. For a structure without a basement or poured
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:726
footings, the start of construction includes the first permanent
framing or assembly of the structure or any part thereof on
its pilings or foundation or the affixing of any prefabricated
structure to its permanent site. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, land clearing, grading, filling,
excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations,
erection of temporary forms, the installation of piling under
proposed subsurface footings, or the installation of sewer, gas
and water pipes, or electrical or other service lines from the
street. For a substantial improvement, construction shall be
considered to have started with the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether
or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
(10) Inspection and revocation. During the construction period, the
Township shall inspect the premises to determine that the work is
progressing in compliance with the permit and with all applicable
Township laws and ordinances. In the event it is found that the
work does not comply with the permit or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, the Township shall revoke the
permit and take such other action as in the circumstances it may
deem appropriate.
(11) Enforcement. Failure to comply with the provisions of this
ordinance is a violation of this ordinance, and the floodplain
administrator may proceed with enforcement action in accordance
with Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Section 616.1,
Enforcement Notice, Section 617.2, Enforcement Remedies
(Penalties), and Article X-A, Appeals to Court. The floodplain
administrator may also issue a declaration of violation, under
Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to deny flood insurance
on the property in violation. The effects of having a Section 1316
violation are nonavailability of flood insurance for any buildings,
possible reduction of market value, risk of damage without
compensation, possible mortgage foreclosure, and denial of
disaster assistance for repair of structural damage.
(a) Notices. Whenever the floodplain administrator or other
authorized municipal representative determines that there are
reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a violation
of any provisions of this section, or of any regulations adopted
pursuant thereto, the floodplain administrator shall give notice
of such alleged violation as hereinafter provided. Such notice
shall:
[1] Be in writing;
[2] Include a statement of the reasons for its issuance;
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:727
[3] Allow a reasonable time, not to exceed a period of 30 days,
for the performance of any act it requires;
[4] Be served upon the property owner or his agent, as the
case may require; provided, however, that such notice or
order shall be deemed to have been properly served upon
such owner or agent when a copy thereof has been served
with such notice by any other method authorized or
required by the laws of this state;
[5] Contain an outline of remedial actions which, if taken, will
effect compliance with the provisions of this section.
(b) Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any action or decision of the
floodplain administrator concerning the administration of the
provisions of this ordinance may appeal to the Zoning Hearing
Board. Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within 30 days
after the decision, determination or action of the floodplain
administrator.
[1] Upon receipt of such appeal, the Zoning Hearing Board
shall consider the appeal in accordance with the
Municipalities Planning Code and any other local
ordinance.
[2] Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning
Hearing Board may seek relief therefrom by appeal to
court, as provided by the laws of this state, including the
Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act.
[3] Granting of a municipal appeal will not relieve a
landowner from the obligation to comply with the
minimum requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program. Landowners that fail to meet the program's
minimum requirements, notwithstanding any appellate
decision to the contrary, are in violation of the National
Flood Insurance Program and remain subject to the
accompanying penalties.

H. Description and identification of floodplain areas.
(1) Identification. The identified floodplain area shall include any areas
of Palmer Township classified as special flood hazard areas
(SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying
Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated July 16, 2014, and
issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:732
the latest revision thereof, including all digital data developed
as part of the FIS. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and
any subsequent revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted by
Palmer Township and declared to be part of this ordinance.
(2) Description and special requirements. The identified floodplain
area shall consist of the following specific areas:
(a) The floodway area shall consist of those areas identified in the
FIS and the FIRM as floodway and which represent the
channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that
must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
increasing the water surface elevation by more than one foot at
any point. This term shall also include floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no
floodway has been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
[1] Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development, shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
[2] Within any floodway area, no new construction or
development shall be allowed, unless the appropriate
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection's regional office.
(b) The AE Area shall consist of those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided.
[1] The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall consist of those
areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the
FIS prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations
have been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(c) The A Area shall consist of those areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no base flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other federal,
state, or other acceptable sources shall be used when
available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the base flood elevation shall be determined by using the
elevation of a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site.
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:733
In lieu of the above, the municipality may require the applicant
to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the
technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall
be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality. [See provisions for site-specific
floodplain studies in Subsection H(4) below.
(3) Floodplain as overlay area. The identified floodplain area shall
function as an overlay district over the zoning district that applies
to a lot. All portions of this ordinance shall also apply to the
floodplain area; except that where the floodplain regulations and
other regulations of this ordinance regulate the same matter, the
more-restrictive regulation shall apply. Should any part of the
identified floodplain area be declared inapplicable because of
lawful official action of the Board of Supervisors, the Zoning
Hearing Board, the Federal Insurance Administration or a court of
competent jurisdiction, the underlying zoning district shall
continue to remain in effect.
(4) Studies by a developer.
(a) If the applicant does not desire the regulations of the identified
floodplain area to apply within an approximated floodplain, the
applicant may, at the applicant's expense, have a detailed study
completed to determine the exact base flood elevation using
accepted hydraulic modeling techniques (HEC-RAS, HEC-2,
etc.).
(b) This determination shall be made under the review and
approval of the Township Engineer and be sealed by a
professional engineer.
(c) An applicant may also provide any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state or other reputable
source.
(d) Such study may also seek to show that an area is within an A or
AE flood area and not the floodway area.
(e) Based upon such study and information, in areas that the
Township Engineer determines, in writing, not to be within the
identified floodplain area, the regulations of the identified
floodplain area shall not apply.
(f) No modification or revision of the water surface elevation, the
floodway area, or any area identified as being flood-prone as
set forth in the latest Flood Insurance Study prepared by the
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:734
Federal Insurance Administration shall be made without prior
written approval from the Federal Insurance Administration.
(5) Changes in identification of floodplain area. The identified
floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Board of
Supervisors where studies or information provided by a qualified
agency or person documents the need for such revision. However,
prior to any such change to the special flood hazard area, approval
must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as soon as practicable,
but not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the changes
to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical or scientific
data.
(6) Boundary disputes. When exact measurements do not exist, the
boundaries of the floodplain areas shall be determined by the
floodplain administrator by scaling distances off the Flood
Insurance Rate Map. If an applicant challenges such determination
by the Floodplain Administrator, the applicant may appeal the
boundaries to the Zoning Hearing Board, which shall seek
comments from the Township Engineer. The person contesting the
location of the floodplain boundary shall have the burden of
establishing that the land does not lie within the identified
floodplain area.
I. Floodplain area prohibited uses. On any site or portion of a site which is
located in a special flood hazard area, the construction, enlargement or
expansion of any of the following uses shall be specifically prohibited,
regardless of their elevation relative to the floodplain:
(1) All new or substantially improved:

186:736
(4) The filling of marshlands, dredging, removal of topsoil or damming
or relocation of any watercourse, except with the approval of the
Pennsylvania DEP.
(5) Any relocation or altering of a watercourse if the water-carrying
capacity will be reduced without an appropriate alternative method
of stormwater management approved under the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (Ch. 165,
Subdivision and Land Development) or any relocation of a
waterway without needed Pennsylvania DEP permits. The State
Floodplain Coordinating Office and downstream municipalities
shall be notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a stream
watercourse, and copies of such notifications shall be submitted to
FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development.
J. Permitted uses in special flood hazard areas shall be as follows,
provided that all other requirements of this section and this ordinance
are complied with:
(1) Crop farming, orchards and raising of livestock.
(2) Plant nursery or Christmas tree farm.
(3) Recreational uses, including public and private parks, day camps,

to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board, based upon review
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:737
by the Township Engineer, that the grading work will not
individually or collectively increase the base flood elevation more
than one foot at any point.
L. Permissible nonconformities. A structure or use of a structure or
premises which lawfully existed before the enactment of these
provisions but which is not in conformity with these provisions may be
continued, subject to the following conditions:
(1) Existing nonconformities (structures and/or uses) located in the
floodway area shall not be expanded or enlarged (unless the effect
of the proposed expansion or enlargement on flood heights is fully
offset by accompanying stream improvements).
(2) Any modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or
improvements of any kind to a nonconformity (structure and/or
use) located in the floodway area to an extent or amount of less
than 50% of its market value shall be elevated and/or floodproofed
in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance.
(3) The modification, alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement
of any kind to a nonconformity (structure and/or use), regardless of
location, to an extent or amount of 50% or more of its value
constitutes a substantial improvement and, therefore, shall be
undertaken only in full compliance with the provisions of this and
any other applicable ordinance.
(4) Uses or adjuncts thereof which are or become nuisances shall not
be permitted to continue.
M. Fill in the floodplain. In addition to any required federal and state
permits, a Township floodplain development permit shall be required
for any filling of either the floodplain area or anywhere within 100 feet
of the top of the primary bank of the Lehigh River or the Bushkill Creek
or within 50 feet of the top of the primary bank of the Schoeneck Creek.
An applicant for such permit shall prove that there will be no increase
in stormwater flows or flooding of the contiguous properties of other
owners. If fill is used, it shall:
(1) Extend laterally at least 15 feet beyond the building line from all
points.
(2) Consist of soil or small rock materials only. Sanitary landfills shall
not be permitted.
(3) Be compacted to provide the necessary permeability and resistance
to erosion, scouring, or settling.
(4) Be no steeper than one vertical foot to two horizontal feet, unless
substantiated data justifying steeper slopes are submitted to, and
approved by, the floodplain administrator.
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:738
(5) Be used to the extent to which it does not adversely affect adjacent
properties.
N. Design standards and improvements.
(1) General.
(a) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall
be made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities
which may be affected by such action have been notified and
until all required permits or approvals have been first obtained
from the commonwealth. In addition, the Federal Insurance
Administrator and Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any
alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
(b) Where not prohibited by this or any other laws or ordinances,
land located in flood-prone area(s) may only be platted for
development subject to the requirement that the developer
construct all buildings and structures to preclude flood
damage in accordance with this and any other laws and
ordinances regulating such development.
(c) No subdivision and/or land development, or part thereof, shall
be approved if the proposed development and/or
improvements will, individually or collectively, increase the
base flood elevation more than one foot at any point. In
identified floodplain areas where base flood elevation data are
not available, plans shall be supported by hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analyses that determine base flood
elevations and floodway information. The analyses shall be
prepared by a licensed professional engineer in a format
required by FEMA for a conditional letter of map revision and
letter of map revision. Submittal requirements and processing
fees shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
(d) If the Palmer Township Board of Supervisors shall determine
that only a part of a proposed plat can be safely developed, it
shall limit development to that part and shall require that
development proceed consistent with this determination.
(e) When a developer does not intend to develop the plat himself
and the Palmer Township Board of Supervisors determines that
additional controls are required to ensure safe development, it
may require the developer to impose appropriate deed
restrictions on the land as recommended by the Township
Solicitor. Such deed restrictions shall be inserted in every deed
and noted on every recorded plat.
(2) Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
(a) Residential structures.
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:739
[1] Any new construction or substantial improvement of a
residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood
elevation.
[2] The design and construction standards and specifications
contained in the 2009 IBC, the 2009 IRC and 34 Pa. Code,
or the most-recent revisions thereof, shall be utilized
where they are more restrictive.
(b) Nonresidential structures.
[1] Any new construction or substantial improvement of a non
residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood
elevation or be designed and constructed so that the space
enclosed below the regulatory flood elevation:
[a] Is floodproofed so that the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water; and
[b] Has structural components with the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy.
[2] Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, made
watertight below the regulatory flood elevation shall be
floodproofed in accordance with the W1 or W2 space
classification standards contained in the publication
entitled "Flood-Proofing Regulations," published by the
United States Army Corps of Engineers (June 1972, as
amended March 1992), or with some other equivalent
standard. All plans and specifications for such
floodproofing shall be accompanied by a statement
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
which states that the proposed design and methods of
construction are in conformance with the abovereferenced
standards.
[3] The design and construction standards and specifications
contained in the 2009 IBC, the 2009 IRC and 34 Pa. Code,
or the most-recent revisions thereof, shall be utilized
where they are more restrictive.
(c) Space below the lowest floor.
[1] Fully enclosed space below the lowest floor (excluding
basements) which will be used solely for the parking of a
vehicle, building access, or incidental storage in an area
other than a basement shall be designed and constructed
to allow for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters for
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:740
the purpose of equalizing hydrostatic forces on exterior
walls. The term "fully enclosed space" also includes crawl
spaces.
[2] Designs for meeting this requirement must either be
certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
[a] There shall be a minimum of two openings having a
net total area of not less than one square inch for
every square foot of enclosed space.
[b] The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
[c] Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices, provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(d) Elevation records. Records of elevations of the base flood
elevation and the lowest floor (including basement) of
structures shall be provided by the applicant for all new or
substantially improved structures in, and in vicinity to, the
floodplain areas. Such information shall indicate whether or
not such structures contain a basement. Such information shall
be maintained in Township records.
(3) Construction standards. The following minimum standards shall
apply for all construction proposed to be undertaken within any
identified flood-prone area:
(a) Drainage facilities. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed
to convey the flow of stormwater runoff in a safe and efficient
manner without damage to persons or property. The system
shall ensure drainage at all points along streets and provide
positive drainage away from buildings. The system shall also
be designed to prevent the discharge of excess runoff onto
adjacent properties.
(b) Sanitary sewer facilities.
[1] All new or replacement sanitary sewer facilities, whether
public or private, and private package sewage treatment
plants (including all pumping stations and collector
systems) shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges
from the systems into the floodwaters. In addition, they
should be located and constructed and floodproofed up to
a point one foot above the base flood elevation to minimize
or eliminate flood damage and impairment.
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:741
[2] No part of any on-site waste disposal system shall be
located within any identified floodplain area except in
strict compliance with all state and local regulations for
such systems. If any such system is permitted, it shall be
located so as to avoid impairment to it, or contamination
from it, during a flood.
[3] The Palmer Township Board of Supervisors may prohibit
installation of on-lot sewage disposal facilities requiring
soil absorption systems where such systems will not
function due to high groundwater, flooding, or unsuitable
soil characteristics. The Board of Supervisors may require
that the developer note on the face of the plat and in any
deed of conveyance areas of the subdivision where soil
absorption fields are prohibited.
[4] The design and construction provisions of the UCC and
FEMA No. 348, "Protecting Building Utilities From Flood
Damages," and "The International Private Sewage
Disposal Code" shall be utilized.
(c) Water facilities. All new or replacement water facilities shall be
designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the system and be located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage.
(d) Streets. The finished elevation of proposed new streets shall be
no more than one foot below the base flood elevation.
(e) Utilities. All other utilities, such as gas lines, electrical and
telephone systems, being placed in flood-prone areas should be
located, elevated (where possible) or floodproofed up to a point
one foot above the base flood elevation and constructed to
minimize the chance of impairment during a flood.
(f) Storage. No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive
or, in times of flood, could be injurious to human, animal, or
plant life shall be stored below the base flood elevation.
(g) Placement of buildings and structures. All buildings and
structures shall be designed, located, and constructed so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be
designed to have a minimum effect upon the flow and height of
floodwater.
(h) Anchoring.
[1] All buildings and structures shall be firmly anchored in
accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement.
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:742
[2] All air ducts, large pipes, storage tanks, and other similar
objects or components located below the base flood
elevation shall be securely anchored or affixed to prevent
flotation.
(i) Floors, walls and ceilings.
[1] Wood flooring used at or below the base flood elevation
shall be installed to accommodate a lateral expansion of
the flooring, perpendicular to the flooring grain, without
causing structural damage to the building.
[2] Plywood used at or below the base flood elevation shall be
of a marine or water-resistant variety.
[3] Walls and ceilings at or below the base flood elevation
shall be designed and constructed of materials that are
water-resistant and will withstand inundation.
[4] Windows, doors, and other components at or below the
base flood elevation shall be made of metal or other waterresistant
material.
(j) Paints and adhesives.
[1] Paints or other finishes used at or below the base flood
elevation shall be of a water-resistant quality.
[2] Adhesives used at or below the base flood elevation shall
be of a marine or water-resistant quality.
[3] All wooden components (doors, trim, cabinets, etc.) shall
be finished with a marine or water-resistant paint or other
finishing material.
(k) Electrical systems and components.
[1] Electric water heaters, furnaces, air-conditioning and
ventilating systems, and other electrical equipment or
apparatus shall not be located below the base flood
elevation.
[2] Electrical distribution panels shall be at least three feet
above the base flood elevation.
[3] Separate electrical circuits shall serve lower levels and
shall be dropped from above.
(l) Utilities and equipment.
[1] Water heaters, furnaces, air-conditioning and ventilation
units and other electrical, mechanical or utility equipment
or apparatus shall not be located below the base flood
elevation.
§ 190-154 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-154
186:743
[2] All fuel supply systems shall be designed to prevent the
infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharges
from the system into floodwaters. Additional provision
shall be made for the drainage of these systems in the
event that floodwater infiltration occurs.
(4) Pilings or columns rather than fill, for the elevation of structures
within flood-prone areas, shall be required in order to maintain the
storage capacity of the floodplain and to minimize the potential for
negative impacts to sensitive ecological areas.
O. Variances in the floodplain areas.
(1) A variance shall only be granted to the requirements of this
§ 190-154 if the applicant can prove that an exceptional and
unnecessary hardship of a unique nature is imposed upon the
property.
(2) In addition to the variance standards stated in the State
Municipalities Planning Code (53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.), the
following requirements shall be applicable:
(a) Variances shall not be issued within the designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood elevation
would result.
(b) The applicant shall be notified in writing, over the signature of
the floodplain administrator, that:
[1] A decision to allow construction of a structure below the
base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance.
[2] Such construction below the base flood elevation increases
risks to life and property.
(c) A detailed professional on-site survey at the expense of the
applicant shall be conducted and be subject to acceptance by
the Township Engineer. Such study shall prove that the
floodplain area, watercourse or drainage course can be altered
in such a way to safely allow the proposed variance while not
adversely affecting the accommodation of the base flood.
(d) The applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Hearing Board that the requested variance:
[1] Will not substantially violate any of the purposes of this
section;
[2] Is the minimum modification necessary to afford relief;
[3] Will not increase the base flood levels;
[4] Is necessary for a reasonable use of the land;
§ 190-154 PALMER CODE § 190-154
186:744
§ 190-155. Erosion control and grading.
[5] Will not result in negative impacts to the creek or river;
and
[6] Is necessary to prevent an exceptional hardship to
applicant.
(e) The applicant shall be required to comply with all provisions of
the Township Building Codes. (See Ch. 55, Building Code.)
(f) Applicable regulations of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain
Management Act and the Federal Flood Insurance Flood Plain
Management Criteria shall apply to any new or substantially
improved structure.
A. All activities, other than routine crop farming unrelated to
development, which would involve the disturbance of earth over an
area greater than 1/4 acre or disturbance of slopes of over 15% shall
submit in advance a grading plan to the Township and a soil and erosion
control plan to the County Conservation District. The erosion control
plan shall be revised as needed until it is found acceptable by the
Conservation District. Compliance with such approved plan shall be a
condition of any Township permit, and a Township permit may be
suspended for noncompliance.
B. Grading regulations.
(1) The existing grade shall not be increased so that unstable slopes
are created.
(2) The surface area of any yard adjacent to a building or structure
shall be graded so that surface water will be drained away from
such structure.
(3) The deposit of soils, detritus or other debris (as a result of site
preparation, grading or excavating) shall not be unsightly or
detrimental to any property, street, sewer or natural waterway.
(4) Materials used for fill as a future base for construction shall be
nonorganic and provide a suitable and secure base.
(5) The Board of Supervisors may require appropriate underground
testing of a proposed building site if there is reasonable doubt in
the opinion of the Township Engineer that the subsurface is
suitable and secure for building.
(6) A site plan shall be provided to the Zoning Officer showing the
existing natural features of a site before grading occurs, with
sufficient information to ensure compliance with the tree
preservation and steep slope regulations of this ordinance. Such
information should also include photographs of the site prior to
grading.

extension and/or connection would be impossible or cost-prohibitive,
based upon review of the Sewer Authority staff. If the Board of
Supervisors determines that such service currently is not reasonably
accessible, then capped sewers shall be required to be installed by the
developer, within the requirements of § 165-64 of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance.
D. Capped sewers. See the requirements of § 165-64 of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.

186:747
§ 190-159. Vibration control.
No person shall operate or permit the operation of any device or conduct
or permit any use to be conducted that creates vibration which is above
the vibration perception threshold of an average person (without the use
of instruments) on private property outside of the lot lines of the use
generating the vibration. This restriction shall not apply to occasional nonroutine
blasting that may be necessary during construction of structures,
streets or utilities.
§ 190-160. Dust, dirt, smoke, vapor, gas and odor control.
(1) The emission of sound for the purpose of alerting persons to the
existence of an emergency.
(2) Emergency work to provide electricity, water or other public
utilities when public health or safety are involved.
(3) Domestic power tools, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00
p.m.

Vehicle Code222).
(7) Public celebrations, specifically authorized by the Township.
(8) Railroads or airplanes.
(9) The unamplified human voice.
C. For any source of sound which emits an impulsive sound (a sound of
short duration, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay and an occurrence
of not more than one time in any fifteen-second interval), the sound
level shall not exceed 20 dBA over the ambient sound level, regardless
of time of day or night or receiving land use.
A. No person shall operate or permit the operation of any device or
conduct or permit any use to be conducted which does not conform with
the standards established under DER air pollution control regulations.
B. No use shall generate odors that would be seriously offensive to
persons of average sensibilities beyond the boundaries of a lot line.
Tighter standards on what is seriously offensive shall apply in the LDR,
MDR, HDR, HDR-II and PO/B Districts than in other districts.

C. Any spreading of manure and septic sludge shall follow good soil and
water conservation and standard practices to reasonably minimize
odor. General standards shall be those recommended by the
Pennsylvania State University Agricultural Extension Service.
A. Overall. All uses shall direct, deflect and shield lights and control the
intensity of lights and illuminated signs to avoid nuisances and prevent
glare onto other properties and streets and to avoid distractions to
motorists. Lights shall not shine directly into the normal line of sight of
motorists. [Amended 2-24-204 by Ord. No. 2004-346]
B. This section shall not apply to approved streetlights within the street
right-of-way.
C. Luminaire height. No privately-owned light standard, other than
lighting of lawful athletic fields, shall have a height greater than 25 feet
if such standard is within 300 feet of an existing principally residential
use or undeveloped residentially-zoned land. In all other situations,
such maximum height shall be 35 feet. These maximum heights may be
waived by the Board of Supervisors for sites with particular and
unusual circumstances that require higher lights.
D. Signs. [Amended 11-13-1995 by Ord. No. 261; 8-21-2000 by Ord.
No. 288]
(1) Illumination of signs beyond what is customary in a residential area
shall be prohibited within the LDR, MDR, HDR, HDR-II and C-R
Districts. No sign shall be excessively illuminated beyond which is
necessary for the sign to be readable. Internally illuminated signs
shall be prohibited in all residential districts in the Township.
Where permitted in nonresidential districts, internally illuminated
signs shall have a dark background with illuminated text that
accounts for a maximum of 20% total sign area. (See Figure I.223)
[Amended 5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
(2) Externally illuminated signs shall be illuminated by a white, steady,
stationary light. For all freestanding pole signs, the light shall be
attached directly to the sign. (See Figure II.224). External light shall
be of reasonable intensity directed at the sign without light
spillover and without causing glare for motorists, pedestrians or
neighboring properties. Signs may be backlighted with a diffused
or shielded light source if deemed necessary by the Township to
controlling glare. Backlighting shall illuminate the letters,
characters or graphics on the sign but not its background in order
to shine only on the face of the sign and not spill over into the
property.

A. No person shall operate or permit the operation of any device or
conduct or permit any use to be conducted which does not comply with
the regulations of the DER, the Federal Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Federal Interstate Commerce Commission.
B. No person shall conduct or permit any use to be conducted which
causes electrical disturbances (except from domestic household
appliances and overhead electric transmission lines) to adversely affect
any equipment at any time other than the equipment creating the
disturbance.
C. No radioactive or hazardous wastes, as defined by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, shall be disposed of within any
district.
A. Applicability.
(1) Tree cutting.
(a) If tree cutting and related development activity are regulated
by the tree preservation requirements of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO) of
1994, as amended, then such tree preservation requirements
shall apply instead of these provisions of this § 190-164 of the
Zoning Ordinance. If such SALDO provisions apply, then
waivers or modifications may be granted by the Board of
Supervisors for just cause, without having to meet
requirements for a zoning variance.
(b) If such SALDO provisions do not apply, then this § 190-164
shall apply to all tree cutting and related development activity.
(NOTE: The tree provision provisions in the SALDO and this
section are identical as of 1993.)
§ 190-161 PALMER CODE § 190-164
186:750
(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the following
activities:
(a) Bona fide tree nurseries for replanting, bona fide Christmas
tree farms or commercial orchards.
(b) "Forestry, commercial" which is regulated as a distinct land use
(See § 190-210 of this ordinance).
(c) Cutting of trees on a lot of less than two acres that has a
primarily residential use, after a certificate of occupancy has
been granted.
(d) Cutting of trees of less than six-inch diameter. (NOTE: Except
that trees that were required to be planted by any Township
ordinance [such as Subsection E(10) below] shall not be cut
down unless replaced by a closely similar tree.)
B. Purposes: to protect wildlife and bird habitats, encourage groundwater
recharge, avoid thermal pollution, decrease air pollution, maintain the
attractive character of areas, maintain and increase property values,
protect water quality and conserve energy; and, through these
purposes, to serve the public health, safety and general welfare.
C. Measurement. For the purposes of this section, the width of trees shall
be the diameter of the trunk at a height of 4.5 feet above the average
surrounding original ground level.
D. Tree removal. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to show
that tree cutting or removal will be held to a reasonable minimum.
Except for exemptions under the above Subsection A, Applicability,
trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or greater may only be cut
down, killed or effectively destroyed if such trees meet one or more of
the following standards:
(1) In addition to other provisions of this section, a maximum of five
trees with a trunk diameter of six inches or more on a lot may be
cut down in a one-year period.
(2) The "thinning of woods" is specifically permitted, provided that
selective cutting is used instead of clearcutting, and provided that a
maximum of 15% of trees six inches or more in diameter in a lot are
cut down and provided that the treecutting is clearly intended to
promote the healthy development of the remaining trees.
(3) Trees may be cut down if the applicant proves that it is necessary to
allow reasonable development of the lot as part of an approved
development plan or building permit (after considering reasonable
alternatives, such as adjusting the location of a building, street or
driveway). For example, trees may be cut down where necessary in
the following situations:
§ 190-164 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-164
186:751
(a) The trees would be located within 10 feet of an existing or
proposed uncurbed vehicle cartway or stormwater detention
basin or paved area or street light or fire hydrant.
(b) The trees would be located within three feet of an existing or
proposed vehicular cartway, parking area, vehicle shoulder,
utility corridor, sidewalk or driveway.
(c) The trees would be located within 25 feet of a proposed on-site
sewage system or the structural walls of the new or expanded
structure.
(d) The trees would be located within the area of proposed use
that needs to be kept open, such as the fairway of a golf course.
(e) The locations of the trees would be affected by unavoidable
significant grade changes.
(f) The trees would be an unresolvable hazard to a public utility.
(4) Trees may be cut down if they are clearly a hazard to the public
safety, such as being a sight distance hazard, an obstruction to a
traffic signal or stop sign or a danger to existing buildings.
(5) Trees may be cut down if they are dead, mostly dead or clearly not
healthy, such as trees that are diseased, unresolvably pest-infected
or clearly near the extreme end of their life span.
(6) Trees may be cut down if the majority of their root system would
need to be destroyed or the root system would need to be covered
by paving or significant grade changes.
E. Protection of trees during construction.
(1) Reasonable efforts shall be taken during any construction to ensure
that trees protected by this section are not intentionally or
accidentally injured or effectively destroyed, including root
compaction by equipment and materials, mechanical damage or
change in grade level.
(2) Within buffer areas. See § 190-194D.
(3) A tree protection area shall be designated on development plans.
This area to be protected shall include the outer limits of land areas
("the dripline") under the branches of trees.
(4) Fencing. The tree protection area shall be separated from all
construction, storage and vehicle areas by a substantial temporary
fence with a minimum four-foot height. Such fence may include
snow fencing or wood planks or strong wires or ropes attached to
metal posts or a similar secure method. The fence shall be kept in
good repair. Such fence shall be removed only after completion of
§ 190-164 PALMER CODE § 190-164
186:752
the work. Trees that are to be removed may also be used as a
temporary buffer to protect trees to be preserved.
(5) The following shall not occur within the defined tree protection
area:
(a) Paving (other than sidewalks). [NOTE: Where practical,
sidewalks should (but are not required to) curve around and/or
be placed as far from the trunk as possible or be placed outside
of the dripline of a tree.].
(b) Storage of building materials, equipment, debris or fill.
(c) Movement of motorized vehicles or equipment.
(d) Grade changes or unnecessary compaction of soil.
(6) If vehicles will need to cross through areas of trees, a defined
fenced path shall be established. The tree protection area should
be noted with prominent signs such as "Tree Protection Area -
Please Keep Out." Such fences and signs shall be removed upon
completion of the work.
(7) Root and limb protection. The cutting of root systems of trees to be
protected shall be minimized. When activity must occur under the
dripline of a tree to be protected, tunneling is recommended
instead of trenching. Limbs should be trimmed or tied back if likely
to be damaged during construction.
(8) A concrete washout area shall not be located in close proximity to
the tree protection area.
(9) Layout. Buildings and other features of a development shall be laid
out to maximize the preservation of healthy mature trees. For
example, building and paving areas should be designed so that
trees are located within islands of sufficient size.
(10) Replacement of trees.
(a) If tree(s) that were required by the Township to be protected
and preserved are killed, removed or otherwise destroyed,
then the Township shall require the applicant or developer to
replace such tree(s) with approved species of trees with a
minimum trunk diameter of four inches measured at one foot
above the average grade level.
[1] One such tree shall be planted for each tree destroyed.
[2] These replacement trees shall be in addition to any trees
required by other provisions of this ordinance.
(b) This replacement provision shall not limit the Township's
ability to also seek fines or other enforcement actions and

§ 190-165. Studies to determine conformance to performance
standards.
remedies under this ordinance or the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
A. Intent. This section is intended to provide a process for the Township to
carefully review unusual or highly complex proposed land uses
(especially industrial uses involving toxic or highly hazardous or
explosive substances) to determine the threat of significant hazards to
the public health and safety and/or future noncompliance with the
performance standards of Article XVI.
B. If a reasonable doubt exists whether a proposed use will comply with
the performance standards of this Article, the Board of Supervisors may
require the applicant for a zoning or occupancy permit to fund such
reasonable and necessary studies to determine the use's compliance
with the performance standards. Such studies shall be completed by
expert(s) selected by the Board of Supervisors. Such studies should be
completed in written form within 90 days after the submittal of an
application for a zoning or occupancy permit.
C. The applicant shall be required to provide such information to the
appropriate reviewer designated by the Board of Supervisors to allow
an accurate determination of potential hazards.
D. If a reasonable doubt exists that a use would violate the performance
standards of this ordinance, the Board of Supervisors may require a use
to fund such reasonable and necessary independent monitoring to
ensure its compliance.

ARTICLE XVII
Off-Street Parking and Loading
§ 190-166. Required number of off-street parking spaces.
A. Requirement.
(1) Each use established, enlarged or altered in any district shall
provide and satisfactorily maintain off-street parking spaces in
accordance with Table 17.1225 and the regulations of this Article.
(2) Uses not specifically listed in Table 17.1 shall comply with the
requirements for the most similar use listed in Table 17.1, as
determined by the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer should
request a recommendation from the Planning Commission.
(3) Where a proposed use contains or includes more than one type of
use (regardless of whether each use is listed in Table 17.1 or is an
unlisted use), the number of parking spaces required shall be the
sum of the parking requirements for each separate use.
(4) Where the computation of required parking spaces results in a
fractional number, the fraction shall be rounded to the closest
whole number.
B. Conditional reduction in off-street parking areas.
(1) The Township recognizes:
(a) The importance of providing adequate, well-designed off-street
parking areas.
(b) The need to limit the amount of paved parking areas to
preserve open space and limit stormwater runoff.
(c) That unique circumstances associated with a land use may
justify a reduction in the parking requirements of Subsection
A.
(2) Following a review and recommendation by the Planning
Commission, the Zoning Hearing Board may permit a reduction,
through the special exception review process of § 190-209, of the
number of parking spaces to be initially developed as required by
Subsection A, provided that each of the following conditions are
satisfied:
(a) The applicant shall demonstrate to the Board, using existing
and projected (five years) employment, customer, resident or
other relevant data, that a reduction in the off-street parking
spaces to be initially developed as required by Subsection A is
warranted.
225. Editor's Note: Table 17.1 is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 190-166 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-166
186:755
§ 190-167. General regulations for parking facilities.
(b) Parking lot plans.
[1] The applicant shall submit plans of the parking lot(s)
which designate a layout for the total number of parking
spaces needed to comply with the parking requirement in
Subsection A.
[2] The plans shall clearly designate which of these parking
spaces are proposed for immediate use and which spaces
are proposed to be conditionally reserved for potential
future use.
[3] The portion of the required parking spaces conditionally
reserved for potential future use shall not be within areas
for required buffer yards, setbacks or areas which would
otherwise be unsuitable for parking spaces due to the
physical characteristics of the land or other requirements
of this ordinance.
[4] Areas conditionally reserved for potential future use shall
be attractively landscaped and remain in open space.
(c) Agreement.
[1] The applicant shall enter into an agreement with the
Township requiring the applicant to maintain each
conditionally reserved area as attractively landscaped
open space and convert some or all of the conditionally
reserved area to additional off-street parking if at any time
the Board finds (based upon the results of field
investigations and recommendations of the Township
Engineer or Zoning Officer) that additional parking is
needed.
[2] This agreement shall be recorded to the deed as a
covenant running with the land or other legally binding
method acceptable to the Zoning Hearing Board Solicitor.
A. General. Parking space layout and requirements shall be adequate for
the intended use.
B. Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence at the effective date
of this ordinance shall not be subject to the requirements of this Article,
provided that the kind of use is not changed and that any parking
facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the future be
reduced to an amount less than that required by this ordinance.
C. Changes in use. Whenever a building or use (including those specified
in Subsection A) is changed or enlarged in floor area, number of
employees, number of dwellings, seating capacity or otherwise to
§ 190-166 PALMER CODE § 190-167
186:756
create a need, based upon the requirements of § 190-166 for an
increase of 10% or more in the number of existing parking spaces, the
number of additional spaces to be provided shall be based upon the
incremental change or enlargement so required.
D. Continuing character of obligation.
(1) All required parking facilities shall be provided and maintained so
long as the use which the facilities were designed to serve still
exists.
(2) Off-street parking facilities shall not be reduced in total extent
except when such reduction is in conformity with the requirements
of this Article in conjunction with a change in the nature of the use.
E. Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any other
use that interferes with its availability for the parking need it is
required to serve.
F. Location of parking spaces. Required off-street parking spaces shall be
on the same lot or premises with the principal use served.
G. Joint use. Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a
common parking lot, provided that the total number of spaces in such
lot shall not be less than the sum of the spaces required for each use
individually and provided such parking lot is within 300 feet walking
distance of all of the principal uses served by such lot, and provided
that the applicant shows evidence of a long-term legally binding
mechanism to assure joint use of the parking. The applicant may seek to
prove that the parking requirement should be reduced under the
provisions of § 190-166B because the uses would have their peak
parking at different times of the day.
H. Definition of "employee." See Article II.
I. Handicapped parking.
(1) Number of spaces. Any lot including four or more off-street parking
spaces shall include a minimum of one handicapped space. The
following number of handicapped spaces shall be provided, unless
a revised regulation is officially established under the Federal
Americans With Disabilities Act:

of spaces over 1,000
(2) Location. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located where they
would result in the shortest reasonable wheelchair-accessible
distance to a handicapped accessible building entrance. Curb cuts
shall be provided as needed to provide access from the
handicapped spaces.
(3) Minimum size. Each required handicapped parking space shall be
eight feet by 18 feet. In addition, each space shall be adjacent to a
five-foot-wide access aisle. Such access aisle may be shared by two
handicapped spaces by being placed between them. However, one
out of every eight required handicapped parking spaces shall have
an adjacent access aisle of eight-foot width instead of five feet.
(4) Slope. Handicapped parking spaces shall be located in areas of less
than 6% slope in any direction.
(5) Marking. All required handicapped spaces shall be well-marked by
clearly visible signs and permanent markings. [Amended
12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
A. General requirements.
(1) Every parking facility shall be designed so that its use does not
constitute a nuisance, hazard or unreasonable impediment to
traffic.
(2) Every parking area shall be arranged for orderly, safe movement.
(3) No parking area shall be designed to require or encourage parked
vehicles to back into a public or private street in order to leave a
parking space, except for a single-family or two-family dwelling
backing onto a road other than a major or minor arterial road.
(4) Every parking area shall be designed so that each motor vehicle
may proceed to and from the parking space provided for it without
requiring the moving of any other motor vehicle, except those of a
single-family or two-family dwelling.
§ 190-167 PALMER CODE § 190-168
186:758
(5) No parking area shall be located within:
(a) A required buffer yard; or
(b) Ten feet of a septic system absorption area.
(6) All parking areas shall include clearly defined and marked traffic
patterns, with the utmost care taken to provide for safe internal
traffic movement and to avoid conflicts between vehicles and
pedestrians.
B. Parking spaces.

least 25 feet in width.
(3) No aisle shall exceed 200 feet in length.
(4) Parking within and obstruction of a required aisle shall be
prohibited.
D. Access drives and driveways.
(1) Driveway width.
(a) Unless a differing requirement is established by PennDOT
along a state street, for common driveways serving four or
more dwelling units, or for any driveway or accessway serving
a nonresidential principal use, the following driveway widths
shall apply, measured at the curbline (or at the edge of street
paving if no curb will exist):
§ 190-168 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-168
186:759
[1] For two-way traffic: a minimum width of 24 feet and a
maximum width of 50 feet.
[2] For one-way traffic: a minimum width of 12 feet and a
maximum width of 20 feet.
(b) All other driveways shall have a minimum width of seven feet

highly visible locations, especially between parking areas and
major streets.

the same time that such action is approved by the Zoning Hearing Board. A
condition of such approval shall be compatibility with adjacent land uses.
§ 190-187. Off-premises signs (including billboards).
A. Purposes:
(1) To carry out the purposes stated in § 190-171A.
(2) This section is intended to carefully control the sizes and locations
of off-premises signs for the following reasons:
(a) Uncontrolled placement of off-premises signs would result in
visual pollution that would conflict with the economic
development goals of the Comprehensive Plan.
[1] The Township has a goal of attracting desirable light
industrial and office development. These types of uses are
very prestige conscious and seek an attractive physical
environment. Uncontrolled erection of off-premises signs,
especially along major entranceways to the Township and
the Lehigh Valley, would harm the positive image of the
Township that business persons receive.
(b) Uncontrolled placement of off-premises signs would create an
environment of visual pollution that would conflict with the
existing and planned residential character of many areas of the
Township.
[1] Even most commercial areas of the Township are within
close proximity to existing and proposed residences.
[2] The visual impact and glare from off-premises signs could
create decreased residential property values in
surrounding areas.
(c) The visual pollution and visual clutter that would result from
uncontrolled placement of off-premises signs could harm areas
of great natural and scenic beauty in the Township. This would
threaten the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan of seeking
to maintain the agricultural and open space character of many
areas of the Township.
(d) The visual clutter from uncontrolled placement of off-premises
signs could cause serious traffic hazards and distractions,
including obstructing sight distances for vehicles and
pedestrians. Also, possible sites abutting arterial streets would
add to existing problems of complex turning movements,
congestion and traffic hazards. Such high-traffic roads require
drivers to place their full attention onto the road without
needless attractions.
§ 190-186 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-187
186:781
(e) This section recognizes that a full variety of alternative means
of free speech are available within the Township, including
provisions for on-premises signs, certain types of temporary
signs and a number of existing off-premises nonconforming
signs that exist in the Township and are available for rent.
(f) The owners of all properties in the Township are provided with
a reasonable variety of reasonable uses for their land other
than permitted off-premises signs.
(g) This section seeks to avoid off-premises signs from having
unfair advantages in sign area and height over on-premises
signs in the competition for attention.
B. Nonconforming off-premises signs. This section is not intended to
require the removal of existing lawful off-premises sign that are
structurally sound and in good repair.
C. Commercial and noncommercial signs. This section applies to both
commercial and noncommercial off-premises signs except as may be
specifically provided for elsewhere in this ordinance.
D. State signs. Signs erected and maintained by the PA Department of
Transportation are permitted by right in all districts. Such signs that
identify business services available at an interchange are specifically
encouraged as an appropriate and orderly means of providing
information without causing visual pollution or traffic hazards.
E. Prohibition. Based directly on the purposes stated in this section, all offpremises
signs are prohibited in all districts of the Township, except as
is specifically permitted by provisions of this ordinance.
F. Allowance for peculiar circumstances.
(1) This section recognizes that peculiar and exceptional
circumstances may cause a need for an off-premises sign other than
those that are permitted.
(2) The Zoning Hearing Board may as a special exception allow one offpremises
sign related towards one individual use. Such a sign shall
be limited to 30 square feet in sign area on one face and with a
maximum height of 20 feet.
(3) Such a sign may be permitted in any district other than LDR, MDR,
HDR or C-R.
(4) No approval shall be granted for such a sign unless the applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Hearing Board that peculiar
and exceptional characteristics of both the individual use and the
site overwhelmingly require a need for such a sign in order for that
use to exist. The applicant shall also prove that the location of such
a sign would be completely compatible with adjacent uses.
§ 190-187 PALMER CODE § 190-187
186:782
G. Permitted off-premises "billboard" signs. An off-premises billboard-type
sign is only permitted if it complies with all of the following
requirements: [Amended 12-27-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-405;

two sign faces per structure if two-sided.
(2) Shall have a total maximum height of 40 feet above the surrounding
ground level. However, for off-premises signs located adjacent to
and directed toward U.S. Route 22 or PA Route 33 and where the
grade of the lot is below the grade of the highway, then the total
maximum height of the sign may be 40 feet above the grade of the
highway.
(3) Shall only be permitted in the GC, LI, PO/IP or PIC District.
(4) Shall be located at least 800 feet from any other such sign.
(5) Shall be located within 300 feet of the existing right-of-way of U.S.

edge of the right-of-way on the same side of the roadway.
(7) Shall be located a minimum of 30 feet from any lot line other than a
residential lot line.
(8) Shall have a maximum sign area of 300 square feet on each of the
permitted sign faces, except where such sign is located within 200
feet of the right-of-way of, and intended or designed to be viewed
from, U.S. Route 22 or PA Route 33, in which case the maximum
area on each of the two sides may be 672 square feet.
(9) Shall not be required to meet the maximum height and size
requirements for a freestanding sign. The maximum height and size
requirement governing freestanding signs as defined by this
ordinance shall not apply to billboard signs.
H. Digital signs and electronically changing message signs. [Added
12-27-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-405]
(1) If an off-premises billboard sign, or any portion thereof, is a digital
sign or electronically changing message sign, it shall be separated
a minimum of 1,000 feet from any other digital or electronically
changing off-premises sign. The distance between sign structures
shall be measured between points directly opposite the signs, along
the nearest edge of the right-of-way on the same side of the
roadway.

22 or PA Route 33, as permitted within a GC, PC, LI, HI, PI/C, PO/IP or
PO/B Zoning District. Where applicable, such signs shall be located,
constructed and maintained in accordance with all applicable
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation regulations, in addition to
§ 190-187 PALMER CODE § 190-189
186:784
all Palmer Township regulations. Where there is a conflict between
regulations, the more-restrictive regulation shall apply.
(1) A digital sign shall not be placed within 500 feet of a residential
zoning district, as measured from a point directly opposite the sign,
along the nearest edge of the right-of-way on the same side of the
roadway.
B. Electronically changing message signs shall only be permitted to be
located within 50 feet of the right-of-way of, and intended or designed
to be viewed from, U.S. Route 22, PA Route 33, William Penn Highway,
Route 248/Nazareth Road/South 25th Street, or Freemansburg Avenue,
as permitted within a GC, PC, LI, HI, PI/C, PO/IP, PO/B or C-R Zoning
District. Where applicable, such signs shall be located, constructed and

General Regulations
§ 190-191. Principal uses limited; posting of address.
§ 190-192. Frontage onto improved streets; number of uses or
buildings. [Amended 7-1-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-320]
A. A maximum of one principal use is permitted on one lot, except as
specifically permitted by this ordinance, and except for approved multitenant
commercial and industrial buildings. See § 190-192C.
B. Every principal building shall post its street number (if one has been
established) in such a prominent place that it can be clearly viewed
from a public street.
A. Frontage required onto improved street.
(1) Every principal building shall be built upon a lot with permanent
access upon a public street or a private street that is improved to
meet Township standards, including a street right-of-way, or for
which such improvements have been insured by the posting of a
performance guaranty pursuant to the Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance. In the case of townhouses or lowrise/
garden apartments, this requirement may be met by access
onto a parking court which has access onto such street.
(2) See Article X of the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance regarding required improvements to streets.
(3) If a pre-existing lawful lot only has access onto an existing private
street that does not meet Township standards and the improvement
of that street is reasonably beyond the control of the applicant, the
lot may be used for a single permitted by right use, but no new lots
shall be created that will not be able to meet this requirement.
B. Multiple buildings on a lot. An approved commercial, institutional,
industrial or garden apartment lot may include more than one principal
building. In such case, the minimum front, side and rear yard
requirements shall only apply at lot lines of the property. In such case, a
twenty-five-foot-wide minimum separation distance shall apply between
principal buildings, unless stated otherwise. Individual buildings or
portions of such buildings may be held in approved condominium
ownership, but the lot shall be owned by a single legal entity.
C. Multiple occupancy.
(1) A principal commercial or industrial building may be occupied by
more than one tenant within a similar general type of use, provided
that all requirements of this ordinance are complied with.
§ 190-191 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-192
186:787
§ 190-193. Height exceptions; airport approaches.
§ 190-194. Special lot and yard requirements, sight distance and
buffer yards.
(2) Each use within a multiuse building shall be required to apply for
separate building and zoning permits through the required
processes.
A. Height exceptions. The maximum structure height specified for each
district shall not apply to farm silos and associated agricultural
structures, communications towers, amateur radio antenna, water
towers, clock or bell towers, steeples of places of worship, electrical
transmission lines, elevator shafts, windmills, chimneys or other
appurtenances usually required to be and customarily placed above the
roof level and not intended for human occupancy. For these exempted
structures, the maximum height shall be 250 feet above the average
surrounding ground level.
B. Height and airport approaches. At a minimum, any structure proposed
to have a height of 75 feet or more above average surrounding ground
level shall present sufficient information to the Zoning Officer to prove
that the structure would comply with all applicable federal, state and
Township requirements regarding airport approaches and warning
lights. See the Township Airport Approach Zoning Provisions, which
specifically shall remain in force and which are not repealed by this
ordinance.
C. Minimum height. No dwelling shall be less than one story in height,
except during a maximum twenty-four-month period from the date of
issuance of the zoning permit. This period may be extended by the
Zoning Hearing Board. This requirement shall not apply to a dwelling
specifically designed to be an "earth-sheltered house" if such dwelling
meets all other requirements of this ordinance and is approved as a
special exception by the Zoning Hearing Board, after considering
compatibility with adjacent uses.
A. In general.
(1) No lot, structure or use shall be created or developed in such a way
that it would result in another lot, building or use not being able to
meet the requirements of this ordinance. This includes, but is not
limited to, setback areas, impervious areas and off-street parking
areas.
(2) Emergency access. All uses and structures shall have adequate
provisions for access by emergency vehicles.
(3) Setbacks not applicable. See exemptions for certain structures in
§ 190-211.
§ 190-192 PALMER CODE § 190-194
186:788
(4) Accuracy. The applicant is responsible to make sure that all
measurements submitted to the Township are accurate.
B. Exceptions to minimum lot areas, lot widths and yards.
(1) Nonconforming lots. See § 190-196.
(2) Through lots. Any lot having frontage on two approximately parallel
streets (not including an alley) shall provide a required front yard
setback abutting each of these streets.
(3) Corner lots.
(a) A setback area equal to the minimum front yard setback shall
be provided along all portions of a corner lot abutting any
public street, except where the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that the provision of a smaller
setback of a different yard for a residential building will
conform with the clearly prevailing yard pattern on numerous
existing developed adjoining lots fronting on the same street.
(b) If a lot is required to provide front yard setbacks along two of
four lot lines, then the remaining two yards may be side yards
without a rear yard being required.
(4) Projections into required yards.
(a) Cornices, eaves, sills or other similar architectural features,
exterior stairways, fire escapes or other required means of
egress, rain leads or chimneys or other similar structures that
do not include space usable by persons may extend or project
into a required yard not more than two feet, except as may be
required under a drainage or utility easement.
(b) Front, side or rear porches that are covered by a roof and are
not enclosed, and are not raised more than four feet above the
ground level may project from the principal building into a
required yard setback, provided that the porch does not
intrude more than five feet into a required yard and has a
maximum width of 10 feet.
(5) Front yard setback exception.
(a) In any district within a block containing a lot proposed for a
construction or expansion of a building, where 50% or more of
the improved lots on such block frontage currently have front
yards of less depth than is currently required for that district,
and where the clear majority of such lots are already
developed, the average of such existing front setbacks shall
establish the minimum front yard depth for the remainder of
the frontage; provided, however, that an absolute minimum
front yard setback of 25 feet shall apply.
§ 190-194 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-194
186:789
(b) In any district within a block containing a lot proposed for a
construction or expansion of a building, where 90% or more of
the lots on such block frontage include existing principal
buildings have front yards of greater depth than is currently
required for that district, and where the clear majority of such
lots are already developed, the average of such existing front
setbacks shall establish the minimum front yard depth for the
remainder of the frontage; provided, however, that the
minimum front yard setback shall not be more than 15 feet
greater than what would otherwise apply.
(6) Triangular lots. If a three-sided lot does not have a rear lot line,
then the required rear yard shall be twice as wide as would
otherwise be required and be measured from the corner of the lot
farthest from the front lot line.
(7) Septic systems. Nothing in this ordinance shall prevent the
Municipal Sewage Enforcement Officer from requiring a minimum
lot area larger than what is stated in this ordinance to carry out
state and Township sewage regulations.
(8) Previously approved setbacks. Where a subdivision or land
development was granted final approval prior to the adoption of
this ordinance, and the lawful setbacks in effect at such time are
shown on the approved plans, at the option of the developer, those
approved setbacks may apply in place of any revised setbacks in
this ordinance.
(9) Electric power lines. See definition of "lot area" in Article II. Active
recreation facilities shall not be developed immediately beneath
electric overhead transmission rights-of-way or easements.
(10) Recreation trail setback. No structure, parking space for a
commercial or industrial use or commercial or industrial storage or
display shall be located within 20 feet of the lot line of the Palmer
Township Bikeway/Recreational Trail.
C. Sight distance.
(1) Sight distance at intersections.
(a) Purpose. To ensure that traffic passing through an intersection
or turning onto a street can safely see oncoming traffic.
(b) A triangular area as described in this section shall be graded
and shall be kept free of sight obstructions between the ground
level and a height of 10 feet above the center-line grade of the
intersecting streets, including structures, nontransparent
fences, vegetation and signs (but not including mowed grass,
posts of official signs which must be located in the sight
triangle because of their function or the trunks of existing
§ 190-194 PALMER CODE § 190-194
186:790
trees whose branches are kept clear of the sight triangle).
[Amended 12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
(c) This sight distance triangle shall be shown on development
plans submitted to the Township and be shown on any plan
required to be recorded. Such triangle shall serve as a
permanent setback line for all such visual obstructions and
shall be binding upon present and future owners of the land.
(d) Such triangular area shall be bounded by the intersecting
street center lines and a diagonal connecting two points, one
which is at each end of the center lines of each street as
follows:
[1] One hundred fifty feet from the intersection of such street
center lines, if either street is an arterial street.
[2] One hundred feet from the intersection of such street
center line if either street is a collector street.
[3] Seventy-five feet from the intersection of such street
center line if both streets are local streets.
(2) Sight distance at intersections of driveways or accessways with
streets.
(a) A triangular area as described in Subsection C(1) above shall
be graded and shall be kept free of sight obstructions between
the ground level and a height of 10 feet above the center-line
grade of the intersecting driveway, accessway or street,
including structures, nontransparent fences, vegetation and
signs (but not including mowed grass, posts of official signs
which must be located in the sight triangle because of their
function or the trunks of existing trees whose branches are
kept clear of the sight triangle). [Amended 12-17-2001 by
Ord. No. 2001-311]
§ 190-194 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-194
186:791
(b) This sight distance triangle shall be shown on development
plans submitted to the Township and be shown on any plan
required to be recorded. Such triangle shall serve as a
permanent setback line for all such visual obstructions and
shall be binding upon present and future owners of the land.
(c) Such triangular area shall be bounded by the intersecting
street center lines and a diagonal connecting two points, one of
which is at each end of the center line of each street,
accessway or driveway 30 feet from the intersection of such
center lines.
(d) No sign shall be placed or vehicle parking located in such
locations that would obstruct clear sight lines necessary for the
safe movement of traffic out of any driveway or accessway onto
a street.
D. Buffer yards. Buffer yards and screening complying with the following
standards shall be required under the following situations:
(1) Buffer yard width; when required. Buffer yards with evergreen
screening shall be required in the following situations, with
whichever is most restrictive applying.
(a) A minimum forty-foot-wide buffer yard shall be required
between any newly developed or expanded area of an
industrial use and any abutting LDR, MDR, HDR or HDR-II
District or existing principal residential use. [Amended
12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
(b) A minimum ten-foot-wide buffer yard shall be required
between any newly developed or expanded area of a
commercial use and any abutting LDR, MDR, HDR or HDR-II
District or existing principal residential use. [Amended
12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
(c) A minimum twenty-foot-wide buffer yard shall be required
between any newly developed or expanded area of industrial
outdoor storage and/or a loading dock routinely used for
tractor-trailer trucks or refrigerated trucks and any abutting
principal office use, LDR, MDR, HDR or HDR-II District, public
§ 190-194 PALMER CODE § 190-194
186:792
street right-of-way or publicly-owned recreation area.
[Amended 12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
(d) A minimum twenty-five-foot-wide buffer yard shall be required
between any townhouse or garden apartment principal
building and the lot line of any directly abutting existing singlefamily
detached dwelling.
(e) In any other location where a buffer yard is required by this
ordinance, and where such width is not specifically stated,
such yard shall have a minimum width of 20 feet.
(2) Location of buffer yards.
(a) The buffer yard shall be measured from the district boundary
line, future street right-of-way line or lot line, whichever is
applicable.
(b) Plants needed for the visual screen shall not be placed within a
future street right-of-way. The required buffer yard width shall
be in addition to the required future street right-of-way.
(c) The buffer yard may include areas within a required front, side
or rear yard, or a paved area setback area, provided that the
larger yard requirement shall apply in case of overlap.
(d) A business use shall not be required to provide a buffer yard
for an adjacent residential use or district if the uses/districts
are separated by an expressway. However, outdoor storage or
tractor-trailer parking adjacent to an expressway shall still
provide any required buffer yard and screening.
(3) Characteristics of buffer yards.
(a) The buffer yard shall be a landscaped area free of structures,
dumpsters, commercial or industrial storage or display,
manufacturing or processing activity, materials, loading and
unloading areas or vehicle parking or display. No new
driveways or streets shall be permitted in the buffer yards
except at points of approved crossings for ingress or egress.
(b) Maintenance. In buffer yards, all areas not covered by trees
and shrubs shall be well-maintained in an all-season vegetative
ground cover (such as grass) and shall be kept free of debris
and rubbish and shall not include grass areas higher than eight
inches.
(c) Preservation of existing vegetation or slopes. If an applicant
proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that an existing
healthy tree line, attractive thick vegetation, natural earth
berm and/or steep slopes will be preserved and serve the same
buffer purposes as plant screening that would otherwise be
required, then such preserved existing buffer shall be
§ 190-194 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-194
186:793
permitted to be used in place of planting new plants. In such
case, the width of the buffer yard required by Subsection D(1)
shall still apply. If this existing buffer requirement is removed,
the applicant shall be required to plant a buffer yard that will
meet the planting requirements of this section.
(d) Fence. Any fence in a buffer yard shall be placed on the inside
of any required evergreen screening.
(4) Plant screen.
(a) Each buffer yard shall include a planting screen of trees or
shrubs extending the full length of the lot line.
(b) Each planting screen shall meet the following requirements:
[1] Plant materials needed to form the visual screen shall have
a minimum height when planted of four feet, unless
otherwise stated in another section of this ordinance.
[2] Plants needed to form the visual screen shall be of such
species, spacing and size as can reasonably be expected to
produce, within three years, a solid year-round visual
screen at least six feet in height.
[3] The plant screen shall be permanently maintained by
present and future landowners. Any plants needed to form
the visual screen that die or are removed shall be replaced
within five months.
[4] The plant screen shall be placed so that at maturity the
plants will be at least five feet from any cartway and will
not grow over an exterior lot line.
[5] The plant visual screen shall be interrupted only at:
[a] Approved points of vehicle or pedestrian ingress and
egress to the lot that are perpendicular to the buffer
yard.
[b] Locations necessary to comply with the sight distance
requirements of Subsection C.
[c] Locations needed to meet other specific state and
Township requirements.
[6] Evergreen trees likely to grow substantially in diameter
should be planted in two or more rows or offsets if needed
to allow space for future growth.
(c) In circumstances where it is impractical to provide plant
screening meeting the requirements of this section, the Zoning
Officer may approve acceptable alternative methods of
screening (such as an attractive visually solid weather-
§ 190-194 PALMER CODE § 190-194
186:794
resistant wood fence), provided that the applicant proves such
alternative would meet the spirit, objectives and intent of the
screening requirements. The applicant shall state in writing
the proposed size and materials of any such fence.
(5) Buffer yard plans.
(a) Prior to the issuance of a permit under this ordinance where a
buffer yard would be required, and on any required subdivision
or land development plan, the applicant shall submit plans
showing:
[1] The location and arrangement of each buffer yard.
[2] The placement, general selection of species and initial size
of all plant materials.
[3] The placement, size, materials and type of all fences to be
placed in such buffer yard.
(b) The Zoning Officer shall review such plans to determine that
the plans are in conformance with the terms of this ordinance.
(6) Mechanical screening. All outdoor stationary ground level
industrial mechanical equipment that is visible from a public street
shall be separated by landscaping and/or have an architectural
building material screen or covering or design that is harmonious
with the building design, as seen from the street.
(7) Based upon a review by the Planning Commission, the Board of
Supervisors may allow an adjustment in the buffer yard
requirements of this section where such requirements are deemed
unnecessary because of the location (such as if a steep slope forms
a natural buffer) or would create a hardship or where an alternative
method of buffering (such as an earth berm and/or solid wood
fence) would be more appropriate.
(8) As a condition of approval of a conditional or special exception use
or a variance, the Board of Supervisors or Zoning Hearing Board as
applicable may require additional screening, additional width and/
or a raised earth berm where necessary to prevent a serious threat
of incompatibility with neighboring uses.
(9) See paved area screening requirements of § 190-168J.
(10) Species of plants in screening. Trees and shrubs needed to form a
required visual screen shall be of the following or closely related
species, unless the applicant proves to satisfaction of the Planning
Commission or Zoning Officer that a substitution would be
appropriate. A required visual screen shall primarily include
evergreen plants. Leafy deciduous plants may be selectively used,
provided that their use does not result in significant visual
openings during the winter. If more than 25 plants are needed to
§ 190-194 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-194
186:795
form a visual screen, then a maximum of 75% of such plants shall
be of one species.

186:796
§ 190-195. Landscaping.
§ 190-196. Establishment of future/ultimate right-of-way widths for
streets.
A. Ground cover and plan required. Any part or portion of a lot which is
not used for buildings, structures, loading or parking areas and aisles,
sidewalks and designated storage areas shall be provided with an allseason,
well-maintained vegetative ground cover and shall be
landscaped with trees and shrubs in accordance with an overall
landscape plan. This landscape plan should include the botanical and
common names of the plants to be used, the sizes to be planted and the
quantity and spacing of each.
B. Modifications. Landscaping of superior quality and quantity should be
provided in highly visible areas of the Township, especially along
arterial roads. The Planning Commission may allow, with concurrence
of the Board of Supervisors, that the specific landscaping requirements
be adjusted to allow approximately the same amount of landscaping to
be placed in different locations or arrangements or to be of different
species than would otherwise be required, if the Township determines
that such alternative would be superior in effect. To receive such
adjustments, an applicant shall provide a landscaping plan prepared by
a registered landscape architect.
C. See § 190-168H, Parking lot landscaping, § 190-168I, regarding parking
lot screening, § 190-194D, Buffer yards, and Article X of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance regarding street trees.
D. Street trees. See Article X of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(1) If a Township regulation would require that street trees be placed
within a state street right-of-way, and PennDOT specifically refuses
permission for such plantings, or if the Township determines that
there are no acceptable locations for street trees within the rightof-
way, then the street trees shall be planted immediately outside
the right-of-way.
(2) Location. See § 165-73A(8) of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance.
(3) Any street trees planted under or near overhead utility lines shall
be of a species with a limited mature height. (NOTE:
Recommendations are available from the local utility company).
A. Purpose. Minimum future/ultimate right-of-way widths are established
for streets where the existing right-of-way is less than that indicated in
this section for the particular classification of street. These future
rights-of-way are designed to reserve adequate rights-of-way for future
circulation improvements, including street widenings, intersection
realignments and widenings, shoulders, bikeways and sidewalks, and to
§ 190-195 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-196
186:797
provide rights-of-way for needed public sewer and water lines and other
utilities and drainage improvements.
B. Measurement.
(1) The future right-of-way shall be measured with 1/2 on either side of
the center line of the existing right-of-way. If the existing right-ofway
is clearly significantly off-center of the cartway, the center line
of the cartway shall be used.
(2) The specific classification of each street is shown on the Township
Official Street Classification Map, at the end of this document.233
C. Dedication of future/ultimate right-of-way. See § 165-59N of the
Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, as amended.
D. Minimum widths. The following future rights-of-way shall be reserved
along each street:
Street Classification
Minimum Future Right-of-Way
(feet)
Major arterial street/expressway 120 or existing right-of-way width,
whichever is wider
Minor arterial street 80, except as stated below
Collector street 60
Local/marginal access/private
streets
50
E. Maintenance. The owner of the adjacent property shall be responsible
for maintenance of portions of the right-of-way not used for vehicles.
F. Modifications of right-of-way width.
(1) The Board of Supervisors may approve a reduction in the minimum
future right-of-way where the applicant clearly proves to the
satisfaction of the Board of Supervisors either of the following:
(a) That the proposed use and/or subdivision is of such low
intensity that it will not create any measurable additional
impact on the adjacent street system; or
(b) That it would, for practical purposes, be infeasible for the
street to be substantially widened at any time in the future
because of the existence of substantial existing buildings on
the applicable side of such street within close proximity to such
street and that the additional right-of-way is not needed for the
extension of water and sewer lines.

§ 190-196 PALMER CODE § 190-196
186:798
§ 190-197. Right-of-way requirement for industrial and commercial
uses.
No industrial or commercial use shall be permitted adjacent to a street
designated on the Township Official Street Classification Map234 as a minor
arterial or collector street unless such street has a right-of-way with a
minimum width of 30 feet from the center line of said street to the lot line
of the proposed use or unless such width will be provided.
§ 190-198. Access onto arterial and collector streets.
To encourage well-planned development fronting onto minor arterial and
collector streets (as defined on the Official Street Classification Map235) and
to minimize traffic congestion and hazards, the following provisions shall
apply to access onto such streets:
(2) Rights-of-way shall not be required to be dedicated in specific
locations that are presently occupied by buildings that are
proposed to remain.
(3) The Board of Supervisors may by resolution or ordinance establish
a wider future right-of-way along a specific street than is provided
by this section, where the Board of Supervisors determines there is
a clear, necessary and reasonable need for such additional width.
A. Parking, loading and drive-throughs. See § 190-166. All off-street
parking, loading, vehicle storage and display and associated internal
vehicle accessways shall be physically separated from the cartway of a
minor arterial or collector street (except at approved perpendicular
entrance and exit points) by a raised curb, planting strip, wall or other
suitable barrier to prevent unchannelized access onto the street. All
parking and drive-through facilities shall have sufficient areas for
stacking of vehicles to prevent the "backup" of vehicles onto a public
street.
B. Access points. Each lot with less than 250 feet of frontage on an arterial
street shall have not more than one access point involving left-hand
turns onto each such street, and no lot with 250 or more feet of total
frontage on an arterial street shall have more than two access points
involving left-hand turns onto any such arterial street. If a lot has more
than one access point, the separation distance between access points
should be maximized, where reasonable considering other traffic safety
concerns.
(1) This provision shall not apply to the following:
(a) Construction of new streets onto an existing arterial street.

§ 190-196 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-198
186:799
§ 190-199. Nonconformities.
(b) Access points that are clearly limited to use by only emergency
vehicles.
(2) A separate ingress point and a separate egress point shall be
considered one access point, if well-marked and if the geometry of
the driveways inhibits two-way traffic.
C. Where practical, access to two or more nonresidential lots should be
combined and/or shared and/or coordinated to minimize the number of
access points onto an arterial street. Shared parking lots and driveways
connecting adjacent nonresidential lots are strongly encouraged. See
possible reduction of parking requirements in § 190-166B.
D. See the access control provisions in Article X of the Township
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, including §§ 165-59F
and 165-67.
E. Larger developments. The following standards shall apply to any
development involving three or more principal commercial lots
(including but not limited to office, service or retail uses) or more than
five acres of commercial, garden/low-rise apartment or townhouse
uses.
(1) Whenever feasible, each principal building shall have its primary
vehicle access onto a service road, marginal access street, common
parking lot, common accessway, collector street or other
alternative method approved by the Township as opposed to direct
vehicle access from each lot involving left-hand turns onto a minor
arterial street.
(2) See requirements for setbacks of driveways from street
intersections in § 165-67 of the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(3) Adequate vehicle access shall be provided to each use without
causing undue congestion to, hazards upon or interference with
traffic movement on public streets. Uses shall include adequate
signalization, turn lanes, stacking areas and deceleration lanes to
provide safe and efficient access.
(4) Illumination. See § 190-161 of this ordinance.
(5) See § 165-59F of the Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
concerning access onto arterial streets. Alternative rear access to
properties fronting an arterial street should be considered.
A. Registration of nonconformities. It shall be the responsibility of a party
asserting a nonconformity to provide the evidence that it is lawful. A
property owner may request a written statement of nonconformity from
the Zoning Officer after providing sufficient evidence.
§ 190-198 PALMER CODE § 190-199
186:800
B. Continuation. A lawful nonconforming use, structure or lot as defined
by this ordinance may be continued and may be sold and continued by
new owners. Any expansion of, construction upon or change in use of a
nonconformity shall only occur in conformance with this section.
C. Expansion of, construction upon or change in use of nonconformities.
(1) Nonconforming structures.
(a) The Zoning Officer shall permit a nonconforming structure to
be reconstructed or expanded, provided that:
[1] Such action will not increase the severity, extent or
amount of the nonconformity (such as the area of the
building extending into the required setback) or create any
new nonconformity.
[2] Any expanded area must comply with the applicable height
restrictions and applicable setbacks set forth in the base
zoning district in which the nonconforming structure is
located and any and all other requirements of this
ordinance. [Amended 3-23-2004 by Ord. No.
2004-347]
(b) In the case of a nonconforming structure which is used by a
nonconforming use, any expansion shall also meet the
requirements of this section regarding nonconforming uses.
(2) Nonconforming lots of record.
(a) Dwellings. In a district in which single-family detached
dwellings are permitted, such dwelling and customary
accessory structures may be erected on a lawful lot of record
after receiving special exception approval, provided that such
lot:
[1] Has a minimum width of 60 feet measured at the minimum
building setback line, except that the minimum lot width in
the LDR District shall be 100 feet.
[2] Was in lawful existence as of January 15, 1973.
[3] Was in single and separate ownership from any abutting
lot as of January 15, 1973 and as of the present.
[4] Has a minimum lot area of one acre in the C-R District,
12,000 square feet in the LDR District and 6,000 square
feet in any other district.
[5] Will comply with minimum setbacks and other
requirements of this ordinance for any new construction or
expanded area, except for minimum lot depth and those
§ 190-199 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-199
186:801
provisions specifically allowed to be altered by this
subsection or for which a variance is granted.
[6] Has minimum side yard setbacks of eight feet each or 10%
each of the lot width, whichever is larger.
[7] If a new principal building will be served by an on-lot
septic system, the lot will comply with all state septic
regulations, and shall provide an approved alternative
drainfield location.
(b) Integration. Two (1) or more abutting nonconforming lots
under common ownership at the time of adoption of this
amended section shall be integrated to form a lot that would be
less nonconforming. Such integrated lot in common ownership
shall not be subdivided, resubdivided or sold in parts using
separate deeds to separate owners, unless specifically
approved as a subdivision under the Township Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance and in compliance with this
ordinance. See § 165-9B of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance regarding resubdivision of lots.
(c) Nonresidential districts. In a district where single-family
detached dwellings are not permitted, a single permitted by
right principal use and its customary accessory uses may be
constructed, reconstructed or expanded on a nonconforming
lot of record as a permitted by right use if all of the following
requirements are met:
[1] The lot has a minimum lot width of 60 feet.
[2] The lot width is at least 30% of the required minimum lot
width.
[3] The lot is a lot of record that lawfully existed prior to the
adoption of this ordinance or an applicable subsequent
amendment.
[4] Minimum setbacks and other requirements of this
ordinance are complied with for any new construction or
expanded area.
[5] If a new principal building will be served by an on-lot
septic system, the lot shall comply with all state septic
regulations, and shall provide an approved alternative
drainfield location.
(d) Modification of setbacks. The Zoning Hearing Board may grant
a special exception to reduce the required setbacks concerning
construction on a nonconforming lot if the Board determines
that such reduction would result in a building that would be
§ 190-199 PALMER CODE § 190-199
186:802
more compatible with neighboring residences than would be
built if the setback requirement was not reduced.
(e) Variances. If a proposed use on a nonconforming lot does not
meet the requirements of the above Subsection C(2)(a), (b), (c)
or (d), then the development of the nonconforming lot shall not
occur unless a variance is granted by the Zoning Hearing
Board. In addition to the standards stated for a variance in the
PA Municipalities Planning Code,236 the Zoning Hearing Board
shall also review whether any alternative permitted uses could
reasonably be made of the property that would have less
significant adverse impacts upon the established character of
an existing residential neighborhood. The full burden of proof
shall be upon the applicant to prove that the lot is a lawful lot
of record, the variance standards are met and the provisions of
this Subsection C are complied with.
(3) Expansion of nonconforming nonresidential uses. A nonconforming
use or a building used by a nonconforming use shall not be
expanded, except in accordance with the following provisions:
(a) An expansion of a total of more than 5% in total building floor
area in any five-year period shall require special exception
approval from the Zoning Hearing Board under Article XX.
(b) Such reconstruction or expansion shall be only upon the same
lot that the nonconforming use was located upon at the time
the use became nonconforming.
(c) The total building floor area used by a nonconforming use or
the total area covered by impervious surfaces of a
nonconforming use shall not be increased by greater than 50%
beyond each such measurement that existed in such use at the
time such use became nonconforming. This maximum increase
shall be measured in aggregate over the entire life of the
nonconformity.
(d) Any expansion of a nonconforming use shall meet the required
setbacks and other requirements of this ordinance, unless the
Zoning Hearing Board grants a variance.
(4) Expansion of nonconforming residential uses. An existing
nonconforming residential use may be expanded in floor area as a
permitted by right use, provided that:
(a) The number of dwelling units is not increased.
(b) The expansion meets all applicable setbacks.
(c) No new types of nonconformities are created.
236. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 190-199 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-199
186:803
(d) A nonconformity is not made more severe (including the
building area within the required setback area).
D. Damaged or destroyed nonconformities.
(1) Except as provided for in Subsection D(3) and J below, a
nonconforming structure that has been destroyed or damaged
equal to 50% or more of its total value by fire, windstorm, lightning
or a similar cause deemed to be not the fault of the owner may
rebuild in a nonconforming fashion only if the application for a
building permit is submitted within 18 months after the date of
damage or destruction, work begins in earnest within 12 months
afterwards and no nonconformity is created or increased by any
reconstruction.
(2) Submittal. Rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed nonconformity
shall not begin until plans for rebuilding have been presented and
approved by the Zoning Officer. Any change of one nonconforming
use to another nonconforming use shall comply with the provisions
of this section.
(3) Agricultural. Nonconforming agricultural structures on farms may
be reestablished or reconstructed as a permitted by right use if
damaged or destroyed, without a time limit.
E. Abandonment of nonconformity.
(1) If a nonconforming use of a structure or land is discontinued,
razed, removed or abandoned for 12 months or longer, subsequent
use of such building or land shall conform with the regulations of
the district in which it is located, except:
(a) As provided for in the damaged or destroyed nonconformities
provisions of this section.
(b) For crop farming.
(c) For Subsection J.
(2) The applicant shall be responsible to provide evidence that the
nonconformity was not abandoned.
F. Changes from one nonconforming use to another.
(1) Once changed to a conforming use, a structure or land shall not
revert to a nonconforming use.
(2) A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming
use only if permitted as a special exception by the Zoning Hearing
Board. The Board shall determine whether the applicant has
provided sufficient proof to show that the proposed new use will be
equally or less objectionable in external effects than the preexisting
nonconforming use with regard to:
§ 190-199 PALMER CODE § 190-199
186:804
§ 190-200. Temporary structure or use.

nonconforming because of a zoning district change shall be regulated
under this section on nonconformities.
H. Floodplains. See § 190-154H of this ordinance.
I. Building permits and nonconformities. When an active building permit
has been lawfully issued prior to the adoption of a section of this
ordinance that makes such activity nonconforming, such use, lot or
structure shall be regulated under the applicable nonconforming
regulations, provided that such construction is completed within a
maximum of 12 months of the issuance of such permit.
J. Nonconforming use of open land. If a nonconforming off-premises
junkyard, outside storage area or similar nonconforming use of open
land is discontinued for 90 days or more, or is damaged or destroyed to
an extent of 50% or more of replacement cost, such structure or use
shall not be continued, repaired or reconstructed.
A. Tents and membrane structures.
(1) In addition to the special exception procedure provided for in this
section, the Zoning Officer may allow the temporary erection of a
tent, membrane or similar temporary structure that is not totally
enclosed for a maximum of seven days in any four-month period for
clearly routine customarily accessory uses such as a wedding in the
rear yard of a dwelling, a festival by a place of worship or a special
sale within the lot of a lawful commercial use.
(2) The Zoning Officer may allow the temporary erection of a tent,
membrane structure or similar temporary structure for a period of
up to a maximum of 180 days in any given calendar year, for clearly
routine customary accessory uses.
(3) All tents, membrane structures or similar temporary structures to
be erected for a total of more than seven days shall require the
submission of a site plan and an application for a zoning permit.
The fee shall be established by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors. Such structure shall comply with all applicable Palmer
Township Code requirements.
§ 190-199 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-200
186:805
B. Removal. Prior to the issuance of a permit for a temporary use or
structure, the applicant shall present a statement from the owner of
record of the land recognizing the application and accepting
responsibility to ensure that the use or structure is removed once the
permit expires. Any temporary structure or use shall be removed
completely upon expiration of the permit without cost to the Township.
If the structure or use is not removed in a timely fashion after proper
notification, the Township may remove the use or structure at the cost
of the person who owns the land upon which the structure or use is
located.
C. Conditions. The temporary use or structure shall be compatible with
adjacent uses and clearly be of a temporary nature. Clearly customary
and incidental accessory uses to a lawful permitted use are permitted
(such as festivals at a place of worship).
D. Construction vehicle parking and temporary offices. The parking of
construction vehicles and temporary construction offices on a site that
is necessary for the actual construction on the same lot or tract that is
actively underway is permitted by right, provided that such vehicles or
offices shall be removed immediately once the type of construction they
relate to is completed or suspended.
E. Food carts. A permitted principal commercial use on lots of more than
20,000 square feet may include the temporary use of a food and
nonalcoholic beverage cart for on-site sales, provided that the following
requirements are met:
(1) The cart is used for maximum periods of four days once in any sixmonth
period. [Amended 11-13-1995 by Ord. No. 261]
(2) The cart is removed within 48 hours after the sales are complete.
(3) The applicant submits a site plan showing that the cart will be welllocated
to avoid pedestrian-vehicle conflicts.
F. Other temporary uses by special exception. A temporary permit may be
issued by the Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception for
structures or uses, other than those types listed as permitted by right in
this section, subject to the following additional provisions:
(1) Duration. The Zoning Hearing Board shall establish a limit on the
duration of the use. In most cases, a temporary approval should
have a maximum term of no longer than two years. In the case of a
special event, except under special circumstances, this term should
be a maximum of six days in any sixty-day period. The Zoning
Hearing Board may grant a single approval once for numerous
occurrences of an event.
(2) Fee. Either the Zoning Hearing Board or the Board of Supervisors
may waive and/or return the required application fee if the
applicant is an Internal Revenue Service recognized and well
§ 190-200 PALMER CODE § 190-200
186:806
§ 190-201. Site plan review procedures for certain uses.
established nonprofit organization, and the applicant clearly shows
that the proposed use is temporary and will be used to clearly
primarily serve a charitable or public service purpose.
(3) Nonprofit. Only a well-established and Internal-Revenue-Servicerecognized
nonprofit organization proposing a temporary use to
clearly primarily serve a charitable or public service purpose shall
be eligible to receive approval for a commercial use in a district
where that use is not permitted.
(4) Special events. For a new special event (not including annual
reoccurrences of a previously held event) that will attract
significant numbers of the public, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
deny the use if it determines that the following will not be generally
appropriate: sanitary and water service, traffic control, off-street
parking and protection of the public health and safety.
A. When site plan required. A site plan review by the Planning Commission
and Board of Supervisors under this section is required for any of the
following uses unless the physical layout of the principal building(s) and
use will be approved under the Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance.
(1) Any aggregate expansion of more than 2,000 square feet in the
floor area of a structure. Aggregate calculation of expansion shall
begin upon adoption of this amendment or December 31, 2001,
whichever is sooner, for all structures of the following types:
[Amended 12-17-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-311]
(2) Any new or expanded paved area of greater than 5,000 square feet.
(3) Conversion of a noncommercial or nonindustrial building to a new
principal commercial use.
(4) Any change from one commercial or industrial use to a different
commercial or industrial use that would require the addition of 15
or more off-street parking spaces beyond what would have been
previously required.
(5) Any conditional use, except a routine replacement of one
commercial use by another commercial use of similar intensity,
within an existing building and using existing parking.
B. Site plan procedures. The following procedures shall be followed for
any use required to be reviewed under this section (See the procedures
in Article XX for procedures for review of a conditional use):

186:807
determine compliance with this ordinance. A minimum of one copy
shall be retained in Township files. The site plan shall include the
information listed in Subsection C below. The Zoning Officer shall
seek a review by the Township Engineer if engineering matters are
involved.
(2) Time. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors shall be
given an opportunity to review the site plan and provide any
advisory comments in writing to the Zoning Officer within the time
limit stated or in Subsection B(3) below.
(3) The Zoning Officer shall review the site plan and determine its
compliance or noncompliance with this ordinance, based upon his/
her review and any comments of the Board of Supervisors and
Planning Commission. The Zoning Officer shall make such
determination within 90 days after the first scheduled Planning
Commission regular meeting following at least 21 days after the
receipt of a complete site plan submission, unless the applicant
grants a written time extension. Such determination shall be
provided in person or through the United States Mail, in writing, to
the applicant or his/her representative.
C. Submission requirements for site plan review. The following
information, as applicable, shall be submitted by the applicant for any
conditional use or any use required to submit a site plan under Article
XX or this section, except for information waived by the Zoning Officer
as not applicable or necessary. If a conditional use review will also need
approval of the physical layout under the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, then the Zoning Officer may permit an
applicant to satisfy the conditional use plan requirement with a plan
meeting the sketch plan requirements of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, provided that such plan provides sufficient
information to determine compliance with this Zoning Ordinance.
(1) A statement describing the proposed use, including proposed
maximum hours of operation, maximum number of employees on
the highest shift and the type of services or type of manufacture.
(2) Layout. A site layout drawn to scale (preferably one inch equals 50
feet) showing the location, dimensions and area of each lot; the
location, dimensions and height of proposed and any existing
structures; the required setback areas; the proposed density of
residential uses; the location and width of proposed or abutting
streets; and the proposed areas to be used for different purposes
within the development, including outdoor storage or display areas.
If the plan involves one phase of what eventually may be a larger
development, then the interrelationships of those phases shall be
shown.

ordinances.
D. Site planning guidelines. The following advisory guidelines are
intended to assist applicants and the Township in developing wellplanned
developments.
(1) Natural features. Seek to minimize grading changes and removal of
mature trees. Seek to preserve the natural beauty of highly visible
areas. Seek to preserve land along creeks and steep hillsides.
(2) Circulation. Seek to separate pedestrian circulation from major
routes of vehicle traffic. Minimize the number of access points
along major roads. Avoid parking spaces backing into through
traffic routes. Ensure adequate capacity of driveways and drivethrough
lanes to avoid traffic backing onto streets.
(3) Utilities. Seek to place as many utility lines as possible
underground.
(4) Signs. Seek to minimize the lighting intensity of signs. Seek to
avoid signs with overly bright, less attractive colors. Consider use
of ground-mounted or wooden signs.
(5) Compatibility. Seek to locate noisier and less compatible uses (such
as loading docks) as far away from homes as possible. Seek to
screen out views of less attractive activities from streets and
homes.
E. Improvement requirements. Any use required to submit a site plan
under this section shall comply with Article X of the Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance, entitled "Design Standards and
Required Improvements," regardless of whether the site plan involves a

impacts, and related costs, of proposed major traffic generating uses; to
require that applicants respond with reasonable proposals to resolve
the negative traffic impacts that their proposed uses will cause on the
public; and to recognize that sufficient federal, state and municipal
funds are not available to resolve traffic problems caused by private
development.
B. Uses requiring traffic study. Any application for any of the following
new uses or expansion of existing uses shall be required to complete a
traffic study and include the findings in a written report. Such
requirement and report shall be based upon the aggregate total
development that can reasonably be expected in all phases of a
development.
(1) Residential: 80 or more new dwelling units.
(2) Commercial: 20,000 square feet or more of new or additional total
floor area.
(3) Office: 30,000 square feet or more of new or additional total floor
area.
(4) Industrial: 60,000 square feet or more of new or additional total
floor area or any truck terminal.
(5) Institutional: 30,000 square feet or more of new or additional total
floor area.
(6) Any use or combination of uses that would generally result greater
than 1,500 trips per day.
(7) Such uses where the Board of Supervisors determines that a traffic
study is needed to address a clearly accident-prone location.
C. Timing. Any required traffic study shall be submitted at the same time
or earlier as any preliminary plan, special exception, conditional use or
construction permit application, whichever is submitted earliest.
§ 190-202 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-203
186:811
D. Costs. The full costs of completing the study and of a review by the
Township Engineer or other Township representative shall be borne by
the applicant.
E. Study area. Prior to initiation of the traffic study, the traffic engineer or
planner shall meet with the Township Engineer to establish the area to
be studied. This area shall be limited to streets and intersections within
a maximum of one mile of the proposed project boundaries, except for a
use of more than 200,000 square feet of commercial floor area or any
use projected to generate more than 3,000 trips per day which shall
have a maximum study area of one mile from the project boundaries.
F. Joint studies. Joint traffic studies between different applicants are
strongly encouraged.
G. Fees. In place of individual traffic studies, the Township Supervisors
may require that an applicant provide a fee in lieu of a study. This fee
shall only be used towards the costs of traffic studies sponsored by the
Township. Any such fee shall be established by resolution or ordinance
of the Board of Supervisors.
H. Project description. Any study shall include a description of the
proposed development, its proposed access and the surrounding street
system. If a development is proposed to occur in stages, each stage
shall be described and taken into account in the study. If the applicant
owns other lands within the study area, reasonable assumptions shall
be made about how that land can be expected to be developed, and
shall be taken into account.
I. Existing traffic conditions. The traffic volumes and service levels during
the a.m. and p.m. peak hours shall be presented for all streets and
intersections in the study area that can reasonably be expected to be
significantly impacted. Traffic volumes shall be based upon actual
counts that occurred within the prior two years, and not upon state
estimates. The locations of all accidents reportable to the State Police
within the study area during a recent two-year period shall be noted.
J. Expected traffic generation. The study shall include an estimate of the
number of trips expected to be generated by the use and any future
stages during the a.m. and p.m. peak hours. Such estimates shall be
based upon the latest published estimates of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, or its successor entity, unless the applicant
provides the Township with estimates and supporting documentation
based upon actual traffic counts of closely similar developments in
Pennsylvania or New Jersey.
K. Projected effects. The study shall take into account not only the use
proposed by the applicant, but also other uses and developments that
have received building permits or preliminary subdivision or land
development approval from a municipality. The study shall project a.m.
and p.m. peak hour traffic volumes and levels of service on impacted
intersections and streets. If the traffic generation by the development
§ 190-203 PALMER CODE § 190-203
186:812
§ 190-204. Stormwater management.
All paved areas, uses and structures involving 3,000 square feet or more
of additional impervious coverage shall comply with the stormwater
management requirements of Article X of the Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, regardless of whether such paved area, use or
structure would be a subdivision or land development.
would be more than 50% greater during any hour other than the a.m.
or p.m. peak hour on adjacent streets, the study shall analyze both the
peak hours for the development and for adjacent streets. The study
shall project what directions the traffic generated will head towards.
L. Levels of service. The study shall estimate the levels of service (A, B, C,
D, E and F), for key traffic movements, including turning movements,
following the standards of the U. S. Department of Transportation.
M. Signal warrants. Heavily traveled intersections at entrances to the
development and other major unsignalized intersections in the study
area shall be studied to determine whether a traffic signal is warranted
by PennDOT criteria. Existing traffic signals that are significantly
impacted shall be studied to determine whether they are in need of
upgrading.
N. Needed improvements. The study may take into account traffic
improvements which are clearly funded and will occur within the next
four years. The study shall include suggestions for how each congested
or hazardous intersection in the study area should be improved to
reduce the hazard or congestion and a rough estimate of the cost of that
improvement.
O. Applicant's response. The applicant shall respond to the traffic study
with proposals on what traffic improvements, right-of-way dedications
or commitments of financing for specific projects the applicant
proposes to commit to resolve the negative traffic impacts of the
proposed development. Such improvements or financing may be staged
in relation to the stages of the development. The applicant may also
agree to commit towards the long-term support of a program to reduce
peak-hour traffic by private vehicles through programs such as van
pooling, support of mass transit or staggered work hours in place of
certain structural improvements.
P. Completion of improvements. Any traffic improvements that are
required as a condition of any approval under this ordinance or the
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance shall be in place or
sufficient funds committed in escrow acceptable to the Township prior
to the issuance of any needed occupancy permit, or within a staged
process agreed to at the time of approval.

§ 190-205. Recreation land, open space and fees requirements.
See the requirements of the Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance. The pre-existing recreation fee regulations of this section shall
continue to be in force for any use granted a zoning permit or building
permit at the time such regulation was in effect.
§ 190-206. Industrial and commercial driveways.
A driveway or accessway serving a principal business use shall be deemed
to be integral with such use and shall not be a permitted use in a residential
district. This restriction shall not apply to a driveway or accessway that will
be clearly limited to use by only emergency vehicles.

ARTICLE XX
Additional Requirements for Specific Uses
§ 190-207. Process for uses permitted by right with additional
requirements.
Each use that is listed in the applicable zoning district as a permitted
by right use and that also is listed in this Article XX shall comply with
the provisions in this Article in addition to the other requirements of this
ordinance. If two requirements specifically differ, the most restrictive
requirement shall apply. The determination of compliance shall be made by
the Zoning Officer. A site plan submission and review may also be required
under § 190-201.
§ 190-208. Process for conditional uses.
A. Purpose. Before a zoning permit can be issued for any use listed as a
conditional use in this ordinance, a site plan shall be submitted and the
proposed use shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission and
approved or disapproved by the Township Board of Supervisors. This
procedure is provided because of the considerable impact that these
uses tend to have on a community.
B. Procedure.
(1) The Zoning Officer shall deny a zoning permit for the proposed
development until written approval of the Board of Supervisors is
obtained.
(2) All applicants for a conditional use shall submit four sets of site
plans for the proposed use to the Zoning Officer as part of the
application for a zoning permit. The site plan requirement may be
waived by the Zoning Officer for uses not involving new
construction or expansion of buildings nor additional off-street
parking. Plans shall be submitted a minimum of 21 days prior to the
first Planning Commission meeting at which the plans are intended
to be discussed. [Amended 5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
(3) All site plans shall contain the information listed in § 190-201,
unless otherwise stated.
(4) The Zoning Officer should forward one copy to the Planning
Commission within five days of receiving the submission, and the
Planning Commission after receiving such plans should consider
the matter at the next regular Planning Commission meeting.
(5) The Planning Commission shall be given an opportunity to provide
a written recommendation to the Board of Supervisors concerning
whether to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the
application. Such action may list proposed conditions. If
disapproval is recommended, the reasons should be stated. Any
recommendation of the Planning Commission shall be provided to
§ 190-207 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-208
186:815
the Board of Supervisors and be mailed to the last known address
of the applicant or hand delivered to the applicant.
(6) The conditional use applications shall be scheduled for a hearing at
a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Supervisors within
60 days of the date that the applicant filed his application for
conditional use with the Township. The Board of Supervisors shall
review the submission and the recommendation of the Planning
Commission, as well as the Township Engineer, along with any
other evidence presented at the time of hearing. At the close of the
hearing, the Board of Supervisors may decide to either approve the
application, disapprove the application, or approve the application
with conditions imposed. The hearing shall be stenographically
recorded. [Amended 5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
(7) The decision of the Board of Supervisors shall be in writing and
shall be mailed to the applicant by ordinary mail at his or her last
known address not later than 45 days following the decision.
[Amended 5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
(8) The applicant shall pay an application fee, as well as a deposit, in
accordance with the official fee schedule to be held in escrow to
cover the costs of a stenographer, advertising costs and other
reasonable costs incurred with having the plan reviewed by the
Township Planning Commission, the Township Engineer, and Board
of Supervisors. In addition, if an applicant appeals from the
decision of the Board of Supervisors, the applicant shall be
responsible for paying for the costs of having a transcript of that
hearing produced and the Township shall pay for the cost of having
any copies made. (Fees to be set by resolution of the Board of
Supervisors.) [Added 5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
C. Approval of conditional uses.
(1) Standards. The Board of Supervisors shall approve a proposed
conditional use if the Supervisors find adequate evidence that any
proposed use will meet:
(a) All of the standards listed in Subsections D and E.
(b) All of the specific standards for the proposed use listed in
§§ 190-210 and 190-211.
(c) All other applicable sections of this ordinance.
(2) Conditions. In granting a conditional use, the Board of Supervisors
may require such reasonable conditions and safeguards (in
addition to those expressed in this ordinance) as the Supervisors
may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this ordinance
and to protect the public health and safety and to ensure
compatibility between differing land uses.
§ 190-208 PALMER CODE § 190-208
186:816
D. General standards. Each conditional use shall comply with all of the
following general standards:
(1) Conform with the spirit, purposes, intent and all applicable
requirements of this ordinance.
(2) Conform with all applicable provisions of all other Township
ordinances.
(3) Conform with all applicable state and federal laws, regulations and
requirements.
(4) Be suitable for the particular location in question.
(5) Not be detrimental to the public health, general welfare, safety or
morals.
(6) Not threaten significant damage to public or private property from
inadequate or improper stormwater management. This condition
shall not be basis of a decision under the Zoning Ordinance if the
use will be required to have a detailed stormwater management
plan approved by the Board of Supervisors under the Subdivision
and Land Development Ordinance.
(7) Not significantly adversely threaten the desirable character of an
existing residential area.
(8) Not threaten a significant fire, explosive, public health or toxic
hazard or other hazard to public safety.
E. The following criteria shall be used as a guide in evaluating a proposed
conditional use:
(1) The presence of adjoining similar uses.
(2) The presence of an adjoining zoning district in which the use is
permitted.
(3) Sufficient area to effectively screen the conditional use from
adjacent uses that are not completely compatible.
(4) A lack of negative impacts on existing or potential permitted uses
of the district or neighboring areas, especially on abutting lots.
(5) The use of sufficient safeguards such as parking, traffic control,
screening and setbacks to resolve any potential adverse influences
the use may have on adjoining uses.
(6) See also Subsection F, regarding road capacity.
F. Road capacity, as a condition.
(1) Intent.
§ 190-208 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-208
186:817
§ 190-209. Process for reviewing special exceptions. [Amended
5-20-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-316]
(a) To ensure that the existing road network is able to handle
additional traffic from intensive types of development. This
section recognizes that state and federal funds are limited for
road improvements. This section is specifically based upon the
findings, goals, objectives and recommendations of the
Township Comprehensive Plan.
(b) This section specifically recognizes the threat of traffic hazards
that could be created by new left-hand turns onto minor
arterial roads at access points without traffic signals. It also
recognizes the many existing congested and hazardous
intersections as described in the Palmer Township
Comprehensive Plan, Background Studies and the Palmer
Township Transportation Plan.
(c) Of particular concern is the possibility of retail uses that would
generate intense traffic that would flow onto William Penn
Highway and Greenwood Avenue, a primarily residential
street. Also severe existing conflicts exist between residential
homes and commercial/generated traffic in the Seipsville area.
(2) A traffic impact report may be required by § 190-203 or be
volunteered by an applicant or by any interested party.
(3) The provisions of § 165-59M, entitled "Required traffic
improvements," of the Township Subdivision and Land
Development Ordinance, shall also apply to any conditional use
that involves construction of one or more new principal buildings.
(4) The Board of Supervisors shall review any professional traffic
studies that are presented. If these traffic studies provide
substantive evidence that the existing road system is unable to
handle the projected traffic at an acceptable level or that very
serious traffic hazards would be created, the Supervisors, after
reviewing any recommendations of the Planning Commission, the
Joint Planning Commission and the PA Department of
Transportation, may deny a conditional use application.
(5) In reviewing the ability of the road system to handle the projected
traffic, the Supervisors shall also consider commitments by a
development to partially or wholly fund needed road improvements
that would provide the needed road capacity and safety. Such
improvements may be funded in stages relating directly to the
stages of a development, with adequate provisions for
improvement guaranties.
§ 190-208 PALMER CODE § 190-209
186:818
A. Purpose. The special exception process is designed to allow careful
review of uses that could cause some potential conflicts with adjacent
uses or areas.
B. Procedure.
(1) The Zoning Officer shall deny a zoning permit for the proposed
development until written approval of the Zoning Hearing Board is
obtained.
(2) All applicants for a special exception use shall submit four sets of
site plans for the proposed use to the Zoning Hearing Board as part
of the application for a zoning permit. This may be waived by the
Zoning Officer for nonintensive home occupations and other uses
not involving new construction nor additional off-street parking.
(3) All site plans shall contain the information required in § 190-201,
except that engineering matters that will be addressed as part of a
future required land development or subdivision submittal need not
be provided in detail in a special exception application.
(4) The Zoning Officer shall forward one copy of the site plan to the
Planning Commission within five days of receiving the submission.
(5) The Zoning Officer shall, prior to the next regularly scheduled
Zoning Hearing Board meeting, review the plan to determine
compliance with this ordinance and submit a written report to the
Zoning Hearing Board.
(6) All applications for special exceptions shall be reviewed by the
Planning Commission of Palmer Township. The Planning
Commission shall be given an opportunity to provide a written
recommendation to the Zoning Hearing Board concerning whether
to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application.
Such action may list proposed conditions. If this approval is not
recommended, the reason should be stated. Any recommendation
of the Planning Commission shall be provided to the Zoning
Hearing Board and be mailed to the last known address of the
applicant or hand delivered to the applicant.
(7) The Board shall not decide the case without reviewing any reports
received from the Zoning Officer and Planning Commission that
may have been received. If such reports are not made, the Board
may still hold the hearing and decide the request.
(8) The Board shall hear and decide such request for a special
exception use under the procedures of Article XXI and the PA
Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.237

accordance with the official fee schedule to be held in escrow to
cover the costs of a stenographer, advertising costs and other
reasonable costs incurred in connection with having the plan
reviewed by the Township Planning Commission and the Township
Engineer. Plans shall be submitted a minimum of 21 days prior to
the first Planning Commission meeting at which time the plans are
intended to be discussed. (Fees to be set by the Board of
Supervisors.)
C. Approval of special exception uses.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board shall approve any proposed special
exception use if it finds adequate evidence that any proposed use
will meet:
(a) All of the standards listed in § 190-208D and the guidelines in
§ 190-208E, which are hereby included by reference.
[Amended 11-13-1995 by Ord. No. 261]
(b) All of the specific standards for the proposed use listed in
§§ 190-210 and 190-211.
(c) All other applicable requirements of this ordinance.
(2) In granting a special exception, the Board may require such
reasonable conditions and safeguards (in addition to those
expressed in this ordinance) as the Board may deem necessary to
implement the purposes of this ordinance and to protect the public
health and safety and to ensure compatibility between differing
land uses.
D. Conditions imposed by the Zoning Hearing Board shall automatically
become conditions of the building permit issued pursuant thereto, and
any failure to comply with said conditions shall be a violation of this
ordinance.
A. In addition to the general standards governing conditional uses and
special exceptions provided for in this ordinance, an applicant seeking
approval from the Zoning Hearing Board or Board of Supervisors must
also demonstrate through the production of competent evidence that
the specific standards and conditions associated with the respective
individual uses have or will be satisfied.

section recognizes that if not properly installed, a satellite
antenna may create a threat to the safety of persons and
property. This section recognizes that if not properly screened
and sited, satellite antennas could result in visual blight and
disturb the character of residential neighborhoods. This
section also recognizes that satellite antennas have the threat
of being substantially more of a nuisance and a visual blight
than most other forms of electronic antenna. The reasons for
this special concern about satellite antenna include the usual
solidness of the structure (which makes it more visible), the
occasional desire to place satellite antenna on front yards and
the fronts of roofs and the overall size of satellite antenna
compared to most other noncommercial antenna.

§ 190-211 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-211
186:885
(d) Size and height.
[1] A satellite antenna shall have a maximum diameter of nine
feet in an LDR, MDR or HDR District and 20 feet in any
other district.

of 11 feet above the average ground level in an LDR, MDR
or HDR District.
[3] In any district other than LDR, MDR or HDR, a satellite
antenna shall have a maximum height if ground-mounted
of 25 feet above the average ground level or 20 feet above
the highest point of a roof if roof-mounted.
(e) Colors. Earth tones are strongly encouraged.

minimum of 200 feet from all exterior lot lines, the
requirements of this section shall not be binding, other than
the total height requirements.
(g) Mobile stands. Satellite antenna on mobile stands are
prohibited except as may be initially needed to determine the
best location for an antenna.

residential lot line. The structural sides of the pool sides shall
be at least five feet from any basement.
(f) The swimming pool area or the entire property on which it is
located shall be so walled or fenced or include such sides of an
aboveground pool as to prevent uncontrolled access by

(4) Fees. See § 190-220.
E. Zoning Hearing Board functions. In addition to any other
responsibilities stated in the PA Municipalities Planning Code, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall be responsible for the following:
(1) Appeal of a decision by the Zoning Officer.
(a) The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by
the appellant (a person affected or any agency of the Township)
that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed
procedures or has misinterpreted or misapplied any valid
provision of this ordinance.
(b) See time limitations for appeals in Subsection G.
(2) Challenge to the validity of the ordinance or map.
(a) The Board shall hear challenges to the validity of this
ordinance filed with the Board, in writing, by the landowner
affected, any officer or agency of the Township or any person
aggrieved.
(b) After the conclusion of the hearing(s), the Board shall decide
all questions and shall make findings on all relevant issues of
fact, within the time limits of the PA Municipalities Planning
Code.
(3) Variance.
(a) The Board shall hear requests for variances filed with the
Board in writing by any landowner (or any tenant with the
permission of such landowner).
(b) Standards. The Board may grant a variance only within the
limitations of state law. (As of 1993, the Municipalities
Planning Code provided that all of the following findings must
be made, where relevant:
[1] There are unique physical circumstances or conditions
(including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot
size or shape or exceptional topographical or other
physical conditions peculiar to the particular property)
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such
conditions and not the circumstances or conditions
generally created by the provisions of this ordinance in the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located.
§ 190-215 PALMER CODE § 190-215
186:896
[2] Because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed
in strict conformity with the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance and a variance is therefore necessary to enable
the reasonable use of the property.
[3] Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
[4] The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the
property is located, nor substantially or permanently
impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent
property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare.
[5] The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
(c) In granting any variance, the Board may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purposes of this ordinance.
(4) Special exception.
(a) The Board shall hear and decide requests for all special
exceptions filed with the Board in writing by any landowner (or
any tenant with the permission of such landowner), as provided
in this ordinance and in accordance with such standards and
criteria contained in this ordinance and the procedures in
§ 190-209.
(b) Conditions. In granting a special exception, the Zoning
Hearing Board may attach such reasonable conditions and
safeguards, in addition to those expressed in this ordinance, as
it may deem necessary to implement the purposes and intent of
this ordinance.
(5) Hearings. See § 190-216.
(6) Records and reports. The staff to the Board shall keep full public
records of its business.
(7) Court appeals. In the case of an appeal from the Board to the Court
of Common Pleas, the appellant shall make the return required by
law and should promptly notify the Township Zoning Hearing Board
Solicitor of such appeal.
(8) Appeal by the Zoning Officer. See § 190-217. [Amended 7-1-2002
by Ord. No. 2002-320]
F. Applications to the Board. See § 190-213D.
§ 190-215 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-215
186:897
G. Time limitations for appeals. The time limitations for appeals shall be as
follows:
(1) No person shall be allowed to file any appeal with the Zoning
Hearing Board later than 30 days after the decision by the Zoning
Officer that is being appealed has been officially issued or appeal
with the County Court of Common Pleas later than 30 days after a
decision of the Zoning Hearing Board has been officially issued,
except as may be provided under Section 914.1 of the PA
Municipalities Planning Code.251
(2) The failure of an aggrieved person other than the landowner to
appeal an adverse decision directly related to a preliminary
subdivision or land development plan shall preclude an appeal from
a final plan approval except in the case where the final submission
substantially deviates from the approved preliminary plan.
(3) This thirty-day time limit for appeals shall not apply to the
revocation of a permit by the Township under § 190-213F.
H. Stay of proceedings. See Section 916 of the PA Municipalities Planning
Code.252
I. Time limitations on permits and variances.
(1) After a variance is approved or approval is officially authorized
under this ordinance, then a permit shall be secured by the
applicant within six months after the date of such approval or
authorization. Such action under such permit shall then begin
within 12 months of the issuance of the permit. For completion
deadlines for exterior work, see § 190-213E(6).
(2) If the applicant submits complete plans for a required site plan
review or subdivision or land development approval or special
exception or conditional use approval that is related to the variance
or issuance of a permit under this ordinance within the above time
limits, then such time limits shall begin after such plan review is
completed or such plan approval is granted.
(3) For good cause the Zoning Officer may, upon application in writing
stating the reasons therefore, extend in writing the application
period to up to 18 months.
(4) If an applicant fails to obtain the necessary permits within the
above time period or after obtaining the permit fails to diligently
commence substantial construction within 12 months or allows
interruptions in substantial construction of longer than six months,
it shall be conclusively presumed that the applicant has waived,

development meeting the traditional village option requirements of this
Article XXII and all other applicable Township requirements.

ordinances shall apply except those provisions specifically permitted by
this article to be modified.

involves a minimum of 10 acres and a minimum of 40 principal uses
(which may include 40 dwelling units). [Amended 12-29-2009 by
Ord. No. 2009-389]
D. A traditional village shall only apply within the following zoning
districts: HDR, MDR, LDR, C-R and PO/B.

address regional or off-site traffic concerns, regional stormwater
controls or other infrastructure improvements of a substantial
nature, as may be identified through the Township Comprehensive
Plan, regional transportation plan, Township Capital Improvements
Plan or other infrastructure improvement needs that would not
otherwise be required by this ordinance. The density bonus

per acre for low-rise or mid-rise apartments or 10 units per
acre for townhouses. [Amended 1-29-2013 by Ord. No.
2013-420]

the form of either the actual construction of the identified
improvements or a payment to the Township in the amount of

186:906
the determined improvement value. As part of the conditional
use approval, the Board of Supervisors shall determine the
required form of the improvements.
(c) Infrastructure improvements provided in exchange for bonus
density are in addition to any on-site or off-site transportation
or infrastructure improvements required under the Zoning
Ordinance or Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance.260

vehicle garages are entered from driveways from the rear of the
lot.
(2) Ten percent in all other cases.
C. Setbacks.
(1) The minimum side and rear principal building setbacks that would
otherwise be permitted may be decreased by 15%, except all
setback requirements in the applicable district regulations shall
still apply abutting the exterior lot lines of the traditional village.

buildings may be set back from any exterior lot lines of a tract a
minimum distance of 10 feet, except a minimum distance of 80 feet
shall be required from the lot line of an existing single-family
detached dwelling. A minimum twenty-foot-wide buffer yard with
screening, as described in § 190-194D, shall be provided between
any such structure and any abutting existing single-family
detached dwelling. The buffer yard and screening shall be the
responsibility of the developer of low-rise or mid-rise apartments.
[Added 12-29-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-389; amended
1-29-2013 by Ord. No. 2013-420]

Supervisors, after a recommendation by the Planning Commission,
an applicant may place a maximum of 50% of the required off-street

§ 190-252 WEEDS; VISUAL OBSTRUCTIONS § 190-253
186:927
§ 190-254. Streetscape performance regulations.
trees placed between the fence and the property line. At least
80% of the total surface shall be opaque, with exception of
the first four inches between the ground and the fence. For
purpose of the buffer yard, chain link fences are not permitted.
(e) All building mechanical systems such as air-conditioning units,
exhaust systems, satellite dishes, elevator housing, and
dumpsters shall be integrated into the overall design and
character of the building. Landscaping and other screening
devices, including decorative fencing, shall be used to soften
the view of these features from adjoining properties.
(f) The rear buffer shall be installed and permanently maintained
by the applicant and successive landowners. Plants that are
needed to form the visual screen, which die or are removed,
shall be replaced by the landowner within five months of
notification by the Township.
(2) Parking areas.
(a) Where paved vehicular areas occur in a side yard that abuts a
residential district or use, such paved areas shall have a
permanent continuous row of bushes, four feet high at the time
of planting, with sufficient density to block car lights from
shining into the adjoining property. Upon written approval
from the adjoining (i.e., affected) property owner, a four-foot
fence with 90% opaqueness may be substituted for the
continuous row of bushes, provided that it is not a chain-linkstyle
fence.
(b) The side yard buffer shall be provided by the developer or
property owner for all new land developments, changes of uses
and/or replacement with same use, and for buildings
reconstructed or rehabilitated over 25% of the assessed tax
value or for buildings expanded by 10% of the square footage
or more.
A. Sidewalks.
(1) Sidewalks shall be provided for all parcels within the Route 248
Overlay District. Sidewalks shall be provided by the developer or
property owner for all new land developments, changes of uses
and/or replacement with the same use, and for buildings
reconstructed or rehabilitated over 25% of the assessed tax value
or for buildings expanded by 10% of the square footage or more.
(2) Sidewalks shall be constructed in accordance with Township
specifications (see Chapter 160, Street and Sidewalks, of the
Township Code) and installed to connect to the lot line of adjacent
parcels. Sidewalks constructed along Route 248 shall begin at the

(1) Illumination of signs beyond what is customary in a residential area
shall be prohibited within the LDR, MDR, HDR, HDR-2 and C-R
Districts. No sign shall be excessively illuminated beyond which is
necessary for the sign to be readable. Internally illuminated signs
shall be prohibited in all residential districts in the Township.
Where permitted in nonresidential districts, internally illuminated
signs shall have a dark background with illuminated text that
accounts for a maximum of 20% total sign area.
(2) Externally illuminated signs shall be illuminated by a white, steady,
stationary light. External light shall be of reasonable intensity
directed at the sign without light spillover and without causing
glare for motorists, pedestrians or neighboring properties. Signs
may be backlighted with a diffused or shielded light source if
deemed necessary by the Township to controlling glare.
Backlighting shall illuminate the letters, characters or graphics on
the sign, but not its background, in order to shine only on the face
of the sign and not spill over into the property.
(3) Hours of illumination. Signs shall be lit during office hours or
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., whichever is less.
All existing internally illuminated signs in a residential zoning
district shall be lit during office hours only.
A. Interconnection of off-street parking areas.
(1) To reduce traffic congestion and the number of curb cuts along
public streets, parking areas shall be connected to adjacent parcels
through rear or side yard access road. The intent is to provide a
secondary point of access in a grid pattern to uses within the Route
248 Overlay District. Where a parking area is constructed and is
adjacent to an undeveloped nonresidential parcel, the access drive
shall be extended to the lot line for future connection.
(2) The use of shared access points is strongly recommended. Where
possible, two adjacent uses may share ingress and egress points to

shine back toward the principal building and shall not spill any
light or glare onto the adjacent property.
(2) Lighting fixtures shall have hoods or shields to manage the light
from spilling over unnecessarily.
(3) Lighting shall be coordinated with landscaping in parking areas.
C. Parking.
(1) Off-street parking areas shall be oriented to the rear or side of
structures to create a unified streetscape and minimize congestion.
Parking and loading shall conform to the standards in § 190-198 of
the Township Zoning Ordinance. A limit of three parking spaces
may be provided on the side of the building that faces a public
street in order to decrease the stacking of vehicles and "back up"
on to a public street. For corner lots, the front yard shall be
determined by side fronting onto the primary street, and the
secondary street frontage shall be considered a side yard.
A. All buildings in the Route 248 corridor overlay shall provide a
prominent and highly visible street-level doorway or entrance along the
front or side of the building that faces a public street.
B. In order to maintain the character of the area, blank walls shall not be
permitted to face a public street. The street level facade of any building
facing a public street or access drive shall be at least 15% transparent.
These requirements shall apply to all new land developments and
existing buildings reconstructed over 50% of tax value.
C. Exterior wall materials that are not permitted in the Route 248 corridor
overlay include: large split face blocks, tilt-up concrete panels,
prefabricated steel panels, and standard concrete masonry units.
A. For all home conversions to a nonresidential use (permitted only as a
conditional use), a land development plan shall be required.
§ 190-256 PALMER CODE § 190-258
