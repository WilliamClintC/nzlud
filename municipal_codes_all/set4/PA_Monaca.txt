§ 100-7 MONACA CODE § 100-7
100:98
(a) Review the rate application and documentation submitted by
the cable operator(s);
(b) Compare the current rates or the proposed rate increase
submitted by the cable operator(s) with the maximum
permitted rates or with such other applicable standards as
have been adopted and/or approved by the FCC;
(c) Consider any public input on the rate application which may

or seek additional time to consider the rate application within said
30 days, the rate application shall be deemed approved on the 30th
day after submission.
B. Request for additional time.
(1) Rate application. If the franchising authority is unable to determine
from the rate application, including any supporting documentation
submitted by the cable operator(s), whether the current rates for
the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation
necessary to receive the basic service tier and/or the proposed rate
increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising
authority may, in cases not involving cost-of-service showings, take
an additional 90 days to consider the rate application.
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the
same upon the cable operator(s), indicating that additional
time is required to consider the rate application. The order
shall be issued prior to the expiration of the 30 days during
which the franchising authority may consider the rate
application. Within 10 days of issuance of such order, the
franchising authority shall publish notice in a newspaper of
general circulation within the jurisdiction of the franchising
authority, which notice shall contain a summary of the order,
including the additional time requested and the reason for
requesting such additional time.

it believes will cure any deficiencies in the rate application
during the additional time.

furnish additional specified information, including proprietary
information, when the current rate or proposed rate increase is
in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current
rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate, the
franchising authority may only require furnishing of
§ 100-7 CABLE TELEVISION § 100-7
100:99
documentation that the rate is within the maximum permitted
rate.
(d) If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the
expiration of the additional time, the current rates or proposed
rate increase shall become effective, subject to any later
refund order adopted by the franchising authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchising authority, in
order to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order,
direct the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose
behalf such amounts were paid.
(2) Cost-of-service rate application. If the cable operator(s) has
submitted a cost-of-service rate application and the franchising
authority is unable to determine whether the current rates for the
basic service tier and/or for the equipment and installation
necessary to receive the basic service tier and/or the proposed rate
increase are within the maximum permitted rates, the franchising
authority may take an additional 150 days to consider the cost-ofservice
rate application.
(a) The franchising authority shall issue an order and serve the
same upon the cable operator(s), indicating that additional
time is required to consider the rate application because it is a
cost-of-service rate application. The order shall be issued prior
to the expiration of the 30 days during which the franchising
authority may consider the rate application. Within 10 days of
issuance of such order, the franchising authority shall publish
notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the
jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice shall
contain a summary of the order, including the additional time
requested and the reason for requesting such additional time.
(b) The franchising authority may require the cable operator(s) to
furnish additional specified information, including proprietary
information, when the current rate or proposed rate increase is
in excess of the maximum permitted rate. When the current
rate is equal to or below the maximum permitted rate, the
franchising authority may only require furnishing of
documentation that the rate is within the maximum permitted
rate.
(c) If no decision is issued by the franchising authority at the
expiration of the additional time, the current rates or proposed
rate increase shall become effective, subject to any later
refund order adopted by the franchising authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the franchising authority, in
order to later order a refund, must, within the text of the order,
direct the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate account of all
§ 100-7 MONACA CODE § 100-7
100:100
amounts received by reason of the rate in issue and on whose
behalf such amounts were paid.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
article, the franchising authority may, pursuant to a petition for
special relief filed with the FCC, request the FCC to examine a
cable operator's cost-of-service rate application, and such
procedures and deadlines as specified by rule or order of the
FCC shall control.
C. Decision of the franchising authority.
(1) The franchising authority shall issue a written opinion when:
(a) The rate application is not approved, in whole or in part, by the
franchising authority.
(b) The rate application is approved by the franchising authority
over the objections of any interested party.
(2) The franchising authority may, but is not required, to issue a
written opinion when the rate application is approved and there
have been no objections filed.
(3) Within 10 days of issuance of an opinion, the franchising authority
shall provide notice in a newspaper of general circulation within
the jurisdiction of the franchising authority, which notice shall
contain at a minimum:
(a) That the franchising authority has reached a decision on the
rate application and announcing that decision.
(b) The manner in which interested parties may review and/or
obtain copies of the opinion.
(c) The right of interested parties to take an appeal from the
opinion of the franchising authority.
(d) The deadline for taking any such appeal.
(4) Notice of the opinion of the franchising authority shall be provided
to the cable operator(s) by mail within seven days of issuance.
D. Disapproval of the rate application.
(1) Rate reduction.
(a) Current rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an
opinion disapproving the current rates of the cable operator(s)
for the basic service tier or for rates for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier, the
franchising authority may order a reduction in the current
rates for the basic service tier and/or for the equipment and
installation necessary to receive the basic service tier. The
§ 100-7 CABLE TELEVISION § 100-7
100:101
prospective rate adjustment may be set at a level consistent
with the FCC-adopted maximum permitted rates, another rate
based on review of a cost-of-service rate application or another
rate consistent with FCC rules.
(b) Proposed rates. If the franchising authority shall issue an
opinion disapproving of any proposed rate increase, the
franchising authority may:
[1] Prescribe a reasonable rate to be charged by the cable
operator(s) instead of the proposed rate. The prescribed
rate may not be lower than the maximum permitted rate
unless a cost-of-service rate application has been
submitted by the cable operator(s) and the franchising
authority determines that the cost-of-service analysis
justifies a lower rate; or
[2] Advise the cable operator(s) of a rate level to which it
would not object if a modified rate application were
resubmitted.
(2) Refunds. The franchising authority may order a refund if:
(a) The cable operator failed to comply with a rate decision by the
franchising authority. The refund period may be retroactive to
the effective date of the rate order issued by the franchising
authority.
(b) The franchising authority determines in its initial review of the
current rates that they exceed the maximum permitted rates
and are unsupported by a cost-of-service rate application. In
such instance, the refund period may be retroactive to
September 1, 1993, or one year prior to the date on which the
cable operator(s) implements the prospective rate adjustment,
whichever is shorter.
(c) The franchising authority has issued an order permitting it to
take an additional 90 or 150 days to consider a rate application
and has directed the cable operator(s) to keep an accurate
account of all amounts received by reason of the rate in issue
and on whose behalf such amounts were paid but failed to
issue an opinion during that time period, causing the rates to
become provisionally effective, and the franchising authority
later finds all or a portion of the rates to be unreasonable. In
such instance, the refund period may be retroactive to the date
of the order and ending on the date on which the cable
operator(s) implements the prospective rate reduction or one
year, whichever is shorter.
(3) Before any refund order shall become effective, the franchising
authority must send notice to the cable operator(s) and provide
said cable operator(s) a maximum of 30 days to submit additional

parties.
§ 100-10. Complaints; information to be included on billing.
information to the franchising authority as to why the refund
should not be ordered. At the end of said period, the franchising
authority shall either confirm, amend or rescind said refund order.
(4) Refunds shall include interest computed at applicable rates
published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and
additional tax payments.
(5) If any proposed rate increase has gone into effect due to inaction of
the franchising authority or the failure of the franchising authority
to issue an order stating a need for additional time, the franchising
authority has no right to order a refund.
(6) Any violation of any order issued hereunder shall be considered a
violation of this article.
A. Cumulative remedies. Where this article provides alternative penalties
or remedies, they shall be cumulative, and the imposition of one penalty
or remedy shall not prevent the franchising authority from invoking any
other penalty or remedy provided herein.
B. In addition to all other rights and remedies provided herein, the
franchising authority shall have all rights and remedies afforded under
the franchise agreement.46
C. Unless otherwise provided, any person convicted of violating any
provision of this article, including any order issued or any rule or
regulation promulgated hereunder, shall, upon conviction, be fined not
more than $600 and costs for each offense and, in default of payment

The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,57 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of Monaca Borough does hereby order as
follows.

provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those
provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the
provisions of this chapter, the more restrictive shall apply.
§ 131-5. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
A. Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
B. Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in order
to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
C. Minimize danger to public health by protecting water supply and
natural drainage.
D. Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing excessive development in areas

structures.
A. The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this chapter
is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
accepted engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur or
flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such as
ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not
imply that areas outside any identified floodplain areas, or that land
uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of Monaca Borough or
any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from

The Floodplain Administrator may 1) fulfill the duties and
responsibilities set forth in these regulations, 2) delegate duties and

entity shall not relieve the community of its responsibilities pursuant to
the participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance
Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations at 44 CFR

ARTICLE IV
Floodplain Areas
§ 131-16. Identification.
§ 131-17. Description.
The identified floodplain area shall consist of the following specific areas:
A. The identified floodplain area shall be any areas of Monaca Borough
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs)
dated August 17, 2015, and issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent revision thereof,
including all digital data developed as part of the Flood Insurance
Study.
B. The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent revisions
and amendments, are hereby adopted by Monaca Borough and declared
to be a part of this chapter.
A. The floodway area shall be those areas identified in the FIS and the
FIRM as floodway and which represent the channel of a watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge
the base flood without increasing the water surface elevation by more
than one foot at any point. This term shall also include floodway areas
which have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special flood hazard areas where no floodway has
been identified in the FIS and FIRM.
(1) Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development,
shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with
standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment
would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
(2) Within any floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed, unless the appropriate permit is obtained from the
Department of Environmental Protection Regional Office.
B. AE Area/District.
(1) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which base
flood elevations have been provided.
(2) The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which base flood elevations have been provided and a
floodway has been delineated.
§ 131-16 FIRES, CONDUCT AT § 131-17
129:137
§ 131-18. Changes in identification of area.
The identified floodplain area may be revised or modified by the Council
where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or person
documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any such change
to the special flood hazard area, approval must be obtained from FEMA.
Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the
date such information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA
of the changes to the special flood hazard area by submitting technical
or scientific data. See § 131-21B for situations where FEMA notification is
required.
§ 131-19. Boundary disputes.
Should a dispute concerning any identified floodplain boundary arise, an
initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and
any party aggrieved by this decision or determination may appeal to the
Council. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant.
§ 131-20. Jurisdictional boundary changes.
Prior to development occurring in areas where annexation or other
corporate boundary changes are proposed or have occurred, the community
shall review flood hazard data affecting the lands subject to boundary
changes. The community shall adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in
areas subject to annexation or corporate boundary changes which meet or
exceed those in 44 CFR 60.3.
C. The A Area/District shall be those areas identified as an A Zone on the
FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no base
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
sources shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the base flood elevation shall be
determined by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction site. In lieu
of the above, the municipality may require the applicant to determine
the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques.
Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who
shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc.,
shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the municipality.

§ 131-22. Elevation and floodproofing requirements.
A. Alteration or relocation of watercourse.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the
municipality and until all required permits or approvals have first
been obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
(2) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that the activity
will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of the
watercourse in any way.
(3) In addition, FEMA and the Pennsylvania Department of Community
and Economic Development shall be notified prior to any alteration
or relocation of any watercourse.
B. When Monaca Borough proposes to permit the following
encroachments: any development that causes a rise in the base flood
elevations within the floodway; or any development occurring in Zones
A1-30 and Zone AE without a designated floodway which will cause a
rise of more than one foot in the base flood elevation; or alteration or
relocation of a stream (including but not limited to installing culverts
and bridges), the applicant shall (as per 44 CFR 65.12):
(1) Apply to FEMA for conditional approval of such action prior to
permitting the encroachments to occur.
(2) Upon receipt of the Administrator's conditional approval of map
change and prior to approving the proposed encroachments, a
community shall provide evidence to FEMA of the adoption of
floodplain management ordinances incorporating the increased
base flood elevations and/or revised floodway reflecting the postproject
condition.
(3) Upon completion of the proposed encroachments, a community
shall provide as-built certifications. FEMA will initiate a final map
revision upon receipt of such certifications in accordance with 44
CFR Part 67.
C. Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed within
any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict compliance
with the provisions contained in this chapter and any other applicable
codes, ordinances and regulations.

set forth below.

impose any additional civil/criminal liability upon owners other
than that which is imposed by existing law.

other enforcement remedies which may be available to the

not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the owner or
occupant; and
(b) The agreement does not diminish or affect the obligation of the

summary has been provided when the rental agreement was first
executed, a summary does not have to be provided upon renewal.

given to a manager shall be deemed a notice given to the owner.

be given to the owner under this chapter shall have been received
by such owner if the notice was given to the owner in the manner
provided by this chapter.
(3) A claimed lack of knowledge by the owner of any violation
hereunder cited shall be no defense to license nonrenewal,
suspension or revocation proceedings as long as all notices
prerequisite to institution of such proceedings have been given and
§ 175-4 MONACA CODE § 175-6
173:218
deemed received in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this chapter.
B. Changes in ownership or occupancy. It shall be the duty of each owner
of a regulated rental unit to notify the Borough Code Enforcement
Officer, in writing, of any change in ownership of the premises or of the
number of regulated rental units on the premises. It shall be the duty of
the owner to notify the Borough Code Enforcement Officer, in writing,
of any increase in the number of occupants in any regulated rental unit
or of the changing of a dwelling unit from owner-occupied to nonowner-
occupied, which thereby transforms the dwelling into a
regulated rental unit for the purposes of this chapter.
C. Owners severally responsible. If any regulated rental unit is owned by
more than one person in any form of joint tenancy, as a partnership or
otherwise, each person shall be jointly and severally responsible for the

appropriate charge for administrative expenses and
services rendered in calculating, collecting, monitoring

property owner or developer entitled thereto.
[2] Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have
not previously been paid for by the Borough.

reimbursement agreement with the property owner or
owners or developer(s) for whose benefit reimbursement
will be provided, attach as an exhibit an itemized listing of
all sewer facilities for which reimbursement shall be
provided.

owners or developer(s) shall be entitled shall not exceed
the cost of all labor and material. engineering design
charges, the cost of performance and maintenance bonds,
Borough review and inspection charges, as well as flushing
and televising charges and any and all charges involved in

Borough, less the amount which would be chargeable to
such property owner or developer based upon the
Borough's collection and distribution tapping fees which
would be applicable to all lands of the property owner or
developer served directly or indirectly through such
extension if the property owner or developer did not fund
the extension.
[5] The Borough shall be required to notify by certified mail,
to their last known address, the property owner or owners
or developer(s) for whose benefit such reimbursement
shall apply within 30 days of the Borough's receipt of any
such reimbursement payment. In the event that the
property owner(s) or developer(s) have not claimed a
reimbursement payment within 120 days of the mailing of
the notice, the payment shall revert to and become the
sole property of the Borough with no further obligation on
the part of the Borough to refund the payment to the
property owner(s) or developer(s).

their discharge, new sources and sources that become industrial
users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard shall be required to submit to the Borough a report
which contains the information listed in Subsection A(2) below.
A new source shall also be required to submit to the Borough a
report which contains the information listed in Subsection A(2)
below. A new source shall also be required to report the method
of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment
standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated
flow and quantity of pollutants discharged.
(2) The industrial user shall submit the information required by this
section, including:
(a) Identifying information: the name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owners.
(b) Wastewater discharge permits: a list of any environmental
control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the
facility.

applicable to each regulated process.
[2] The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature
and concentration (and/or mass where required) by the
standard or by the Borough of regulated pollutants in the
discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous,
daily maximum and long-term average concentrations (or
mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall
be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed
in accordance with procedures set out in § 177-43J.
§ 177-43 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-43
173:253
[3] Sampling must be performed in accordance with
procedures set out in § 177-43K.
[4] In cases where the standard requires compliance with a
best management practice or pollution prevention
alternative, the user shall submit documentation as
required by the Borough or the applicable standards to
determine compliance with the standard. [Added
10-13-2009 by Ord. No. 913]
(f) Certification: a statement reviewed by the industrial user's
authorized representative and certified by a qualified
professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are
being met on a consistent basis and, if not, whether additional
operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards
and requirements.
(g) Compliance schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or (O&M)
will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the
shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide
such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion
date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance
date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the
requirements set out in § 177-41B(2) of this article.
B. Compliance schedule progress report. The following conditions shall
apply to the schedule required by § 177-43A(2)(g). The schedule shall
contain progress increments in the form of dates for the
commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events
include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and
completing construction and beginning and conducting routine
operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months.
The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the superintendent
no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and,
if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to
the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months
elapse between such progress reports to the superintendent.
C. Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the
POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and
requirements shall submit to the Borough a report containing the
§ 177-43 MONACA CODE § 177-43
173:254
information described in § 177-43A(2)(d), (e) and (f). For industrial
users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established
in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long-term
production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant
discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this
report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance with § 177-42A.
D. Periodic compliance reports.
(1) Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard
shall, at a frequency determined by the superintendent but in no
case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a
report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and
the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for
the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 177-42A.
(2) All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial
user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement
facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in
good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to
keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be
grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
(3) If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of
this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required
by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in § 177-43K of this
article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the
report.
(4) In cases where the standard requires compliance with a best
management practice or pollution prevention alternative, the user
shall submit documentation as required by the Borough or the
applicable standards to determine compliance with the standard.
[Added 10-13-2009 by Ord. No. 913]
E. Report of changed conditions. Each industrial user is required to notify
the superintendent of any planned significant changes to the industrial
user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or
volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change.
(1) The superintendent may require the industrial user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge
permit application under § 177-41A(2).
§ 177-43 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-43
173:255
(2) The superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under § 177-42 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under § 177-42E.
(3) No industrial user shall implement the planned changed
conditions) until and unless the superintendent has responded to
the industrial user's notice.
(4) For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or greater
and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be
deemed significant.
F. Reports of potential problems.
(1) In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load which may cause
potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the
prohibited discharge standards in § 177-33 of this article), it is the
responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and
notify the Borough of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user.
(2) Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the superintendent, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future
occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user
of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or
any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification
relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this article.
(3) Failure to notify the Borough of potential problem discharges shall
be deemed a separate violation of this article.
(4) A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom
to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection F(1)
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or
suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency
notification procedure.
G. Reports from nonsignificant industrial users. All industrial users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports
to the Borough at least twice a year (in June and December) describing
the nature, concentration and flow of pollutants required to be reported
to the Borough. All reports must be signed and certified in accordance
with § 177-42A.
§ 177-43 MONACA CODE § 177-43
173:256
H. Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling
performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user
must notify the superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and
analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs
monitoring at the industrial user's at least once a month or if the POTW
performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and
when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling.
I. Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
(1) Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing,
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise
disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261.
Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and
the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial
user discharges more than 10 kilograms of such waste per calendar
month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following
information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged
during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during
the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later
than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification
under this subsection needs to be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed
discharges must be submitted under § 177-43E above. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants
already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of
§ 177-43D above.
(2) Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection A of
this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no
more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are
acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute
hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e)
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which
the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any
hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
(3) In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA,
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing
§ 177-43 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-43
173:257
any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user
must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities of the
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of
such regulations.
(4) In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce
the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
J. Analytic requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the
techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in
an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136
does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with
procedures approved by the EPA.
K. Sample collection.
(1) Except as indicated in Subsection K(2) below, the industrial user
must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional
composite collection techniques. In the event that flowproportional
sampling is unfeasible, the superintendent may
authorize the use of time-proportional sampling or through a
minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that
this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show
compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
(2) Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained
using grab collection techniques.
L. Determination of noncompliance. The superintendent may use a grab
sample(s) to determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
M. Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid,
into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date
of receipt of the report shall govern.
N. The POTW and all industrial users subject to this article shall retain and
preserve, for no less than three years, any records, books, documents,
memoranda, reports, correspondence, and any and all summaries
thereof relating to monitoring, sampling, chemical analyses and
compliance with best management practice (BMP) requirements
performed by or on behalf of a user in connection with its discharge.

§ 177-44. Compliance monitoring.
(1) All sampling records shall include:
(a) The date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the
names of the person or persons taking the samples;
(b) The dates that analyses were performed;
(c) Who performed the analyses;
(d) The analytical techniques/methods used; and
(e) The results of such analyses.
(2) All records which pertain to matters which are the subject of any
enforcement or litigation activities brought by the Borough, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or USEPA pursuant hereto shall
be retained and preserved by the user until all enforcement
activities have concluded and all periods of limitation with respect
to any and all appeals have expired.
A. Inspection and sampling. The Borough shall have the right to enter the
facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this
article and any permit or order issued hereunder is being met and
whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof.
Industrial users shall allow the superintendent or his representatives
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying and the performance of any
additional duties.
(1) Where an industrial user has security measures in force which
require proper identification and clearance before entry into its
premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements
with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the Borough, state and EPA will be
permitted to enter without delay, for the purposes of performing
their specific responsibilities.
(2) The Borough, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user's property or require installation of such devices as
are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's
operations.
(3) The Borough may require the industrial user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All
devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be
calibrated yearly to ensure their accuracy.
(4) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be
§ 177-43 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-44
173:259
§ 177-45. Confidential information.
Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits
and monitoring programs and from Borough inspection and sampling
activities shall be available to the public without restriction unless the
industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Borough that the release of such information would
divulge trade secrets under applicable state law. When requested and
demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program
or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics
and other effluent data, as defined by 40 CFR 23.302, will not be recognized
as confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.
§ 177-46. Publication of industrial users in significant
noncompliance. [Amended 2-13-2007 by Ord. No. 896]
The Borough shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper
published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the
industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant
promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal
request of the superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs
of clearing such access shall be borne by the industrial user.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing Borough personnel access to the
industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
B. Search warrants. If the superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure or property or any part thereof and if the
superintendent has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there
may be a violation of this article or that there is a need to inspect as
part of a routine inspection program of the Borough designed to verify
compliance with this article or any permit or order issued hereunder or
to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then, upon application by the Borough Solicitor, the Court
of Common Pleas of Beaver County or any other appropriate judicial
issuing authority shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing
therein the specific location subject to the warrant. The warrant shall
specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the
property described. Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours
by the superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of
the Borough. In the event of an emergency affecting public health and
safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant.
§ 177-44 MONACA CODE § 177-46
173:260
noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
§ 177-47. Administration enforcement remedies.
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of all of the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1),
multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC equals 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil
and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW determines
has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference
or pass-through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel
or the general public):
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the
POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under § 177-47 of this
article to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days after the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a local control mechanism or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction
or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide, within 45 days after the due date, required reports
such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance reports,
periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with
compliance schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance.
H. Any other violation or group of violations, which may include a violation
of best management practices, which the POTW determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local
pretreatment program.
A. Notification of violation. Whenever the superintendent finds that any
user has violated or is violating this article, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment
requirement, the superintendent or his agent may serve upon said user
§ 177-46 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-47
173:261
a written notice of violation. Within 30 days of the receipt of this
notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions,
shall be submitted by the user to the superintendent. Submission of
this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in
this section shall limit the authority of the Borough to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without
first issuing a notice of violation.
B. Consent orders. The superintendent is hereby empowered to enter into
consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar
documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for
noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by
the user to correct the noncompliance of within a time period also
specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and
effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to § 177-47D and E
below and shall be judicially enforceable.
C. Show cause hearing. The superintendent may order any user which
causes or contributes to violation(s) of this article, wastewater
discharge permits or orders issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement to appear before the
superintendent and show cause why a proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the
time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the
reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why this
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the
meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such
notice may be served on any authorized representative of the user.
Whether or not the user appears as ordered, immediate enforcement
action may be pursued following the hearing date. A show cause
hearing shall not be a prerequisite for taking any other action against
the user.
D. Compliance orders. When the superintendent finds that a user has
violated or continues to violate this article, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge, directing that the user come into compliance within 30 days.
If the user does not come into compliance within 30 days, sewer service
shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated.
Compliance orders may also contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management
practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to
the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a federal pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order release the user of liability
§ 177-47 MONACA CODE § 177-47
173:262
for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a
compliance order shall not be a prerequisite to taking any other action
against the user.
E. Cease and desist order.
(1) When the superintendent finds that a user is violating this article,
the user's wastewater discharge permit, any order issued
hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease
and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(a) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(b) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened
violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the
discharge.
(2) Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a prerequisite to
taking any other action against the user.
F. Emergency suspensions.
(1) The superintendent may immediately suspend a user's discharge
(after informal notice to the user) whenever such suspension is
necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The
superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's discharge
(after notice and opportunity to respond) that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW or which presents or may present
an endangerment to the environment.
(a) Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a
user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the superintendent shall take such steps as
deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The
superintendent shall allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Borough that the period of endangerment has passed,
unless the termination proceedings set forth in § 177-47G are
initiated against the user.
(b) A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed
written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future
§ 177-47 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-47
173:263
§ 177-48. Injunctive relief.
Whenever a user has violated a pretreatment standard or requirement or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, wastewater discharge
permits or orders issued hereunder or any pretreatment requirement, the
Borough Attorney may apply for the issuance of a temporary or permanent
injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific
performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order or other
requirement imposed by this article on activities of the industrial user. Such
other action as appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief may also be
sought by the Borough. A petition for injunctive relief need not be filed as a
prerequisite to taking any other action against a user.
§ 177-49. Violations and penalties; costs; civil penalties.
occurrence to the superintendent, prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under §§ 177-47C and G.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
G. Termination of discharge.
(1) In addition to any other action authorized by this article, any user
that violates the following conditions of this article, wastewater
discharge permits or orders issued hereunder is subject to
discharge termination:
(a) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions.
(b) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge.
(c) Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents and characteristics prior to
discharge.
(d) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the
purpose of inspection, monitoring or sampling.
(e) Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§ 177-33 through
177-38 of this article.
(2) Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under
§ 177-47C of this article why the proposed action should not be
taken.
A. Any user which has violated or continues to violate this article, any
order or wastewater discharge permit hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the Borough for
a maximum civil penalty of the larger of $1,000 per day per violation or
the maximum allowed by state law per day, per violation.
§ 177-47 MONACA CODE § 177-49
173:264
§ 177-50. Affirmative defenses to discharge violations.
B. The superintendent acting on behalf of the Borough may recover
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated
with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring
expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the Borough.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into
account all relevant circumstances, including but not limited to the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration, any
economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective actions
by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a prerequisite for taking any
other action against a user.
A. Upset.
(1) For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An
upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or
careless or improper operation.
(2) An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards if the requirements of Subsection A(3) are met.
(3) An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed,
contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence, that:
(a) An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset.
(b) The facility was, at the time, being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable
operation and maintenance procedures.
(c) The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the upset (If this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five
days.):
[1] A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance.
§ 177-49 REAL ESTATE REGISTRY § 177-50
173:265
[2] The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and
times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the
noncompliance is expected to continue.
[3] Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
(5) Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment
standards.
(6) The industrial user shall control production on all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its
treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative
method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
B. General/specific prohibitions. An industrial user shall have an
affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in § 177-33 of
this article if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know
that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either a
local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user
was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass
through or interference or no local limit exists, but the discharge did
not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior
discharge when the Borough was regularly in compliance with its
NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with
applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
C. Bypass.
(1) Terms defined.
(a) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams
from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility.
(b) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes
them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss
of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does
not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
§ 177-50 MONACA CODE § 177-50
173:266
(2) An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated but
only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of
Subsection C(3) and (4) of this section.
(3) If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass if possible. An industrial user shall submit oral
notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time
it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times; and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of
the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-bycase
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
(4) Exceptions.
(a) Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement
action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
[1] Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
[2] There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of
equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate backup equipment should have been installed in
the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to
prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
[3] The industrial user submitted notices as required under
Subsection C(3) of this section.
(b) The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection C(4)(a) of
this section.

General Provisions
§ 197-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Borough of Monaca
MS4 Prohibited Discharge Ordinance."
§ 197-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
§ 197-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety, and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harm and maximizing
the benefits described in § 197-2 of this chapter, through provisions
designed to:
A. Inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities contributes to erosion
and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and
storm sewers, increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control
stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood control
efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge,
threatens public health and safety, and increases pollution of water
resources.
B. Reasonable regulation of connections and discharges to municipal
separate storm sewer systems is fundamental to the public health,
safety, and welfare and the protection of people of the commonwealth,
their resources, and the environment.
C. Stormwater is an important water resource which provides
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to obtain a
permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES). Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater discharges to the permittee's regulated
small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s).
A. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.
B. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and
restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this
commonwealth.
C. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 199-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Monaca Stormwater
Management Ordinance."
§ 199-2. Statement of findings.
The governing body of the municipality finds that:
A. Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities threatens
public health and safety by causing decreased infiltration of rainwater
and increased runoff flows and velocities, which overtax the carrying
capacity of existing streams and storm sewers and greatly increase the
cost to the public to manage stormwater.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy metals
and pathogens. Groundwater resources are also impacted through loss
of recharge.
C. A program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation
of land development and redevelopment causing loss of natural
infiltration, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the
protection of the people of the municipality and all the people of the
commonwealth, their resources and the environment.
D. Stormwater can be an important water resource by providing
groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams,
which also protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Non-stormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the
municipality.

§ 199-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote health, safety and welfare within
the municipality and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing
the benefits described in § 199-2 of this chapter through provisions
designed to:
§ 199-4. Statutory authority.
The municipality is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect
stormwater impacts by the authority of the Department of Environmental
Protection.
§ 199-5. Applicability; regulated activities.
A. Manage stormwater runoff impacts at their source by regulating
activities that cause the problems.
B. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
C. Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems as much as
possible.
D. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which requires
a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
E. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to
otherwise protect water resources.
F. Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses.
G. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93.4a to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality to support those
uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water quality in special
protection streams.
H. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and streambeds.
I. Provide for proper operations and maintenance of all permanent
stormwater management BMPs that are implemented in the
municipality.
J. Provide a mechanism to identify controls necessary to meet the NPDES
permit requirements.
K. Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program to
address non-stormwater discharges into the municipality's separate
storm sewer system.

B. Earth disturbance activities and associated stormwater management
controls are also regulated under existing state law and implementing
regulations. This chapter shall operate in coordination with those
parallel requirements; the requirements of this chapter shall be no less
restrictive in meeting the purposes of this chapter than state law.
A. Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve
the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or
ordinance. To the extent that this chapter imposes more rigorous or
stringent requirements for stormwater management, the specific
requirements contained in this chapter shall be followed.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to affect any of the
municipality's requirements regarding stormwater matters which do
not conflict with the provisions of this chapter, such as local stormwater
management design criteria (e.g., inlet spacing, inlet type, collection
system design and details, outlet structure design, etc.). Conflicting
provisions in other municipal ordinances or regulations shall be
construed to retain the requirements of this chapter addressing state
water quality requirements.

state regulations.
(1)
Existing uses are those attained as of November 1975, regardless
whether they have been designated in Chapter 93. Regulated earth
disturbance activities must be designed to protect and maintain
existing uses and maintain the level of water quality necessary to
protect those uses in all streams and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(2)
Water quality involves the chemical, biological and physical
characteristics of surface water bodies. After regulated earth
disturbance activities are complete, these characteristics can be
impacted by the addition of pollutants, such as sediment, and
changes in habitat through increased flow volumes and/or rates
as a result of changes in land surface area from those activities.
Therefore, permanent discharges to surface waters must be
managed to protect the streambank, streambed and structural
integrity of the waterway to prevent these impacts.

E. Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass
or convey flows from the tributary area and any facility which may
constitute a dam subject to permit by DEP under 25 Pa. Code Chapter
105.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of an erosion and
sediment control plan for construction activities.
B. DEP has regulations that require an erosion and sediment control plan
for any earth disturbance activity of 5,000 square feet or more under 25
Pa. Code § 102.4(b).
C. In addition, under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 92, a DEP NPDES construction
activities permit is required for regulated earth disturbance activities.
D. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or county
conservation district must be provided to the municipality. The issuance
of an NPDES construction permit [or permit coverage under the
statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies the requirements
Subsection A.
E. A copy of the erosion and sediment control plan and any required
permit, as required by DEP regulations, shall be available at the project
site at all times.
A. No regulated earth disturbance activities within the municipality shall
commence until approval by the municipality of a plan which
demonstrates compliance with state water quality requirements after
construction is complete.
B. The BMPs must be designed, implemented and maintained to meet
state water quality requirements and any other more stringent
requirements as determined by the municipality.
C. To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from regulated earth
disturbance activities, state water quality requirements can be met by
BMPs, including site design, which provide for replication of
preconstruction stormwater infiltration and runoff conditions so that
postconstruction stormwater discharges do not degrade the physical,

193:320
chemical or biological characteristics of the receiving waters. As
described in the DEP Comprehensive Stormwater Management Policy
(No. 392-0300-002, September 28, 2002), this may be achieved by the
following:
(1) Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration
conditions;
(2) Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to ensure filtering
out of the chemical and physical pollutants from the stormwater
runoff; and
(3) Streambank and streambed protection: management of volume and
rate of postconstruction stormwater discharges to prevent physical
degradation of receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
D. DEP has regulations that require municipalities to ensure design,
implementation and maintenance of best management practices
(BMPs) that control runoff from new development and redevelopment
after regulated earth disturbance activities are complete. These
requirements include the need to implement postconstruction
stormwater BMPs with assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of those BMPs.
E. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office must be provided to
the municipality. The issuance of an NPDES construction permit [or
permit coverage under the statewide general permit (PAG-2)] satisfies
the requirements of Subsection A.

§ 205-16. Permit required; emergency circumstances.
§ 205-17. Adherence to terms of permit.
No permittee shall perform any of the work authorized by such permit in
any amount greater than that specified in such permit, except that where
the permittee desires to perform additional work not in excess of an amount
greater than 10% of the amount specified in such permit, the permittee
may apply to the Borough of Monaca for an amended permit to permit the
additional work. If additional work desired to be performed by the permittee
exceeds 10% of the amount specified in the original permit, an application
for a new permit shall be deemed to cover any such additional work as may
be added pursuant to the issuance of an amended permit within the limit
specified herein.
§ 205-18. Time frame for commencement of work.
Work for which a permit has been issued shall commence within 30 days
after the issuance of the permit thereof. If not so commenced, the permit
shall be terminated automatically unless the permittee applies for an
extension of time within which to commence work. If such an extension is
granted, the original permit shall remain in force for the period of time
specified in the extension. Permits which terminate by reason of failure
to commence work within 30 days after issuance thereof or within any
extension of time granted hereunder may be renewed only upon the
payment of an additional permit fee as originally required.
§ 205-19. Permits nontransferable.
Permits are not transferable from one person to another, and the work
shall not be performed in any place other than the location specifically
designated in the permit.

excavation of any kind in or under the surface of any street without first
securing a permit from the Borough of Monaca for each separate
undertaking.
B. Any person maintaining pipes, lines or other underground facilities in
or under the surface of any street may proceed with an opening without
a permit when emergency circumstances demand the work to be done
immediately, provided that the permit could not have reasonably and
practically been obtained beforehand. In such cases where emergency
openings are necessary, the Borough of Monaca shall be notified prior
to such openings by either fax or telephone. The person shall thereafter
apply for a permit on the first regular business day on which the
Borough of Monaca office is open for business, and said permit shall be
retroactive to the date when the work was begun.

Every permit shall expire after 60 days from issuance date. If the permittee
shall be unable to complete the work within the specified time, he or she
shall, prior to expiration of the permit, present, in writing, to the Borough of
Monaca a request for an extension of time setting forth therein the reasons
for the requested extension. If the Borough of Monaca finds that the failure
to complete the work under the permit within the time specified therein
was due to circumstances reasonably beyond the control of the permittee
and that an extension of time to complete the work under the permit is
necessary and not contrary to the public interest, the permittee may be
granted additional time for the completion of the work.
§ 205-21. Cuts made by municipal utilities.
All street openings required by utilities owned and/or operated by the
Borough of Monaca shall be made and restored under the direction and

Pennsylvania or by the County of Beaver; provided, however, that any
person applying for a permit to do work within the right-of-way of a street
or highway maintained by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or by the
County of Beaver which would otherwise require a permit under the terms
of this article shall notify the Borough of Monaca at the time that said
application is made and at the time that the work under any permit issued
pursuant to said application is begun, so that proper safety precautions may
be taken by the Borough of Monaca during the continuation of said work.
§ 205-23. Right to use streets.
Every permit shall be granted subject to the right of the Borough of Monaca,
or of any other person entitled thereto, to use the street for any purpose for
which such street may lawfully be used not inconsistent with the permit.

Monaca specifically related to the work authorized by the permit and,
unless the permittee is granted permission to restore the street surface,
the cost of restoring the street surface removed or damaged by the
work done under such permit. The amount of such deposit shall be
computed by the Borough of Monaca in accordance with this article. In
the case of public utility companies, the Borough of Monaca may waive
the requirement of a deposit if said utility companies file with the
Borough of Monaca their corporate bond in a form satisfactory to the
Municipal Solicitor, conditioned upon the payment to the Borough of
Monaca of all costs which would otherwise be covered by and paid out
of such a deposit. In the event that such utility companies elect to file
such a bond, the Borough of Monaca shall bill such utility companies
monthly for such costs as they accrue.

relocation and file a claim against the permittee with the Borough of
Monaca for the costs of such repairs or relocation. Public utility
companies concerned shall be notified by the Borough of Monaca in
sufficient time to determine the validity of the damage or relocation
claims. The cost of such repair work or relocation work may be withheld
by the Borough of Monaca from the deposit pending determination of
liability for the damage.

193:349
bench mark within the Borough of Monaca shall not be removed or
disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission to do
so is first obtained, in writing, from the Borough of Monaca. Permission
shall be granted only upon the condition that the permittee shall pay all
expenses incident to the proper replacement of the monument.
G. When work performed by the permittee interferes with the established
drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee
to provide proper drainage.
H. When any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused to flow,
roll or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause removal of the
same from the street within eight hours after deposit to permit safe flow
of traffic. In the event that the earth, gravel or other excavated material
so deposited is not removed as specified, the Borough of Monaca shall
cause such removal, and the cost incurred shall be paid by the
permittee or deducted from his or her deposit.
I. Every permittee shall place around the project such barriers,
barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be
determined by the Borough of Monaca to be necessary for the
protection of the public. Additional safety requirements may be
prescribed by the Borough of Monaca and, where applicable, shall be in

safety devices, such devices shall be installed and maintained by
the Borough of Monaca. The amount of the cost incurred shall be

to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate dirt or
dust nuisance, the Borough of Monaca may require the permittee to
provide toe boards or bins, and if the excavated area is muddy and

psi at seven days and 600 psi at 28 days.
P. Use of streets. During the progress of work, the permittee shall
accommodate both vehicular and pedestrian traffic and shall provide
unobstructed access to fire hydrants and water and gas valves. Gutters
and waterways must be kept open, or other provisions made for the
removal of stormwater. Street intersections may be blocked 1/2 at a
time, and the permittee shall lay and maintain temporary driveways,
bridges, and crossings as, in the opinion of the Engineer, are necessary
to reasonably accommodate the traveling public.

(3) It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to ascertain and verify
the actual location and elevation of existing pipelines or buried
conduits in the path of the work before commencing excavation.
R. Shoring, sheeting and bracing. All excavations which are five feet or
more in depth or which exceed any state or federal regulatory agency's
stipulated maximum depth for unshored excavations or are in unstable
material and shoring is necessary to facilitate proper and safe working
conditions, excavations shall be shored. All shoring shall meet or
exceed OSHA or State Labor Department requirements. Shoring shall
consist of timber or metal sheeting supported by a sound system of
cross jacks acting against a sheeting whaler grid. As an alternate to
shoring by sheeting, the permittee may employ an approved-type
trench box of reinforced-steel construction, and workmen shall conduct
work from within such box.
S. Construction methods. Excavation involving the removal of bituminous
or concrete paving in streets, private drives and parking area trenching
situations shall be accomplished by sawing or cutting the improved
surface at the edges of the proposed trench at points one foot on either
side of the trench opening at ground surface. Sawing or cutting shall
extend to the full depth of the existing surface. Where existing surfaces
are damaged, taken up, undercut or unraveled by construction
excavation operations which extend beyond the original saw or cut
marks for removal, the permittee, in restoring such bituminous or
concrete surfaces to original condition, shall resaw or cut the surface to
a straight and even line six inches beyond the furthest point of damage
from the trench center line.
T. Work in freezing weather. When temperatures fall to 32° F., all grouting
and concrete materials entering into the construction are to be
preheated and used while warm. When any mortar or cement concrete
work is carried out under freezing conditions, the heated area must be
maintained for at least 24 hours or the installation shall be protected
from frost by covering with hay or straw; and where it is impractical to
completely cover the work area with an enclosure and heat the work
area to at least 40° F., the work shall be suspended.
U. Trench excavation. The trench shall be excavated along the lines
proposed by the permit holder and approved by the Borough Designee
or Engineer. All trenches shall have vertical sides. No tapering of sides
shall be permitted unless approved in writing. The width of the trench,
unless otherwise approved, shall be six inches minimum and 18 inches
maximum on each side of the utility pipe. The bottom of the trench shall
be hallowed out so as to allow the body of the pipe to have a bearing
throughout on the trench bottom. Ground adjacent to all excavations
§ 205-27 STORAGE AREAS § 205-27
193:353
§ 205-28. Backfilling and restoration.
shall be graded to prevent water running in. Any accumulated water in
the excavation shall be removed by pumping or other means approved
by the Engineer, prior to the placement of pipes or utilities and before
backfill is begun.
V. The attached details labeled SD-1 through SD-2T and Local Road
Bituminous Pavement Replacement detail are merged herein, made a
part hereof and shall be the standards to follow and comply with for and
during street opening work.122
A. All pavement cuts, openings, and excavations shall be made properly
and backfilled properly by the permittee according to Borough of
Monaca specifications, including but not limited to the details attached
hereto and incorporated herein at the appendix to this chapter. If
conditions are such as to prevent the completion of permanent
restorations of the street surface at the time backfilling is completed,
the permittee shall install a temporary surface in accordance with
municipal specifications until such time as weather conditions will
permit permanent restoration of the street surface.
B. The Borough of Monaca shall be notified by the permittee 48 hours in
advance of backfilling and restoration. Such notice shall provide the
approximate time each will begin.
C. No backfilling or restoration shall be accomplished unless or until the
Borough designee or Engineer is present or permission has been
granted for backfilling or restoration after inspection by the Borough
designee or Engineer.
D. If the Borough designee or Engineer finds that paving surfaces adjacent
to the street openings may be damaged where trenches are made
parallel to the street or where a number of cross trenches are laid in
proximity to one another or where the equipment used may cause such
damage, he or she may require negotiated contribution from the
permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of such street if the
total area of the proposed patch or damaged area exceeds 25% of the
total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete
gutter edges. Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions
agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit.
E. After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted with due diligence. Unless the provisions of
Subsection A of this section apply, the permittee is required to complete
permanent restoration of the street surface in accordance with
municipal specifications within seven days after repairs and/or
installation are completed. Furthermore, the permittee shall be

chapter.
§ 205-27 MONACA CODE § 205-28
193:354
§ 205-29. Restoration guarantee.
required to install and maintain a temporary surface in accordance with
municipal specification during:
(1) The period between the completion of repairs and/or installation
and the commencement of final restoration; and
(2) The periods during the actual work when workers do not require
access to the excavation.
F. Inspections of all work authorized by a permit shall be made by the
Borough designee or Engineer at such times and in such manner as
required to assure compliance with provisions of the article. If the
nature of the work to be performed under any permit is such as to
require the services of a full-time inspector, the Borough designee or
Engineer shall provide the services of such inspector.
G. All costs of inspection shall be borne by the permittee. Such costs shall
be based upon a schedule of charges on file in the office of the Borough
of Monaca.
H. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of a
permit, the permittee shall notify the Borough of Monaca, in writing. A
certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the Borough designee or
Engineer to each permittee no sooner than one year and not later than
18 months after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been
made, provided that the work authorized by the permit has been
performed according to municipal specifications. Prior to the issuance
of a certificate, the Borough Designee or Engineer shall make a final
inspection of the restoration to determine whether municipal
specifications have been adhered to and/or whether the restoration
work was otherwise adequately and properly performed.
I. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of two years
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration and the
permittee fails to make such correction after notification, any expense
incurred by the Borough in correcting such settlement shall be paid by
the permittee or recovered from his or her bond, unless the permittee
submits proof, satisfactory to the Borough of Monaca, that the
settlement was not due to defective backfilling.
J. In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the
charge or care of the Borough of Monaca or any of its officers or
employees, and no officer or employee of the Borough of Monaca, or its
agents, is authorized in any way to take or assume any jurisdiction over
any such opening, except in the exercise of the police power when it is
necessary to protect life and property.
A. Computation of guarantee. The Borough of Monaca, upon receipt of a
properly completed application, shall determine the amount of the
guarantee to be made by the permittee in accordance with the schedule
§ 205-28 STORAGE AREAS § 205-29
193:355
of charges established pursuant to Subsection E of this section. The
guarantee shall be paid at the time the permit is issued, and the
guarantee shall be used to reimburse the Borough of Monaca for the
cost of any work and/or materials furnished by it in connection with
work authorized by the permit, to cover the cost of all necessary
inspections of said work or any other expenses incurred by the Borough
of Monaca in carrying out the provisions of this article. In the case of
a public utility company, the requirement of such guarantee may be
waived if such public utility company files with the Borough of Monaca
its corporate bond.
B. Form of guarantee. The guarantee may be either in the form of a
certified treasurer's or cashier's check or in lawful money of the United
States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any guarantee is less than sufficient to pay all
costs, the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the Borough of Monaca
an amount equal to the deficiency. If the permittee fails or refuses to
pay such deficiency, the Borough of Monaca may institute an action to
recover the same in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County,
Pennsylvania. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no additional permits
shall be issued to such permittee.
D. Yearly guarantee. Whenever any public utility company shall anticipate
applying for permits for more than one street opening or excavation per
calendar year and does not elect to file a corporate bond as
hereinbefore provided, such public utility company may post one
guarantee in an amount and form as hereinbefore provided for the
calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of guarantees which
would otherwise be required for the anticipated permits.
E. Guarantee and fee schedules. The Borough of Monaca shall establish a
schedule of charges for inspections, labor, materials and other such
expenses as may be incurred by the Borough in carrying out the
provisions of this article. This schedule shall be established by the
Borough of Monaca in accordance with the reasonably anticipated costs
to be incurred by the Borough making such inspections, including
reasonable administrative and overhead expenses, and in accordance
with the currently prevailing costs in the area for any labor and
materials which may be provided by the Borough. The Borough of
Monaca shall revise said schedule from time to time to reflect any
increase or decrease in the costs used to establish said charges. The
schedule shall be open to public inspection in the Borough of Monaca
Administrative office.
F. Decision on costs. The decision of the Borough of Monaca as to the cost
of any work done or repairs made by the Borough of Monaca, pursuant
to the provisions of this article, shall be final and conclusive as to such
cost, subject to such rights of appeal as may exist by statute.

employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence.
C. The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the

intent of this section that no person shall be subject to the payment of
the local services tax by more than one political subdivision during each

each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions

the calendar year in which the local services tax is levied.

with the person's employer affirming that the person reasonably
expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources
within the political subdivision of less than $12,000 in the calendar
year for which the exemption certificate is filed.
(2) The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of
the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within
§ 213-13 SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT § 213-13.1

Borough of Monaca that the person has received earned income
and net profits from all sources within the Borough of Monaca
equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the
person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the Borough of Monaca in an amount equal
to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall
withhold the local services tax from the person as follows:
(a) If a person who claimed an exemption from the local services
tax for a given calendar year becomes subject to the tax for the
calendar year the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year.
(b) The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first
payroll period after receipt of the notification under Subsection
D(3)(a) a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not
withheld from the person due to the exemption certificate filed
by the person, plus the per-payroll amount due for that first
payroll period.
(c) The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the
remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the
same amount withheld for other employees.
(d) In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding
of the local services tax under this exception is severed in that
calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision levying the tax
may pursue collection under this article.
E. Employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption
certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any
employee from the local services tax.
F. Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption
certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a
minimum of three years. Employers who have failed to withhold the
local services tax from an employee or employees, and who do not have
copies of the employee exemption certificate or certificates, will be held

beyond limits of Borough.

of business outside the Borough of Monaca but who engage in any
occupation within the Borough of Monaca do, by virtue thereof, agree

provided that the action to enforce the fine and penalty herein provided may
be instituted against any person in charge of the business of any employer
who has failed or refused to file a return required by this article.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll

days after the due date set forth above, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of such tax due or unpaid, together with interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%

shall be added to the flat rate of said tax for nonpayment thereof. Where
suit is brought for the recovery of this tax, the individual liable therefor

(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,

confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer of division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration

cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in

his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the property is
the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if the grantee
claims an exemption from taxation under this subsection.

(23) Leases for the production or extraction of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals and assignments thereof.

and complete value of the transfer shall be shown on the statement of
value. A copy of the Pennsylvania realty transfer tax statement of value
may be submitted for this purpose. For leases of coal, oil, natural gas or
minerals, the statement of value may be limited to an explanation of the
reason such document is not subject to tax under this article.

associations or corporations and the members, partners, shareholders or
stockholders thereof are fully taxable. For the purposes of this article,

vehicles (including fire trucks, ambulances, etc.) and interfere with the
peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the residents of the Borough of Monaca
in their homes and neighborhoods. The Council has determined that the
adoption of this section is necessary to remediate the foregoing.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the

way and public square within the municipal limits of Monaca Borough.

combination, construction truck, driveway-towaway operation,
farm equipment, full trailer, house trailer, limousine (capable of
carrying 10 or more passengers), maxi-cube vehicle, mobile home,
motor home, recreational trailer, semitrailer, stinger-steered
automobile or boat transporter, tow dolly, trailer, truck-camper, and
truck tractor.

vehicles, pickup campers, boat trailers, tent trailers and cases
or boxes used for transporting recreational equipment (whether

parked or permit to be parked any large motor vehicle on any street
within the municipal limits of Monaca Borough.

§ 225-45. Authority to remove and impound.
The Borough shall have authority to remove and impound or to order

provisions of this article.
§ 225-46. Designation of approved storage garages; bonding;

Council that it is bonded or has acquired liability insurance in an amount
satisfactory to the Borough Council as sufficient to indemnify owners of
impounded vehicles against loss or damage to those vehicles while in the
custody of the garagekeeper for the purpose of towing or storage. The
approved storage garage shall submit to the Borough Council its schedule

Prior to operating any such vehicle as hereinbefore described on private
property, the operator must request and receive the permission of the
owner of the property. Where private property is owned by more than one
person, it shall be insufficient compliance with this section to request and
receive the permission of any one of the owners, if the operator has reason
to know that another owner objects thereto. It is the intent of this section
to prohibit the operation of such off-road vehicle on property owned by
more than one person if any of the owners object, but to permit an operator
who has received permission from one of the owners to presume that the
operator has permission of all the owners unless the operator has reason to
know otherwise.

Prior to operating any such vehicle as hereinbefore described on property
owned by Monaca Borough, the operator must request and receive the

owned by Monaca Borough. Such resolution may limit the operation of such
vehicles to such days of the week, hours of the day or otherwise as the
Council sees fit. Such resolution(s) may also limit the number of vehicles
to be operated at any given time or attach any other condition(s) to the
operation of such vehicles as the Council sees fit.

Any permission granted hereunder may be revoked at the will of the private
property owner of such private property and the will of the Council
respecting public property. Upon request of any owner of private property,

vehicle from such public property.
§ 227-6. Operation near residential dwellings.
Irrespective of compliance with the foregoing sections of this chapter, it
shall be unlawful for any person(s) to operate any motor vehicle, including
but not limited to a motorcycle, motorbike, motor scooter, all-terrain vehicle
or snowmobile, upon private property or upon property that is owned by

The aforesaid one-hundred-foot restriction shall not apply to a residential
dwelling that is owned by a person who has given his/her permission to
operate a motor vehicle under the provisions of this chapter.
§ 227-7. Violations and penalties.

§ 231-5. Amendments to regulations; compliance.
The Council recognizes that Rule 71 and 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8902 may be
amended from time to time. It is the intention of the Council that the police

of the arrest, whether or not these guidelines have been formally amended
to comply with any rule or statute changes.
(1) When a defendant has been arrested without a warrant, the
arresting officer may, when the officer deems it appropriate,

citation to the defendant.
C. When the defendant has not been released from custody under
Subsection B, the defendant shall be taken without unnecessary delay
before the issuing authority where a citation shall be filed against the
defendant. The defendant shall be given an immediate trial unless:
(1) The commonwealth is not ready to proceed or the defendant
requests a postponement, and, in either event, the defendant shall
be given the opportunity to deposit collateral for appearance on the
new date and hour fixed for trial; or
(2) The defendant's criminal record must be ascertained before trial as
specifically required by statute for purposes of grading the offense
charged, in which event the defendant shall be given the
opportunity to deposit collateral for appearance on the new date

The cost of construction of any water main or the extension of any existing
water main shall be paid in such manner as is set forth in the subsections to
this section:
§ 233-6. Notice of proposed work; billing.
Prior to the construction of any new water main or to any extension of an
existing water main, written notice thereof shall be sent to each abutting
property owner by the Borough Secretary. In addition to said notice, each
property owner shall be furnished with a statement of the estimated cost

A. The cost of construction of any new water main or the extension of any
existing water main shall be borne by the Borough of Monaca as to the
frontage of any lot which now fronts on a street in which is situate a
water main, provided that on said lot is situate a structure which is, as

this section of this article, the prorated front-foot cost shall be paid by
the abutting property owners. Said front footage shall be determined by
the number of feet said water main measures between the extension of
the property lines of said lot.

231:554
§ 233-7. Excess costs; refunds.
After completion of construction, the total actual cost of the water main
shall be determined, and the Borough Secretary shall bill each abutting
property owner for any excess cost over the estimated construction cost
within 30 days. Where any property owner has, on the basis of the estimated
construction cost, paid in excess of his pro rata share of the actual cost,
such excess shall be refunded to him within 30 days after the completion of
the water main.
§ 233-8. Interest; filing of lien.
From and after 30 days following the completion of the water main, each
abutting property owner will be liable for interest at the rate of 6% per
annum on the unpaid balance of his pro rata share of the cost of
construction unless by written agreement with the Borough of Monaca, his
payments are otherwise determined. In the event that full payment of the
cost of the water main is not made within 30 days following completion
thereof or within the time specified by written agreement between the

A. Every property owner desiring or required to make a connection with
the water supply and distribution system of the Borough of Monaca
shall make an application with the Borough Manager for a permit. The
Manager, upon being satisfied that the proposed water connection shall
be in conformity with this article and all other rules, regulations and
requirements of the Borough of Monaca applicable thereto, shall issue
to the applicant a water tapping permit, upon payment by the applicant
of all applicable and prevailing fees, which shall be for use of the
Borough.
B. Customer facilities.
(1) A customer facilities fee is hereby imposed against each
residential, commercial and industrial unit connected or required
to be connected to the Borough's water supply and distribution
system to cover the costs associated with the installation of
customer-owned facilities from the property line to the unit or
structure to be served. The facilities referred to herein shall not
include the water service line on the customer's property, which
line shall be installed and maintained by and be the responsibility
of the customer. The facilities envisioned herein include the costs of
the inside water meter, the outside remote meter and the labor
costs incurred by the Borough to install them.
(2) The amount of the customer facilities fee shall be set from time to
time by resolution of the Monaca Borough Council.
C. Connection fee.
(1) A connection fee is hereby imposed against each residential,
commercial and industrial unit connected or required to be
connected to the Borough's water distribution system to cover the
cost of the facilities installed by the Borough from the system's
main distribution line to the property line of the property or unit to
be served. A typical installation would include a corporation at the
distribution line and all necessary piping and fittings to bring the
line to the property line or edge of the waterline right-of-way line.

resolution of the Monaca Borough Council.
D. Tapping fee.
(1) A tapping fee is hereby imposed against each residential,
commercial and industrial unit connected or required to be
connected to the Borough's water distribution system. The purpose
of the tapping fee is to recover the capital cost of the capacity of the
water distribution facilities required to serve each new customer. It
shall have four component parts: capacity component, distribution
component, special purpose component and reimbursement
component. The tapping fee authorized by this article and
promulgated by any resolution adopted pursuant hereto shall not
include the cost of operation and maintenance.
(a) Capacity component. The capacity component shall provide for
cost sharing of general water distribution system facilities built
to supply both existing and future service needs. Such facilities
would include but not be limited to treatment plants, holding
tanks, booster stations, transmission lines and related
appurtenances. This component is restricted to the cost of such
facilities, less any outstanding debt and contributions-in-aid-of
construction.
(b) Distribution component. The distribution component shall be
the amount charged for the cost of distribution facilities such
as waterlines and appurtenances. This component is restricted
to the cost of such facilities, less any contributions-in-aid-of
construction.
(c) Special purpose component. The special purpose component
shall serve as a reimbursement of costs applicable to a
particular group of customers, or serving a particular purpose
or servicing a particular area.
(d) Reimbursement component. The reimbursement component
shall serve to collect tapping fees from new connections to
facilities constructed by parties other than the Borough (i.e.,
developers). This component shall apply to waterline
extensions made by a developer, which serve or can serve
homes outside the development. Therefore, where a property
owner or developer constructs or causes to be constructed at
his expense any extension of the water distribution system of
the Borough, the Borough shall provide for the reimbursement
to the property owner or developer when the owner of another
property not in the development for which the extension was
constructed connects a service line directly to the extension
within 10 years of the date of the dedication of the extension to
the Borough in accordance with the following provisions:
§ 233-9 MONACA CODE § 233-9
231:558
[1] Such reimbursement shall be equal to the distribution or
collection part of each tapping fee collected as a result of
subsequent connections. The Borough shall be entitled to
deduct from each reimbursement payment an amount
equal to 5% which shall be deemed to represent the
appropriate charge for administrative expenses and
services rendered in calculating, collecting, monitoring
and disbursing the reimbursement payments to the
property owner or developer entitled thereto.
[2] Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have
not previously been paid for by the Borough.
[3] The Borough shall, in the preparation of the necessary
reimbursement agreement with the property owner or
owners or developer(s) for whose benefit reimbursement
will be provided, attach as an exhibit an itemized listing of
all sewer facilities for which reimbursement shall be
provided.
[4] The total reimbursement to which a property owner or
owners or developer(s) shall be entitled shall not exceed
the cost of all labor and material, engineering design
charges, the cost of performance and maintenance bonds,
Borough review and inspection charges, as well as flushing
and televising charges and any and all charges involved in
the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the
Borough, less the amount which would be chargeable to
such property owner or developer based upon the
Borough's collection and distribution tapping fees which
would be applicable to all lands of the property owner or
developer served directly or indirectly through such
extension if the property owner or developer did not fund
the extension.
[5] The Borough shall be required to notify by certified mail,
to their last known address, the property owner or owners
or developer(s) for whose benefit such reimbursement
shall apply within 30 days of the Borough's receipt of any
such reimbursement payment. In the event that the
property owner(s) or developer(s) have not claimed a
reimbursement payment within 120 days of the mailing of
the notice, the payment shall revert to and become the
sole property of the Borough with no further obligation on
the part of the Borough to refund the payment to the
property owner(s) or developer(s).
(2) The amount of the tapping fee as comprised by its four component
parts shall be set from time to time by resolution of the Monaca
Borough Council.

with a Borough water main shall permit any other person to make an
attachment or connection with his, her or their waterline leading into said
water main.
§ 233-12. Size of tap.
All connections made to any water main shall be by three-fourths-inch taps

to any water main of the Borough of Monaca or to any line leading to a

violation, shall be punishable as provided in Chapter 1, Article II, Code

on a wall or other surface, the surface area of the sign shall be the
sum of the areas of each individual letter calculated by measuring
the distance between the highest and lowest points of each letter
and multiplying that distance by the distance between the longest
horizontal distance across the letter;

abandonment to the Building Inspector, the system shall be
considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out of
service for a continuous twelve-month period. After the 12 months
of inoperability, the Building Inspector may issue a notice of
abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system.
(3) The owner shall have the right to respond to the notice of
abandonment within 30 days from notice of receipt date. After
review of the information provided by the owner, the Building
Inspector shall determine if the small wind energy system has been
abandoned. If it is determined that the small wind energy system
has not been abandoned, the Building Inspector shall withdraw the
notice of abandonment and notify the owner of the withdrawal.
(4) If the owner fails to respond to the notice of abandonment or if,
after review by the Building Inspector, it is determined that the
small wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued, the
owner of the small wind energy system shall remove the wind
generator and tower, at the owner's sole expense, within three
months of receipt of the notice of abandonment. If the owner fails
to physically remove the small wind energy system after the notice
of abandonment procedure, the Building Inspector may pursue
legal action to have the small wind energy system removed at the
owner's expense.

§ 245-50. Purpose.
§ 245-51. Adoption of Borough floodplain/flood-prone maps.
A. Certain areas of Monaca Borough are subject to periodic flooding and/
or mudslides from streams and other waters causing damage to
properties and improvements within the reach of such waters.
B. Monaca desires the insurance coverage for its citizens, residents and
properties within the Borough offered by the National Flood Insurance
Act of 1968, as amended, to protect against loss resulting from flooding
and/or mudslides.
C. The Borough Council of Monaca Borough has determined to participate
in the National Flood Insurance Program.
D. Regulations promulgated by the Federal Insurance Administrator under
the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, require the
Borough Council to enact adequate regulations of land use for those
areas subject to the hazards of flooding or mudslides consistent with
the criteria set forth in Section 1910 of the National Flood Insurance
Program Regulations, as amended.
A. The boundaries of floodplain or flood-prone areas within the Borough of
Monaca are shown and detailed in the Federal Emergency Management
Agency Flood Insurance Rate Map, bearing the date of December 4,
1979, and consisting of one sheet designated as a "panel" and further
identified by Community - Panel Number 420114 0001 B. Said Flood
Insurance Rate Map and any revisions thereto are hereby deemed and
declared a part of this chapter, and same are incorporated herein by
reference and are hereby adopted as the Borough of Monaca
Floodplain/Flood-Prone Map.
B. Said Floodplain/Flood-Prone Map may be revised from time to time due
to the occurrence of natural or man-made changes causing changes in
floodplain or flood-prone areas and/or due to more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual which documents the need for a change; provided however,
that prior to such revision, approval thereof must be obtained from or
be directed by the Federal Insurance Administration or its successor,
and, upon such approval or directive being made, such floodplain and/
or flood-prone areas and/or maps shall be deemed applicable hereto
and made part hereof.

(a) The FW (Floodway Area) shall be delineated for purposes of
this chapter using the criteria that a certain area within the
floodplain must be capable of carrying the waters of the onehundred-
year flood without increasing the water surface
elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. The
areas included in this area are specifically defined in the
Floodway Data Table contained in the above-referenced Flood
Insurance Study and shown on the accompanying Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map.
(b) Within any FW (Floodway Area), the following provisions
apply:
[1] Any new construction, development, use, activity or
encroachment that would cause any increase in flood
heights shall be prohibited.
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Dams and Waterway
Management.
(2) The FF (Flood-Fringe Area). The FF (Flood-Fringe Area) shall be

its stratigraphic equivalent, and such oil and gas wells that
are planned to involve drilling of a single well on a well site
for no more than seven consecutive days total in any
calendar year can request a waiver from the Borough from
any condition set forth herein if, in the sole discretion of
the Borough, the conditions are not necessary to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the residents.
(h) The Borough may attach to the approval of any application
hereunder additional design and installation conditions in
order to protect the public's health, safety and welfare.

Judge, shall pay to the Borough a fine of not more than $500, plus
all court costs, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney's
fees incurred by the Borough on account of such violation. No
penalty or cost shall be imposed until the date the determination of
the violation by the Magisterial District Judge becomes final. If the
defendant neither pays nor timely appeals the judgment, the
Borough may enforce the judgment as provided by law. Each day a
violation exists after final judgment shall constitute a separate
offense. The amount of the fine imposed shall be multiplied by the
number of such days and may be charged and collected as a
judgment by the Borough without further judicial proceedings.
Further, the appropriate officers or agents of the Borough are
hereby authorized to issue a cease and desist notice and/or to seek
equitable relief, including injunction, to enforce compliance
herewith. No bond shall be required of the Borough if the Borough

[Amended 9-28-2010 by Ord. No. 918]
§ 245-63. Definitions.
See Article I of this this chapter.
§ 245-64. Applicability.
A nonconforming use may continue, be bought or sold, altered, restored or
extended subject to the provisions of this article even though such use does
not conform to the regulations established for that zoning district in which it
is located. However, one nonconforming use cannot be changed to another
type of nonconforming use.
§ 245-65. Restoration of unsafe structures.
Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition of any portion of a building or structure declared unsafe by a
proper authority.
§ 245-66. Alterations to nonconforming structures.
§ 245-67. Restoration.
Any nonconforming structure or any structure housing a nonconforming
use that is damaged by fire, flood, explosion or other casualty may be
reconstructed and used as before the damage occurred if such
reconstruction is undertaken within 12 months of such casualty, and if the
restored structure has no greater lot coverage and contains a cubic content
no greater than before such casualty.
§ 245-68. Extensions.
A. A nonconforming structure may be enlarged or structurally altered,
provided the enlargement or alteration does not increase the existing
nonconformity such as encroaching further into a required yard setback
than the existing nonconforming structure does, and further provided
that no new nonconformities are created. All other alterations or
enlargements shall require review by the Zoning Hearing Board and,
after public hearing, the Zoning Hearing Board may determine undue
hardship and may authorize a variance for the reasonable alteration or
enlargement of such structure.
B. Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged, added to or replaced by
another nonconforming sign, use or structure, except that the
interchange of advertising panels shall be permitted.

§ 245-70. Construction approved prior to legal enactment of
standards.
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or
designated use of a building or structure for which a permit has been issued
and the construction of which shall have been diligently prosecuted within
two months of the date of such permit, and the ground-story framework
of which shall have been completed within four months of the date of the
permit, and which entire building shall be completed according to such
plans as filed within one year from the date of legal enactment of this
chapter.
§ 245-71. Abandonment.
The nonconforming use of a building or land which has been abandoned
shall not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. A
nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned when one of the
following conditions exists:
A. A nonconforming use may be extended as a special exception upon
approval through application of the Zoning Hearing Board, subject to
the following:
(1) The extension becomes an attached part of the main structure and
does not utilize additional or adjoining land area other than the
original parcel.
(2) The extension does not encroach upon the maximum building
height or yard setback requirements of the district in which the
nonconforming use is presently located.
(3) The extension is for the purpose of expanding the nonconforming
use in existence at the time of the legal acceptance of this chapter.
B. Extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming building or
structure which existed prior to the enactment of this chapter shall not
be deemed an extension of such nonconforming use.
A. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a
conforming use, except when authorized as a use by special exception
by the Zoning Hearing Board if the Board determines that the new
nonconforming use will more closely correspond to the uses authorized
in the district as permitted uses, uses by special exception or
conditional uses and that the new nonconforming use will be in keeping
with the character of the neighborhood in which it is located and will
have an equal or lesser impact on the neighborhood than the existing
nonconforming use.
B. When a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, the use
thereafter shall not be changed to a nonconforming use.
§ 245-68 MONACA CODE § 245-71
237:786
§ 245-72. Unlawful use not authorized.
Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted as authorization for or approval
of the continuance of the illegal use of a structure or premises in violation
of zoning controls in existence at the time of the effective date of legal
enactment of this chapter.
§ 245-73. District changes.
Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer
an area from one district to another district of a different classification, the
foregoing provisions shall apply to any nonconforming use existing therein.
§ 245-74. Registration.
The Zoning Officer shall be responsible for preparing a list of all
nonconforming uses existing at the time of the legal enactment of this
chapter, and such list shall be maintained for public use and information.
A. When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent.
B. When the characteristic equipment and furnishing of the
nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not
been replaced by similar equipment within 90 days, unless other facts
show intention to resume the nonconforming use.
C. When a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of six
months.
D. When it has been replaced by a conforming use.
E. When it has been changed to a use permitted as a special exception by

Conditional Uses Procedure
[Amended 9-28-2010 by Ord. No. 918]
§ 245-75. Purpose.
The purpose of this article shall be to provide for certain uses in specified
zoning districts which require a detailed and close examination by the
Borough Council. Such uses will have a significant impact on a particular
zoning district or the entire community; therefore, the uses necessitate
additional safeguards and control.
§ 245-76. Administration.
A. The applicant desiring conditional use approval shall file an application
on forms provided by the Borough.
B. Along with the application, the applicant shall file all maps, plans and
text necessary to explain the proposed development and its compliance
with the standards and criteria set forth in this chapter. Seventeen
copies of said maps, plans and text shall be filed. The copies shall be
distributed as follows: Planning Commission (five copies), Borough
Council and Mayor (eight copies), Borough Engineer (one copy), Zoning
Officer (one copy), Secretary (one copy) and Borough Solicitor (one
copy).
C. A complete application shall be filed by the applicant with either the
Borough Secretary or the Zoning Officer. The Zoning Officer shall
review the application to ensure that it is complete. If an application is
incomplete, the Zoning Officer shall inform the applicant of the specific
deficiencies of the application. Until a complete application is
submitted by the applicant, the Borough shall not formally review the
application.
D. A fee for the application for conditional use may be prescribed by the
Borough Council. Such a fee may be revised from time to time through
resolution by Borough Council. If a fee is prescribed, it shall be
submitted by the applicant to the Borough in conjunction with the
application for conditional use.
E. If approval for an application for conditional use is granted, the Zoning
Officer shall issue a certificate of conditional use on a standardized
form.
F. If approval for an application for conditional use is granted but
additional stipulations have been attached which must be adhered to
before a certificate of conditional use can be issued, such additional
stipulations shall be expressed in writing. The Zoning Officer, with
assistance from the Borough Solicitor or the Borough Engineer, if
necessary, shall prepare the written copy of additional stipulations. A
written copy of the additional stipulations shall be forwarded to the

applicant. From the date of receipt, the applicant shall have 14 days to
accept or reject the additional stipulations. The applicant shall forward
his decision, in writing, to the Borough Secretary or the Zoning Officer.
If the applicant fails to act within the fourteen-day time limit, it shall be
deemed that the applicant rejects the conditions stipulated.
G. If an application for conditional use is not approved, the applicant shall
be informed, in writing, of the denial and the specific reasons for the
denial. The Zoning Officer, with assistance from the Borough Solicitor
or the Borough Engineer, if necessary, shall prepare the written denial
which is to be signed by the President of the Borough Council or the
Borough Secretary acting as agent for the Borough Council.
A. Decisions regarding conditional uses shall be rendered by the Borough
Council. When considering conditional uses, the Borough Council shall
apply the standards and criteria detailed in Article IX to ensure that
such a use is consistent with the purpose of this chapter, the
Comprehensive Plan and other Borough development documents. Along
with the standards and criteria expressed in this chapter, the Borough
Council may attach additional reasonable conditions and safeguards it
deems necessary to implement the purpose of this chapter.
B. In considering an application for approval of a conditional use, Borough
Council shall proceed as follows:
(1) A public hearing, pursuant to public notice, as defined herein, shall
be conducted by Borough Council.
(2) The hearing shall be conducted by Borough Council or Borough
Council may appoint any member or an independent attorney as a
hearing officer.
(3) The first hearing shall be commenced within 60 days from the date
of the applicant's request, unless the applicant has agreed, in
writing, to an extension of time. Each subsequent hearing before
the Zoning Hearing Board or Hearing Officer shall be held within
45 days of the prior hearing, unless otherwise agreed to by the
applicant, in writing, or on the record. An applicant shall complete
the presentation of his case-in-chief within 100 days of the first
hearing. Upon request of the applicant, the Zoning Hearing Board
or Hearing Officer shall assure that the applicant receives at least
seven hours of hearings within the 100 days, including the first
hearing. Persons opposed to the application shall complete the
presentation of their opposition to the application within 100 days
of the first hearing held after the completion of the applicant's
case-in-chief. The applicant may, upon request, be granted
additional hearings to complete his case-in-chief provided the
persons opposed to the application are granted an equal number of
additional hearings. Persons opposed to the application may, upon
§ 245-76 MONACA CODE § 245-77
237:790
the written consent or consent on the record by the applicant
and the Borough, be granted additional hearings to complete their
opposition to the application provided the applicant is granted an
equal number of additional hearings for rebuttal.
(4) The decision, or, where no decision is called for, the findings, shall
be made by Borough Council. However, the applicant, in addition to
the Borough, prior to the decision, may waive decision or findings
by Borough Council and accept the decision or findings of the
hearing officer as final.
(5) In granting a conditional use, Borough Council may attach such
reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement
the purposes of this chapter.
(6) Borough Council shall render a written decision, or, when no
decision is called for, make written findings on the conditional use
application within 45 days after the last hearing before Borough
Council.

accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon,
together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any
provisions of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code269 or
any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a reference to the
provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion is deemed
appropriate in light of the facts found.
(8) Where Borough Council fails to render a decision within the period
required by this subsection or fails to commence, conduct or
complete the required hearing in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection, the decision shall be deemed to have been
rendered in favor of the applicant unless the applicant has agreed,
in writing, or on the record, to an extension of time.
(9) When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of failure of Borough Council to meet or render a decision,
as herein provided, Borough Council shall give public notice, as
defined herein, of the decision within 10 days from the last day it
could have met to render a decision. If Borough Council fails to
provide such notice, the applicant may do so.
(10) A copy of the final decision, or, where no decision is called for, of
the findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed
to him no later than the day following the date of the decision.
(11) Nothing in this subsection shall prejudice the right of any party
opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court of
competent jurisdiction.

change or amendment of this chapter shall affect the decision on such
application adversely to the applicant, and the applicant shall be
entitled to a decision in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
as it stood at the time the application was duly filed.
B. Provided, further, should an application be approved by the Borough
Council, the applicant shall be entitled to proceed with the submission
of either land development or subdivision plans within a period of six
months, or longer if approved by the Borough Council, following the
date of such approval. Such plans shall be submitted in accordance with
the provisions of all Borough ordinances and plans governing land
development as they stood at the time the application was duly filed
before the Borough Council. If either a land development or subdivision
plan is so filed within said period, such plans shall be subject to the time
limitations and regulations stipulated by said ordinances. The time
limitations shall commence as of the date of filing such land
development or subdivision plan.

§ 245-81 MONACA CODE § 245-81
237:800
the owner may request a variance from the Zoning Hearing
Board.
(d) If the construction described above was preceded by and only
permitted following the required approval of a subdivision or
land development, the three-year limitation for changes to this
chapter text and/or map affecting said construction shall be
measured from the date preliminary approval was granted for
the subdivision or land development. If no preliminary
approval was granted, the date shall be measured from the
date final approval was granted for the subdivision or land
development.

Officer shall be returned to the applicant along with a written

the inspection and the findings of the Zoning Officer with respect to
the conformance of the construction with the permit issued.
(a) Before construction begins, the Zoning Officer shall inspect the
site to ensure that the construction will comply with the permit

the building or stricture and/or the building lot, to determine if
the actual construction will comply with the permit issued.
(b) At the completion of construction, the Zoning Officer shall
inspect the site to ensure that the completed construction is in

other Borough agents, may be revoked within the thirty-day appeal
period as outlined in § 245-96A. If such an errantly issued permit is not
revoked within the thirty-day appeal period, the decision to revoke the
permit shall be determined by the Borough Council after consultation

advantageous to the applicant to include all components of the
development in one application for a conditional use or a special
exception. If all components of a development are not included in the
original application (i.e., signs, lighting, etc.) and the applicant
proposes additional components of a development which are not

237:807
be obtained by the applicant before commencing any construction,
development or use of land governed by said permits.
C. In certain instances, both a conditional use or special exception and a
subdivision/land development approval are required for proposed
development plans. In such cases, both a conditional use or a special
exception and a subdivision/land development must be approved by the
appropriate government review agencies for the applicant to proceed
with the proposed development plans.
D. Approval by any Borough branch of government for any development
plan, whether it be the approval of a conditional use, special exception
and/or a subdivision/land development plan, does not guarantee that
the applicant will be permitted to legally proceed with the proposed
development plans when other state and federal agencies are involved
in the approval of the development process. It is the responsibility of
the applicant to determine what other governmental agencies are

A. A Zoning Hearing Board is hereby created.
B. The members of the Board shall be residents of the Borough and shall
be appointed by the Borough Council through a majority vote.
C. The Board shall consist of three members.
D. The term of office of Board members shall be three years and shall be so

unexpired portion of the term.
F. Board members shall not hold any other Borough office, be a member of
the Borough Planning Commission or be the Zoning Officer.
G. Board members may receive compensation for the performance of their
duties but in no case shall it exceed the rate of compensation
authorized to be paid to the members of the Borough Council. If
compensation is instituted, the Borough Council shall do so by
resolution.
H. If a member of the Board changes residence which results in such
member not being a resident within the political subdivision boundaries
of the Borough, such member shall immediately vacate such
membership to the Board.
I. The Borough Council may appoint by resolution at least one but no
more than three residents of the Borough to serve as alternative
members of the Board.
(1) The term of office of an alternate member shall be three years.
(2) When seated pursuant to the provisions of § 245-90B, an alternate
member shall be entitled to participate in all proceedings and
discussions of the Board to the same and full extent as provided by
law for Board members. The alternate member shall have the right
to cast a vote as a voting member during the proceedings and shall
have all the powers and duties set forth in this chapter and as
otherwise provided by law.
§ 245-87 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-88
237:809
§ 245-89. Removal of members.
Any Board member may be removed for malfeasance, misfeasance or
nonfeasance in office, or for other just cause, by a majority vote of the
Borough Council which appointed the member, taken after the member has
received 15 days' advance notice of the intent to take such a vote. A hearing
shall be held in connection with the vote if the member shall request it in
writing.
§ 245-90. Organization of Board.
(3) An alternate member shall not hold any other Borough office, be a
member of the Borough Planning Commission or be the Zoning

Council. If compensation is instituted, the Borough Council shall do
so by resolution.

discussion of the Board but shall not be entitled to vote as a
member of the Board nor be compensated pursuant to Subsection
I(4) unless designated as a voting alternate member pursuant to
§ 245-90B.
A. The Board shall elect from its own membership its officers, who shall
serve annual terms as such and may succeed themselves. For the
conduct of any hearing and the taking of any action, a quorum shall not
be less than a majority of all the members of the Board, but the Board
may appoint a hearing officer from its own membership to conduct any
hearing on its behalf, and the parties may waive further action by the
Board as provided in § 245-93.

members of the Board to sit on the Board as may be needed to provide
for a quorum. Any alternate member of the Board shall continue to
serve on the Board in all proceedings involving the matter or case for
which the alternate was initially appointed until the Board has made a
final determination of the matter or case. Designation of an alternate
pursuant to this section shall be made on a case-by-case basis in
rotation according to declining seniority among all alternates.
C. The Board may make, alter and rescind rules and forms for its
procedure, consistent with ordinances of the Borough and laws of the
commonwealth. The Board shall keep full public records of its business,
which records shall be the property of the Borough, and shall submit a
report of its activities to the Borough Council at the request of the
Borough Council.

findings of the Hearing Officer as final. [Amended 9-28-2010 by Ord.
No. 918]
E. The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person affected by
the application who has made timely appearance of record before the

J. The Board or the hearing officer shall not communicate, directly or
indirectly, with any party or his representatives in connection with any
issue involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to
participate, shall not take notice of any communication, reports, staff
memoranda or other materials, except advice from their Solicitor,
unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to contest the material so
noticed and shall not inspect the site or its surroundings after
commencement of hearings with any party or his representatives unless
all parties are given an opportunity to be present.
K. The Board or the hearing officer, as the case may be, shall render a
written decision or, when no decision is called for, make written
findings on the application within 45 days after the last hearing before
the Board or the hearing officer.
(1) Where the application is contested or denied, each decision shall be
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions based thereon
together with the reasons therefor. Conclusions based on any
provision of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act
247, as amended),273 or of any Borough ordinance, rule or
regulation shall contain a reference to the provision relied on and
the reasons why the conclusion is deemed appropriate in the light

no stipulation that his decision or findings are final, the Board shall
make his report and recommendations available to the parties
within 45 days and the parties shall be entitled to make written
representations thereon to the Board prior to final decision or entry
of findings, and the Board's decision shall be entered no later than

(3) Where the Zoning Hearing Board fails to render a decision within
the required forty-five-day period or fails to commence or complete
the required hearing as provided in § 245-93C, the decision shall be
deemed to have been rendered in favor of the applicant, unless the
applicant has agreed, in writing or on the record, to an extension of
time. [Amended 9-28-2010 by Ord. No. 918]
(4) When a decision has been rendered in favor of the applicant
because of the failure of the Board to meet or render a decision as
273. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 10101 et seq.
§ 245-93 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-93
237:813
hereinabove provided, the Board shall give public notice of said
decision within 10 days from the last day it could have met to
render a decision in the same manner as provided in Subsection A.
If the Board shall fail to provide such notice, the applicant may do
so.
(5) Nothing in Subsection K of this section shall prejudice the right of
any party opposing the application to appeal the decision to a court
of competent jurisdiction.
(6) A copy of the final decision or, where no decision is called for, of the
findings shall be delivered to the applicant personally or mailed to
him not later than the day following its date. To all other persons
who have filed their names and addresses with the Board not later
than the last day of the hearing, the Board shall provide, by mail or
otherwise, brief notice of the decision or findings and a statement
of the place at which the full decision or findings may be examined.
L. Mediation option. [Added 9-28-2010 by Ord. No. 918]
(1) Parties to proceedings authorized in this article may utilize
mediation as an aid in completing such proceedings. In
proceedings before the Zoning Hearing Board, in no case shall the
Zoning Hearing Board initiate mediation or participate as a
mediating party. Mediation shall supplement, not replace, those
procedures in this § 245-93 once they have been formally initiated.
Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as expanding or
limiting municipal police powers or as modifying any principles of
substantive law.
(2) Participation in mediation shall be wholly voluntary. The
appropriateness of mediation shall be determined by the
particulars of each case and the willingness of the parties to
negotiate. The Borough, in offering the mediation option, shall
assure that in each case the mediating parties, assisted by the
mediator as appropriate, develop terms and conditions for:
(a) Funding mediation.
(b) Selecting a mediator who, at a minimum, shall have a working
knowledge of municipal zoning and subdivision procedures and
demonstrated skills in mediation.
(c) Completing mediation, including time limits for such
completion.
(d) Suspending time limits otherwise authorized in this chapter or
in the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247, as
amended),274 provided there is written consent by the
274. Editor's Note: See 53 P.S. § 1010 et seq.
§ 245-93 MONACA CODE § 245-93
237:814
§ 245-94. Jurisdiction.
The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and render final
adjudication in the following matters:
mediating parties, and by an applicant or Borough decisionmaking
body, if either is not a party to the mediation.
(e) Identifying all parties and affording them the opportunity to
participate.
(f) Subject to legal restraints, determining whether some or all of
the mediation sessions shall be open or closed to the public.
(g) Assuring that mediated solutions are in writing and signed by
the parties, and become subject to review and approval by the
appropriate decisionmaking body pursuant to the authorized
procedures set forth in this chapter.
(3) No offers or statements made in the mediation sessions, excluding
the final written mediated agreement, shall be admissible as
evidence in any subsequent judicial or administrative proceedings.
A. Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance, except
those brought before the Borough Council by a landowner as a curative
amendment (see § 245-95C).
B. Challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the process of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after
the effective date of said ordinance.
C. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer, including but not
limited to the granting or denial of any permit or failure to act on the
application therefor; the issuance of any cease and desist order; or the
registration or refusal to register any nonconforming use, structure or
lot.
D. Appeals from a determination by the Borough Engineer or the Zoning
Officer with reference to the administration of any floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance.
E. Appeals from the Zoning Officer's preliminary opinion determination
under § 245-80 of this chapter.
F. Appeals from the determination of the Zoning Officer or Borough
Engineer in the administration of any land use ordinance or provision
thereof with reference to sedimentation and erosion control and
stormwater management insofar as the same relate to development not
involving subdivision and land development applications.
§ 245-93 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-94
237:815
§ 245-95. Variances, special exceptions and substantive challenges.
G. Applications for variances from the terms of this chapter, flood hazard
ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance (see
§ 245-95A).
H. Applications for special exception under this chapter, floodplain or flood
hazard ordinance or such provisions within a land use ordinance (see
§ 245-95B).
A. Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is
alleged that this chapter or other applicable ordinances inflict
unnecessary hardship upon the applicant. The Board may by rule
prescribe the form of the application and may require preliminary
application to the Zoning Officer. In granting any variances, the Board
may attach, in addition to the express standards and criteria as detailed
in Article IX, such reasonable conditions and safeguards as it may deem
necessary to implement the purpose of this chapter. The Board may
grant a variance, provided that all of the following findings are made
where relevant in a given case:
(1) There are unique physical circumstances or conditions, including
irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or shape, or
exceptional topography, or other physical conditions peculiar to the
particular property and that the unnecessary hardship is due to
such conditions and not the circumstances or conditions generally
created by the provisions of this chapter in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(2) Because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is no
possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity
with the provisions of this chapter and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the
property.
(3) Such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the applicant.
(4) The variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of
the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public
welfare.
(5) The variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum variance
that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation in issue.
B. Special exceptions. Where special exceptions are to be considered as
specified by the Borough Council in this chapter, the Board shall grant
or deny special exceptions pursuant to express standards and criteria
as detailed in Article IX. In granting a special exception, the Board may
attach such reasonable conditions and safeguards, in addition to those
§ 245-94 MONACA CODE § 245-95
237:816
expressed in this chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the
purposes of this chapter.
C. Substantive challenges.
(1) A landowner who on substantive grounds desires to challenge the
validity of this chapter, Zoning Map or any provision thereof which
prohibits or restricts the use or development of land in which he
has an interest; or persons aggrieved by a use or development
permitted on the land of another by this chapter, Zoning Map or
provision thereof who desires to challenge its validity on
substantive grounds shall submit their challenge to the Board as
governed by the following:
(a) The challenging party shall make a written request to the
Board that it hold a hearing on its challenge. The request shall
contain the reasons for the challenge.
(b) Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or
hearings, the Board shall determine whether the challenged
ordinance or map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. If a
challenge heard by the Board is found to have merit, the
decision of the Board shall include recommended amendments
to the challenged ordinance which will cure the defects found.
In reaching its decision, the Board shall consider the
amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
[1] The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities,
water supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
[2] If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the
proposal upon regional housing needs and the
effectiveness of the proposal in providing housing units of
a type actually available to and affordable by classes of
persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by the challenged
provisions of the ordinance or map.
[3] The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed
by the site's soils, slopes, wetlands, woodlands,
floodplains, aquifers, natural resources and other natural
features.
[4] The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
wetlands, woodlands, floodplains, natural resources and
natural features, the degree to which these are protected
or destroyed and the tolerance of the resources to
development and to any adverse environmental impacts.
[5] The impact of the proposal on the preservation of
agriculture and other land uses which are essential to
public health and welfare.
§ 245-95 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-95
237:817
(c) The Board shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing.
(d) If the Board fails to act on the landowner's request within the
time limits referred to above, a denial of the request is deemed
to have occurred on the 46th day after the close of the last
hearing.
(e) The Board shall commence its hearings within 60 days after
the request is filed unless the landowner requests or consents
to an extension of time.
(f) Public notice of the hearing shall include notice that the
validity of the ordinance and/or map is in question and shall
give the place where and the times when a copy of the request,
including any plans, explanatory material or proposed
amendments, may be examined by the public.
(g) The challenge shall be deemed denied when:
[1] The Board fails to commence the hearing within the time
limit set forth in Subsection C(1)(e); or
[2] The Board falls to act on the request 45 days after the
close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is
extended by mutual consent by the landowner and the
Board.
[3] Where a validity challenge is sustained by the Board
pursuant to this section or the court acts finally on appeal
from denial of a curative amendment proposal or a validity
challenge, and the proposal or challenge so approved
requires a further application for subdivision or land
development, the developer shall have two years from the
date of such approval to file an application for preliminary
or tentative approval subject to the Monaca Borough
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, as
amended.275 Within the two-year period, no subsequent
change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any
manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant
sustained in the validity challenge. Upon the filing of a
preliminary or tentative plan, the provisions of Section
508(4) of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code
(Act 247, as amended) shall apply. Where the validity
challenge is approved but does not require further
application under the Monaca Borough Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance, as amended, the developer
shall have one year within which to file for a building
permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent change

Appeals from the determination or decisions of the Board shall be filed and
handled as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code
(Act 247, as amended).276
or amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other
governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any
manner which adversely affects the rights of the applicant
as granted in the sustained validity challenge. During
these protected periods, the court shall retain or assume
jurisdiction for the purpose of awarding such
supplemental relief as may be necessary.
A. All appeals from the determinations adverse to the landowner or
applicant shall be filed by the landowner or applicant, as the case may
be, within 30 days after notice of the determination is issued, including
but not limited to, determinations by the Zoning Officer, Municipal
Engineer, Borough Council, Borough Planning Commission or any other
duly authorized organization enforcing and/or interpreting land use
regulations.
B. No person shall be allowed to file any proceeding with the Board later
than 30 days after an application for development, whether it be
preliminary or final, has been approved by an appropriate municipal
officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal
or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and
proves that he has no notice, knowledge or reason to believe that such
approval has been given.

requirements of the written request hereof, shall include the plans
and explanatory materials describing the use or development
proposed by the landowner in lieu of the use or development
permitted by the challenged ordinance or map. Such plans or other
materials shall not be required to meet the standards prescribed
for preliminary, tentative or final approval or for the issuance of a
permit, so long as they provide reasonable notice of the proposed
use or development and a sufficient basis for evaluating the
challenged ordinance or map in light thereof. Also, an application
fee, if prescribed by the Borough Council, shall be submitted with
the application. Nothing herein contained shall preclude the
landowner from first seeking a final approval before submitting his
challenge.

defects therein. Such amendment or amendments shall be
proposed by the landowner.

any plans, explanatory material or proposed amendments, may be
examined without charge or obtained for a charge not greater than
the cost thereof. The Borough Council shall publish the proposed
curative amendment once in one newspaper of general circulation
in the Borough not more than 60 days nor less than seven days
prior to the hearing. Publication of the proposed curative
amendment shall include either the full text thereof or the title and
a brief summary, prepared by the Borough Solicitor and setting
forth all the provisions in reasonable detail. If the full text is not

newspaper of general circulation in the Borough, a brief summary
setting forth all the provisions in reasonable detail together with a
summary of the changes.
(4) The Borough Solicitor shall represent and advise the Borough
Council at the hearing or hearings.
(5) The Borough Council may retain an independent attorney to
present the defense of the challenged chapter or map on its behalf

Subsection B(2) above, written notice shall be given to the
applicant, the Zoning Officer and to any person who has made
timely written request for the same. Written notices shall be
delivered by the Borough through certified United States mail. In
addition, written notice of said hearing shall be conspicuously
posted on the affected tract of land at least one week prior to the
hearing.
(7) The Borough Council may prescribe reasonable fees through
resolution with respect to the curative amendment hearing. Fees
for said hearings may include notice and advertising costs and
necessary administrative overhead connected with the hearing.
The costs, however, shall not include legal expenses of the Borough
Council, expenses for engineering, architectural or other technical
consultants or expert witness costs.
(8) The hearing or hearings shall be conducted by the Borough
Council.
(9) The parties to the hearing shall be the Borough, any person
affected by the application who has made timely appearance of
record before the Borough Council, and any other person, including
civic or community organizations permitted to appear by the
Borough Council. The Borough Council shall have the power to
require that all persons who wish to be considered parties enter
appearances, in writing, on forms provided by the Borough Council
for that purpose.
(10) The President or acting President of the Borough Council presiding
shall have the power to administer oaths and issue subpoenas to

with any party or his representatives in connection with any issue
involved except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to

Borough Solicitor, unless the parties are afforded an opportunity to
contest the material so noticed and shall not inspect the site or its
surroundings after the commencement of hearings with any party
or his representatives unless all parties are given an opportunity to
be present.
C. Based upon the testimony presented at the hearing or hearings, the
Borough Council shall determine whether the challenged chapter or
map is defective, as alleged by the landowner. The Borough Council
shall render a written decision. When the application is contested or
denied, each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon, together with the reasons thereof.
Conclusions based on any ordinance, rule or regulation shall contain a
reference to the provision relied on and the reasons why the conclusion
is deemed appropriate in the light of the facts found.
D. If the Borough Council has determined that a validity challenge has
merit, it may accept a landowner's curative amendment, with or
without revision, or may adopt an alternative amendment which will
cure the challenged defects. The Borough Council shall consider the
curative amendments, plans and explanatory material submitted by the
landowner and shall also consider:
(1) The impact of the proposal upon roads, sewer facilities, water
supplies, schools and other public service facilities.
(2) If the proposal is for a residential use, the impact of the proposal
upon regional housing needs and the effectiveness of the proposal
in providing housing units of a type actually available to and
§ 245-100 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-100
237:825
affordable by classes of persons otherwise unlawfully excluded by
the challenged provisions of the ordinance or map.
(3) The suitability of the site for the intensity of use proposed by the
site's soils, slopes, woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, aquifers,
natural resources and other natural features.
(4) The impact of the proposed use on the site's soils, slopes,
woodlands, wetlands, floodplains, natural resources and natural
features, the degree to which these are protected or destroyed, the
tolerance of the resources to development and any adverse
environmental impacts.
(5) The impact of the proposal on the preservation of agriculture and
other land uses which are essential to public health and welfare.
E. The Borough Council shall render its decision within 45 days after the
conclusion of the last hearing. If the Borough Council fails to act on the
landowner's request within the forty-five-day period mentioned above, a
denial of the request is deemed to have occurred on the 46th day after
the close of the last hearing. The challenge shall also be deemed denied
when:
(1) The Borough Council fails to commence the hearing within the
allowed time limits.
(2) The Borough Council notifies the landowner that it will not adopt
the curative amendment.
(3) The Borough Council adopts another curative amendment which is
unacceptable to the landowner.
(4) The Borough Council fails to act on the request 45 days after the
close of the last hearing on the request, unless the time is extended
by mutual consent by the landowner and the Borough.
F. A copy of the final decision of the findings shall be delivered to the
applicant personally or mailed to him no later than the day following its
date. To all other persons who have filed their name and address with
the Borough Council not later than the last day of the hearing, the
Borough Council shall provide, by mail or otherwise, brief notice of the
decision or findings and a statement of the place at which the full
decision or findings may be examined.
G. Within 30 days after a curative amendment, whether the landowner's
amendment or a revised amendment proposed by the Borough Council,
has been enacted, a copy of the amendment to this chapter or Map shall
be forwarded to the Beaver County Planning Commission.
H. If the Borough does not accept a landowner's curative amendment
brought in accordance with this section and a court subsequently rules
that the challenge has merit, the court's decision shall not result in a
declaration of invalidity for the entire chapter or Zoning Map, but only
§ 245-100 MONACA CODE § 245-100
237:826
§ 245-101. Municipal curative amendment.
If the Borough Council determines that this chapter, the Zoning Map278 or
portion thereof is substantially invalid, it shall take the following action:
for those provisions which specifically relate to the landowner's
curative amendment and challenge.
I. Where a curative amendment proposal is approved by the grant of a
curative amendment application by the Borough Council or the court
acts finally on appeal from a denial of a curative amendment proposal,
and the proposal so approved requires a further application for
subdivision or land development, the developer shall have two years
from the date of such approval to file an application for preliminary or
tentative approval subject to the Monaca Borough Subdivision and
Land Development Ordinance,277 as amended. Within the two-year
period, no subsequent change or amendment in the zoning, subdivision
or other governing ordinance or plan shall be applied in any manner
which adversely affects the rights of the applicant as granted in the
curative amendment. Upon the filing of the preliminary or tentative
plan, the provisions of Section 508(4) of the Pennsylvania
Municipalities Planning Code, Act 247 (as amended), shall apply. Where
the proposal appended to the curative amendment application is
approved but does not require further application under the Monaca
Borough Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance, as amended,
the developer shall have one year within which to file for a building
permit. Within the one-year period, no subsequent change or
amendment in the zoning, subdivision or other governing ordinance or
plan shall be applied in any manner which adversely affects the rights
of the applicant as granted in the curative amendment. During these
protected periods, the court shall retain or assume jurisdiction for the
purpose of awarding such supplemental relief as may be necessary.
A. The Borough Council shall declare by formal action this chapter, the
Zoning Map or portion thereof substantially invalid and propose to
prepare a curative amendment to overcome such invalidity. Within 30
days following such declaration and proposal, the Borough Council
shall:
(1) By resolution, make specific findings setting forth the declared
invalidity of this chapter, Map or portion thereof which may
include:
(a) References to specific uses which are either not permitted or
not permitted in sufficient quantity.
(b) Reference to a class or use or uses which requires revision.
277. Editor's Note: See Ch. 210, Subdivision and Land Development.
278. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Borough offices.
§ 245-100 WATER AND SEWAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM § 245-101
237:827
(c) Reference to the entire ordinance which requires revision.
(2) Begin to prepare and consider a curative amendment to this
chapter to correct the declared invalidity.
B. Within 180 days from the date of the declaration and proposal, the
Borough shall enact a curative amendment to validate or reaffirm the
validity of its chapter pursuant to the provision required by § 245-99 in
order to cure the declared invalidity of this chapter.
C. Upon the initiation of the procedures as set forth in this section, the
Borough Council shall not be required to entertain or consider any
landowner's curative amendment filed under § 245-100, nor shall the
Zoning Hearing Board be required to give a report as requested under
§ 245-95C. Upon completion of the procedures as set forth in
Subsections A and B of this section, no right to a cure pursuant to the
provisions of § 245-100 or § 245-95C shall, from the date of declaration
and proposal, accrue to any landowner on the basis of the substantive
invalidity of the unamended chapter for which there has been a curative
amendment pursuant to this section.
D. The Borough, if it has utilized the procedures as set forth in Subsections
A and B of this section, may not utilize said procedure for a thirty-sixmonth
period following the date of the enactment of a curative
amendment, or reaffirmation of the validity of this chapter pursuant to
Subsection B of this section; provided, however, that if after the date of
declaration and proposal there is a substantially new duty or obligation
imposed upon the Borough by virtue of a change in the statute or by
virtue of a Pennsylvania Appellate Court decision, the Borough may
utilize the provisions of this section to prepare a curative amendment to
its ordinance to fulfill said duty or obligation.

may have assisted in the commission of any such violation shall each day
be guilty of a separate offense and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined
as herein provided. Whenever any person or corporation shall have been
officially notified by the Zoning Officer or by service of a summons in a
prosecution or in any other official manner that he is committing a violation
of this chapter, each day that he shall continue such violation after such
notification shall constitute a separate offense punishable in like fine or
penalty. Such fines or penalties shall be collected as the fines or penalties
are now collected by law.
