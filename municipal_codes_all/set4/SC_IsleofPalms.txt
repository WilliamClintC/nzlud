PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Isle of Palms, South Carolina. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1994 Code and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1994 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation that represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel Walker, Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Nick Sottile, City Attorney, and the City administrative staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(a)  When required.

The Purchasing Agent may secure professional services by direct negotiation and selection, taking into account the type of services required, the proximity (location) of the professional providing the services, the capability of the professional to produce the required service within a reasonable time, past performance, and the ability to meet budget requirements. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the City from using competitive procurement procedures for professional services if City Council determines it is in the best interests of the City. 
(3)  The following types of expenditures are exempt from the competitive procurement requirements of this section:

(5)  An expenditure may be made without competitive procurement when an item is required for trial use or testing. The Purchasing Agent shall set forth such determination and the basis therefor in a written statement submitted to City Council and entered in the minutes of Council. 
(6)  The Purchasing Agent may obtain goods and services from an awarded bidder in a competitive bidding process utilized within the preceding twelve (12) months by another political subdivision of the state for substantially the same goods or services when the Purchasing Agent has good reason to believe that the awarded bidder is the lowest qualified bidder at the time the City obtains such goods and services. 
(7)  Competitive procurement shall not be required for goods and services purchased through a state contract awarded by the purchasing division of the State of South Carolina, or when an item that is equivalent or superior to a state contract item is purchased at a price equal to or less than the state contract price. 
(8)  An expenditure may be made without competitive procurement when it is determined by the Purchasing Agent that the expenditure is critical to the City and time does not permit for solicitation or resolicitation in accordance with the procedures set forth in this chapter.

(9)  The approval requirements set forth in section 1-10-3 shall apply to the expenditures listed in each exception hereinabove; provided, however, that City Council approval shall not be required for emergency purchases pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

Sec. 1-10-5. - Methods of source selection. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  Request for information (RFI) shall mean an informal request for information on potential vendors or service providers to determine what products and services are available and the capabilities of the vendors/providers in terms of offerings and strengths for the purpose of developing a future procurement process, developing strategy, and/or building a database. The RFI is not a procurement method and does not result directly in the award of a contract. In the event that sufficient information is received, the City may, but is not obligated to, initiate a competitive bidding opportunity. No contractual obligation whatsoever on behalf of the City shall arise from the RFI process. 
(2)  Request for bids (RFB) shall mean a formal request to prospective vendors soliciting price quotations or bids. 
(3)  Request for proposals (RFP) shall mean a formal solicitation for proposals based on a generalized scope of work with contract award to the responsible person(s) submitting the most advantageous and responsive proposal. 
(4)  Request for qualifications (RFQ) shall mean a formal solicitation for professional/technical capabilities. 
(b)  Request for information (RFI). A request for information may be used prior to the issuance of a request for bids (RFB), request for proposals (RFP), or request for qualifications (RFQ) for any contract for City improvements, materials, equipment, or services costing more than $25,000.00, if requested by City Council. 
(c)  Competitive sealed bidding.

The newspaper notice required herein shall include a general description of the articles or services to be purchased, state where bid forms and specifications may be secured, and the time and place for opening of sealed bids. In the event that, after advertising as aforesaid, no bids are received, the Purchasing Agent shall, with approval of the City Council, solicit bids by mail, telephone, newspaper, posting on the City's website, or by any other reasonable manner to secure responsible bidders. 
(4)  Sealing. Bids shall be submitted to the Purchasing Agent securely sealed in an envelope, and shall be identified on the envelope in accordance with bid instructions. 
(5)  Opening. Bids shall be opened in public in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place stated in the public notices. 
(6)  Tabulation. A tabulation of all bids received shall be available for public inspection.

(9)  Right to waiver. The City has the right, but not the obligation, to waive informalities or irregularities in a bid received and allow the bid to be considered. 
(10)  Bid instructions. Bid instructions shall be prepared or approved by the Purchasing Agent. In the event of a conflict between the bid instructions and this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall control. 
(11)  Pre-qualification. When it is considered impracticable to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for proposals may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids complete with cost and pricing information limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation. 
(12)  Award. Contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. In determining the lowest responsible bidder, in addition to price, the Purchasing Agent and City Council shall consider: 
(i)  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
(ii)  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
(iii)  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
(iv)  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
(v)  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contracts or services; 
(vi)  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
(vii)  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; 
(viii)  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service for the use of the subject of the contract; 
(ix)  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid; 
(x)  The ability of the bidder to meet the specifications or to offer an acceptable alternative equivalent. 
(13)  Award to other than low bidder. When the award is not given to the lowest bidder, a full and complete statement of the reasons for same shall be prepared or approved by the Purchasing Agent, filed with the documents relating to the transaction, and held for a period of not less than three (3) years. 
(14)  Tie bids. If two (2) or more bidders submit the low bid, quality and service being equal, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder. If two (2) or more of such bids are submitted by local bidders, the contract shall be awarded to one (1) of the local bidders by drawing lots in public. If local bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the Purchasing Agent shall award the contract to one (1) of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public. 
(15)  Bid deposits. The Purchasing Agent or City Council shall have the authority to require a bid deposit, which shall be prescribed in the public notices inviting sealed bids. Upon entering into a contract, bidders shall be entitled to return of a required bid deposit. The City shall retain a successful bidder's bid deposit upon failure of bidder to enter into a contract within thirty (30) days after the award; provided, however, that the City Council, in its sole discretion, may waive this forfeiture. 
(16)  Performance bonds. The Purchasing Agent or City Council shall have the authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as the Purchasing Agent or City Council deems reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the City. The requirement of a performance bond shall be stated in any bid instructions. 
(17)  Payment bond/labor and material bond. The Purchasing Agent or City Council may require a payment bond and labor and material bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as the Purchasing Agent deems reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the City. The requirements of such bonds shall be stated in any bid instructions. 
(18)  Negotiations authorized. 
(i)  Generally, sealed bids are not negotiated, but in the event that all bids are rejected because of the amount of the bid, the Purchasing Agent is authorized in situations where the City's best interest precludes resolicitation of bids of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment in the bid price of the lowest responsible bidder, including changing the bid specifications, in order to bring the bid within the amount of funds deemed by the Purchasing Agent or City Council to be available for the contract. If such negotiations are unsuccessful, the Purchasing Agent is authorized to enter into new negotiations with the next lowest responsible bidder, and likewise the third and sequential bidders until a bid price acceptable to the City is obtained. If the Purchasing Agent is unsuccessful in the first round of negotiations, negotiations may be reopened with any bidder with whom negotiations have occurred. If a contract is still not able to be negotiated, the scope of the request for bids may be changed in an effort to reduce the cost to a fair, reasonable and acceptable amount and all responsive bidders must be allowed to submit their best and final offers/bids. 
(ii)  When all bids received are rejected and are not successfully negotiated as provided by subsection (ii) of this section and it is determined by the Purchasing Agent or City Council that time or other circumstances will not permit the delay required to resolicit competitive sealed bids, a contract may be negotiated provided that: 
1.  Each responsible bidder who submitted a bid under the original solicitation is notified of the determination and is given reasonable opportunity to negotiate; 
2.  The negotiated price is lower than the lowest rejected bid by any responsible and responsive bidder under the original solicitation; and 
3.  The negotiated price is the lowest negotiated price offered by any responsible and responsive bidder. 
(d)  Competitive sealed proposals. 
(1)  Conditions for use. When the Purchasing Agent determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or not advantageous to the City, a contract for City improvements, materials, equipment, or services costing more than $25,000.00 may be awarded by competitive sealed proposals. 
(2)  Request for proposals (RFP). Proposals shall be solicited through a formal request for proposals. 
(3)  Public notice. Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given in the same manner as provided for competitive sealed bidding. 
(4)  Sealing. Proposals shall be submitted to the Purchasing Agent securely sealed in an envelope, and shall be identified on the envelope in accordance with the instructions in the request for proposals. 
(5)  Proposal opening. Proposals shall be publicly opened in the presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place stated in the public notices. Only the names of the offerors shall be disclosed at the proposal opening. Contents of competing offerors shall not be disclosed during the process of review and discussions. Proposals shall be for public inspection after contract award. Proprietary or confidential information marked as such in each proposal shall not be disclosed without written consent of the offeror. Late proposals shall neither be opened nor considered for award; however, the name and address of the late offeror and the time of attempted delivery shall be recorded wherever practicable. 
(6)  Rejection of bids. The Purchasing Agent or City Council has the authority to reject all proposals, parts of all proposals, or all proposals for any one (1) or more supplies or contractual services included in the proposed contract. 
(7)  Bidders in default to City. The Purchasing Agent shall not accept the proposal of a vendor or contractor who is delinquent in the payment of taxes, licenses, or other monies due to the City. 
(8)  Right to waiver. The City has the right, but not the obligation, to waive informalities or irregularities in a proposal received and allow the proposal to be considered. 
(9)  Discussion with responsible offerors and revisions to proposals. As provided in the request for proposals, discussions may be conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals, and such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors. 
(10)  Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the evaluation factors and, if necessary, the relative importance of price and of each other evaluation factor. 
(11)  Negotiations with preferred offeror. After proposals have been evaluated, negotiations may be held with the preferred offeror in an effort to reach terms advantageous to the City. Notwithstanding this provision, requests for proposals may incorporate contract terms to which all offerors shall be expected to adhere. 
(12)  Award. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be most advantageous to the City taking into consideration the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals and any addenda thereto. No other factors or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. 
(13)  Performance bonds. The Purchasing Agent or City Council shall have the authority to require a performance bond before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as the Purchasing Agent or City Council deems reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the City. The requirement of a performance bond shall be stated in the request for proposal. 
(14)  Payment bond/labor and material bond. The Purchasing Agent or City Council may require a payment bond and labor and material bond, before entering into a contract, in such form and amount as the Purchasing Agent deems reasonably necessary to protect the best interest of the City. The requirements of such bonds shall be stated in the request for proposal.

Sec. 1-10-6. - Construction contracting. 
(a)  The Purchasing Agent may recommend the appropriate method of construction contracting for a particular project. In determining which method to recommend, the Purchasing Agent shall consider the City's requirements, the scope of the project, its resources, and the potential contractor's capabilities. 
(b)  City Council finds that certain non-traditional means of public construction project management, such as construction management services, design-build services, or turnkey management services, can be in the best interests of the City in certain circumstances. Such services allow for the selection of a single business to perform and manage the complete design and construction of a project. Therefore, the following methods may be employed under the following circumstances: 
(1)  The Purchasing Agent shall have the discretion to use construction management services, design-build services, or turnkey management services as alternatives for construction contracting administration. In exercising such discretion, the Purchasing Agent shall consider the method which, in the Purchasing Agent's discretion, is the most advantageous to the City and will result in the most timely, economical, and successful completion of the construction project. 
(2)  If the Purchasing Agent determines that the use of construction management services, design-build services or turnkey management services is the most advantageous means of securing the construction contracting administration as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and the amount of services to be secured thereby is anticipated to exceed $500,000.00, the selection of the method of construction contracting administration shall be submitted for review to the Ways and Means Committee of City Council. Within fifteen (15) days after notice of such review, an interested party shall submit to the Ways and Means Committee written comments which set forth the position of the party with respect to the decision as to which construction contracting method to use. At the next meeting of the Committee, which shall not occur until after at least fifteen (15) days following notice of such review, those who submitted comments may address the Committee. Following the meeting of the Committee, if City Council does not reject the selection of this method, the construction contracting administration shall be secured in the manner set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. 
(3)  The City shall use the competitive sealed proposal method set forth in this chapter for the purposes of procuring construction management services, design build services, or turnkey management services or any other similar type of construction management contract. The Purchasing Agent may retain outside consulting services to prepare such requests for proposals. The request for proposals for any of these services shall set forth the criteria which the City will be using to select the successful proposal.

ARTICLE B. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY FEE 

Sec. 3-3-21. - Stormwater management utility fee; classification of property. 
A.  Classification. For purposes of determining the fee, all real property in the City is classified as follows: 
1.  Single-family residential; 
2.  Vacant; 
3.  Commercial. 
B.  Base rate. The base rate shall be forty-eight dollars ($48.00) annually. In no case shall a utility customer be billed a fee for less than one-half (1/2) the base rate. 
C.  Equivalent residential unit (ERU). The commonly accepted rate unit for stormwater utilities is the equivalent residential unit (ERU). This is a descriptive value based on the land classification type and the amount of impervious surface. The ERU is used to relate a rate charged for a typical residential property and this becomes the common denominator by which commercial properties are evaluated. The ERU for Charleston County has been determined to be three thousand (3,000) square feet. 
D.  Annual fees. Annual fees for all property shall be as follows: 
1.  Single-family residential property. Single-family residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one (1) equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or improvements (impervious area). 
2.  Vacant property. Vacant property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one half (1/2) equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel. 
3.  Commercial property. Commercial property shall be charged the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area of the property, as determined by the Director of Public Works or an authorized designee, by one (1) ERU (3,000 square feet). The numerical factor will be rounded to the nearest tenth (0.1) of a unit. The minimum fee for any commercial property shall be the base rate times one half (1/2) ERU. Those commercial properties with impervious area greater than one-half (1/2) ERU (1,500 square feet) and less than one (1) ERU (3,000 square feet) shall be charged the base rate times one (1) ERU. 
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 2(3-3-21), 8-28-2007; Ord. No. 2016-06, § 2, 6-28-2016) 
Sec. 3-3-22. - Determination of amount of stormwater management utility fee. 
A.  Computation of stormwater management utility fee: 
1.  Determine base rate to assign ERU; 
2.  Determine the impervious area on the property; 
3.  Calculate the numerical factor for the property in question by dividing the impervious area by one (1) ERU (3,000 square feet); and 
4.  Calculate the annual Stormwater Management Utility Fee by multiplying the numerical factor by the base rate, if the factor is greater than one (1). 
B.  Example calculation. Calculation of monthly fee for one and one-half (1.50) acre commercial property with a determined impervious area of thirty-two thousand five hundred (32,500) square feet: 
1.  1 ERU = Three thousand (3,000) square feet. 
2.  Property impervious area = Thirty-two thousand five hundred (32,500) square feet. 
3.  ERU's for example property = 32,500 square feet of impervious area ÷ 1 ERU of 3,000 square feet = 10.8 ERU's. 
4.  Utility fee = ERU's x base rate = 10.8 ERU's x example base rate of $48.00 = $518.40/year. 
C.  The classification of real property and the identification of the utility customer for the purpose of determining fees shall be determined from the records of the Charleston County Tax Assessor's office. The utility customer or person charged the fee is based on the classification of the real property as of January 1 of the year of billing and each year subsequently thereafter. 
D.  Where the tax records are incomplete or ambiguous, a physical inspection of the real property shall be made to determine the use of the property. Upon development of the City's database and review of the real properties on a case-by-case basis, the classifications from the records of the Charleston County Tax Assessor's office do not preclude an adjustment to the data that the City uses to determine the fee. 
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 2(3-3-23), 8-28-2007; Ord. No. 2016-06, § 2, 6-28-2016) 
Sec. 3-3-23. - Adjustment of utility fee. 
A.  In cases where the utility customer disputes the fee based on the actual impervious area of the real property in which he has interest, a notice of objection may be filed with the Zoning Administrator as outlined in section 3-3-9; provided, however, that City Council many delegate the Zoning Administrator's responsibilities hereunder to the County or its duly authorized representatives pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement providing for same. 
B.  Where an adjustment of the fee is warranted, the Zoning Administrator shall recalculate and redetermine the fee using equivalent ERU's that is based on the total impervious area of the real property at issue. 
C.  Where deemed appropriate and at the discretion of the Zoning Administrator, the gross acreage of the real property may be adjusted as a means of recalculating and redetermining the fee. This method is applied in cases where the property is large and the ratio of pervious area to impervious area is low. The Zoning Administrator and the utility customer shall mutually agree on the general area of improvement. In cases where a mutual agreement cannot be reached, the utility customer may file a notice of objection as referenced in subsection A of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 2(3-3-24), 8-28-2007; Ord. No. 2016-06, § 2, 6-28-2016) 
Sec. 3-3-24. - Duration of fee. 
    The fees established by this article have been adopted by City Council. This fee will be reviewed, evaluated, and amended as necessary in order to address the City's stormwater program needs/deficiencies and Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (SMS4) general permit requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2007-15, § 2(3-3-25), 8-28-2007; Ord. No. 2016-06, § 2, 6-28-2016) 
Sec. 3-3-25. - Billing of stormwater management utility fee; late charges. 
    The fee shall not be prorated. No refunds of the fee shall be made except as set forth in this article. The utility fee shall be billed annually and mailed to each owner of record of real property, based on the classification of the property as of January 1 of each year. For non-payment of all or any part of the utility fee, the monetary penalty shall be the same penalty set forth in section 12-45-180 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, as may be amended. If any fee shall remain sixty (60) days after the due date, the County may issue a lien upon the parcel for the stormwater utility fee, penalties and costs of collection and shall proceed to collect in the same manner as prescribed by law for the collection of other fees and taxes.

This article is also designed to minimize property damage by establishing requirements and procedures to control the potential adverse effects of increased stormwater runoff and related pollutant loads associated with both future development and existing developed land. Proper management of stormwater runoff will further the purpose of this article to ensure a functional drainage system, reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion, attain and maintain water quality standards, enhance the local environment associated with the drainage system, reduce local flooding, maintain where necessary pre-developed runoff characteristics of the area in terms of flow rate, volume and pollutant concentration, and facilitate economic development while mitigating associated pollutant, flooding, erosion, and drainage impacts. 
B.  Another primary purpose of this article is to direct the development and implementation of a Stormwater Management Program (SWMP), establishing authority which authorizes or enables the City at a minimum to: 
1.  Comply with State and Federal requirements related to stormwater management developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act; 
2.  Prohibit illicit discharges into the City's stormwater systems and facilities and receiving waters; 
3.  Control to the maximum extent practicable the discharge into the City's stormwater systems and facilities and receiving waters of spills, dumping, or disposal of materials other than stormwater; 
4.  Address specific categories of non-stormwater discharges and similar other incidental non-stormwater discharges listed in the SWMP; 
5.  Require erosion and sediment controls to protect water quality on all applicable new and redevelopment projects both during and after construction; 
6.  Where necessary, require stormwater discharge rate and volume control during and following development, redevelopment, or construction; 
7.  Define and implement procedures of site plan review and site inspection of all applicable construction projects within the City; 
8.  Control the discharge from the City's stormwater systems and facilities and receiving waters of pollutants in such quantity that water quality standards are met or to otherwise address post-construction, long-term water quality.

Sec. 5-4-3. - Districts designated; zone map; compliance with chapter. 
    For the purposes of regulating and restricting the location of trades, industries, apartment houses and other uses of property, the number of square feet of lots per family housed, the location and size of yards and height of buildings in the developed portion of the City, the City is hereby divided into zones or districts, as shown on the Official Zoning Map which, together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated as a part of this chapter. The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk and bearing the seal of the City under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map referred to in section 5-4-3 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Isle of Palms, S.C., adopted on (date of adoption)." If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the Official Zoning Map, such changes shall be made on the Official Zoning Map promptly after the amendment has been approved by City Council, with an entry on the Official Zoning Map as follows: "On (date), by official action of the City Council, the following changes were made (change was made) in the Official Zoning Map; (brief description of change)" which entry shall be signed by the Mayor and shall be attested by the City Clerk. No such change shall become effective until such entry shall have been made on the Official Zoning Map, and signed and attested. Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the Official Zoning Map which may from time to time be made or published, the Official Zoning Map shall be in the custody of the City Administrator and shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of lands, buildings, and other structures in the City. In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret by reason of the nature of number of changes and additions, the City Council may by ordinance adopt a new Official Zoning Map which shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map. The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting and other errors or omissions in the prior Zoning Map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original Official Zoning Map as amended. The new Official Zoning Map shall be marked "This is the Official Zoning Map, adopted (date), of the City of Isle of Palms, S.C." which statement shall be signed by the Mayor, attested by the City Clerk, and bear the seal of the City. Unless the prior Official Zoning Map is lost or has been totally destroyed, the map or any significant parts thereof remaining after partial destruction shall be preserved, together with all records of the City regarding its adoption and amendment. No structure or premises shall be erected or used except in conformity with the regulations prescribed in this chapter for use, height and area districts in which such structure or premises is located. 
(Code 1994, § 5-4-3) 
Sec. 5-4-4. - Interpretation of district boundaries. 
    When exact distances are not shown on the Official Zoning Map, a district boundary on the map shall be interpreted to run along the centerline of an existing street or alley abutting the district and if the exact location of such boundary is still uncertain, it shall be determined by the Zoning Administrator, with due consideration given to the location as indicated by the scale of the map. Where the streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys as shown on the map, the Zoning Administrator may apply the district designations on the map to the streets or alleys on the ground in such manner as to conform to the intent and purpose of this chapter. 
(Code 1994, § 5-4-4) 
Sec. 5-4-5. - Appeals, variances and special exceptions. 
(a)  Appeals. 
1.  Pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, § 6-29-780, the City Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby established. Provisions relating to organization, composition and functions of the Board are set forth in title 1, chapter 9, article B. Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken from any order or decision of the Zoning Administrator by any person aggrieved or by any officer, department, or board of the City. Unless otherwise provided by rules of the Board, an appeal must be made by written application setting forth the grounds of appeal and filed with the Zoning Administrator within thirty (30) days from the date of the order or decision appealed from. The Zoning Administrator shall promptly forward to the Board all documents constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal or other matter referred to it, and give at least fifteen (15) days' public notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the community and also due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within a reasonable period of time. At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The Board shall adopt rules of procedure for the conduct of hearings. All final decisions and orders of the Board shall be in writing and permanently filed in the office of the Board as a public record. All findings of fact and conclusions of law must be separately stated in final decisions or orders of the Board, which must be delivered to parties in interest by certified mail. 
2.  An appeal stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal in taken certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings may not be stayed other than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or by a court of record on application, on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown. 
(b)  Variances. Pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, § 6-29-800, upon written application filed with the Zoning Administrator, the Board may authorize in specific cases a variance from the terms of the ordinances contained in this chapter when strict application of the provisions of the ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship. Filing fees set by resolution of City Council from time to time must be paid by the applicant at the time of filing of an application for a variance. Such application shall contain information addressing each of the statutory requirements for variances stated in S.C. Code 1976, § 6-29-800, as amended, all of which must be met. A variance may be granted in an individual case of unnecessary hardship if the Board makes and explains in writing the following findings: 
(1)  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property; 
(2)  Such conditions do not generally apply to other property in the vicinity; 
(3)  Because with these conditions, the application of the ordinance or resolution of the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; 
(4)  The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial detriment to an adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance. 
    The Board may not grant a variance which has the effect of allowing the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a zoning district, to physically extend a nonconforming use, or to change the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map. The fact that property may be utilized more profitably if a variance were granted shall not be considered as a ground for a variance. A claim of unnecessary hardship cannot be based on conditions created by the applicant. A claim of unnecessary hardship cannot be based on financial hardship of the applicant. 
    In granting a variance, the Board may attach to it such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed building, structure, or use as the Board may consider advisable to protect established property values in the surrounding area, or to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare. 
(c)  Special exceptions. 
1.  Upon written application filed with the Zoning Administrator, the Board may grant as a special exception any use specified as a special exception in the zoning district regulations. In addition to the conditions generally required by the applicable zoning district regulations, the Board shall apply the following standards in deciding special exception applications: 
(1)  Adequate provision shall be made for setbacks, fences, buffer or planting strips to protect adjacent properties from adverse impact of the proposed use, such as noise, vibration, dust, glare, odor, traffic congestion and similar factors. 
(2)  Vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement on adjacent roads must not be hindered or endangered. 
(3)  Off-street parking and loading areas and the entrances and exits for the use must be adequate in terms of location, number, design and construction to serve the use without adverse impact on adjacent properties. 
(4)  The proposed use must not adversely affect the property values, the general character or the general welfare of the surrounding vicinity. 
2.  In granting a special exception, the Board may attach to it such conditions regarding the location, size, character, or other features of the proposed use as the Board may consider advisable in order to promote public health, safety, or general welfare. No special exception use may be altered or enlarged without the prior approval of the Board.

Sec. 5-4-152. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the City are subject to periodic inundation which can result in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affects the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 2017-07, § 1(Exh. A), 4-24-2018) 
Sec. 5-4-153. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters; and 
(4)  Regulate developments which may increase erosion or flood damage; and, regulate the construction of structures which will unnaturally divert floodwaters which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 2017-07, § 1(Exh. A), 4-24-2018) 
Sec. 5-4-154. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To encourage notification to potential real property buyers that a property is located in a special flood hazard area.

CHAPTER 2. - STOPPING, STANDING, AND PARKING OF VEHICLES 
ARTICLE A. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 8-2-1. - Findings and intent. 
(a)  The City finds that parking in the public rights-of-way and public parking lots should be regulated to promote traffic safety, enhance the smooth flow of traffic, and, in certain areas of high demand for parking spaces, fairly allocate parking spaces among the public by limiting parking time. 
(b)  Limiting and pay parking in business districts helps facilitate commerce by promoting frequent turnover for shopping rather than allowing long-term parking, and generates revenue from the use of the parking rights-of-way and public parking lots and by enforcement and maintenance of parking regulations. 
(c)  Effective enforcement of parking regulations is required to meet the objectives of this article, and to protect the health, safety, and welfare of both drivers and pedestrians using public rights-of-way and public parking lots.
