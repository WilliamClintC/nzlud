regulations and orders of the municipality and the required proof of
such completion received by the designated officer, and if the
municipality has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or
securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured. If the
municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the

insured, such interest shall belong to the municipality. To the extent
that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned
on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the
time that the proceeds are returned.

section shall be construed to prohibit the municipality and the named
insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of
funds to the named insured if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.

A. This Part 1 provides for the regulation of the public wastewater
collection and treatment system operated by the Montgomery Township
Municipal Sewer Authority ("MTMSA") and, inter alia, sets forth
uniform requirements for direct and indirect contributions of
wastewater within the jurisdiction of Montgomery Township which is
ultimately discharged to the publicly owned treatment works' ("POTW")
treatment plants ("POTW-TP") specified below. Montgomery Township
is responsible for enforcement of this Part 1, but MTMSA, the POTWTPs
and the municipalities primarily responsible for any POTW-TP share
the duty to enforce this Part 1 to the extent necessary to assure
compliance with the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. § 1251 et
seq. and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR 403), along
with all applicable state and federal laws and permits. No POTW-TP or
municipality responsible for a POTW-TP shall have any jurisdiction or
authority to enforce this or any ordinance as they might relate to
contributors whose discharge does not enter its own POTW-TP.
B. The objectives of this Part 1 are to:
(1) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater system
which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge at the POTW-TP;
(2) Prevent the introduction of pollutants into the wastewater system
that will pass through the system, inadequately treated, into
receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3) Protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater
and sludge in the course of their employment and the general
public;
(4) Improve the opportunity to reuse and recycle wastewaters and
sludge from the wastewater system;
(5) Provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the wastewater
system; and
(6) Enable POTW-TP permittees to comply with their National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit conditions, sludge
use and disposal requirements, and any other federal or state laws

ARTICLE III
Pretreatment of Wastewater
§ 187-11. Pretreatment facilities.
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this Part 1 and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment
standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in § 187-5 of this Part 1
within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the state, or the POTW-TP,
whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall
be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
the POTW-TP and to the MTMSA for review, and shall be acceptable to the
POTW-TP and the MTMSA before such facilities are constructed. The review
of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the POTW-TP and the MTMSA under the provisions
of this Part 1.
§ 187-12. Additional pretreatment measures.
A. Whenever deemed necessary, the POTW-TP may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from
industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance
with the requirements of this Part 1.
B. The POTW-TP may require any person discharging into the POTW to
install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A
wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
C. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the POTW-TP or the MTMSA, they are necessary for the
proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease
and oil, or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for
residential users unless a residential user who is contributing excessive
amounts of grease, oil, or sand has first been given the opportunity to
reduce the discharge by other means. All interception units shall be of a
type and capacity approved by the POTW-TP and/or the MTMSA and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.
Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly,
as needed, by the user at its expense, in accordance with any procedure
for the installation and maintenance of grease traps as may be
established from time to time by the POTW-TP and/or MTMSA.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.

§ 187-13. Accidental discharge/slug discharge control plans.
[Amended 2-13-2012 by Ord. No. 12-255]
Within one year of a user being designated as an SIU and at least every two
years thereafter, the POTW-TP or MTMSA shall evaluate whether each SIU
needs an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action
to control slug discharges. All users are required to notify the POTW-TP or
MTMSA immediately of any changes in their facilities affecting the potential
for an accidental discharge and/or slug discharge to the POTW. The POTWTP
or the MTMSA may require any user to develop, submit for approval
and implement such a plan or take such other action that may be necessary
to control slug discharges. Alternatively, the POTW-TP or the MTMSA may
develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
§ 187-14. Hauled wastewater.
A. Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW-TP and the MTMSA of
any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 187-35 of this Part 1;
and
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection
and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials,
loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker
training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or
measures and equipment for emergency response.
A. Septic tank wastewater may be introduced into the POTW only at
locations designated by the POTW-TP or MTMSA, and at such times as
are established by the POTW-TP or MTMSA. Such wastewater shall not
violate Article II of this Part 1 or any other requirements established by
the POTW-TP or MTMSA. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may require septic
tank wastewater haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The
POTW-TP and/or MTMSA may collect samples of each hauled load to
ensure compliance with applicable standards.
B. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may require haulers of industrial wastewater
to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may
require generators of hauled industrial wastewater to obtain
wastewater discharge permits and/or to provide a disclosure affidavit
as to the nature of the wastewater. The POTW-TP or MTMSA also may
prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial wastewater. The discharge of
hauled industrial wastewater is subject to all other requirements of this
Part 1.
§ 187-13 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-14
1:212
C. Industrial wastewater haulers may discharge loads only at locations
designated by the POTW-TP or MTMSA. No load may be discharged
without prior consent of the POTW-TP or MTMSA. The POTW-TP or
MTMSA may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance
with applicable standards. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may require the
industrial wastewater generator and/or hauler to provide a wastewater
analysis of any load prior to discharge.
D. Industrial wastewater haulers must provide a wastewater-tracking
form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name
and address of the industrial wastewater hauler, permit number, truck
identification, names and addresses of sources of wastewater, and
volume and characteristics of wastewater. The form shall identify the
type of industry, known or suspected waste constituents, and whether
any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.
E. MTMSA and/or the POTW-TP may require each industrial wastewater
hauler to post a bond indemnifying MTMSA and/or the POTW-TP, their
consultants, employees and agents from any damages the industrial
wastewater hauler's wastewater may cause to the POTW, POTW-TP,
employees, third parties and the environment. Should the wastewater
contaminate other waste or wastewater, the industrial wastewater
hauler shall be responsible for the complete removal and disposal of
such contaminated waste or wastewater at his expense.

Reporting Requirements
§ 187-30. Baseline monitoring reports.
A. Within either 180 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later,
existing categorical industrial users currently discharging to or
scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the POTW-TP or
MTMSA a report which contains the information listed in Subsection B,
below. At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new
sources, and sources that become categorical industrial users
subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard,
shall submit to the POTW-TP or MTMSA a report which contains the
information listed in Subsection B, below. A new source shall report the
method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical
standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow
and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
B. Users described above shall submit the information set forth below.
(1) All information required in § 187-19A(1)(a), (2), (3)(a), and (6), of
this Part 1.
(2) Measurement of pollutants.
(a) The user shall provide the information required in

(b) The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements
of this Subsection B(2).
(c) Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment
exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure the
flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate
compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where an
alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along
with supporting data shall be submitted to the control
authority;
(d) Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with
§ 187-39 of this Part 1;
(e) The POTW-TP may allow the submission of a baseline report
which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
§ 187-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-30
1:225
§ 187-31. Compliance schedule progress reports.
The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
§ 187-30B(4) of this Part 1:
information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures;
(f) The baseline report shall indicate the time, date and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles
and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.
(3) Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's
authorized representative as defined in § 187-4 of this Part 1 and
certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis and, if
not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment
standards and requirements.
(4) Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will
be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional
pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The completion date
in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance
schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set
out in § 187-31 of this Part 1.
(5) Signature and report certification. All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with § 187-43A of this Part 1 and
signed by an authorized representative as defined in § 187-4 of this
Part 1.
A. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for
the commencement and completion of major events leading to the
construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. (Such events
include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing
preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components,
commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation.);
B. No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
C. The user shall submit a progress report to the POTW-TP or MTMSA no
later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date
of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied
with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the
established schedule; and
§ 187-30 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-31
1:226
§ 187-32. Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment
standard deadline.
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source,
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the POTW-TP or MTMSA a report containing the information
described in §§ 187-19A(6) and (7) and 187-30B(2) of this Part 1. For users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits, this report shall contain
a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other
users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with § 187-43A of this Part 1. All sampling will be
done in conformance with § 187-40 of this Part 1.
§ 187-33. Periodic compliance reports.
D. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the POTW-TP or MTMSA.
A. All significant industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the
POTW-TP but in no case less than twice per year (June and December),
submit to the POTW-TP and the MTMSA reports indicating the nature,
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and
maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance
reports must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of
§ 187-30B of this Part 1. In the event that the months for submission of
the reports are altered by the POTW-TP, factors such as local high or
low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc. shall be taken into
consideration. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires
compliance with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution
prevention alternative, the user must submit documentation required
by the POTW-TP or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine
the compliance status of the user.
B. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant
regulated by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user
has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that
the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the
discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water
and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the
industrial user [see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)]. This authorization is subject
to the following conditions:
§ 187-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-33
1:227
(1) The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the
facility, provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by
an applicable categorical standard and otherwise includes no
process wastewater.
(2) The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective
period of the wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer
than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent wastewater
discharge permit. See § 187-19A(8) of this Part 1.
(3) In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the
facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the
facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes.
(4) The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed by the
authorized or duly authorized representative of the industrial,
commercial, institutional, or significant industrial user as defined
in § 187-4 of this Part 1, and include the certification statement in
§ 187-43A of this Part 1 [40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii)].
(5) Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA-approved method from 40
CFR 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant
was used in the analysis.
(6) Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the POTW-TP must be
included as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons
supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the user in
its request for the waiver must be maintained by the POTW-TP for
three years after expiration of the waiver.
(7) Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the POTW-TP, the industrial user must certify on each
report with the statement in § 187-43C below, that there has been
no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to activities of
the industrial user.
(8) In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's
operations, the user must immediately comply with the monitoring
requirements of § 187-33A of this Part 1, or other more frequent
monitoring requirements imposed by the POTW-TP, and notify the
POTW-TP.
(9) This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards,
except as otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment
standard.
§ 187-33 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-33
1:228
§ 187-34. Reports of changed conditions.
Each user must notify the POTW-TP or MTMSA of any significant changes
to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or
volume of its wastewater at least 60 days before the change.
§ 187-35. Reports of potential problems.
C. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 187-43A of this Part 1.
D. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at
all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample
results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
E. If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the POTW-TP, using the procedures
prescribed in § 187-40 of this Part 1, the results of this monitoring shall
be included in the report.
A. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under § 187-19 of this Part 1.
B. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may issue a wastewater discharge permit
under § 187-28 of this Part 1 or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit under § 187-25 of this Part 1 in response to changed
conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
C. For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are
not limited to, flow increases of 20% or greater, and the discharge of
any previously unreported pollutants.
A. In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental
discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that
might cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall
immediately telephone and notify the POTW-TP or MTMSA of the
incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge,
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective
actions taken by the user along with the identity of the person or
persons believed to be responsible for the discharge.
B. Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived
by the POTW-TP, submit to the POTW-TP or MTMSA a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be
taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such
§ 187-33 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-35
1:229
§ 187-36. Reports from unpermitted users.
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide
appropriate reports to the POTW-TP or MTMSA as the POTW-TP or MTMSA
may require.
§ 187-37. Notice of violation; repeat sampling; reporting.
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the POTW-TP or MTMSA within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling within seven days of
becoming aware of the violation and perform the repeat analysis and submit
the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW-TP or MTMSA within 30 days
after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user is
not required if the POTW-TP performs sampling at the user's facility at least
once a month, or if the POTW-TP performs sampling at the user between the
time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user
or the POTW-TP receives the results of this sampling, or if the POTW-TP has
performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
§ 187-38. Prohibition of discharge of hazardous waste.
notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or
other liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the
POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property;
nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or
other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this Part 1.
C. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in Subsection A, above. Employers shall ensure
that all employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
D. Significant industrial users are required to notify the POTW-TP
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a
slug discharge.
A. No user shall discharge hazardous waste or any substance which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261
into the POTW or POTW-TP. The prohibition in this section does not
apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical
pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of
§§ 187-30, 187-32, and 187-33 of this Part 1.
B. In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
POTW-TP or MTMSA, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the
§ 187-35 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-38
1:230
§ 187-39. Analytical requirements.
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 136
and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
POTW-TP or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 187-40. Sample collection.
discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
C. In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall
certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
D. This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Part 1, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
A. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed
during the period covered by the report, based on data that is
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.
B. Except as indicated in Subsections C and D below, the user must collect
wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite
sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW-TP. Where timeproportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the
POTW-TP, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using
protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR 136
and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during
a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil
and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory.
Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing
procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the POTW-TP, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples
may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
§ 187-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-40
1:231
§ 187-41. Date of receipt of reports.
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 187-42. Recordkeeping.
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part 1 shall retain,
and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information
obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this Part 1, any
additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities
undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and
documentation associated with best management practices established
under § 187-8E of this Part 1. Records shall include the date, exact place,
method (including sample preservation), and time of sampling, and the
name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were
performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the
user, the POTW-TP, the municipality, the MTMSA, or where the user has
been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW-TP or
MTMSA.
§ 187-43. Certification statements.
C. Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
D. For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day
compliance reports required in §§ 187-30 and 187-32 of this Part 1 [40
CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do
not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available,
the POTW-TP may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required
by § 187-33 of this Part 1 [40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)], the
industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples
necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 187-44. Right of entry; inspection; sampling.
A. The POTW-TP or MTMSA shall have the right to enter the premises of
any user to determine whether the user is complying with all
requirements of this Part 1 and any wastewater discharge permit or
order issued hereunder. The POTW-TP shall notify the MTMSA prior to
entry of a user's premises. Users shall allow the POTW-TP or MTMSA
ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of
any additional duties. Such requests for inspection and sampling do not
require advance notice to the user, and POTW-TP and MTMSA
personnel shall be admitted to the user's premises for such purpose
regardless whether advance notice was given to the user.
B. Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user
shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, the POTW-TP or MTMSA
shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.
C. The POTW-TP or MTMSA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
D. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to
measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least
annually to ensure their accuracy.
E. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by
the user at the written or verbal request of the POTW-TP or MTMSA and

Confidential Information
§ 187-46. Public access to information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the POTW-TP or MTMSA's inspection and
sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction,
unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the POTW-TP or MTMSA, that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request
must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that
such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which
might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available
for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon
request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program
or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the
person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics
and other effluent data, as defined at 40 CFR 2.302 shall not be recognized
as confidential information and shall be available to the public without
restriction.

Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance
§ 187-47. Grounds for publication.
The POTW-TP shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation
that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the
POTW, a list of the users which, at any time during the previous 12 months,
were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards
and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall be applicable
to all significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
Subsections C, D or H of this section) and shall mean:
A. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those
in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any
magnitude) a numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including
instantaneous limits as defined in Article II of this Part 1;
B. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each
pollutant parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement,
including instantaneous limits, as defined by Article II of this Part 1
multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
C. Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by Article II of this Part 1 (daily maximum, long-term average,
instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the POTW-TP
determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges,
interference or pass-through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public;
D. Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the POTW-TP's
exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
E. Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction,
or attaining final compliance;
F. Failure to provide within 30 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic selfmonitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance
schedules;
G. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
§ 187-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-47
1:239
H. Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of best
management practices, which the POTW-TP determines will adversely
affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.

Administrative Enforcement Remedies
§ 187-48. Authorization of enforcement.
The municipalities with primary responsibility for the POTWs and the
POTW-TPs, in conjunction with MTMSA and/or the Township, are fully
empowered to undertake all enforcement remedies set forth below in order
to assure user compliance with all state and federal laws and regulations.
The enforcement actions described herein will be undertaken pursuant
to the POTW-TP's duly adopted and EPA-approved Enforcement Response
Guide, a federally mandated statement of policy which provides fair and
even application of all enforcement remedies to users in violation, such
document being available at all times for public inspection. In addition, the
municipalities with primary responsibility for the POTWs, MTMSA and the
POTW-TPs retain each and every right and power granted pursuant to the
Publicly Owned Treatment Works Penalty Law69 also known as "Act 9 of
1992," in addition to any amendments thereto.
§ 187-49. Surcharge in lieu of enforcement remedy.
With respect to compatible pollutants (as defined in § 187-4 of this Part
1), the POTW-TPs may, from time to time and at their discretion, adopt
a policy whereby certain specifically identified conventional pollutants are
permissibly discharged to the POTW for removal at the POTW-TP, with the
cost of such removal to be borne by the discharger. The POTW-TP may
expand or limit the list of compatible pollutants to which this surcharge
system applies based upon the POTW-TP's capacity/ability to effectively
remove particular compatible pollutants. In the event that a compatible
pollutant is within the scope of the surcharge system as it exists at the
time of discharge, then such compatible pollutant discharge shall not be
considered a violation of this Part 1. However, any failure to pay the
surcharge cost for the POTW-TP's removal of the pollutant shall itself be
considered a violation of this Part 1 and subject to enforcement action,
in addition to all generally held rights of collection. At no time shall the
surcharge factor as calculated by the respective POTW-TP be greater than
or equal to 1.7 where 1.0 equals the sum of the values related to compatible
pollutants, including flow.
§ 187-50. Notification of violation.
When the POTW-TP or MTMSA finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
POTW-TP or MTMSA may serve upon that user a written notice of violation.
The specific manner in which such notice of violation shall be issued, and
the terms and conditions pursuant to which the user shall respond or
correct the violation, shall be as set forth in the Enforcement Response
69.Editor's: See 35 P.S. § 752.1 et seq.
§ 187-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-50
1:241
Guide. When the notice of violation includes a plan for dissatisfactory
correction and prevention of the violation, submission of such plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit
the authority of the POTW-TP or MTMSA to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
notice of violation.
§ 187-51. Consent orders.
The POTW-TP or MTMSA may enter into consent orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents
shall include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the
noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such
documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders
issued pursuant to §§ 187-53 and 187-54 of this Part 1 and shall be judicially
enforceable.
§ 187-52. Show-cause hearing.
A. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, to appear and show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed
enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the
user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days
prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user as defined in § 187-4 and required by
§ 187-20A of this Part 1. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
B. Any hearing conducted pursuant to this section shall be presided over
by a committee (hereinafter "committee"), composed of three persons,
including two persons designated by the POTW-TP and one person
designated by MTMSA. In the event that the POTW-TP or MTMSA fails
to designate a hearing participant, then the other member(s) shall
designate an individual to so serve. The committee may itself conduct a
hearing and take the evidence or may designate any of its members or
any officer or employee of the POTW-TP or MTMSA to:
(1) Issue, in the name of the committee, notices of hearings requesting
the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of
evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings.
(2) Take the evidence.
§ 187-50 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-52
1:242
§ 187-53. Compliance orders.
When the POTW-TP or MTMSA finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
POTW-TP or MTMSA may issue an order to the user responsible for the
discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified
time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided,
sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities,
devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and
management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline
for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not
be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
§ 187-54. Cease-and-desist orders.
(3) Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including
transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to
the committee for action thereon.
C. At any hearing held pursuant to this Part 1, testimony taken must be
under oath and recorded stenographically. The transcript, so recorded,
will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the
hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof.
D. After the committee has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order,
through the MTMSA Manager (who shall actually issue the order), to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that following a
specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are properly operated. Further orders and
directives, as are necessary and appropriate, may be issued.
E. Any user aggrieved by the enforcement of this Part 1 may take an
appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania, and have a hearing thereon, if the appeal is filed in
accordance with the provisions of the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A.
§ 105 et seq., including the time period for appeal prescribed therein.
A. When the POTW-TP or MTMSA finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to
§ 187-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-54
1:243
§ 187-55. Administrative fines.
§ 187-56. Emergency suspensions.
recur, the POTW-TP or MTMSA may issue an order to the user directing
it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to:
(1) Immediately comply with all requirements; and
(2) Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
B. Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. When MTMSA or the POTW-TP finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, MTMSA or the POTW-TP may fine the user in
an amount not to exceed $25,000 per day or any greater amount which
might be permitted by amendment to the POTW Penalty Law. Such fines
shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be
assessed for each day during the period of violation. The actual amount
of the fine in a particular case shall account for the factors set forth in
the Enforcement Response Guide and in any separately adopted
statements of policy on the imposition of fines pursuant to the POTW
Penalty Law.
B. Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and if the
unpaid charges, fines and penalties are not paid after 60 calendar days,
the aggregate amount thereof shall bear interest from the penalty date
at the rate of 0.83% per month (10% per year). A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
C. A user charged with a violation shall have 30 days to pay the proposed
penalty in full, or, if the user wishes to contest either the amount of the
penalty or the fact of the violation, the user must file an appeal of the
action within 30 days to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania. Failure to appeal within this period shall result in
a waiver of all legal rights to contest the violation or the amount of the
penalty.
D. Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
A. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may immediately suspend a user's discharge,
after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is
necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably
appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
§ 187-54 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-56
1:244
§ 187-57. Termination of discharge.
to the health or welfare of persons. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may also
immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to
respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
B. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop
or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the POTWTP
or MTMSA may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any
individuals. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may allow the user to
recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the POTW-TP or MTMSA that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in
§ 187-57 of this Part 1 are initiated against the user.
C. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the POTW-TP or
MTMSA prior to the date of any show-cause or termination hearing
under § 187-52 or § 187-57 of this Part 1.
D. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior
to any emergency suspension under this section.
A. In addition to the provisions in § 187-27 of this Part 1, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:
(1) Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
(2) Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
(3) Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
(4) Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
(5) Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article II of this Part 1.
B. Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge
and be offered an opportunity to show cause under § 187-52 of this Part
1 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option
by the POTW-TP shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.

ARTICLE XI
Judicial Enforcement Remedies
§ 187-58. Injunctive relief.
When the POTW-TP or MTMSA finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
POTW-TP or MTMSA may petition the Court of Common Pleas of
Montgomery County, through the attorney for the MTMSA and/or the
POTW-TP for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
Part 1 on activities of the user. The POTW-TP or MTMSA may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition
for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against a user.
§ 187-59. Civil penalties.
In the event that MTMSA or the POTW-TP is required to seek court redress,
for violations of this Part 1, then all amounts recoverable elsewhere herein
as administrative fines shall be recoverable as civil penalties; attorneys'
fees, court costs, and related expenses shall also be recoverable. Filing suit
for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.
§ 187-60. Criminal prosecution.
In the event that any discharge or other violation of this Part 1 constitutes a
violation of any criminal or penal statute, then in addition to all enforcement
remedies described elsewhere in this Part 1, MTMSA and the POTW-TP or
the participating municipalities shall have the unfettered right to initiate
and/or assist in any state or federal criminal proceedings as a result of
such violation. Examples of criminal conduct in connection with a violation
include, but are not limited to, knowing or intentional introduction of any
substance into the POTW-TP which causes injury to persons or property,
otherwise undertaking any act or failing to undertake any act which
recklessly endangers the well-being of the community or plant personnel,
falsification of documents required to be filed pursuant to this Part 1, and
tampering with or otherwise rendering inaccurate a monitoring device or
similar equipment.
§ 187-61. Remedies nonexclusive.
The remedies provided for in this Part 1 are not exclusive. The POTW-TP
or MTMSA may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be
in accordance with the POTW-TP's Enforcement Response Guide. However,
§ 187-58 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-61
1:247
the POTW-TP or MTMSA may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the POTW-TP or MTMSA is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
§ 187-61 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-61

ARTICLE XII
Supplemental Enforcement Action
§ 187-62. Performance bonds.
The POTW-TP may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this
Part 1, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder,
or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless such user first
files a satisfactory bond, payable to the POTW-TP, in a sum not to exceed
a value determined by the POTW-TP to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
§ 187-63. Liability insurance.
The POTW-TP may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Part 1,
a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the user first submits
proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair
damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
§ 187-64. Water supply severance.
Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of this
Part 1, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, water service to the user may
be severed. Service will recommence, at the user's expense, only after the
user has satisfactorily demonstrated to the POTW-TP or MTMSA its ability
to comply.
§ 187-65. Public nuisances.
A violation of any provision of this Part 1, a wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
is hereby declared a public nuisance to the extent that it constitutes such
nuisance as defined by Pennsylvania law or municipal order.
§ 187-62 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-65
1:249

ARTICLE XIII
Affirmative Defenses to Discharge Violations
§ 187-66. Upset.
A. For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the
reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of Subsection C, below, are met.
C. A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
(1) An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
(2) The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and
(3) The user has submitted the following information to the POTW-TP
or MTMSA within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this
information is provided orally, a written submission must be
provided within five days):
(a) A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
(b) The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and
(c) Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
E. Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance
with categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary
to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
§ 187-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-66
1:251
§ 187-67. Prohibited discharge standards.
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in § 187-5A of
this Part 1 or the specific prohibitions in § 187-5B of this Part 1 if it can
prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone
or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause passthrough
or interference and that either:
§ 187-68. Bypass.
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or
fails.
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough
or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in
nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the POTWTP
was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the case
of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
A. For the purposes of this section:
(1) "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
(2) "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural
resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections C and D of this
section.
C. Bypass notifications.
(1) If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit
prior notice to the POTW-TP or MTMSA, at least 10 days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
(2) A user shall submit oral notice to the POTW-TP or MTMSA of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
§ 187-66 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-68
1:252
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of
the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within
five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its
cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times
and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time
it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW-TP
or MTMSA may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if
the oral report has been received within 24 hours.
D. Bypass.
(1) Bypass is prohibited, and an enforcement action against a user for
a bypass may be undertaken unless:
(a) Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
(b) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment
downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up
equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and
(c) The user submitted notices as required under Subsection C of
this section.
(2) The POTW-TP or MTMSA may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the POTW-TP or MTMSA
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
Subsection D(1) of this section.

connection prohibited.
There shall be three classes of building sewer permits: for residential
service; for commercial service; and for industrial service. In all cases,
the owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished
by MTMSA. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment
of MTMSA. A permit and inspection fee for a residential, commercial and
industrial building sewer permit shall be paid to MTMSA at the time the
application is filed. Permit and inspection fees for sewer permits shall be in
such amounts as may be established from time to time by MTMSA through
resolution. No property, building or structure or use thereof, other than that
described in the building sewer permit, shall at any time be connected with
or attached to a public sewer.
§ 187-71. Bearing of costs; indemnification.
All costs and expenses incidental to the installation, connection, and
maintenance of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner or user,
who shall indemnify MTMSA and Montgomery Township from any loss or
damage that may directly or indirectly be caused by the installation of the
building sewer.
§ 187-72. Separate sewers.
A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every
building or any part of any building as may be determined by MTMSA.
§ 187-73. Use of old sewers.
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found, upon examination and test by MTMSA, to meet all
requirements of this Part 1.
§ 187-74. Conformance to codes. [Amended 2-11-2013 by Ord. No.

A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES  Those establishments engaged in
activities of preparing, serving, or otherwise making available for
consumption foodstuffs and that use one or more of the following
preparation activities: cooking by frying (all methods), baking (all
methods), grilling, sauteing, rotisserie cooking, broiling (all methods),
boiling, blanching, roasting, toasting, or poaching. Also included are
infrared heating, searing, barbecuing, and any other food preparation
activity that produces a hot, nondrinkable food product in or on a
receptacle that requires washing. These facilities include restaurants,
cafeterias, hotels, motels, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, grocery
stores, churches, camps, caterers, manufacturing plants, or any other
industrial or commercial establishments which discharge, or are likely
to discharge, grease into the public sewer system.
GREASE  Material composed primarily of fats, oil, and grease from
animal or vegetable sources. The term "fats, oil and grease" shall be
deemed as grease by definition. Grease does not include petroleumbased
products.
GREASE INTERCEPTOR  A device for separating and retaining
waterborne greases and grease complexes prior to the wastewater
exiting the interceptor and entering the public sewer system. These
devices also serve to collect settlable solids, generated by and from
food preparation activities, prior to the wastewater exiting the
interceptor and entering the public sewer system.
OIL/WATER SEPARATOR  A device that is specifically designed and
manufactured to separate oil from water and permits the oil to be
collected and removed on a regular basis so as to prevent it from being
discharged into the public sewer system.
B. Control plan for grease and food waste.
(1) Any person who constructs, renovates or expands a food service
facility shall be required to submit to MTMSA a grease and food
waste control plan that will effectively control the discharge of
undesirable materials into the public sewer system.
(2) Any owner of an existing food service facility shall also be required
to submit a grease and food waste control plan that will effectively
§ 187-74 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-75
1:256
control the discharge of undesirable materials into the public sewer
system.
C. Grease interceptor installation, connection and location requirements.
(1) Installation requirements. All owners of existing, proposed or
newly renovated or expanded food service facilities within the
MTMSA wastewater service area shall be required to install, at the
owner's expense an approved, properly operated and maintained
grease interceptor.
(2) Sanitary sewer flows. Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories, etc., shall not be discharged into the grease interceptor.
These flows shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer
service lateral.
(3) Floor drains. Only floor drains which discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease
interceptor.
(4) Garbage grinders/disposers. Solid food waste products shall be
disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means,
and not the sanitary sewer system.
(5) Dishwashers. Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the
grease interceptor. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water
which can melt grease and allow it to pass through an undersized
grease interceptor. Interceptors must be sized accordingly to allow
enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify
and float to the top of the interceptor.
(6) Location. The grease interceptor shall be installed outside the
building upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral
connection unless MTMSA allows an interior installation. This will
allow easy access for inspection, cleaning and removal of the
intercepted grease at any time. A grease interceptor may not be
installed inside any part of a building without written approval by
MTMSA.
D. Design criteria.
(1) Construction. Grease interceptors shall be constructed in
accordance with the standards of the MTMSA and shall have a
minimum of two compartments with fittings designed for grease
retention. All grease-removal devices or technologies shall be
subject to the written approval of MTMSA. Such approval shall be
based on demonstrated removal efficiencies of the proposed
technology.
(2) Access. Access to grease interceptors shall be available at all times,
to allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to grease
traps shall be provided by two manholes (one on each
§ 187-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-75
1:257
compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast-iron frame
and cover.
(3) Load-bearing capacity. In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease interceptor shall be designed to have adequate
load-bearing capacity.
(4) Inlet and outlet piping. Wastewater discharging to a grease
interceptor shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the
interceptor. Each grease interceptor shall have only one inlet and
one outlet pipe.
(5) Grease trap sizing. The required size of the grease interceptor shall
be calculated using the EPA-2 model. All grease interceptors shall
have a capacity of not less than 1,000 gallons nor exceed a capacity
of 3,000 gallons. If the calculated required capacity exceeds 3,000
gallon, multiple units plumbed in series shall be installed.
E. Grease interceptor cleaning/maintenance.
(1) Cleaning/pumping. The owner of a food service facility shall,. at
such owner's expense, maintain and keep in good repair all grease
interceptors to assure the proper operation and efficiency thereof.
Cleaning of grease interceptors shall include the complete removal
of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and
bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a
qualified and licensed hauler. Decanting or discharging of removed
waste back into the grease interceptor from which it was removed
or any other grease trap, for the purpose of reducing the volume to
be disposed, is prohibited. Cleaning shall also include a thorough
inspection of the interceptor and its components. Any needed
repairs shall be noted, and repairs shall be made at the owner's
expense.
(2) Cleaning/pumping frequency. The grease interceptor must be
cleaned/pumped out completely a minimum of once every four
months, or more frequently as determined by MTMSA, as needed to
prevent carryover of grease into the MTMSA sewer system.
(3) Disposal. All materials removed from each grease interceptor must
be disposed of at a facility approved to receive such waste in
accordance with the provisions of this program. In no way shall the
pumpage be returned to any private or public portion of the public
sewer system. All pumpage from grease interceptors must be
tracked by a manifest, which confirms pumping, hauling and
disposal of the waste. The owner of the food service facility must
obtain and retain a copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
(4) Maintenance log. A grease interceptor cleaning/maintenance log,
indicating each cleaning/pumping for the previous 24 months, shall
be maintained for each food service facility by the owner thereof.
This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler and
§ 187-75 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-75
1:258
disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location for
inspection. Said log shall be made available to MTMSA or its
representative, upon request.
(5) Submittal of records.
(a) Each owner of a food service facility shall submit all cleaning
and maintenance records to MTMSA. The maintenance records
shall include the following information:
[1] Facility name, address, contact person and phone number;
[2] Company name, address, phone number and contact name
of person responsible for performing the maintenance,
cleaning, pumping or repair of grease interceptor;
[3] Types of maintenance performed;
[4] Dates maintenance was performed;
[5] Date of next scheduled maintenance; and
[6] Copies of manifests.
(b) The owner shall be required to submit maintenance records to
MTMSA on a biannual basis (twice per year). Records shall be
submitted by March 1 and September l of each year. The
records shall be submitted to:
Manager
Montgomery Township Municipal Sewer Authority
1001 Stump Road
Montgomeryville, PA 18936
(6) The MTMSA will perform periodic inspections of food service
facilities and shall notify the owner thereof any additional required
maintenance or repairs. Upon written notification by the MTMSA,
the owner shall be required to perform the specified maintenance
within 14 calendar days. Upon inspection by the MTMSA, the
owner may be required to install, at his expense, additional
controls to provide a complete system which prevents discharges of
undesirable materials into the public sewer system.
F. Additives. Any biological additive(s) placed into the grease interceptor
or building discharge line, including but not limited to enzymes,
commercially available bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb,
purge, consume, treat or otherwise eliminate grease, shall require
written approval by the MTMSA prior to use. The use of such additives
shall in no way be considered as a substitution for the maintenance
procedures and/or cleaning procedures required herein.
§ 187-75 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-75
1:259
G. Chemical treatment. Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, acid
or other chemical solvents designed to dissolve or remove grease shall
not be allowed to enter the grease interceptor.
H. Sand, soil and oil separators. All owners of car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, car and truck maintenance facilities,
fabricators, utility equipment shops and other facilities (as determined
by the MTMSA) that have sources of sand, soil and oil shall install
effective sand, soil and oil traps, interceptors and/or oil/water
separators. These systems shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil
and oil at the expected flow rates. These systems shall be designed in
accordance with the criteria established within the latest edition of the
International Plumbing Code. These systems shall be, at the owner's
expense, cleaned or pumped on a regular basis to prevent impact upon
the MTMSA sewer system. Users whose systems are deemed to be
ineffective by the MTMSA shall be asked to change the cleaning
frequency and/or to increase the size of the system. Owners of washing
facilities will be required to prevent the inflow of detergents and
rainwater into the MTMSA sewer system. Oil/water separator
installations shall be required at facilities that accumulate petroleum
oils and greases.
I. Laundries. Owners of commercial laundries shall equip them with an
interceptor with a wire basket or similar device, removable for
cleaning, that prevents passage into the MTMSA sewer system of solids
1/2 inch or larger in size, such as rags, strings, buttons, or other solids
detrimental to said system.
J. Bottling establishments. Bottling plants shall discharge wastewater
into an interceptor that will provide for the separation of broken glass
or other solids before discharging into the MTMSA sewer system.
K. Permit requirement. Every person who is required to install a grease
interceptor or a sand, soil and oil separator shall apply for and be issued
a permit setting forth required specifications for said interceptor and
separator and cleaning, maintenance, disposal and reporting
requirements.
L. Cost reimbursement. If MTMSA is required to repair and/or clean out
its sewer lines as a result of a stoppage resulting from a poorly
maintained grease interceptor, and/or sand, soil and oil separator, the
owner thereof shall be required to refund the labor, equipment,
materials and overhead costs incurred by MTMSA and any fines
incurred by MTMSA due to any sanitary sewer overflow caused by the
stoppage. Additionally, the owner shall also pay the reasonable costs
and fees incurred by the MTMSA by having to engage the services of its
consulting engineers and solicitor in connection with the administration
of the requirements of this section.
§ 187-75 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-75
1:260
§ 187-76. Elevation.
Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at
an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by a method approved by
MTMSA and discharged to the building sewer.
§ 187-77. Surface runoff and groundwater.

such measures from the property owner and/or user. If payment is not
made, MTMSA may file a municipal claim and/or a civil action.
E. The property owner or user must give prompt written notice to MTMSA
upon any change in ownership, change in tenant or change in use of any
property connected to the sewage system.
A. Residential users. Each residential dwelling shall be billed for one EDU
of capacity. A "residential dwelling" shall be a single-family dwelling,
each family unit of a multifamily dwelling (apartment, condominium,
twin, townhouse, etc.) and a mobile home.
B. Nonresidential users.
(1) For all nonresidential, commercial or industrial uses, one EDU shall
equal 60,000 gallons of metered water consumption per year or
15,000 gallons of metered water consumption per quarter, and the
number of EDUs shall be computed by dividing the total number of
gallons of water used for each quarter by 15,000 and rounding off
the next lower whole number if the decimal remainder is 0.49 or
less and to the next higher whole number if the decimal remainder
is 0.50 or more.
§ 187-78.11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-78.12
1:265
(2) Any nonresidential, commercial or industrial use not using a
metered public water supply shall be required to install metering
equipment in its water supply system for the purposes of
determining its sewer rental. The type of equipment and
installation procedures shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of MTMSA. The installation and completion of the
metering equipment shall be in accordance with the MTMSA's
specifications and subject to final inspection and approval by
MTMSA. The user shall read the water meter quarterly and report
the readings to the MTMSA at least 30 days in advance of the
MTMSA's quarterly sewer rental billing. The water meter shall be
calibrated by and at the expense of the owner in intervals of not
less than five years by a company approved by MTMSA, and
verification of the calibration shall be given to MTMSA.
Representatives of MTMSA shall have the right of access into and
upon the property of any user to independently verify the water
meter reading and to have the water meter independently
calibrated.
(3) For nonresidential, commercial and industrial uses, all water used
on a property shall be metered for the purpose of determining the
sewer rents, except as follows:
(a) Automatic sprinkling fire protection water can be excluded
from the metering for sewer rent purposes if the water for this
purpose has a separate meter.
(b) An industrial user utilizing a process using noncontact process
water which does not flow into MTMSA's sewer system may
apply to MTMSA for approval of a metering system which will
exclude for billing purposes the water not introduced into
MTMSA's sewer system.
(c) In the case of inaccurate or missing water meter readings, the
succeeding annual average calculated after repair and
replacement of the meter shall be used to estimate the water
usage for the period having inaccurate or missing water meter
readings. Payment for these quarterly periods of inaccurate or
missing water meter readings shall be at least 80% of the
water usage as estimated by MTMSA during the period in
question. The account shall be reconciled after the year where
accurate water meter readings have been determined, and the
owner/user shall pay the amount due as determined by
MTMSA within 30 days, together with interest at 10% per year.
(d) It shall be conclusively presumed that all nonresidential,
commercial and industrial users discharge a minimum of 80%
of their wastewater production over a twelve-hour period each
day, with the remainder discharged over the remaining hours
in the day.
§ 187-78.12 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-78.12

C. Multiple connections to lateral. If two or more dwellings, apartments,
stores, offices or industrial units are connected through a single lateral
or if two or more families use separate cooking and/or toilet facilities in
a single dwelling, the sewer rent shall be computed as though each
such dwelling, apartment, store, office or industrial unit and each such
family were a separate property or user with a separate connection to
the public sewer.
D. Quarterly payments.
(1) Residential sewer rents shall be payable in advance, and rent for
each calendar quarter shall be billed and payable in accordance
with the due dates noted on the quarterly billing documentation
issued by MTMSA. Rent for the quarter in which a new connection
is made shall be prorated and shall be billed in conjunction with the
next regular quarterly billing or by special billing, as the official
responsible for billing may elect.
(2) Sewer rent for nonresidential, commercial, industrial and
institutional users shall be billed and payable in accordance with
the due dates noted on the quarterly billing documentation issued
by MTMSA.
E. Interest penalty for late payment; lien.
(1) If any quarterly installment of sewer rent is not paid within 30 days
after the date of the bill, a ten-percent penalty shall be added
thereto; and if the installment plus penalty is not paid within 60
days after the date of the bill, the aggregate amount thereof shall
bear interest from the penalty date at the rate of 0.83% per month
(10% per year). Any unpaid sewer rent, together with penalties,
interest and costs thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall be a
lien on the property served which may be collected by action in
assumpsit or by a lien filed in the nature of a municipal claim, as
provided by law. In addition, MTMSA shall have the right to require
any water utility to shut off the water supply to any property with
respect to which the sewer rent imposed is unpaid until all such
rents, together with interest and penalties, are paid. The property
owner shall be responsible for all costs involved in shutting off the
water supply as fixed by resolution of MTMSA.
(2) In addition to the foregoing penalty, interest and costs imposed, if
MTMSA or the Township files a lien or commences litigation to
collect any delinquent sewer rental billing, there shall be added to
the amount billed and claimed an attorney's fee of 10% of the total
delinquent amount, plus all court costs and other costs of
collection.
F. Payment address. Bills for sewer rents shall be mailed to the address
specified in the application for the connection permit unless and until a
different address is reported to MTMSA by the owner or user of the
property. Failure to receive a bill as the result of incorrect address or

and industrial) users and customers as follows:
otherwise shall not excuse nonpayment of rent nor extend the time for
payment.
G. Responsibility of owner. The owner of the property billed shall be
responsible for payment of the sewer rents. If requested by a property
owner, MTMSA may bill a tenant of the owner or user, but the owner
shall remain responsible for payment of the sewer rents, and the
property may be subject to lien by MTMSA.
H. Supplying information to MTMSA. The applicant or owner or user (all
collectively "user") shall provide to MTMSA at any time(s) all
information, plans, studies and documents requested by MTMSA
necessary to determine the appropriate number of EDUs to be assigned
to the user's facility.
I. Amendments. The Township and MTMSA reserve the right to change
EDU values from time to time, to add or delete property classifications
and, in cases of dispute, to determine the classification of a given
property.
A. There shall be a fixed service charge per EDU of $87.59. A residential
EDU shall include any single-family dwelling, each family unit of a
multifamily dwelling (apartment, condominium, twin, townhouse), and
a mobile home. For all nonresidential users and customers, one EDU
shall equal up to and including 15,000 gallons of metered water
consumption per quarter, and any fraction thereof shall be charged as
an additional EDU.

§ 187-89. Retaining or holding tanks.
installation costs. [Calculated amount = (ENR-CCI year 2 ÷ ENRCCI
initial) x initial costs].
(2) Maintenance costs. The initial estimated annual costs of
maintenance shall be escalated by the United States Department of
Labor Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the ratio of the current date
CPI to the substantial completion date CPI times the initial
estimated annual maintenance. The CPI escalated annual
maintenance shall be adjusted by the ratio of ending annual
average flow to the preceding period's annual average flow, the
result raised to the six-tenths power. {Calculated amount = (CPI
year ÷ CPI Initial) x [(Q year ÷ Q initial) ^ 0.6] x annual
maintenance cost}. The calculated new bond amount shall be
compared against the preceding twelve-month maintenance cost,
and the larger of the two amounts shall be the amount.
C. In lieu of such bonds, the owner shall be permitted to establish an
escrow fund for the replacement cost and the annual maintenance cost
with the Authority for at least 50% of the estimated cost of replacement
and/or maintenance of the system with the obligation to add to this fund
10% of same each year until the fund reaches 110% of the cost of
replacement and/or maintenance of the system as determined by the
Authority.
A. The Authority is hereby authorized and empowered to approve within
the Township the control and methods of the use and operation of
retaining or holding tank sewage disposal and the collection and
transportation of retaining or holding tank waste.
B. The Authority shall adopt such rules and regulations, including a fee
schedule concerning sewage retaining or holding tanks, which it may
deem necessary from time to time to effect the purposes herein.
C. Since retaining/holding tanks are the least desirable method of
handling wastewater and it is the objective of the Township and its
Authority to provide public sewerage service to the entire Township,
the Authority shall not issue any permits for new retaining or holding
tanks unless one of the following is met and the owner purchases
capacity in the treatment, conveyance and collection facilities by paying
the required tapping fee:
(1) The Authority estimates that within a three-year period public
sewerage will be within 150 feet of the principal building on the
property proposing to utilize retaining/holding tanks as a
temporary means of sewerage disposal.
(2) The owner posts an escrow amount in cash equal to 110% of the
average annual contract amount for wastewater hauling and
disposal at a rate of every three days of three independent private
§ 187-88 MONTGOMERY CODE § 187-89
1:280
wastehaulers. These funds shall be used by the Authority to
maintain/operate the retaining/holding tank if required through
default of the owner. When the retaining/holding tank is terminated
and public sewerage service provided, the remaining funds will
be returned to the owner. The retained interest becomes the
Authority's as a fee for administering the account.
(3) The owner intends to use the holding-retaining, collection system
as a short-duration (less then four months) facility. A permit may be
issued by the Authority without guaranty, but wastehauler and
disposal location contract must be provided. In the event of the
owner's failure to operate and maintain the system to the
satisfaction of the Authority, the owner agrees that the Authority
may terminate the permit and prohibit the use previously
approved, and all occupied/used facilities operated by the owner
shall be closed until public sewerage service is provided.
D. No person in the Township shall install or construct a retaining or
holding tank or install, construct, occupy or use a building to be served
by a retaining or holding tank without first obtaining a permit from the
Montgomery County Health Department under § 187-82B above.
E. The Authority shall inspect retaining or holding tanks located in the
Township annually, and the owner shall pay an annual inspection fee in
accordance with the Authority's fee schedule. The owner shall also pay
to the Authority actual costs of Authority covering any emergency
responses concerning operation and maintenance of retaining or
holding tanks.
F. The collection and transportation of all sewage from any improved
property utilizing a retaining or holding tank and the disposal thereof
shall be made only at such site or sites as may be approved by the
PaDEP. The pickup and delivery of the retaining or holding tank waste
shall be conducted with a manifest system to verify the source, quantity
and treatment site of all retaining or holding tank waste. The owner
shall submit to Authority annually copies of all manifests evidencing
proper disposal of the sewage.
G. The regulation covering hauled wastewater in Ordinance No. 97-75,
§ 187-13 of this chapter, the Sewer Use Ordinance, of the Township is
herein incorporated by reference and made a part hereof.
H. The applicant for the use and operation of a new retaining or holding
tank permit shall submit the following to the Authority:
(1) A performance bond or an escrow fund created with the Authority
to ensure that the necessary steps for the collection, transportation
and disposal of the retaining or holding tank waste will be
completed. Any performance bond shall be issued by a company
having an AM. Best rating of B+ or higher and upon terms
approved by the Authority, and the amount of the bond or escrow
fund shall be 110% of the annual cost of transportation and
§ 187-89 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 187-89
1:281
disposal of the retaining or holding tank waste as estimated and
determined by the Authority.
(2) Letters from an authorized official of two PaDEP-approved disposal
sites, one primary and one alternate, agreeing to receive retaining
or holding tank waste from the applicant.
(3) A list, both quantitative and qualitative, of all wastes which will be
discharged to a retaining or holding tank. The qualitative analysis
will be performed in accordance with the United States
Environmental Protection Agency's Standard Methods (latest
edition), down to detectable limits.
(4) A signed contract with a sewage hauler providing that the hauler
will dispose of the retaining or holding tank waste of the applicant
on a regular basis.
I. Design standards.
(1) The design and construction of the retaining tank must comply in
all respects with the terms of Title 25 Pa. Code, Chapters 71, 72
and 73.
(2) The property owner shall submit to the Authority for its approval
plans showing the size, shape, location, type of material used in the
fabrication of the retaining or holding tank and details of its
construction. This information shall be given to the Authority prior
to the issuance of any building permit for newly constructed
buildings and prior to the issuance of any occupancy permit for
existing buildings. No building permit shall be issued by the
Township until the Authority approves the retaining or holding tank
application in each instance and grants a permit for use and
operation, and no occupancy permit shall be granted until the
retaining or holding tank installation is approved by the Authority.
(3) The owner shall locate all retaining or holding tanks so that the
sewage pumper will have easy access to withdrawal facilities
during all seasons of the year.
J. The owner of the property on which the retaining or holding tank is
located shall:
(1) Maintain the retaining tank facilities and equipment in proper
working order at all times in conformance with this Part 2 and any
other regulations of the Montgomery County Health Department,
Township or Authority and the terms of any applicable laws and the
regulations of PaDEP.
(2) Permit an authorized representative of the Montgomery County
Health Department, Authority or PaDEP to make periodic
inspections of the retaining tank facilities.

accordance with the following:
§ 201-2 MONTGOMERY CODE § 201-2
1:322
(a) To protect the right-of-way, equipment shall have rubber
wheels or runners and have rubber, wood or similar protective
pads between the outriggers and the surface unless otherwise
authorized by the permit.
(b) If other than rubber-equipped machinery, the pavement and
shoulders shall be protected from equipment damage by the
use of matting or other suitable protective material, unless the
permittee requests, in writing, a waiver from the use of
protective material thereby acknowledging its obligation and
commitment to repair or reconstruct the right-of-way area, if
damaged, to its former condition.
(c) If the equipment damages the right-of-way area, the permittee
shall restore the damaged area to its former condition in a

permittee, including a failure of the permittee or a person to
comply with the permit or this article.
(b) Upon request, the permittee shall deliver to the Township
certificates of insurance evidencing the types and amounts of
coverage specified by Township staff.
(12) Insurance. The permittee shall obtain, prior to the start of work, a
policy of insurance, issued by an insurer having a certificate of
authority and a licensed agent authorized to transact the business
of insurance in this commonwealth, in accordance with the
following conditions:
§ 201-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 201-2
1:323
(a) The permittee or its contractor shall obtain insurance for
public liability and property damage, in form, amount and
duration satisfactory to the Township to cover a loss that may
be incurred for construction, reconstruction, repair, relocation
or installation of the permitted structure or facilities.

coverage for damage to the highways, highway structures and
appurtenances or other Township property and shall be in an
amount satisfactory to the Township.
(c) Upon request, the permittee shall deliver to the Township
certificates of insurance evidencing the insurance coverage
required.
(d) The permittee's obligations to indemnify the Township and
obtain insurance to secure indemnification and its obligations
to restore the highway and obtain a bond relating to
restoration are separate obligations from obtaining insurance
for the purposes required.
(13) Maintaining structure or facility. As long as the permittee operates
and leaves in place structures or facilities in, upon or along the
right-of-way, the permittee shall maintain and keep them in good
order and repair.
(14) Damaged structure or facility to be repaired. If a structure or
facility becomes damaged, the permittee shall promptly have it
removed, repaired or otherwise made safe. The permittee is
responsible for repair or restoration of the portion of the highway
damaged by a structure or facility. The permittee's obligation to
repair or restore the highway necessitated by a damaged structure
or facility under this paragraph is separate from the obligations to
restore the highway and obtain a bond relating to the restoration
and maintenance of the highway.
(15) Damage to highway. Responsibility of the permittee for restoration
of the highway includes the following:
(a) If there is a failure of the highway, including a slope or other
appurtenance thereto, in the area of the permitted work within
two years after the acknowledged completion of the permitted
work and there is not similar failure of the highway beyond the
area of the permitted work, the permittee has absolute
responsibility to make temporary and permanent restoration of
this area unless the permittee delivers clear and convincing
evidence to the Township office demonstrating that the
highway failure was caused by another person.
§ 201-2 MONTGOMERY CODE § 201-2
1:324
(b) In situations where the permittee has the responsibility to
restore the highway, including slope or any other appurtenance
thereto, the permittee has the duty to restore the improved
area in accordance with the permit. If the permittee fails to
restore the improved area properly, the Township will have the
authority to do the work at the expense of the permittee. The
permittee shall reimburse the Township for the costs within 30
days after receipt of the Township's invoice.
(c) The obtaining of a bond, other security or an agreement to
secure restoration costs does not relieve the permittee of the
restoration obligations imposed. The obtaining of a bond, other
security or an agreement will not act as a release of the
permittee from liability under principles of tort law with
respect to a failure of the highway in the permitted area
occurring after the expiration of the bond, other security or
agreement.
(16) Future highway changes. If in the future the highway is altered for
public convenience or necessity, the permittee shall at its own cost
and expense, change or relocate all or a part of the structures or
facilities authorized by the permit which interfere with the highway
alterations or which is inconsistent with the purpose of the highway
alterations.
(17) Acknowledgment by inspector. Acknowledgment, by the inspector
of the Township that all or part of the permitted work has been
completed does not constitute approval or acceptance of the work
or agreement that the work was performed in accordance with the
permit. Acknowledgment of completion by the inspector will not act
as a release of the permittee or waiver by the Township of its right
to seek performance or restitution from the permittee.
J. Special conditions for subsurface operations.
(1) Drilling, boring, driving or tunneling across improved area.
Drilling, boring, driving or tunneling across improved areas shall
comply with the following conditions:
(a) When crossing under an improved area, the opening for a
utility shall be drilled, bored, driven or tunneled a minimum
depth of three feet from the surface to the top of the opening.

the bore opening, if retrievable liquids is immediately
removed from the boring pit.
(b) No openings for the purpose of placing utilities facilities or
other structures under the improved area by drilling, boring,
driving or tunneling may be made closer than three feet to the
edge of the shoulder, unless the permit authorized a lesser

(c) A utility or other structure crossing under the improved area
shall be constructed to assure the safety of the traveling public
and to preclude the necessity of entering upon the improved
area to effect future maintenance or replacement.
(2) Trenching across the improved area. Trenching across an improved
area may be performed only when specifically authorized by the
permit, in accordance with the following:
(a) The top of every utility shall be installed at least three feet
beneath the surface.
(b) Trenching across the improved area may be authorized by the
permit where drilling, boring, driving or tunneling are not

§ 205-6. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for the
purpose of these regulations, have the meanings indicated:

whereas structural BMPs or measures are those that consist of a physical
device or practice that is installed to capture and treat stormwater runoff.
Structural BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed wetlands,
to small-scale underground treatment systems, infiltration facilities, filter
strips, low-impact design, bioretention, wet ponds, permeable paving,
grassed swales, riparian or forested buffers, sand filters, detention basins,
and manufactured devices. Structural stormwater BMPs are permanent
appurtenances to the project site.[Added 4-12-2004 by Ord. No.

ARTICLE III
Design Standards
§ 205-7. Exceptions.
The standards of design in this article should be used to judge and ascertain
the adequacy of subdivision proposals. Where the Supervisors determine
that the literal application of any of these standards in any case would cause
an undue hardship or be plainly unreasonable and unnecessary, they may
grant such reasonable exceptions as, in their opinion, will not be contrary
to the public interest. The Township Engineer and the Township Planning
Commission may recommend such reasonable exceptions to the design
standards of this article if the Engineer or Planning Commission determines
that an undue hardship would be caused in any case.
§ 205-8. Construction of facilities; inspection.
§ 205-9. General standards.
The following principles of land subdivision, general requirements and the
minimum standards of design shall be observed by the subdivider, developer
and builder at all instances:

expense to the Township, the streets, curbs, sidewalks, water mains,
sanitary sewers and storm drains, streetlights, fire hydrants, street
signs, shade trees, monuments, lot pins and other facilities and utilities
specified in this article. Construction and installation of such facilities
and utilities shall be subject to inspection by appropriate Township
officials during the progress of the work.
B. Prior to the issuance of a building permit and/or a grading permit
associated with a land development as defined in this chapter, the
developer and the builder shall attend a preconstruction meeting with
representatives of Montgomery Township. The consent of the developer
and the builder to the reasonable directions of the Township's
representatives at the preconstruction meeting shall be a condition
precedent to the issuance of a building permit and/or grading permit.

§ 205-26. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to provide minimum standards to safeguard
persons, to protect property and to promote the public welfare by
regulating and controlling the grading, excavating, removal or destruction
of topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover or land.
§ 205-27. Interpretation.
The provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements
to meet the above-stated purposes. Where the provisions of this article
impose greater restrictions than those of any statute, other ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of this article shall prevail. Where the provisions
of any statute, other ordinance or regulation impose greater restrictions
than those of this article, the provisions of such statute, ordinance or
regulation shall prevail.117

4-12-2004 by Ord. No. 04-177S; amended 9-26-2016 by Ord. No.
16-297ZS]
In addition to full compliance with Article IV, Erosion and Sediment Control,
an applicant's erosion and sediment control measures must comply with
Chapter 206, the Montgomery Township Stormwater Management
Ordinance.
§ 205-28. Grading permit.
A. Permits required. No person shall commence or perform any grading,
excavation, fill, topsoil removal or removal of vegetative cover without
first having obtained a grading permit from the Township Zoning
Officer upon the recommendation of the Township Engineer. A separate
grading permit shall be required for each site. One permit may cover
both an excavation and any fill made on the same site. A grading permit
will not be required, however, in the following situations, but in all other
respects the provisions of this chapter shall apply:
(1) An excavation which does not exceed 20 cubic yards total of
material removed.
(2) A fill which does not exceed 20 cubic yards of material deposited.
(3) An excavation below finished grade for the basements and footings
of a single-family residence, swimming pool or underground
structure authorized by building permit, an excavation for a
driveway between a single-family residence site and street or the
117. Editor's Note: Original § 210D, Definitions, as amended, which immediately followed this
section, now appears in Article II of this chapter. See § 205-6.
§ 205-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-28
1:385
grading of such excavated materials into the site from which
excavated, and including the provision of additional topsoil as may
be required for seedbed preparation.
(4) The Township may require the applicant to file a certificate of
insurance before the grading permit is issued. The amount of
insurance shall be prescribed by the Township based on the risk
involved, and the insurance shall be written by a company licensed
to do business in Pennsylvania. It must be noted on the grading
permit that neither the issuance of the grading permit nor
compliance with the permit shall relieve any person from any
responsibilities for damage to persons or property otherwise
imposed by law, nor shall the permit pose any liability upon the
Township for damages to persons or property. [Added 4-19-1993
by Ord. No. 93-9S]
B. No grading permit for any development site shall be issued until there
has been a site examination and approval by the Township Engineer.
[Amended 4-10-1989 by Ord. No. 18M]
C. Permit fees. Before issuing a grading permit, the Township Secretary,
or designated Code Enforcement Official, shall collect a permit fee,
which permit fee shall be determined and set by resolution of the Board
of Supervisors, which shall, from time to time by resolution, review and
set the fees to be charged as a permit fee for a grading permit.
[Amended 12-5-1983 by Ord. No. 18E; 4-19-1993 by Ord. No.
93-9S]
D. Topsoil standards. [Amended 4-10-1989 by Ord. No. 18M]
(1) Residential development. The developer shall strip back from each
residential lot and retain on each residential lot all topsoil from the
lot. There shall be no release of excess topsoil permitted until each
lot shall be graded with a minimum of eight inches of topsoil after
examination by the Township Engineer.
(2) Commercial/industrial development. After final grading there shall
be a minimum of eight inches of topsoil on the entire site other than
that portion of the site where there are buildings or other
impervious surface coverage. There shall be no release of excess
topsoil from the site until examination by the Township Engineer.
(3) The developer is not required to import topsoil to the site if an
eight-inch final depth cannot be achieved. In cases where the
original site has less than eight inches of topsoil at the start of
grading activities, the total amount available will become the
minimum topsoil requirement. No topsoil will be allowed to be
released from the site. [Added 3-23-1992 by Ord. No. 18X]
E. Expiration of permit. Every grading permit shall expire by limitation
and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not
been commenced within six months or is not completed within two
§ 205-28 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-28
1:386
§ 205-29. Erosion and sediment control.
years from the date of issue, provided that the Township Engineer
may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual
difficulties have prevented the work's being started or completed within
the specified time limits, grant reasonable extensions of time, and
provided that the application for extension of time is made before the
date of expiration of the permit.
F. Denial of permit; appeal.
(1) The Township Zoning Officer shall deny a grading permit where, in
his opinion, the work as proposed by the applicant may endanger
any property or any street or alley or fails to meet Township
standards. In determining whether the proposed work is likely to
endanger any property or streets or alleys or create hazardous
conditions, the Township Zoning Officer shall give due
consideration to possible saturation by rains, earth movements,
runoff of surface waters and subsurface conditions such as the
stratification and faulting of rock and the nature and type of the soil
or rock.
(2) The Board of Supervisors shall promptly consider appeals from the
provisions of this section or from the determinations of the
Township Engineer, and the Board shall make determinations of
alternative methods, standards or materials when, in its opinion,
strict compliance with the provisions of this chapter is not
necessary. Any applicant or permit holder shall have the right to
appeal to any court of competent jurisdiction from any decision or
determination of the Board of Supervisors.
A. General.
(1) For qualifying tracts, no changes shall be made in the contour of
the land; no grading, excavating, removal or destruction of the
topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be
commenced until such time that a plan or proposal for minimizing
erosion and sedimentation has been processed with and reviewed
by the Montgomery Township Planning Commission or there has
been a determination by the Township Engineer that such plans are
not necessary.
(2) Measures used to control erosion and reduce sedimentation shall,
as a minimum, meet the standards and specifications of the
Montgomery County Soil and Water Conservation District as
contained in the Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook, June
1970. The Township Engineer or other officials, as designated, shall
ensure compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies of
which are available from the District or the Secretary of
Montgomery Township.
§ 205-28 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-29
1:387
B. Principles. The following measures are effective in minimizing erosion
and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the control
plan:
(1) Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be
done in such a way that will minimize erosion.
(2) Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep
cut-fill operations to a minimum and ensure conformity with
topography so as to create the least erosion potential and
adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff.
(3) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected
and supplemented.
(4) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a
practical minimum.
(5) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable.
(6) Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect
exposed critical areas during development.
(7) The permanent (final) vegetation and structural erosion control and
drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the
development.
(8) Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased
runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and
after development. Where deemed necessary by the Township, the
rate of surface water runoff will be structurally retarded.
(9) Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed
area is stabilized by the use of debris drains, sediment basins, silt
traps or similar measures.
(10)On all areas to be paved, the base shall be installed immediately
upon final grading of the road.
C. Grading for drainage. In order to provide more suitable sites for
building and other uses, to improve surface drainage and to control
erosion, the following requirements shall be met:
(1) All lots, tracts or parcels shall be graded to provide proper
drainage away from buildings and dispose of it without ponding,
and all land within a development shall be graded to drain and
dispose of surface water without ponding, except where approved
by the Board of Supervisors on the recommendation of the
Township Engineer.
(2) All drainage provisions shall be of such design as to adequately
handle the surface runoff and carry it to the nearest suitable outlet,
such as a curbed street, storm drain or natural watercourse. Where
§ 205-29 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-29
1:388
drainage swales are used to divert surface waters away from
buildings, they shall be sodded or planted as required and shall be
of such slope, shape and size as to conform with the requirements
of the Township.
(3) Concentration of surface water runoff shall only be permitted in
swales or watercourses.
(4) Excavations and fills.
(a) Cut and fill slopes shall not be steeper than 2:1 unless
stabilized by a retaining wall or cribbing, except as approved
by the Board of Supervisors when handled under special
conditions.
(b) Adequate provisions shall be made to prevent surface water
from damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping
surfaces of fills.
(c) Cut and fills shall not endanger adjoining property.
(d) Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding or
erosion of the soil.
(e) Fills shall not encroach on natural watercourses or constructed
channels.
(f) Fills placed adjacent to natural watercourses or constructed
channels shall have suitable protection against erosion during
periods of flooding.
(g) Grading will not be done in such a way so as to divert water
onto the property of another landowner without the expressed
written consent of the affected landowner.
(h) During grading operations, necessary measures for dust
control will be exercised.
(i) Grading equipment will not be allowed to cross live streams.
Provision will be made for the installation of culverts or
bridges.
(j) Whenever a fill is to be made of materials other than clean soil
or earth, the grading permit shall be subject to the following
additional limitations and requirements:
[1] The fill shall be completed within a reasonable length of
time, said time limit to be determined by the Township
Engineer and to be specified on the grading permit.
[2] Clean soil or earth shall be placed over the top and
exposed surfaces of the fill to a depth not less than four
inches and sufficient to conceal all materials other than
clean soil or earth within the fill. Where the nature of the
§ 205-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-29
1:389
§ 205-30. General responsibilities.
fill requires, the Township Engineer may require clean soil
or earth to be placed over the top and exposed surfaces of
the fill to a depth sufficient to conceal all materials at the
end of each day's operations.
[3] No grading permit shall be issued for the filling of
materials other than clean soil or earth until a faithful
performance bond in the amount of the Township
Engineer's estimated cost of adequately covering such fill
with clean soil or earth has been furnished to the
Township. Such bond shall be executed by a corporate
surety or by the principal, as the Township may require,
and shall be subject to the approval of the Township
Solicitor as to form. In lieu of said bond, a cash deposit in
said amount may be made with the Township or with a
bank or trust company, approved by the Township
Solicitor, which shall act as escrow agent.
(k) Notice to adjacent property owners. Before commencing any
excavation or fill which will affect an adjoining property or
structures thereon, the person making or causing the
excavation to be made shall give written notice to the owners
of said adjoining properties or structures not less than 14 days
before such excavation is to be made. Adjoining properties and
structures shall be protected as provided in the Township
Building Code.118,119
A. Whenever sedimentation is caused by stripping vegetation, regrading
or other development, it shall be the responsibility of the person,
corporation or other entity causing such sedimentation to remove it
from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses and to
repair any damage at his expense as quickly as possible.
B. Maintenance of all drainage facilities and watercourses within any
subdivision of land development is the responsibility of the developer
until they are accepted by the Township or some other official agency,
after which they become the responsibility of the accepting agency.
C. It is the responsibility of any person, corporation or other entity doing
any act on or across a communal stream, watercourse or swale or upon
the floodplain or right-of-way thereof to maintain, as nearly as possible
in its present state, the stream, watercourse, swale, floodplain or rightof-
way during the pendency of the activity and to return it to its original
or equal condition after such activity is completed.

Township or, when necessary, the Pennsylvania Department of Forests
and Waters.
F. Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, there shall be
provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially
with the line of said watercourse and of such width as will be adequate
to contain the maximum rate of runoff from the fully developed area
upstream.
G. Each person, corporation or other entity which makes any surface
changes shall be required to:
(1) Collect on-site surface runoff and dispose of it to the point of
discharge into the common natural watercourse of the drainage
area.
(2) Handle existing and potential off-site runoff through his
development by designing to adequately handle storm runoff from
a fully developed area upstream.
(3) Pay his proportionate share (i.e., the proportion that the area of his
land bears to the area of the fully developed drainage area) of the
total cost of off-site improvements to the common natural
watercourse based on a fully developed drainage area.
(4) Provide and install at his expense, in accordance with Township
requirements, all drainage and erosion control improvements
(temporary and permanent) as required by the erosion and
sediment control plan or proposal.
H. The Township will assume the responsibility for maintaining an open
and free flowing condition in all minor streams, watercourses and
drainage systems constructed or improved in accordance with the
Township design criteria which are necessary for proper drainage, in
the discretion of the Township, if adequate right-of-way exists or can be
acquired.

[Added 4-23-1984 by Ord. No. 18F]
§ 205-35. Areas of special flood hazard; purpose.
Those areas defined as "floodplain" by the Floodplain Conservation District
of the Township Zoning Ordinance121 shall be subject to the requirements
and restrictions contained in the Zoning Ordinance and the following
additional regulations which are intended to conform to the requirements
of Section 60.3d of the National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 90-448, and
the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act P.L. 851, No. 166 of 1978.122
It is the purpose of these regulations to:
§ 205-36. Restrictions on development in areas of flood hazard.
The following requirements shall apply for all subdivision and land
developments proposed in Montgomery Township:
A. Regulate any subdivision or land development of floodplain land areas
that is permitted or as a result of an approved variance in order to
promote the general health, welfare and safety of the community.
B. Require that each subdivision lot or development site in floodplain
areas be provided with a safe building site with adequate access; and
that public facilities which serve such sites be designed and installed to
preclude flood damage at the time of initial construction.
C. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuitable for use
because of flood hazards by prohibiting the subdivision and
development of unprotected floodplain areas.
D. Maintain the certification of Montgomery Township and the eligibility of
the property owners in Montgomery Township for the benefits of the
National Flood Insurance Program, P.L. 90-448.
A. The Board of Supervisors may, when it is deemed necessary for health,
safety or welfare of the present and future population of the area and
necessary to the conservation of water, drainage and sanitary facilities,
restrict subdivision of any portion of the property which lies within the
floodplain of any stream or drainage course.
B. No subdivision or land development shall be approved if the proposed
development or improvements will, individually or collectively, increase
the established flood level or regulatory flood elevation (where
available).
C. If the Board of Supervisors determines that only a portion of a proposed
plan can be safely developed, it shall limit development to that part and
121. Editor's Note: See Ch. 230, Zoning.

§ 205-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-36
1:395
§ 205-37. Excavation and grading.
Where any excavation or grading is proposed or where any existing trees,
shrubs or other vegetative cover will be removed, the developer shall
consult the Montgomery County Conservation District representative
concerning plans for erosion and sediment control and a report on the soil
characteristics of the site in order to determine the type and magnitude
of development the site may safely accommodate. Before undertaking any
excavation or grading, the developer shall conform to all pertinent laws,
regulations and ordinances of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and
Montgomery Township.
§ 205-38. Storm drainage facilities.
shall require that development proceed consistent with this
determination.
D. When a developer does not intend to develop the plan himself and the
Board of Supervisors determines that additional controls are required
to ensure safe development, it may require the developer to impose
appropriate deed restrictions on the land. Such deed restrictions shall
be inserted on every deed and noted on the record plan.
E. Any new construction and substantial improvements, including the
placement of prefabricated buildings, located in flood-prone areas shall
be designed or modified and adequately anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse or lateral movement of the structure, be constructed with
materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage and be
constructed by methods and practices minimizing flood damage.
F. Prospective developers shall consult with the Code Enforcement Officer
to make a determination as to whether or not the proposed subdivision
or land development is located within an identified floodplain.
G. Where not prohibited by this chapter or any other codes or ordinances,
land located in a floodplain may be subdivided or developed in
accordance with this chapter and any other codes or ordinances
regulating such development.
A. Storm drainage facilities shall be designed to convey the flow of a onehundred-
year storm without risk to persons or property. The drainage
system shall ensure drainage at all points along streets and ensure
conveyancy of drainage away from buildings and on-site waste disposal
sites.
B. The Board of Supervisors may require in a floodplain, an underground
storm sewer system to accommodate one-hundred-year floods and a
secondary surface system to accommodate larger, less frequent floods.
Drainage plans shall be consistent with local and regional drainage
plans. The facilities shall be designed to prevent the discharge of
increased peak runoff onto adjacent properties.
§ 205-36 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-39
1:396
§ 205-39. Changes in watershed.
Any development which creates a significant change in the characteristics
of the watershed, thus increasing volume and/or velocity of surface water
runoff due to the decrease in retention and infiltration of stormwater,
shall not be permitted until guaranties are made of erosion, sedimentation,
inundation and water drainage from peak periods of precipitation to provide
for controlled disposal of excess surface water. Such improvements must
satisfy the requirements and regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, Bureaus of Water Quality Management and Dams
and Encroachments.
§ 205-40. Elevation of streets.
The finished elevation of proposed streets within floodplain area shall be
a minimum of two feet above the base flood elevation or regulatory flood
elevation, where available. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to
discharge flood flows without increasing flood heights onto lands of other
property owners.
§ 205-41. (Reserved)123
§ 205-42. Sewers.
A. Within floodplain areas:
(1) New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and all
appurtenances thereto, including but not limited to pumping
stations, shall be floodproofed up to a point 1 1/2 feet above the
base flood elevation.
(2) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
B. The Board of Supervisors may prohibit installation of sewage disposal
facilities requiring soil absorption systems where such systems will not
function due to high groundwater, flooding or unsuitable soil
characteristics. The Board of Supervisors may require that the
developer note on the plan and in any deed of conveyance that on-site
sewage disposal systems are prohibited in designated flood-prone
areas.
C. The Board of Supervisors may prescribe adequate methods for waste
disposal. If a public sanitary sewer system is located within or near the
proposed subdivision or land development, the Board of Supervisors
shall require the developer to connect to this system where practical,
based upon the recommendation of the Montgomery Township Sewer

1:397
§ 205-43. Water supply.
All new or replacement water systems in floodplain areas, whether public
or private, shall be floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet above the established
base flood elevation or regulatory flood elevation, where available. If there
is an existing public water supply system within or near the subdivision or
land development, the Board of Supervisors shall require the developer to
connect to this system where practical and shall prescribe the procedures
to be followed by the developer in connecting to said system.
§ 205-44. Elevation of other utilities.
All other new or replacement public or private utilities and facilities shall
be elevated or floodproofed to a point 1 1/2 feet above the established base
flood elevation or regulatory flood elevation, where available.
§ 205-45. Erosion and sedimentation.
The Board of Supervisors, in its consideration of any preliminary plan
of subdivision and land development, shall condition its approval upon
the execution of measures designed to prevent accelerated soil erosion
and resulting sedimentation, as required by the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources. All applicable regulations and permit
requirements of said Department, as stipulated in its Soil Erosion and
Sedimentation Control Manual, shall be followed by all parties engaged in
earth-moving activities.
§ 205-46. Natural watercourses.
All continuously flowing natural watercourses shall be maintained in their
natural state, except that removal of debris and correction of severe erosion
shall be required.
§ 205-47. Intermittent watercourses.
Authority Engineer, and shall prescribe the procedures to be followed
by the developer in connecting to said system.
A. Intermittent watercourses shall be maintained essentially at their
existing alignments and gradients except that they may be improved by
minor regrading and shall either be planted in grass or provided with
water erosion preventive improvements such as riprap. Paving of such
watercourses shall not be allowed, nor shall piping, except under roads,
driveways and walkways.
B. Intermittent watercourses often are significant elements of the
headwaters of larger streams and are usually small in size. Therefore,
developers should be encouraged to design and build around and with
respect for these drainageways, and the Board of Supervisors may
allow rerouting of these drainageways only when serious
§ 205-42 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-47
1:398
considerations so warrant or when the site drainage will be improved
by such proposed alignment changes.

contiguous properties in different zoning districts by providing certain
minimum landscaping requirements for all future land developments.
§ 205-49. General requirements.
A. The standards of design of this article should be used to judge the
adequacy of subdivision or land development proposals. Where, in the
opinion of the Township Engineer, the literal application of these
standards in certain cases would work undue hardship or be plainly
unreasonable, the Township Landscape Architect, Township Shade Tree
Commission, or Township Engineer may recommend to the Board of
Supervisors such reasonable exceptions as will not be contrary to the
public interest. The Board of Supervisors may modify or adjust the
standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while securing
substantial conformance with the objectives of the regulations.
B. The standards included in these regulations are minimum design
requirements. The Board of Supervisors reserve the right, in any case,
to request that the requirements listed herein exceed these standards if
conditions so warrant.
C. It is required that all landscape plans be prepared by a landscape
architect registered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and familiar
with this Landscape Article in order to promote the proper use and
arrangement of plant materials. These plans shall be reviewed by
appropriate Township staff members and consultants and approved by
the Township Board of Supervisors.
D. (Reserved)
E. All plant material shall meet the standards of the American Standard
for Nursery Stock by the American Nursery and Landscape Association
(2004), or most recent edition, and the height, spread and/or caliper for

day of final approval of the landscape installation by the Township
Landscape Architect, Township Shade Tree Commission, or the
Township Engineer. Any plant material 25% or more of which is dead
shall be considered dead. A tree shall be considered dead when the
main leader has died or 25% of the crown is dead. Any dead plant
material shall be replaced and installed according to the approved
planting practices.
H. The developer shall contact the Township in writing to request a final
inspection for acceptance at the end of the guaranty period. These
inspections will be performed when plant materials are in full leaf only
(May 1 through November 15). All guaranty escrow funds will be
released upon acceptance at the end of the guaranty period. The
guaranty will be extended until 30 days after receipt of the request
letter following May 1. Should the end of the guaranty period occur
after November 15, the guaranty period shall be extended to May 15.
I. Nonconforming uses. Whenever there is a nonconforming use, the
nonconforming use must comply with the most restrictive landscape
requirements for either the land use or the zoning district in which it is
located or the zoning district which would normally permit the
nonconforming use.125

over 20 trees shall be estimated by the following method:
(a) Three one-hundred-foot-by-one-hundred-foot-square areas will
be staked out in locations acceptable to the owner/developer
and the Township Engineer, Township Shade Tree Commission
or Township Landscape Architect.
(b) The quantity of trees in each area will be counted and the
totals averaged to determine the average number of trees per
10,000 square feet of wooded area.
(c) This average quantity per area will be used to determine both
the quantity of trees being removed and the quantity of trees to
remain in large masses.

the land and a minimum elevation difference between the floor level of
the unit and the ground elevation under it. Existing trees and shrubs,
rock formations, streams, floodplains, steep slopes and other natural
features of the tract shall be preserved to the maximum extent
practical. Favorable views shall be emphasized by the plan.
C. Courts and spaces. Groups or clusters of units so placed as to create
interior spaces and courtyards shall be incorporated whenever feasible.
D. Orientation. Mobile homes are encouraged to be arranged in a variety
of orientations and are strongly encouraged to have many units with
their long sides facing the street rather than their ends, in order to
provide variety and interest. Site layout shall be designed to ensure that
mobile home units are offset to block long uninterrupted vistas between
the units.
E. Street layout. Gridiron layouts and street patterns unrelated to the
topography of the site are to be avoided.
F. Roadways.
(1) Standards. All applicable standards for streets and roads contained
in the Montgomery Township Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance of 1964, and as subsequently amended, shall be adhered
to for all public roads in and abutting mobile home developments.
In those developments wherein the roads are to be maintained as
private internal roadways owned and maintained by the mobile
home park operators or owned and maintained in common by the
residents/owners of the individual lots, the standards shall be as
follows:
(a) Right-of-way. There shall be an equivalent right-of-way, as
defined herein, reserved along those streets which are
designed to function as feeder or collector roads and which
connect major exterior roadways, form major loops, traverse
the park or provide major or important access to adjacent
parcels. No equivalent right-of-way is required on other roads.
On those roads where an equivalent right-of-way is required,
parallel parking may be permitted, but perpendicular or angle
parking is discouraged.
(b) Pavement. The pavement width of all residential streets
serving as access to mobile home lots shall be not less than 26
feet, except that this may be reduced to not less than 20 feet on
a street serving as access to no more than 20 mobile home lots
where parking is prohibited along the road and off-street
visitor parking is provided in common areas within 300 feet of
all dwelling units at a rate of 0.3 space per mobile home.
(c) Grades. Gradients on all residential streets shall not exceed
10%.

1:426
(d) Culs-de-sac. A paved turnaround area with a minimum radius
of 50 feet shall be provided at the closed end of any cul-de-sac
road serving as the sole access of four or more mobile home
lots. No permanently closed cul-de-sac street shall exceed 500
feet in length or serve as the sole access to more than 20
mobile home lots.
(e) Other requirements. All other applicable requirements of this
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance relating to
grades, vertical curves, horizontal curves, tangents between
curves, sight distance, construction specifications, intersection
alignment, intersection radius, interconnection of adjacent
parcels and similar regulations shall be adhered to in all mobile
home park developments.
(2) Access limitations. Mobile home lots may have direct access only
onto minor internal streets. Direct access from a mobile home lot
shall not be permitted onto the street(s) from which the mobile
home development gains primary access.
(3) Access streets. Access to mobile home parks shall be designed to
minimize congestion and hazards at the entrances or exits and
allow free movement of traffic on adjacent streets. The entrance
roads connecting the park streets with a public street or road shall
have a minimum road pavement width of 34 feet for a distance of at
least 100 feet from the public street.
(4) Conversions. Any road built as a private road and later proposed for
conversion to a public road shall be brought up to the applicable
standards for public roads prior to being ordained as a public way,
unless this requirement is waived by the governing body
subsequent to determining that compliance with the requirement
would have a negative effect on the mobile home park.
G. Pedestrian circulation.
(1) General requirements. All mobile home parks shall provide safe,
convenient, all-season pedestrian walkways of adequate width for
intended use, durable and convenient to maintain, between
individual mobile homes, mobile home park streets, all community
facilities provided for the residents and off-site pedestrian traffic
generators, such as schools, bus stops, commercial centers, etc.
These pedestrian walkways may parallel vehicular roadways,
where they shall only be required on one side, or they may form a
separate but coordinated system away from streets. Walkways
must be provided wherever pedestrian traffic is concentrated and
where school children congregate but may be waived elsewhere if
the applicant successfully demonstrates a lack of need.
(2) Common walk system. Where a common walk system is provided
and maintained between locations, such common walks shall have
a minimum width of four feet. Where these walks parallel
§ 205-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-67
1:427
roadways, they shall be separated from the road pavement by a
distance of at least four feet.
(3) Individual walks. All dwellings shall be connected to common walks
to streets or to driveways or parking spaces connecting to a paved
street. Such individual walks shall have a minimum width of two
feet.
H. Parking.
(1) Spaces required. Two all-weather off-street parking spaces shall be
provided for each dwelling either on the same lot therewith or in
common parking facilities, provided that parking areas contained
therein are within 150 feet of the mobile home lots for which they
are intended.
(a) Aisle width. Where common parking facilities are to be used,
no parking aisle will be less than 22 feet in width.
(b) Required green areas. Ten percent of all common parking
areas on each lot shall be devoted to green areas consisting
mostly of natural vegetation which must be interspersed within
the paved parking area to channel traffic or divide parking
areas. The green areas required by this section shall not
constitute a portion of any green area on common open spaces
otherwise required by this chapter or any other ordinance or
regulation of the Township. The exact design and location of
the green areas required by this section shall be indicated on a
development or subdivision or other similar plan and be
permanently maintained as such.
I. Common open space. In addition to the requirements of § 230-61 of the
Township Zoning Ordinance, the following regulations shall also apply:
(1) Common open space and buffer areas design. Common open space,
buffer areas and the circulation system should be designed as an
integrated open space system, utilizing techniques that will
produce maximum open space benefit to the resident consistent
with the unit density and density concentration on the park site.
(2) Standards for location and management. Common open space
areas shall be located and designed as areas easily accessible to
residents and preserving natural features. Common open space
areas should include both active recreation areas for all age groups
and, particularly where the site includes a watercourse or hilly or
wooded areas, land which is left in its natural state. At least 25% of
the open space areas shall be located in an area not subject to
flooding and have reasonable topography and slope to be used for
active recreational activities. No such active recreational open
space areas shall be less than 1/4 acre in size.
J. Buffers.
§ 205-67 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-67
1:428
(1) General requirement. Along all exterior property boundary lines,
except those which abut another mobile home park, there shall be a
permanent buffer at least 15 feet in depth, unless this is waived
pursuant to Subsection J(4) or (5) below. A screen buffer, as defined
herein, shall be provided wherever the mobile home park abuts
existing residential uses, with the exception of mid-rise or high-rise
structures, and where abutting other types of uses when deemed
necessary by the Township governing body to provide sufficient
buffering and transition. A softening buffer, as defined herein, shall
be provided wherever the mobile home park abuts existing mid-rise
or high-rise residential uses; existing commercial, office, industrial,
and institutional uses; any existing street [as modified by
Subsection J(3) below], drive or parking area; or open (not wooded)
undeveloped land. An open buffer shall be provided wherever the
mobile home park abuts wooded undeveloped land or where more
extensive buffers are deemed unnecessary by the governing body.
(2) Components. The minimum components of each type of buffer shall
be as follows:
(a) Screen buffer. The primary component of a screen buffer shall
be a row of evergreen trees at a height of not less than six feet
when planted, spaced not more than 10 feet apart on center,
and these trees shall be of such species to attain a height of not
less than 20 feet at maturity. Also required as a secondary
component of the buffer is one of the following: mounding (the
use which is encouraged), provided that the slopes shall be a
maximum of 3:1; visually opaque fencing not greater than six
feet in height; and coniferous shrubbery. Any combination of
evergreen trees, coniferous shrubs, mounding, fencing or
other natural vegetation or man-made material is allowed,
provided that an effective visual screen at least 15 feet in
height above the adjacent ground elevation in the mobile home
park is achieved within a reasonable time. But whenever only
vegetation is used there shall be at least a double row of
evergreen trees, with the trees in one row offset five feet from
the trees in the other row and the rows at least five feet apart.
(b) Softening buffer. The primary component of a softening buffer
shall be a row of trees, spaced not more than 25 feet apart on
center, at least 25% of which shall be evergreen. The
evergreen trees shall be at least six feet in height when planted
and shall attain at least 20 feet in height at maturity. Any
deciduous trees shall be at least 1 1/2 inches in caliper,
measured one foot above ground level, and eight feet in height
when planted and shall attain a height of not less than 20 feet
in maturity. These trees shall be interspersed with other
allowable components, including any other type of trees,
shrubs, mounding, fencing and/or similar natural or man-made
§ 205-67 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-67
1:429
elements having a visible vertical dimension, or any
combination thereof.
(c) Open buffer. The open buffer shall, as a minimum, consist of
grass, ground cover and/or similar vegetative material and
may include trees, shrubs or other natural or man-made
landscaping materials, but it shall be mostly vegetative rather
than paved.
(3) Street boundaries. Rather than the extensive buffers described in
Subsection J(2) above, the use of a single row of deciduous trees at
least eight feet in height when planted and at least 20 feet in height
at maturity, with a spacing of not more than 40 feet on center, may
be provided along all property boundaries which abut a street
wherever necessary for adequate sight distance or where the
governing body determines this to be a sufficient buffer to protect
the welfare and safety of the community.
(4) Existing buffers. In cases where an edge(s) of a mobile home park
occurs along natural features which function as buffers, including
but not limited to mature vegetation, significant grade changes or
stream valleys, which are likely to be permanently preserved,
buffering may be waived along that edge(s) upon approval of the
governing body.
(5) Buffer alternative. Buffers may also be waived by the governing
body where the mobile home park abuts a single-family residential
use, if only detached modular homes or conventionally-built singlefamily
detached dwellings, but no mobile home, are constructed
within 200 feet of that property boundary.
(6) Maintenance. All vegetation shall be maintained permanently and,
in the event of death or other destruction, shall be replaced within
one year by the persons responsible for maintenance when death or
destruction occurred.
(7) Buffer landscape plan. A landscaping plan shall be submitted with
the final plans, showing all pertinent information, including the
location, size and specie of all individual trees and shrubs to be
preserved or planted, or, alternately, the general characteristics of
existing vegetation masses which are to be preserved.
K. Drainage considerations. The following site drainage requirements
shall apply to all mobile home parks.
(1) Surface water. The ground surface in all parts of park shall be
graded and equipped to drain all surface water in a safe, efficient
manner. The velocity of runoff during and after development shall
not exceed 1.5 feet per second as required by Chapter 102, Section
102.22(c) of the Erosion Control Rules and Regulations, published
by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, July
1, 1973, and as subsequently amended.

A. This shall be submitted in eight copies to the Township Secretary,
accompanied by an application for approval. The plan will be reviewed
by the Planning Commission in accordance with the Second Class
Township Code.143 The plan will also be reviewed by the Township
Engineer and Township or State Health Officer, the County Planning
Commission and other appropriate officials. The plan shall then be
reviewed by the Supervisors, taking into consideration the
recommendations of the other reviewing agencies or persons. If the
Supervisors approve the plan, the Township Secretary will so certify
thereon, and one copy will be given to the subdivider, developer or
builder. If the Board disapproves, the reasons therefor will be given to
the subdivider, developer or builder, who may appeal therefrom as
provided by law.
B. Approval of the plan by the Board will be tentative only and shall confer
no vested rights on the parties in interest, and changes or modifications
therein may subsequently be required if the Board determines the same
to be necessary. Any subdivision for which the record plan is not
approved within two years must be submitted as an entirely new
subdivision.
A. Improvement construction plan. This shall be submitted in triplicate
(two paper prints and one cloth print) to the Township Secretary for
approval by the Supervisors. Before approval, the plan will be reviewed
by the Township Engineer and the Planning Commission. Whenever the
drainage area involved contains more than 1/2 of one square mile, a
permit must be obtained from the Water and Power Resources Board of
the Commonwealth. The plan will then be reviewed by the Supervisors,
taking into consideration the requirements and recommendations of the
other reviewing agencies or persons. Upon approval of the plan, the
Township Secretary will so certify thereon, one copy will be given to the
subdivider, developer or builder, who will also receive from the
Township Secretary an improvement construction permit authorizing
him to proceed with the construction of the improvements. An
improvement construction permit does not constitute approval of the
work to be performed thereunder. Such permit will become void if work
is not commenced within six months, provided that an extension of six
months may be granted by the Township Secretary upon written
request therefor. After completion of the work, a completion certificate
will be issued by the Township Secretary, and the Township Engineer
will endorse the plan accordingly.

ARTICLE XII
Sketch Plans
[Added 4-10-1989 by Ord. No. 18N]
§ 205-88. Applicability.
The standards, requirements and procedures contained in this article shall
supplement the existing submission and processing procedures of all
applications for subdivision and/or land developments in the Township.
§ 205-89. Intent.
It is the intent in permitting sketch plans to avoid unnecessary delays and
expense to both the Township and the applicant. Issues raised at the sketch
plan stage can be resolved before time and expense have been incurred in
developing preliminary plans. Preliminary plans submitted without sketch
plan approval may raise significant issues that can be resolved only by
redesign.
§ 205-90. Tentative sketch plan submissions.
A. All applicants for subdivision or land development may submit a sketch
plan to the Township Planning Commission. Applicants with proposals
to subdivide a parcel of land into three or more lots or to develop a
parcel of land containing one or more acres are strongly encouraged to
submit sketch plans because their proposals are more likely than
smaller proposals to need redesigning.
B. Tentative sketch plans shall be considered as submitted for informal
discussion between the developer and the Planning Commission and, at
its option, the Board of Supervisors. Submission of a sketch plan does
not constitute a formal submission of an application for approval of a
subdivision or land development plan.
C. For informal purposes, seven copies of the tentative sketch plan shall be
submitted to the Township Manager for distribution to the Township
Engineer, the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors and the
Montgomery County Planning Commission. Each such reviewing
agency shall have comments on the sketch plan within 45 days. This
forty-five-day review period shall not restrict the applicant from
submitting a preliminary plan. The applicant may submit a preliminary
plan at any time.
D. Contents of tentative sketch plans. Tentative sketch plans shall be
drawn to scale showing precise dimensions and shall show the
following information:
(1) The name of the subdivision or land development and the name of
municipality.
§ 205-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-90
1:461
§ 205-91. Review procedures.
(2) A location plan showing the subject tract and the surrounding road
network, including all adjoining curb cuts and traffic lights;
including a key map.
(3) The name and address of the owner, agent, engineer, surveyor and
architect, as applicable.
(4) The tract boundary and location by deed plotting.
(5) A North point and scale.
(6) The existing and proposed road and lot or structure layout and
building envelopes.
(7) Significant topographical and physical features, such as soils,
floodplains, slopes at two-foot grade changes, woodlands and
existing structures.
(8) Proposals for control of drainage runoff.
(9) Proposals for community facilities.
(10) Road widths and dimensions.
E. The tentative sketch plan shall be accompanied by at least two recent
photographs of all existing structures on the tract.
F. Formal review. Formal submission of an application for subdivision or
land development begins with preliminary plan submission, at which
time:
(1) The appropriate fee to the Township and Montgomery County
Planning Commission must be submitted; and
(2) The requirements for formal review and approval begin as per
Article V of Act 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning
Code.146
A. The tentative sketch plans shall be presented to the Township Planning
Commission for informal discussion at a regularly scheduled Planning
Commission meeting, following an application made to the Township
Zoning Officer or Manager and a request to be placed on the agenda.
B. The Township Planning Commission may make nonbinding suggestions
and recommendations to the applicant during the meeting at which the
plan is discussed. These need not be presented in writing to the
applicant.
C. If a proposal is large or complex, the Township Planning Commission
may defer completing its comments and recommendations until it has

§ 205-92. Effect of review.
consulted its technical advisors. However, the Planning Commission
will try to expedite this informal review process.
A. Approval of a tentative sketch plan shall not be considered as approval
of a preliminary plan nor in any way bind the applicant or the Township.
B. The Planning Commission may grant sketch plan approval unless the
proposal is for cluster development for which conditional approval is
required by the Board of Supervisors.
C. The purpose of allowing a tentative sketch plan submittal is to provide a
vehicle for discussing and clarifying ideas and concepts to be used and
refined in further sketches or in preliminary plans. Therefore,
preliminary plans shall incorporate rudiments of sketch plans approved
by the Township, including the information listed in § 205-90D above.

§ 205-94. Public utilities and laterals.
All water, gas, electric and other pipes and conduits and all service
connections or laterals shall be laid to the full width of the ultimate right-ofway,
where the need therefor can be reasonably anticipated, before streets
are paved. The arrangements for said service connections or laterals shall
be the responsibility of the subdivider, developer or builder.
§ 205-95. Inspection of work and materials.
The Township Engineer shall be notified 48 hours in advance of the
commencement of any construction operation, in order that provisions may
be made for inspection by the Township.
§ 205-93 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-95
1:465

ARTICLE XIV
Conditions of Acceptance
§ 205-96. Streets and other improvements.
A. Conditions. The Township may take over and make public any street or
other improvement if:
(1) The required improvements, utility mains and laterals and
monuments shown on an approval plan or plans have been
constructed to all requirements and approved by the Township

[Amended 6-26-1989 by Ord. No. 18O]
§ 205-97. Preventive remedies.
§ 205-98. Jurisdiction.
District Justices shall have initial jurisdiction in proceedings brought under
§ 205-99.
§ 205-99. Enforcement remedies.
Any person, partnership or corporation who or which has violated the
provisions of any subdivision or land development ordinance shall, upon
A. In addition to other remedies, the Township may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or in equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to
prevent illegal occupancy of a building, structure or premises. The
description by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer of other
documents used in the process of selling or transferring shall not
exempt the seller or transferor from such penalties or from the
remedies herein provided.
B. The Township may refuse to issue any permit or grant any approval
necessary to further improve or develop any real property which has
been developed or which has resulted from a subdivision of real
property in violation of any ordinance. Such denial of a permit or
approval shall apply to any of the following applicants:
(1) The owner of record at the time of such violation.
(2) The vendee or lessee of the owner of record at the time of such
violation, without regard as to whether such vendee or lessee had
actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(3) The current owner of record who acquired the property subsequent
to the time of violation, without regard as to whether such current
owner had actual or constructive knowledge of the violation.
(4) The vendee or lessee of the current owner of record who acquired
the property subsequent to the time of violation, without regard as
to whether such vendee or lessee had actual or constructive
knowledge of the violation.
C. As an additional condition for issuance of a permit or the granting of an
approval of any such owner, current owner, vendee or lessee for the
development of any such real property, the Township may require
compliance with the conditions that would have been applicable to the
property at the time the applicant acquired an interest in such real
property.

Traffic Management Study
[Added 8-23-1993 by Ord. No. 93-23]
§ 205-100. Purpose.
A traffic management study shall be required for all major subdivisions,
land developments and rezoning requests as described in § 205-102. This
study and report will enable Montgomery Township to assess the effect
of a proposed subdivision, land development or rezoning request on the
transportation system in Montgomery Township. The purpose of the study is
to ensure that proposed developments or zoning changes do not adversely
affect the transportation network, to identify any traffic problems
associated with site access and to determine traffic problems on Township,
county or state roads in the study area of the proposed project. The study
also will assist in the protection of air quality, the conservation of energy
and the safety of the motoring public. The study shall also present specific
determination of necessary traffic control signing (i.e., stop signs, speed
limit signing, warning signs, no parking signing, etc.), conforming to
Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, Title 75, and applicable Township
requirements.
§ 205-101. Conduct of traffic management study.
The traffic management study shall be prepared by a qualified traffic
engineer and/or transportation planner with previous traffic study
experience. The requirements, procedures and standards for the traffic
management study are set forth in § 205-104.
§ 205-102. Applicability.
A. A traffic management study shall be submitted for all residential
subdivisions or land developments of 20 or more lots or dwelling units;
all commercial, office, industrial, institutional or other nonresidential
uses requiring subdivision or land development approval; all rezoning
requests; and, with respect to residential subdivisions or land
developments of fewer than 20 dwelling units, the Board of
Supervisors, at its discretion where it determines that there is a need
for a traffic management study because of the location of the proposed
site, may require a traffic management study and report; provided,
however, that the Supervisors notify the applicant of this requirement
within 30 days of the original filing of the application.
B. The Board of Supervisors may waive in whole or in part the
requirement for a traffic management study at its discretion in
accordance with the provisions of § 205-107 below.
§ 205-100 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 205-103
1:471
§ 205-103. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
LEVEL OF SERVICE  This elevation is defined in the 1985 Highway
Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, as amended, as operational
conditions within a traffic stream (or at an intersection approach). "Level of
service" also generally describes these conditions in terms of such factors
as speed, travel time, freedom to maneuver, traffic interruptions, comfort
and convenience and safety. Six "levels of service" are defined for each type
of traffic facility, ranging from A to F. Level of Service A indicates free flow;
Level of Service B indicates stable flow; Level of Service C indicates stable
but inhibited flow; Level of Service D indicates high-density, restricted
stable flow; Level of Service E indicates operation at or near capacity; and
Level of Service F is indicative of flow breakdown.
MAJOR INTERSECTION  Any intersection where traffic generated by the
proposal will have a significant effect on the operation of traffic through
the intersection. Where doubt exists, the qualified traffic engineer and/
or planner shall seek guidance from the Montgomery Township Board of
Supervisors and/or the Township Traffic Engineer prior to the submission of
the study.
QUEUE ANALYSIS  This procedure includes the average queue and
maximum queue of vehicles which will be observed in each traffic stream
and intersection approach, measured in both feet and vehicles. Various
statistical and/or computer models may be applied.
STUDY AREA  This area will extend along all Township, county and state
roads serving the development and will extend to all major intersections
in the Township that may be affected. Where doubt exists, the qualified
traffic engineer and/or transportation planner will seek guidance from the
Montgomery Township Board of Supervisors or its designee prior to the
submission of the study.
TRIP GENERATION  The total count of trips to and from a study site
per unit of land use (i.e., acres, dwelling unit, etc.) as established by
the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip
Generation Report. For land uses not listed in this report or if information
is determined through a small sample size, the qualified traffic engineer
and/or transportation planner shall seek guidance from the Montgomery
Township Board of Supervisors or its designee prior to the submission of the
study.
VOLUME/CAPACITY ANALYSIS  This procedure compares the volume of a
traffic facility to its capacity. The procedure described in the 1985 Highway
Capacity Manual, Transportation Research Board Special Report 209, as
amended, shall be followed.
WARRANTS FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLATION  A series of warrants
which detail the minimum traffic volume, pedestrian volume or other
criteria necessary for the installation of a traffic signal. These criteria are

site and use and transportation setting for the site and its
surrounding area.
(a) Site and study area boundaries. A brief description of the size,
location, general terrain features, proposed land uses,
construction staging and completion date of the proposed land
development shall be provided. If the development is
residential, types of dwelling units and number of bedrooms
shall be included. Also, the description shall include probable
socioeconomic characteristics of site users with respect to
transportation needs of the site (i.e., number of senior
citizens).
(b) Existing and proposed site uses. The existing and proposed
uses of the site shall be identified in terms of type and zoning
classification category.
(c) Existing and proposed nearby uses. A complete description of
the existing land uses in the vicinity of the site as well as their
current zoning, proposed uses for adjacent land and other
major existing and proposed land development shall be
provided.
(d) Existing and proposed roadways and intersections. The
description shall contain full documentation of the proposed
internal and existing external transportation system. This
description shall include proposed internal vehicular bicycle
and pedestrian circulation, all proposed ingress and egress
locations, all internal roadways (widths and rights-of-way),
parking conditions, traffic channelization and any traffic
signals or other intersection control devices at all intersections
within the site. Also, locations for all signing (i.e., speed limits,
etc.) shall be shown and verified. The report shall describe the
entire external roadway system within the study area. Major
intersections in the study area shall be identified and
illustrated. All existing and proposed public transportation
services and facilities within a one-mile radius of the site shall
also be documented. All future highway improvements within
Montgomery Township and the study area, including proposed
construction and traffic signalization, shall be noted.
Improvements cited within the most recent Montgomery
Township Comprehensive Plan shall be referenced.
§ 205-104 MONTGOMERY CODE § 205-104
1:474
Improvements from the Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation's twelve-year Highway and Bridge Program,
within Montgomery Township and the study area, shall also be
noted. Any proposed or in-place roadway improvements due to
proposed surrounding developments shall be noted.
(2) Analysis of existing conditions. This section shall describe the
results of the volume/capacity analysis to be completed for the
roadways and intersections in the study area under existing
conditions as well as any data collection efforts that are required.
(a) Daily and peak hour volumes. Schematic diagrams shall be
presented depicting existing traffic volumes for average daily
traffic (ADT), the weekday peak highway traffic hour(s) and
peak development-generated hour(s) and the Saturday peak
traffic hour. All documentation must be contained in the report.
Turning movement and mainline volumes shall be presented
for all peak hour conditions (weekday a.m. peak, weekday p.m.
peak, weekday site-generated and Saturday peak) while only
mainline volumes are required for ADT's. Source and method
of computation must be included.
(b) Volume/capacity analysis at critical points. A volume/capacity
analysis based upon existing volumes shall be performed
during the weekday and Saturday peak traffic hour(s) and the
peak development-generated hour(s) for all roadways and
major intersections in the study area.
(c) Levels of service at critical points. Based on the results
obtained in the previous section, levels of service are to be
computed and presented in schematic form. Included in this
section shall also be a description of typical operating
conditions at each level of service.
(3) Analysis of future conditions without the proposed development.
This section shall describe the anticipated traffic volumes in the
future and the ability of the roadway network to accommodate this
traffic without the proposed development. The future year(s) for
which projections are made shall be the development completion
year unless required otherwise by the Montgomery Township
Board of Supervisors. Factors included within this section include,
but are not limited to, background traffic growth expansion and
traffic generated by other proposed developments as well as
associated improvements.
(a) Daily and peak hour traffic volumes. This section shall clearly
indicate the method and assumptions used to forecast future
volumes in order that Township personnel can duplicate these
calculations. The schematic diagrams depicting future volumes
shall be similar for those described previously in Subsection
B(2)(a) in terms of location and times (daily and peak hours).

(b) Volume/capacity analysis at critical points. The ability of the
roadway system to accommodate future traffic (without the
proposed development) is to be described in this section. If
roadway improvements or modifications are committed for
implementation, the volume/capacity analysis should be
presented for these conditions. Periods of analysis shall be
presented for these conditions. Periods of analysis shall be the
same as those previously performed in Subsection B(2)(b).
(c) Levels of service at critical points. Based on the results
obtained in the previous section, levels of service are to be
determined and presented as in Subsection B(2)(c).
(4) Trip generation. The estimation of vehicular trips to result from the
proposal shall be completed for average weekday, average
Saturday, peak traffic hours during the weekday a.m. and p.m. peak
traffic hours, the weekday peak development-generated hour and
the Saturday peak traffic hour. These development-generated
traffic volumes shall be provided for the inbound and outbound
traffic movements as estimated, and the reference source(s) and
methodology followed shall be documented. Any characteristics of
the site which may cause particular trip generation problems shall
be noted.

General Provisions
§ 206-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Montgomery
Township Stormwater Management Ordinance."
§ 206-2. Statement of findings.
The Board of Supervisors finds that:
A. Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting
from development and redevelopment throughout a watershed
increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and
sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm
sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and
manage stormwater, undermines floodplain management and flood
reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces
groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.
B. Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff resulting
from land development and redevelopment throughout a watershed can
also harm surface water resources by changing the natural hydrologic
patterns, accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion
of streambeds and streambanks, thereby elevating sedimentation),
destroying aquatic habitat, and elevating aquatic pollutant
concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients, heavy
metals, and pathogens.
C. A comprehensive program of stormwater management (SWM),
including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing
accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare,
and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of
the commonwealth, their resources, and the environment.
D. Stormwater is an important water resource by providing groundwater
recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also
protects and maintains surface water quality.
E. Public education on the control of pollution from stormwater is an
essential component in successfully addressing stormwater.
F. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to
implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are
required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their
separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES).
G. Impacts from stormwater runoff can be minimized by using project
designs that maintain the natural hydrologic regime and sustain high
§ 206-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 206-2
1:489
§ 206-3. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
welfare within the Township by maintaining the natural hydrologic regime
and by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in
§ 206-2, through provisions designed to:
water quality, groundwater recharge, stream baseflow, and aquatic
ecosystems.
H. Nonstormwater discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
can contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth.
A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including
regulations at 25 Pa. Code 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim, and restore
the existing and designated uses of the waters of this commonwealth.
B. Minimize increases in stormwater volume and control peak flows.
C. Minimize impervious surfaces.
D. Provide review procedures and performance standards for stormwater
planning and management.
E. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.
F. Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, requiring a
minimum of structures and relying on natural processes.
G. Focus on infiltration of stormwater to maintain groundwater recharge,
to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality, and to
otherwise protect water resources.
H. Preserve and restore the flood-carrying capacity of streams.
I. Prevent scour and erosion of streambanks and stream beds.
J. Provide standards to meet National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements.
K. Address certain requirements of the Municipal Separate Stormwater
Sewer System (MS4) NPDES Phase II Stormwater Regulations.
L. Provide for proper operation and maintenance of all stormwater
management facilities and best management practices (BMPs) that are
implemented in the Township.
M. Implement the requirements of the Neshaminy Creek Watershed Act
167 Stormwater Management Plan (includes Little Neshaminy Creek
Watershed).
N. Implement the requirements of the Wissahickon Creek Watershed Act
167 Plan.

accordance with plans and specifications approved by the Township is
exempt.
E. The use of land for gardening and/or landscaping for home
consumption is exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
F. Exemptions from any provisions of this chapter shall not relieve the
applicant from the requirements in § 206-11D through L.
G. Infiltration exemptions.
(1) Depth to limiting zone: A minimum of two feet of soil suitable for
infiltration must exist between the invert of the infiltration BMP
and the top of the nearest limiting zone. Otherwise, the volume
control requirement shall not be applied to the development site,
and the entire volume must be treated.
H. Hotspots.
(1) Stormwater hotspots: Appendix D contains a list of types of
hotspots that may be recognized by the Township.150 If a site is a
potential hotspot, it has important implications for how stormwater
is managed. First and foremost, untreated stormwater runoff from
hotspots concentrated into a collection system shall not be
recharged into groundwater where it may contaminate water
supplies. Therefore, the volume control requirement shall not be
applied to development sites that lie within a hotspot (the entire
volume must still be treated). Second, a greater level of stormwater
treatment shall be applied at hotspot sites to prevent pollutant
washoff after construction. The Environmental Protection Agency's
(EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
stormwater program requires some industrial sites to prepare and
implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan.
(2) Rate of infiltration: When infiltration is not feasible due to poor
infiltration rates or hotspot, the water quality volume must be
treated by an approved SMP.
I. Additional exemption criteria.
(1) Exemption responsibilities: An exemption shall not relieve the
applicant from implementing such measures as are necessary to
protect public health, safety, and property.
(2) Drainage problems: Where drainage problems are documented or
known to exist downstream of or is expected from the proposed
activity, the Township may deny exemptions.
(3) Exemptions are limited to specific portions of this chapter.

§ 206-7. Compatibility with other ordinance or legal requirements.
Approvals issued pursuant to this chapter do not relieve the applicant of
the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities
regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act, or ordinance.
§ 206-8. Change of appendixes.
The appendixes listed below are incorporated herein by reference, as
amended:151
(1) Appendix A - Stormwater Management Design Criteria.
(2) Appendix B - Low Impact Development Practices.
(3) Appendix C - Disconnected Impervious Area.
(4) Appendix D - Hot Spots.
(5) Appendix E - West Nile Virus Guidance.
(6) Appendix F - Small Project Stormwater Management Site Plan.
(7) Appendix G - Nonstructural Project Design Checklist.
(4) HQ and EV streams: The Township may deny exemptions in high
quality (HQ) or exceptional value (EV) waters and source water
protection areas (SWPA).
(5) For a development taking place in stages, the entire development
plan must be used in determining compliance with these exemption
criteria. The starting point from which to consider tracts as "parent
tracts" in which future subdivisions and respective impervious area
computations are cumulatively considered shall be the date of the
municipal adoption of the original Montgomery Township
Stormwater Management Plan Ordinance [May 12, 2014].
(a) For example: If a property owner in Montgomery Township
proposes a three-hundred-square-foot shed after adoption of
the municipal stormwater management ordinance, that
property owner would be exempt from site plan and peak rate
control requirements. If, at a later date, the property owner
proposes to construct a garage and driveway adding an
additional 1,300 square feet of impervious surface, the
applicant would be required to submit a SWM site plan or
small project SWM site plan (or if applicable a fee-in-lieu of
alternative for small projects) in accordance with Article IV
demonstrating the stormwater control requirements for the
total impervious surface of 1,600 square feet.
J. The Township may deny or revoke any exemption pursuant to this
section at any time for any project that the Township believes may pose
a threat to public health, safety, property or the environment.

§ 206-12. Permit requirements by other governmental entities.
Approvals issued and actions taken under this chapter do not relieve the
applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for
activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance.
§ 206-13. Erosion and sediment pollution control.
§ 206-14. Volume control.
Volume controls will mitigate increased runoff impacts, protect stream
channel morphology, maintain groundwater recharge, and contribute to
water quality improvements. Stormwater runoff volume control methods
are based on the net change in runoff volume for the two-year storm event.
Volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in
Subsection A or the Simplified Method in Subsection B below. For regulated
activities equal to or less than one acre, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select
either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic
limitations of the procedures associated with each methodology, and other
25 of the Pennsylvania Code, the Clean Streams Law, and the Storm
Water Management Act.160
N. Various BMPs and their design standards are listed in the Pennsylvania
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual (PA BMP Manual).
A. Must comply with Title 25, Chapter 102 of the Pa. Code and any other
applicable state, county and Township codes. PADEP requires an
engineered post-construction SWM plan with projects proposing earth
disturbance greater than one acre.
B. Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for regulated earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP regional office or County
Conservation District must be provided to the Township.
C. Approval of earth disturbance activities is required by the Township per
Table 206-6.2.
D. Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria
are recommended to be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed.
They shall include the following:
(1) Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from
sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase to
maintain maximum infiltration capacity.
(2) Infiltration BMPs shall not be constructed nor receive runoff until
the entire drainage area contributory to the infiltration BMP has
achieved final stabilization.

1:513
factors. All regulated activities greater than one acre must use the Design
Storm Method.
A. Design-Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) (any regulated
activity): This method requires detailed modeling based on site
conditions. For modeling assumptions refer to § 206-19A.
(1) Post-development total runoff should not be increased from predevelopment
total runoff for all storms equal to or less than the
two-year twenty-four-hour duration precipitation.
(2) The following applies in order to estimate the increased volume of
runoff for the two-year twenty-four-hour duration precipitation
event:
To calculate the runoff volume (cubic feet) for existing site
conditions (pre-development) and for the proposed developed site
conditions (post-development), it is recommended to use the soil
cover complex method as shown on the following page. Table
A-3 in Appendix A is available to guide a qualified professional
and/or an applicant to calculate the stormwater runoff volume.
The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired, or
infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Soil Cover Complex Method:
Step 1: Runoff (in) = Q = (P - 0.2S)2/(P + 0.8S)
Where
P = 2-year Rainfall (in)
S = the potential maximum retention (including initial
abstraction, Ia)
S = (1,000/CN) - 10
Step 2: Runoff Volume (Cubic Feet) = Q x Area x 1/12
Where
Q = Runoff (in)
Area = SWM Area (square feet)
B. Simplified Method (CG-2 in the BMP Manual) (regulated activities less
than or equal to one acre):
(1) Stormwater facilities shall capture the runoff volume from at least
the first two inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
Volume (cubic feet) = (2" runoff/12 inches)* impervious surface
(square feet)
(2) At least the first inch of runoff volume from the new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow, i.e., it
§ 206-14 MONTGOMERY CODE § 206-14
1:514
shall not be released into the surface waters of the commonwealth.
The calculated volume shall be either reused, evapotranspired or
infiltrated through structural or nonstructural means.
Volume (cubic feet) = (1" runoff/12 inches)* impervious surface
(square feet)
(3) Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate the first
half inch of the permanently removed runoff.
(4) No more than one inch of runoff volume from impervious surfaces
shall be released from the site. The release time must be over 24
hours to 72 hours.
C. Stormwater control measures: The applicant must demonstrate how the
required volume is controlled through stormwater best management
practices (BMPs) which shall provide the means necessary to capture,
reuse, evaporate, transpire or infiltrate the total runoff volume.
(1) If natural resources exist on the site and a SWM site plan
submission is required for the regulated activity, the applicant shall
determine and display the total acreage of protected area where no
disturbance is proposed on the plan. The acreage of the protected
area should be subtracted from the total site area and not included
in the stormwater management site area acreage used in
determining the volume controls.
Stormwater Management Site Area =
{Total Site Area (for both pre and post development
conditions) - Protected Area}
Natural resource areas should be calculated based upon the
Township's own natural resource protection ordinance. If no
ordinance exists, see Table A-2 in Appendix A161 for guidance
to assess the total protected area. For additional reference, see
Chapter 5, Section 5.4.1, of the PA BMP manual.
(2) Calculate the volume controls provided through nonstructural
BMPs. Table A-5 in Appendix A162 is recommended as guidance.
(3) Volume controls provided through nonstructural BMPs should be
subtracted from the required volume to determine the necessary
structural BMPs.

(4) Calculate the volume controls provided through structural BMPs.
Table A-6 in Appendix A163 is recommended as guidance. See PA
BMP Manual, Chapter 6, for description of the BMPs.
(5) Infiltration BMPs intended to receive runoff from developed areas
shall be selected based on the suitability of soils and site conditions
(see Table A-6 in Appendix A164 for a list of infiltration BMPs).
Infiltration BMPs shall be constructed on soils that have the
following characteristics:
(a) A minimum soil depth of 24 inches between the bottom of the
infiltration BMPs and the top of bedrock or seasonally high
water table.
(b) An infiltration rate sufficient to accept the additional
stormwater load and dewater completely as determined by
field tests. A minimum of 0.2 inches/hour should be utilized and
for acceptable rates a safety factor of 50% should be applied
for design purposes (e.g., for soil which measured 0.4 inches
per hour, the BMP design should use 0.2 inches per hour to
insure safe infiltration rates after construction).
(c) All open-air infiltration facilities shall be designed to
completely infiltrate runoff volume within three days (72
hours) from the start of the design storm.
(d) All subsurface and contained facilities such as capture-andreuse
systems must have storage available equivalent to the
water volume control amount within three days (72 hours)
from the end of the design storm.
(e) Pretreatment (See Appendix D165) shall be provided prior to
infiltration.
(6) Soils. A soils evaluation of the project site shall be required to
determine the suitability of infiltration facilities. All regulated
activities are required to perform a detailed soils evaluation by a
qualified design professional which, at minimum, addresses soil
permeability, depth to bedrock, and subgrade stability. The general
process for designing the infiltration BMP shall be:
(a) Analyze hydrologic soil groups as well as natural and manmade
features within the site to determine general areas of
suitability for infiltration practices. In areas where
development on fill material is under consideration, conduct
geotechnical investigations of subgrade stability; infiltration
may not be ruled out without conducting these tests.

§ 206-15. Stormwater peak rate control and management districts.
(b) Provide field tests such as double ring infiltrometer or
hydraulic conductivity tests (at the level of the proposed
infiltration surface) to determine the appropriate hydraulic
conductivity rate. Percolation tests are not recommended for
design purposes.
(c) Design the infiltration structure based on field determined
capacity at the level of the proposed infiltration surface and
based on the safety factor of 50%.
(d) If on-lot infiltration structures are proposed, it must be
demonstrated to the Township that the soils are conducive to
infiltrate on the lots identified.
(e) An impermeable liner will be required in detention basins
where the possibility of groundwater contamination exists. A
detailed hydrogeologic investigation may be required by the
Township.
A. District boundaries. For the purposes of this chapter, the Township is
divided in stormwater management districts as listed in Table 206-15.1.
The boundaries of the stormwater management districts are shown on
official maps attached to and made part of this chapter, which shall be
designated Stormwater Management District Map. The exact location
of the stormwater management district boundaries as they apply to a
given development site shall be determined by mapping the boundaries
using the two-foot topographic contours (or most accurate data
required) provided as part of the SWM site plan.
B. General. Proposed conditions rates of runoff from any regulated activity
shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff from existing
conditions for the design storms specified on the Stormwater
Management District Watershed Map and in this section of this chapter.
C. Standards for managing runoff from each subarea in the watershed for
the two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year design
storms are shown in Table 206-15.1. Development sites located in each
of the management districts must control proposed development
conditions runoff rates to existing conditions runoff rates for the design
storms in accordance with Table 206-15.1 on the following page.

D. Sites located in more than one district. For a proposed development site
located within two or more stormwater management district category
subareas, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall meet the
management district criteria for the district in which the discharge is
located.
E. Off-site areas. When calculating the allowable peak runoff rates,
developers do not have to account for runoff draining into the subject
development site from an off-site area. On-site drainage facilities shall

§ 206-16. Nonstructural project design to minimize stormwater
impacts.
§ 206-17. Stream bank erosion requirements (channel protection).
be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development
site.
F. Site areas. The stormwater management site area is the only area
subject to the management district criteria. Nonimpacted areas or
nonregulated activities bypassing the stormwater management
facilities would not be subject to the management district criteria.
G. Alternate criteria for redevelopment sites. For redevelopment sites, one
of the following minimum design parameters shall be accomplished,
whichever is most appropriate for the given site conditions as
determined by the Township:
(1) Meet the full requirements specified by Table 206-15.1 and
§ 206-20; or
(2) Reduce the total impervious surface on the site by at least 20%
based upon a comparison of existing impervious surface to
proposed impervious surface.
A. The design of all regulated activities should include the following to
minimize stormwater impacts:
(1) The applicant should find practicable alternatives to the surface
discharge of stormwater, the creation of impervious surfaces, and
the degradation of waters of the commonwealth and must maintain
as much as possible the natural hydrologic regime of the site.
(2) An alternative is practicable if it is available and capable of
implementation after taking into consideration existing technology
and logistics in light of overall project purposes and other
municipal requirements.
(3) See Appendix G for a Nonstructural Project Design Checklist.166
A. If a perennial or intermittent stream passes through the site, the
applicant shall create a riparian buffer extending a minimum of 10 feet
to either side of the top-of-bank of the channel. The buffer area shall be
established and maintained in an undisturbed state. This buffer area
may be maintained as a meadow with minimal mowing of the grassed
area, or as a forested buffer, being planted with appropriate native
vegetation (refer to Appendix B of the BMP Manual for plant lists167). If
an existing buffer is legally prescribed (i.e., deed, covenant, easement,

§ 206-18. (Reserved)
§ 206-19. Calculation methodology.
etc.) and it exceeds the requirements of this chapter, the existing buffer
shall be maintained. This does not include lakes or wetlands.
B. Applicants shall adhere to the following stream bank erosion/channel
protection requirements:
(1) In addition to the control of water quality volume (in order to
minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on downstream stream
bank erosion), the primary requirement is to design a BMP to
detain the proposed conditions two-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event to the existing conditions one-year flow using the SCS Type II
distribution. Additionally, provisions shall be made (such as adding
a small orifice at the bottom of the outlet structure or a sand filter)
so that the proposed conditions one-year, twenty-four-hour storm
event takes a minimum of 24 hours to drain from the facility from a
point when the maximum volume of water from the one-year,
twenty-four-hour storm event is captured (i.e., the maximum water
surface elevation is achieved in the facility). Release of water can
begin at the start of the storm (i.e., the invert of the water volume
control orifice is at the invert of the facility).
(2) The minimum orifice size in the outlet structure to the BMP shall be
three inches in diameter, where possible, and a trash rack shall be
installed to prevent clogging. On sites with small drainage areas
contributing to this BMP that do not provide enough runoff volume
to allow a twenty-four-hour attenuation with the three-inch orifice,
the calculations shall be submitted showing this condition. Orifice
sizes less than three inches can be utilized, provided that the
design will prevent clogging of the intake. It is recommended that
the design, to accommodate maintenance, include a replaceables
and/or porous media filter cartridge.
A. The following criteria shall be used for runoff calculations:
(1) For development sites not considered redevelopment, the ground
cover used to determine the existing conditions runoff volume and
flow rate shall be as follows:
(a) Wooded sites shall use a ground cover of "woods in good
condition." A site is classified as wooded if a continuous canopy
of trees exists over 1/4 acre.
(b) The undeveloped portion of the site, including agriculture,
bare earth, and fallow ground, shall be considered as "meadow
in good condition," unless the natural ground cover generates
a lower curve number (CN) or Rational "c" value (i.e., woods)
as listed in Tables A-4 or A-7 in Appendix A.168
§ 206-17 MONTGOMERY CODE § 206-19
1:520
(2) For development and redevelopment sites, the ground cover used
to determine the existing conditions runoff volume and flow rate for
the developed portion of the site shall be based upon actual land
cover conditions. If the developed site contains impervious
surfaces, 20% of the impervious surface area shall be considered
meadow in the model for existing conditions.
B. Stormwater runoff peak discharges from all development sites with a
drainage area equal to or greater than two acres shall be calculated
using a generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the

political subdivisions within which a person may be employed.
§ 209-6. Exemption; refunds.
A. Exemption. Any person whose total earned income and net profits from
all sources within the political subdivision is less than $12,000 for any
calendar year in which the tax is levied is exempt from the payment of
the tax for that calendar year. In addition, the following persons are
exempt from payment of the tax:
(1) Any person who has served in any war or armed conflict in which

released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a
result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double
or quadruple amputee or has a service-connected disability
declared by the United States Veterans' Administration or its
successor to be a total one-hundred-percent disability.

component of the armed forces" shall mean the United States Army
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps

B. Procedure to claim exemption.
(1) A person seeking to claim an exemption from the local services tax
may annually file an exemption certificate with the political
subdivision and with the person's employer affirming that the
person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits
from all sources within the political subdivision of less than
$12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is
filed. In the event the political subdivision utilizes a tax collection
officer, it shall provide a copy of the exemption certificate to that
officer. The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of
all the employee's last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the fiscal year
for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the tax.
Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise
instructed by the political subdivision or except as required by
Subsection B(2), the employer shall not withhold the tax from the
person during the calendar year or the remainder of the calendar
§ 209-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-6
1:549
year for which the exemption certificate applies. Employers shall
ensure that the exemption certificate forms are readily available to
employees at all times and shall furnish each new employee with a
form at the time of hiring. The exemption certificate form shall be
the uniform form provided by the political subdivision.
(2) With respect to a person who claimed an exemption for a given
calendar year from the tax, upon notification to an employer by the
person or by the political subdivision that the person has received
earned income and net profits from all sources within the political
subdivision equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or
that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that
calendar year, or upon an employer's payment to the person of
earned income within the municipality in an amount equal to or in
excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold
the local services tax from the person under Subsection B(3).
(3) If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year
from the tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year under
Subsection B(2), the employer shall withhold the tax for the
remainder of that calendar year. The employer shall withhold from
the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the
notification under Subsection B(2), a lump sum equal to the amount
of tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption
claimed by the person under this subsection, plus the per-payroll
amount due for that first payroll period. The amount of tax withheld
per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that
calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other
employees. In the event the employment of a person subject to
withholding of the tax under this clause is subsequently severed in
that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding
balance of tax due, and the political subdivision may pursue
collection under this article.
(4) Except as provided in Subsection B(2), it is the intent of this
Subsection B that employers shall not be responsible for
investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption
eligibility or exempting any employee from the local services tax.
C. Refunds. Montgomery Township, in consultation with the Collector and
DCED, shall establish procedures for the processing of refund claims
for any tax paid by any person who is eligible for exemption, which
procedures shall be in accord with provisions of the General Municipal
Law relating to refunds of overpayments and interest on overpayments.
Refunds made within 75 days of a refund request or 75 days after the
last day the employer is required to remit the tax for the last quarter of
the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. No
refunds shall be made for amounts overpaid in a calendar year that do
not exceed $1. The Township of Montgomery or the Collector shall
determine eligibility for exemption and provide refunds to exempt
persons.
§ 209-6 MONTGOMERY CODE § 209-7
1:550
§ 209-7. Duty of employers to collect.
A. Each employer within the political subdivision, as well as those
employers situated outside the political subdivision but who engage in
business within the political subdivision, is hereby charged with the
duty of collecting the tax from each of his employees engaged by him or
performing for him within the political subdivision and making a return
and payment thereof to the Collector. Further, each employer is hereby
authorized to deduct this tax for each employee in his or her employ,
whether said employee is paid by salary, wage or commission and
whether or not all such services are performed within the political
subdivision.
B. A person subject to the tax shall be assessed by the employer a pro rata
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging
in an occupation. The pro rata share of the tax assessed on the person
for a payroll period shall be determined by dividing the rate of the tax
levied for the calendar year by the number of payroll periods
established by the employer for the calendar year. For purposes of
determining the pro rata share, an employer shall round down the
amount of the tax collected each payroll period to the nearest 1/100 of a
dollar. Collection of the tax shall be made on a payroll period basis for
each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation,
except as provided in Subsection D of this section. For purposes of this
subsection, "combined rate" shall mean the aggregate annual rate of
the tax levied by the school district and the municipality.
C. No person shall be subject to the payment of the local services tax by
more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.
D. In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from
withholding the tax if the employee provides a recent pay statement
from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the
length of the payroll period and the amount of the tax withheld and a
statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the
employee's principal employer and the employee will notify other
employers of a change in principal place of employment within two
weeks of its occurrence. The employee's statement shall be provided on
the form approved by DCED.
E. The tax shall be no more than $52 on each person for each calendar
year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which a
person may be employed. The political subdivision shall provide a
taxpayer a receipt of payment upon request by the taxpayer.
F. No employer shall be held liable for failure to withhold the tax or for the
payment of the withheld tax money to the political subdivision if the
failure to withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by
the employee as to the employee's place or places of employment, the
employee's principal office or where the employee is principally
employed. Further, an employer shall not be liable for payment of the
§ 209-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-7
1:551
§ 209-8. Returns.
Each employer shall prepare and file a return showing a computation of the
tax on forms to be supplied to the employer by the Collector. If an employer
fails to file the return and pay the tax, whether or not the employer makes
collection thereof from the salary, wages or commissions paid by him or her
to an employee, except as provided hereafter in this article, the employer
shall be responsible for the payment of the tax in full as though the tax had
been originally levied against the employer.
§ 209-9. Dates for determining tax liability and payment.
Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the
first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number
of employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the
Collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year. Supplemental
reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January
31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records
from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December
31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30,
October 30 and January 31, respectively.
§ 209-10. Self-employed individuals.
Each self-employed individual who has earned income or realizes net profit,
as those terms are defined herein, within the political subdivision shall be
required to comply with this article and pay the tax due to the Collector on
or before the 30th day following the end of each quarter.
§ 209-11. Individuals engaged in more than one occupation or
employed in more than one political subdivision.
The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day
the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period. In the
event a person is engaged in more than one occupation, that is, concurrent
employment, or an occupation which requires the person working in more
than one political subdivision during a payroll period, the priority of claim
to collect the local services tax shall be in the following order:
local services tax in an amount exceeding the amount withheld by the
employer if the employer complies with the provisions of Subsection
B of § 209-6 of this article and this section and remits the amount so
withheld in accordance with this article.
G. Employers shall be required to remit the local services taxes 30 days
after the end of each quarter of a calendar year.
A. First, the political subdivision in which a person maintains his or her
principal office or is principally employed;
§ 209-7 MONTGOMERY CODE § 209-11
1:552
§ 209-12. Nonresidents subject to tax.
All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their places
of business outside of the political subdivision but who perform services
of any type or kind or engage in any occupation or profession within the
political subdivision do, by virtue thereof, agree to be bound by and subject
themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under
this article with the same force and effect as though they were residents of
the political subdivision. Further, any individual engaged in an occupation
within the political subdivision and an employee of a nonresidential
employer may, for the purpose of this article, be considered a self-employed
person, and in the event his or her tax is not paid, the political subdivision
shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee
for the collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.
§ 209-13. Administration of tax.
B. Second, the political subdivision in which the person resides and works
if the tax is levied by that political subdivision;
C. Third, the political subdivision in which a person is employed and which
imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person's home. In case of
dispute, a tax receipt of the taxing authority for that calendar year
declaring that the taxpayer has made prior payment constitutes prima
facie certification of payment to all other political subdivisions.
A. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and receive payments of
this tax and keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him
from each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the
tax was received. It shall be the duty of the Collector to accept and keep
a record of the information submitted by employers relating to the
number of employees subject to the tax, the number of employees
exempt from the tax, the employee exemption certificates and refunds
of the tax paid to individuals and employers.
B. The Collector is hereby charged with the administration and
enforcement of this article and is hereby charged and empowered,
subject to municipal approval, to proscribe, adopt and promulgate rules
and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration
and enforcement of this article, including provisions for the
examination of payroll records of any employer subject to this article,
the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with
this article and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to
which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred. Any person
aggrieved by any decision of the Collector shall have the right to appeal
to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County after exhausting
any administrative remedies, as in other cases provided.
C. The Collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll
records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return
made by an employer or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax
§ 209-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-13

§ 209-14. Suits for collection.
§ 209-15. Violations and penalties.
Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by
this article, or whoever refuses inspection of the books, records or accounts
in his or her custody and control setting forth the number of employees
subject to this tax who are in his or her employment, or whoever fails or
refuses to file any return required by this article shall be guilty of a violation
and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine of not more
than $600 and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such
fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days. The action to
enforce the penalty herein prescribed may be instituted against any person
in charge of the business of any employer who shall have failed or who
refuses to file a return required by this article.
§ 209-15.1. Interpretation.
due. Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the
Collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.
A. In the event that any tax under this article remains due or unpaid 30
days after the due dates above set forth, the Collector may sue for the
recovery of any such tax due or unpaid under this article, together with
interest and penalty.
B. If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6%
on the amount of such tax shall be calculated beginning with the due
date of the tax, and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of
such tax for nonpayment thereof. Where suit is brought for the recovery
of this tax or other appropriate remedy undertaken, the individual liable
therefor shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of
collection.
A. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to empower the
political subdivision to levy and collect the tax hereby imposed on any
occupation not within the taxing power of the political subdivision
under the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
B. If the tax hereby imposed under the provisions of this article shall be
held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be in violation of the
Constitution of the United States or of the laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as to any individual, the decision of the court shall not
affect or impair the right to impose or collect said tax or the validity of
the tax so imposed on other persons or individuals as herein provided.

transacted by him during the months while he was in business prior
to the tax year.
(3) Every person subject to the payment of the tax hereby imposed who
commences business subsequent to January 1 of the tax year shall
compute the gross volume of business by multiplying the actual
gross volume of business transacted by him during the first month
of his engaging in business by the number of months remaining in
the tax year.

engages in business which is temporary, seasonal or itinerant by its
nature, except for any person licensed to engage in a temporary
retail business under Ordinance No. 83, as amended,185 shall

return in the same calendar year in which the final return in question is
being filed. In the event that the tax was less than the amount finally
determined to be owed in the final return, the taxpayer shall be liable to
pay said tax upon the filing of the final return. In the event that the
amount paid at the time of the filing of the estimated return is less than

commenced business less than one full year prior to the beginning of

the amount of the tax paid at the time of making the estimated return
on the estimated computation and the amount of the tax finally shown
to be due. If the balance shall be a credit, the amount of the credit shall
be applied towards the current year's estimated tax. [Amended

a return, then in such case the Tax Administrator or his duly appointed
deputies shall assess said person or persons on such an amount of
whole or gross volume of business as said Tax Administrator or his
deputies deem reasonable and appropriate. In all cases of such
assessment, the Tax Administrator or his duly appointed deputies shall
give the parties assessed a notice in which shall be stated the trade,
business, occupation or class and the amount of the mercantile tax
imposed or levied.
D. The taxpayer shall maintain such records and books of account as will
enable him to make a true and accurate return in accordance with the
provisions of this article. Such accounts and records must disclose in
detail the gross receipts and other data pertaining to the taxpayer's
gross volume of business and must be sufficiently complete to enable
the Tax Administrator or his deputies to verify all transactions. The Tax
Administrator or his deputies are hereby authorized to examine the
books, papers and records of any person or persons subject to or
supposed to be subject to the tax imposed by this article in order to
verify the accuracy of the return made or, if no return was made,
ascertain the tax due.
E. The burden is hereby imposed upon any person, firm or corporation

provided by law.
H. If the final return of the taxpayer shows an overpayment of the tax by
reason of the fact that the taxpayer did not continue to engage in
business throughout the year, the Tax Administrator shall refund to the
taxpayer the amount of such overpayment, without interest, which shall
be the difference between the amount of tax paid upon the filing of the
first return and the amount of the tax finally shown to be due.
A. All taxes due and unpaid under this article shall be recoverable by the
Township Solicitor as other debts due the Township are now by law
recoverable.

political subdivision which impose such tax on the same person or

§ 209-45 MONTGOMERY CODE § 209-46

imposed by this article. The exemption of such governmental bodies shall
not, however, relieve any other party to a transaction from liability for the
tax.
§ 209-47. Excluded transactions.
A. The tax imposed by § 209-45 shall not be imposed upon:
(1) A transfer to the commonwealth or to any of its instrumentalities,
agencies or political subdivisions by gift, dedication or deed in lieu
of condemnation or deed or confirmation in connection with
condemnation proceedings or a reconveyance by the condemning
body of the property condemned to the owner of record at the time

year from the date of condemnation.

the Constitution or statutes of the United States.

pursuant to acquisition by the municipality, Township, school
district or county of a tax delinquent property at a Sheriff's sale or
Tax Claim Bureau sale.
(4) A transfer for no or nominal actual consideration which corrects or
confirms a transfer previously recorded but which does not extend
or limit existing record legal title or interest.
(5) A transfer or division in kind for no or nominal actual consideration
of property passed by testate or intestate succession and held by
cotenants; however, if any of the parties take shares greater in
value than their undivided interest, tax is due on the excess.
(6) A transfer between husband and wife, between persons who were
previously husband and wife who have since been divorced,
provided that the property or interest therein subject to such
transfer was acquired by the husband and wife or husband or wife
prior to the granting of the final decree in divorce, between parent
and child or the spouse of such child, between brother or sister or
spouse of a brother or sister and brother or sister or the spouse of a
brother or sister, and between a grandparent and grandchild or the
spouse of such grandchild, except that a subsequent transfer by the
grantee within one year shall be subject to tax as if the grantor

§ 209-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-47
1:577
exempt if the transfer was made directly from the grantor to all
of the possible beneficiaries, whether or not such beneficiaries
are contingent or specifically named. No such exemption shall be

would be imposed under this article. Where the document by which
title is acquired by a grantee or statement of value fails to set forth
that the property was acquired by the grantee from or for the
benefit of his principal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the
property is the property of the grantee in his individual capacity if
the grantee claims an exemption from taxation under this clause.
(12) A transfer made pursuant to the statutory merger or consolidation
of a corporation or statutory division of a nonprofit corporation,
except where the Department reasonably determines that the
primary intent for such merger, consolidation or division is
avoidance of the tax imposed by this article.

record in the name of the corporation or association where the
grantee owns stock of the corporation or an interest in the

purpose of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding,
processing, publishing, research and development,

pollution control, warehousing or agriculture; and

between associations or corporations and the members, partners,
shareholders or stockholders thereof are fully taxable. For the purposes of
this article, corporations and associations are entities separate from their
members, partners, stockholders or shareholders.
§ 209-49. Acquired company.
(b) The agency or authority has the full ownership interest in the
real estate transferred.
(16) A transfer by a mortgagor to the holder of a bona fide mortgage in
default in lieu of a foreclosure or a transfer pursuant to a judicial
sale in which the successful bidder is the bona fide holder of a
mortgage, unless the holder assigns the bid to another person.
(17) Any transfer between religious organizations or other bodies or
persons holding title for a religious organization if such real estate
is not being or has not been used by such transferor for commercial
purposes.
(18) A transfer to a conservancy which possesses a tax-exempt status
pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954

interest in a real estate company or family farm corporation.

minerals and assignments thereof.

Earned Income and Net Profits Tax
[Adopted 11-11-2002 by Ord. No. 02-162]
§ 209-77. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ASSOCIATION  A partnership, limited partnership, or any other
unincorporated group of two or more persons.
BUSINESS  An enterprise, activity, profession or any other undertaking of
an unincorporated nature conducted for profit, or ordinarily conducted for

CURRENT YEAR  The calendar year for which the tax is levied.
DOMICILE  The place where one lives and has his permanent home, and
to which he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent. Actual

transitory. Domicile is the voluntary fixed place of habitation of a person,
not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of
making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt
some other permanent home. In the case of businesses, or associations, the
domicile is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the
place where its functions are discharged.
EARNED INCOME  Salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive
payments, fees, tips and other compensation received by a person or his
personal representative for services rendered, whether directly or through
an agent, and whether in cash or property; not including, however, wages or
compensation paid to persons on active military service, periodic payments
for sickness and disability other than regular wages received during a
period of sickness, disability or retirement, or payments arising under
Workmen's Compensation Acts, Occupational Disease Acts and similar
legislation, or payments commonly recognized as old age benefits,
retirement pay or pensions paid to persons retired from service after
reaching a specific age or after a stated period of employment,
compensation payments by any governmental agency, or payments to
reimburse expenses, or payments made by employers, or labor unions
for wage and salary supplemental programs, including, but not limited
to, programs covering hospitalization, sickness, disability or death,
supplemental unemployment benefits, strike benefits, social security and
retirements.
§ 209-77 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 209-77

agency designated by governing body to collect and administer the tax on
earned income and net profits.
NET PROFITS  The net income from the operation of a business,
profession, or other activity, except corporations, after provision for all
costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on
a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the accounting system used in
such business, profession, or other activity, but without deduction of taxes
based on income.

§ 230-10. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,214 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Montgomery Township does hereby order
in the FP Floodplain Conservation District the following regulation shall
apply.
§ 230-11. General provisions.
A. Intent. In addition to the purpose stated in Article I, § 230-2, of the
Montgomery Township Zoning Ordinance, the specific intent of this
article shall be to protect areas of floodplain subject to and necessary
for the containment of floodwaters. Furthermore, in light of the
Township's certification as eligible for federal flood insurance, it is the
intent of this article to provide adequate protection for flood-prone
properties within Montgomery Township. In advancing these principles
and the general purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and the adopted
Township Comprehensive Plan, the following shall be the specific
objectives in the FP Floodplain Conservation District:
(1) Protect areas of the floodplain necessary to contain floodwaters.
(2) To permit only those uses in the floodplain that are compatible with
preserving natural conditions and stream flow.
(3) To combine with present zoning requirements certain restrictions
made necessary for flood-prone areas to promote the general
health, welfare and safety of the Township.
(4) Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
(5) To minimize danger to public health by protecting the quality and
quantity of surface and subsurface water supplies adjacent to and
underlying flood hazard areas and promoting safe and sanitary
drainage.
(6) Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its
governmental units, and its residents by preventing excessive
development in areas subject to flooding.
214. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 230-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-11
1:723
(7) Comply with federal and state floodplain management
requirements.
(8) To prevent the erection of structures in areas unfit for human usage
by reason of danger from flooding, unsanitary conditions or other
hazards.
(9) To provide retention areas for the temporary storage of
floodwaters.
(10) To permit only those uses which can be appropriately located in the
floodplain, as herein defined, and which will not impede the flow or
storage of floodwaters or otherwise cause danger to life and
property at, above or below their locations along the floodplain.
(11) To provide sufficient drainage courses to carry abnormal flows of
stormwater in periods of heavy precipitation.
(12) To protect those individuals who, despite the flood dangers,
develop or occupy land on a floodplain resulting from a use which is
nonconforming by virtue of this article.
(13) To protect adjacent landowners and those both upstream and
downstream from damages resulting from development within a
floodplain and the consequent obstruction or increase in flow of
floodwaters.
(14) To protect the entire Township from individual uses of land which
may have an effect upon subsequent expenditures for public works
and disaster relief and adversely affect the economic well-being of
the Township.
(15) To protect other municipalities within the same watershed from the
impact of improper development and the consequent increased
potential for flooding.
(16) To provide areas for the deposition of flood-borne sediment.
(17) To require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities,
be constructed so as to be protected from damage in accordance
with the requirements of the Federal Flood Insurance Program, P.L.
90-448, and the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act, P.L.
851, No. 166 of 1978, and as either is amended.215
B. Abrogation and greater restriction. This article supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in the Floodplain
Conservation District. However, any other ordinance provisions shall
remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are
more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of
this article, the more restrictive shall apply.
215. Editor's Note: See 32 P.S. § 679.101 et seq.
§ 230-11 MONTGOMERY CODE § 230-11
1:724
§ 230-12. Identification of floodplain areas.
C. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this article shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the article, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose the provisions of this article are hereby declared to be
severable.
D. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
(1) The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is
based on acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods
may occur or flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by
debris. This article does not imply that areas outside the Floodplain
Conservation District, or that land uses permitted within such
areas, will be free from flooding or flood damages.
(2) This article shall not create liability on the part of Montgomery
Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this article or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. District established. The Floodplain Conservation District is defined
and established as follows:
(1) The Floodplain Conservation District is defined and established as
a district applicable to those areas of Montgomery Township
classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) dated March 2, 2016, (and all subsequent
revisions and amendments), and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2, 2016 (and all
subsequent revisions and amendments), and issued by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most recent
revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part of the
Flood Insurance Study. Said floodplains shall be comprised of the
following specific areas:
(a) The Floodway Area/District shall be those areas identified as
floodway on the FIRM as well as those floodway areas which
have been identified in other available studies or sources of
information for those special floodplain areas where no
floodway has been identified in the FIS. The floodway
represents the channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface
elevation by more than one foot at any point.
§ 230-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-12
1:725
[1] Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed,
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(b) The AE Area/District shall be those areas identified as an AE
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for
which base flood elevations have been provided.
[1] The AE Area adjacent to the floodway shall be those areas
identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS
prepared by FEMA for which base flood elevations have
been provided and a floodway has been delineated.
(c) Community-identified flood hazard areas shall be those areas
where Montgomery Township has identified local flood hazard
or ponding areas, as delineated and adopted on a "Local Flood
Hazard Map" using best available topographic data and locally
derived information such as flood of record, historic high water
marks, soils or approximate study methodologies.
(d) The A Area/District shall be the areas identified as an A Zone
on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one-percent-annual-chance flood elevations have
been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other federal, state, or other acceptable
source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available, the elevation shall be determined
by using the elevation of a point on the boundary of the
Floodplain Conservation District which is nearest the
construction site.
(e) In lieu of the above, Montgomery Township may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or
others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that
the technical methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses, computations,
etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the municipality.
(f) (Reserved)
§ 230-12 MONTGOMERY CODE § 230-12
1:726
(g) Alluvial soils.
[1] Soils with a frequency of flooding of 1% or greater per
year, as delineated by the Natural Resources Conservation
Service, United States Department of Agriculture Web-
Based Soil Survey (available online at
http://websoilsurvey.nrcs.usda.gov/), including, but not
limited to, the following soils:
[a] Bowmansville (Bo).
[b] Knauers (Bo).
[c] Rowland (Rt).
[2] Any party wishing to develop in such areas shall supply
engineering studies to the Township sufficient so that the
Township Engineer may determine if said area(s) are to be
considered as a one-hundred-year floodplain. If said
area(s) is not part of the area proposed for building, the
Township may not require such studies at the advice of the
Township Engineer, but the Township shall require said
soil areas to be appropriately identified on all subdivision,
development or building plans to be submitted to the
Township.
(2) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be delineated on the
Floodplain Overlay Map of Montgomery Township, which is hereby
made a part of this chapter and is available for inspection at the
Township office. Whenever there is a difference between said map
and the data contained in the sources described in § 230-11A(1) of
this section, the data contained in said sources shall determine the
boundary of the district.
(3) Studies used to establish the floodplain boundaries shall be
available in the Township Building for reference.
(4) Use of information. The Township Code Enforcement Officer shall
obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state or other source as
criteria for requiring that all new construction, substantial
improvements or other developments in Zone A shown on the
FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps adhere to the requirements
under the NFIP § 60.3(c)(2), (3), (5) and (6) and § 60.3(d)(3).
(5) The Floodplain Conservation District shall be deemed an overlay on
any zoning district now of hereafter applicable to any lot.
(6) It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business or
corporation to undertake, or cause to be undertaken, any
construction or development anywhere within Montgomery
§ 230-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-12
1:727
Township unless a permit has been obtained from the Floodplain
Administrator.
(7) A permit shall not be required for minor repairs to existing
buildings or structures.
B. Changes in the FP Floodplain Conservation District Area. The
Floodplain Conservation District may be revised or modified by the
Board where studies or information provided by a qualified agency or
person documents the need for such revision. However, prior to any
such change, approval must be obtained from FEMA. Additionally, as
soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the date such
information becomes available, a community shall notify FEMA of the
changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
C. Boundary disputes: appeals procedure.
(1) In case of any dispute concerning the boundaries of a Floodplain
Conservation District, initial determination shall be made by the
Township Code Enforcement Officer, who shall seek the advice of
the Township Engineer as necessary in making said determination.
(2) Any party aggrieved by the decision of the Code Enforcement
Officer as to the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation
District, as defined above, which may include the grounds that said
map referred to therein is or has become incorrect because of
changes due to natural or other causes or changes indicated by
future detailed hydrologic and hydraulic studies, may appeal to the
Zoning Hearing Board as provided in Article XXIII, §§ 230-182 to
230-185 of this chapter. The burden of proof in such an appeal shall
be on the applicant.
(3) Whether a proposed use is within the Floodplain Conservation
District shown on the Floodplain Overlay Map shall, upon appeal
from the decision of the Code Enforcement Officer, be determined
by the Zoning Hearing Board upon receipt of the findings of the
detailed on-site survey by the petitioner. The Zoning Hearing
Board, in addition to other evidence and standards, shall request
the review and recommendations of the Township Planning
Commission and other Township agencies or officials at least 45
days before the public hearing.
(4) The Zoning Hearing Board may request the review and
recommendations of the following agencies, on a case-by-case
basis, to be determined by a consultation with the Code
Enforcement Officer and the appropriate agency or individual: the
United States Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District; the
Soil Conservation Service; the Township Engineer; the
Montgomery County Planning Commission; the Neshaminy or
Wissahickon Watershed Associations; and other technical agencies
as necessary. Such request shall be made 45 days prior to the
public hearing.

1:728
§ 230-13. Use regulations.
(5) All changes to the boundaries of the Floodplain Conservation
District are subject to the review and approval of the Federal
Insurance Administrator.
D. Overlay concept. The Floodplain Conservation District shall be deemed
an overlay on any zoning district now or hereafter applicable to any lot.
(1) Should the Floodplain Conservation District be declared
inapplicable to any tract by reason or action of the Township Board
of Supervisors in amending this article; or the Code Enforcement
Officer, the Zoning Hearing Board or any court of competent
jurisdiction in interpreting the same; or the Zoning Hearing Board
or any court of competent jurisdiction in determining a legal effect
of the same, the zoning applicable to such lot shall be deemed to be
the district in which it is located without consideration of this
article.
(2) Should the zoning of any parcel or any part thereof in which the
Floodplain Conservation District is located be changed through any
legislative or administrative actions or judicial discretion, such
change shall have no effect on the Floodplain Conservation District
unless such change was included as part of the original application.
(3) Where this article does not define the boundaries of the floodplain
as defined in § 230-12 herein, the minimum setback from any
watercourse for a structure shall be equal to the horizontal
distance from the top of the bank of the watercourse extended to a
point at which the elevation is one foot above the elevation of the
top of the bank, as verified by the Township Engineer, or 50 feet,
whichever is greater. All such changes to the boundaries of the
Floodplain Conservation District are subject to the review and
approval of the Federal Insurance Administrator.
E. Corporate boundary changes. Prior to development occurring in areas
where annexation or other corporate boundary changes are proposed
or have occurred, the community shall review flood hazard data
affecting the lands subject to boundary changes. The community shall
adopt and enforce floodplain regulations in areas subject to annexation
or corporate boundary changes which meet or exceed those in 44 CFR
60.3.
A. Permitted uses. The following uses and no other will be permitted in a
Floodplain Conservation District. All such uses shall be subject to the
floodproofing requirements as stipulated in this article, as well as the
Township Building Code and Subdivision and Land Development
Ordinance, both as amended.216

§ 230-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-14
1:737
D. Standards for granting special exceptions and variances.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board shall exercise discretion in allowing
only those uses which are substantially in accord with the stated
provisions in § 230-11 herein. The Zoning Hearing Board, in
considering special exceptions or variance applications, shall
consider the following:
(a) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical
conditions peculiar to the particular property and that the
unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions and not the
circumstances or conditions generally created by the
provisions of the zoning ordinance in the neighborhood or
district in which the property is located.
(b) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions,
there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of the zoning ordinance
and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary
to enable the reasonable use of the property.
(c) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.
(d) That the variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or
development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(e) The effect of the use shall not alter the carrying capacity of the
stream and floodplains at the location of the proposed use.
(f) Lands abutting the waterway, both upstream and downstream,
shall not be adversely affected by the proposed use.
(g) The general welfare or public interest of Montgomery
Township or of other municipalities in the same watershed
shall not be adversely affected, nor create nuisances, causer
fraud on, or victimize the public, or conflict with any other
applicable state or local ordinances or regulations.
(h) Any new or substantially improved structures permitted by
special exception or by variance shall be constructed and
placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of water and shall be designed to have no effect upon the
flow and height of floodwater on other properties. Such
structures shall be elevated in accordance with the provisions
contained in the Montgomery Township Building Code, as
amended.
§ 230-14 MONTGOMERY CODE § 230-14
1:738
(i) Any new or substantially improved structure permitted as a
special exception or by variance shall be floodproofed in
accordance with the provisions contained in the Montgomery
Township Building Code, as amended.
(2) All new or substantially improved structures shall be firmly
anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
(a) All such structures shall be constructed so as to prevent the
entrance of floodwaters into the water supply and waste
treatment systems as well as other utility systems. In addition,
waste treatment systems shall be designed to minimize or
eliminate discharges from such systems into the floodwaters.
(b) In all such structures, there shall be provision in all fully
enclosed areas below the base flood elevation of a minimum of
two openings having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens,
louvers or other coverings or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
(c) In all such structures, the electrical, heating, ventilation,
plumbing and air-conditioning equipment and other service
facilities shall be designed and located so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding.
(3) Any additions to existing structures permitted as a special
exception or by a variance shall be elevated to the greatest extent
possible according to the provisions contained in the Montgomery
Township Building Code, as amended.
(4) An affirmative decision shall not be issued by the Zoning Hearing
Board for an application within the designated floodway if any
increase in the flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.
(6) In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
(a) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(b) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
(c) Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all
decisions as required in this section.
§ 230-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-14
1:739
§ 230-15. Technical provisions.
(7) The Zoning Hearing Board shall maintain a complete record of all
variance requests and decisions affecting the Floodplain
Conservation District, including the written justification of the
reason for the issuance of any special exception or variance, and
report such decisions in the Township's biennial report submitted
to the Federal Insurance Administration and FEMA.
E. Additional standards for granting variances. A property owner of a lot
of record, as of the date of the enactment of this article, who is able to
prove that the strict enforcement of this article would create undue
hardship by denying a reasonable use of an existing lot which is
situated either wholly or partially in the Floodplain Conservation
District may seek relief by applying for a variance from the Zoning
Hearing Board.
(1) The Zoning Hearing Board, after deciding upon the merits of the
application, may permit the applicant to make some reasonable use
of the property in question, while ensuring that such use will not
violate the basic objectives of this article as specified in § 230-11
herein.
(2) In considering a use as a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall
consider those standards outlined in § 230-14 herein.
(3) Requests for variances shall be considered by the Zoning Hearing
Board in accordance with the following:
(a) Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Zoning
Hearing Board upon a determination that failure to grant the
appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant
and a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety or extraordinary public expense or create nuisances,
cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
(b) Affirmative decisions shall only be issued upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to provide relief.
A. General. In granting any variance, Montgomery Township Zoning
Hearing Board shall attach the following technical provisions to the
proposal for which the variance has been granted. These conditions and
safeguards are necessary in order to protect the public health, safety,
and welfare of the residents of the municipality.

hazard or nuisance, such as excessive noise, vibration, smoke, toxic
matter, radiation, heat, odor or glare, as defined by the governing body
and all appropriate ordinances.
F. The location of all mobile home parks shall be protected by screening or
other appropriate means against any undesirable off-site views or any
adverse influence (such as heavy commercial or industrial use, heavy
traffic or brightly lighted activities) from adjoining streets and areas.
G. Mobile home parks shall not be located directly abutting conventionally
built single-family detached housing of significantly different unit value
and density than the proposed mobile homes except where extensive
natural buffering exists and will be retained or can be created so as to
functionally and visually separate the two sites or where compatible
units of modular or conventionally built homes will be located in the
mobile home park adjacent to the existing residences. The developer
shall provide any necessary transition between differing residential
structural types, unit values and densities within the mobile home park
tract.
H. Any site proposed for a mobile home park shall, in the opinion of the
governing body, be easily accessible to essential community facilities
and services, such as employment centers, shopping centers, schools
and police and fire protection, and shall be within one mile by roads or
pedestrian walkway to existing or planned convenience commercial
facilities. The site should also preferably be within the same one mile
distance of existing or planned public transit routes (if available).
I. Every area to be used as a mobile home park must be served exclusively
by the municipal sanitary waste disposal system and a centralized
water supply system, if those facilities are available and if each system
is found to contain the available capacity to serve the proposed park or,
alternatively, the area to be used as a mobile home park must, if it
cannot connect to either or both the centralized water supply and
municipal sanitary sewer systems, be served by a common single water
supply system serving all dwelling units and other structures in the
park and/or a common single sanitary sewer system doing likewise,
either or both of which, as applicable, must have the approval of the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources. Furthermore,
those on-site facilities must, when constructed, meet the following
criteria:
§ 230-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-57
1:793
(1) The satellite system shall be designed and constructed in a manner
that will permit adequate connection to the centralized or public
system in the future.
(2) The administrative structure for the satellite system shall be
organized in a manner that will facilitate easy interconnection of
the two systems.
(3) The developer shall be required to show proof that the satellite
system intending to serve the proposed park will not interfere with
any existing sewage disposal system or any existing water supplies,
be they wells for nearby properties or sources of water for other
community systems.
(4) When the centralized or public system reaches the park site,
connection to it shall be mandatory, and the cost of the eventual
interconnection shall be borne by the developer or the organization
that is set up to own and operate the satellite system.
(5) If, after development occurs, the satellite water system is deemed
to be the cause of interference with existing water supplies or the
satellite sewer system is deemed to be the cause of any pollution,
extension of the centralized or public systems may be required at
that time. The cost of the extension and hookup shall be borne by
the developer or organization owning and operating the satellite
system.
J. Any tract intended for a mobile home park must have direct access to
the feeder-type road (or a road of a higher classification), as defined by
the Township Comprehensive Plan or Ultimate Right-Of-Way Ordinance,
which the Township governing body deems capable of accommodating
the transport of mobile home units, upon recommendation of the
Township Engineer. Plans evidencing provisions for safe and efficient
ingress and egress to and from the public streets and highways
servicing the mobile home park, without causing undue confusion or
interference with the normal traffic flow, shall be submitted to the
Township governing body and must be approved by the Township
Engineer, who shall make the determinations based on the adequacy of
the thoroughfare to carry the additional traffic generated by the mobile
home park.
K. The applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the municipal
governing body that he has complied with or will comply with all
requirements of Chapter 179 of Title 25, Part I, Subpart D, Article II, of
the Rules and Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources, and with all other pertinent regulations of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania which are applicable to mobile
home parks.

are encouraged to utilize the minimum setbacks specified in Subsection
F above and to be placed off-center on the lots so as to provide a large
usuable open yard space and outdoor living area in one section of the
lot.
H. Distance between structures and mobile homes. Mobile homes shall be
separated from each other and from other buildings and their
structures, other than accessory structures, at their closest points by a
minimum of 20 feet.
I. Setback from front and rear lot lines. Where any two mobile homes are

§ 230-67. Optional area, width and yard regulations.
In order to promote added flexibility of design and to encourage

J. Impervious surface ratio. [Added 7-23-2007 by Ord. No. 07-219Z]
(1) The maximum impervious surface ratio permitted on a lot used for
a single-family detached dwelling or agriculture shall be 40%.
A. As a requirement of using these standards, a developer shall dedicate a
minimum of 10% of the gross acreage of the tract to the municipality.
The actual location of the donated land shall be negotiated to
coordinate with the existing Township lands and with other potential
lands so that an integrated and cohesive system of park lands may be
evolved.
(1) Criteria for land to be dedicated. The Board of Supervisors, upon
the recommendation of the Park and Recreation Board, shall
determine if the land is acceptable for dedication based on the
following and any other relevant criteria.
(a) Access. The dedicated land must be readily accessible to all
residents. This should be by virtue of at least one side of the
site abutting a public street for a minimum distance of 50 feet.
If public easements are the sole access, they shall be wide
enough to accommodate two-way traffic of maintenance
equipment.
(b) Location. The dedicated land shall be located, to the extent
possible, so that it equally serves all residents of the
development.
(c) Shape. The shape shall be suitable to accommodate those park
and open-space activities appropriate to the location and needs
of the residents. The exact shape is variable. An example of an
unacceptable piece of land is one that is 30 feet wide and 1,500
feet long, unless it is to be developed as a bike route or as a
connecting trail to other facilities.
§ 230-66 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-67
1:801
(d) Soils. Soils should be suitable for the intended park and open
space uses.
(e) Unity. It is desirable for the dedicated land to be in well placed,
adequately sized areas so that it can accommodate anticipated
uses, rather than to have numerous useless smaller pieces.
(f) Utilities. The major piece(s) of dedicated land are to be
accessible to, but none crossed on or above the surface of, a
public street(s), telephone, power, fuel, water and sewer lines,
etc. If any of these facilities are placed underground, no part of
them or their supportive equipment shall protrude above
ground level.
(g) Slopes and floodplains. Steep slopes and floodplains shall not
make up more than 40% of the dedicated land. A minimum of
60% of the land must be relatively flat dry ground, not
exceeding the average percent of slope of the tract and
suitable to the intended purposes. Yards, setbacks, retention
basins and detention basins and other open stormwater
facilities and other open areas required by zoning and other
regulations are not to be included as part of the acreage to be
dedicated.
B. In the event that the Board of Supervisors accepts the gift to dedicate
10% of the gross acreage, then the following regulations shall apply in
lieu of the regulations set forth under Article XI, § 230-66A through G,
inclusive.
(1) Minimum lot area. The minimum lot size permitted shall be 12,000
square feet.
(2) Minimum lot width. The minimum lot width at the building line
shall be 70 feet. The minimum lot width at the street line shall be
50 feet.
(3) Minimum yard setbacks. The minimum yard setback shall be:
(a) Front yard: 40 feet
(b) Side yard:
[1] Interior yards: There shall be two side yards having an
aggregate width of not less than 25 feet, each side yard
having a width of not less than 10 feet.
[2] Corner lots: There shall be two side yards, the side yard
abutting the street having a width of not less than 30 feet
and the side yard not abutting the street having a width of
not less than 10 feet.
(c) Rear yards: 40 feet.

§ 230-68. Other provisions. [Added 7-28-1986 by Ord. No. 17-037]
See Article XXI of this Zoning Ordinance for general provisions that may
also relate to this District.
(4) Building coverage. The maximum building coverage of any lot shall
not exceed 20% of the total lot area.
(5) Lot averaging. A maximum of 25% of the lots in the development
may be reduced in size to no less than 10,000 square feet with
other lots being of sufficiently larger size so that the final result
shall be that the lot size shall be no less than 12,000 square feet.
(6) Front yard averaging. A maximum of 25% of the lots in the
development may have the front yards reduced in depth to no less
than 35 feet with the front yards in other lots being of sufficiently
larger depth so that the final result shall be that the average front
yard of all lots in the development shall be no less than 40 feet in
depth.
(7) Public water and sewerage. Each lot must be served by public
water supply and public sewerage.
(8) Public and private utilities. All utility lines shall be placed
underground.

§ 230-184. Variances.
A. Substantive challenges to the validity of any land use ordinance, except
those brought before the Board of Supervisors as curative amendments.
B. Challenges to the validity of a land use ordinance raising procedural
questions or alleged defects in the progress of enactment or adoption,
which challenges shall be raised by an appeal taken within 30 days after
the effective date of said ordinance.
A. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance inflict unnecessary hardship upon
the appellant. The Board may grant a variance, provided that the
following findings are made where relevant in a given case:
(1) That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
(2) That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there is
no possibility that the property can be developed in strict
conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and that
the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the
reasonable use of the property.
(3) That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.

1:910

The Board shall hear and decide requests for special exceptions to the terms
of this chapter in such cases as are expressly provided for in this chapter.
In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards in addition to those expressed in this chapter as
it may deem necessary to implement the purpose of this section and this
Zoning Ordinance. Where, in this chapter, additional standards are set forth
for a particular use that may be requested for a special exception, then the
Board shall consider whether the request meets those standards in addition
to the standards set forth in this section. In deciding all applications for
special exceptions, the Board shall be guided by the following criteria and
standards:
(4) That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located nor substantially or permanently impair the appropriate
use or development of adjacent property nor be detrimental to the
public welfare.
(5) That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least
modification possible of the regulation in issue.
B. In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the
purpose of this chapter.
A. The proposed use is one permitted by special exception.
B. The proposed use is permitted, and it will conform to the applicable
regulations of the district in which it is located or any district
regulations which may relate to or apply to the use, including but not
limited to setbacks, building coverage, open space and buffering.
C. The proposed use will conform to the regulations applicable according
to use and/or district, including but not limited to regulations contained
in Article XIX, Off-Street Parking and Loading; Article XX,
Nonconforming Uses; and Article XXI, Miscellaneous Provisions.
[Amended 4-27-2009 by Ord. No. 09-236Z]
D. Points of vehicular access to the lot are provided at a distance from the
intersections and other points of access and in number sufficient to
prevent undue traffic hazards and obstruction to the movement of
traffic.
E. The location of the site with respect to the existing public roads giving
access to it is such that the safe capacity of the public roads is not
exceeded by the estimated traffic attracted or generated by the
proposed use, and the traffic generated or attracted is not out of
character with the normal traffic using said public roads.

1:911
§ 230-186. Other appeals. [Added 5-8-1989 by Ord. No. 17-054]
The Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and determine the following:
F. A determination that the proposed use will not have an unwarranted
impact on traffic in the area, either creating significant additional
congestion in an area of existing congestion or posing a threat of
significant additional congestion where there is a high probability of
future congestion. In addition, the Board shall consider whether the
proposed use will create any traffic hazard dangerous to the public
safety.
G. Screening of the proposed use from adjacent uses is sufficient to
prevent the deleterious impact of the uses upon each other, considering
the type, dimension and character of the screening.
H. The suitability of the property for the proposed use.
I. The proposed use not adversely affect or contradict the Comprehensive
Plan of the municipality.
J. The general purpose and intent of this chapter.
K. The Board will be guided by sound subdivision practice, sound land use
planning and the preservation and conservation of natural resources.
L. The suitability of the proposed use to the character of the neighborhood
and the uses of the surrounding properties.
M. The proposed use will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property.
N. The proposed use will not adversely affect the public health, safety or
general welfare.
O. The proposed use will not adversely affect transportation or unduly
burden water, sewer, school, park or other public facilities.
P. The presence or absence of protestants against the proposed use shall
not be dispositive, but the Board may weigh such presence or absence
of protestants as evidence of the effect that the proposed use may be
deemed to have.
Q. The proposed use shall not overcrowd land or create undue
concentration of population or undue intensity of use.
A. Appeals from a decision by a Municipal Engineer or Zoning Officer
regarding floodplains.
B. Appeals from the decision of any agency or officers regarding transfer
of development rights or performance density provisions.

commercial developments.
E. Require new development to be compatible with existing land uses on
abutting properties or provide transitional buffers in proportion to the
degree of incompatibility.

applicant shall improve all roads and intersections determined to
be in need of improvement by the Montgomery Township Traffic
Management Study and which have been included in the
applicant's traffic impact study, as determined by the Township.
The following criteria shall be applied to all intersections as defined
above:
(a) For each lane group with a predevelopment Level of Service A
or B, the postdevelopment level of service for that lane group
may be increased to no more than 20 seconds of average delay
per vehicle or the middle of Level of Service C.
(b) For each lane group with a predevelopment Level of Service C,
the postdevelopment level of service for that lane group may
be increased to no more than 35 seconds of average delay per
vehicle, or 2/3 of Level of Service D.
(c) For each lane group with a predevelopment Level of Service D,
the postdevelopment level of service for that lane group may
be increased to no more than 40 seconds of average delay per
vehicle, the maximum delay for Level of Service D.
(d) For each lane group with a predevelopment Level of Service E
or F, every effort shall be made to improve the lane group to a
Level of Service D. If a postdevelopment Level of Service D
cannot reasonably be achieved, the applicant shall make
sufficient improvements to maintain a postdevelopment lane
group average delay of no more than the predevelopment delay
plus 10%.
(e) Under no circumstances shall any lane group with a
predevelopment volume/capacity ratio of less than 1.0 be
permitted to increase beyond 1.0.
(f) Criteria; mitigation.
[1] Where the postdevelopment criteria for the level of service
and average delay cannot be attained for any reasons,
including but not limited to geometric design limitations,
topographical constraints, presence of man-made
structures or obstructions and unavailability of necessary
right-of-way, the applicant shall seek the advice of the
Township, through the Township's Traffic Engineer, for
appropriate mitigation measures based upon practical
limitations and sound engineering judgment. The Traffic
Engineer's charges therefor are to be paid by the
developer.
[2] In each and every instance, the Board of Supervisors shall
make the final determination of the predevelopment and
postdevelopment levels of service and the traffic study
§ 230-202 MONTGOMERY CODE § 230-202

funding or to install a Township-wide closed loop traffic signal
system (and pay for a proportionate share of corresponding
hardware and software or to install the proportionate part of
corresponding hardware and software) for every intersection
included within the traffic study area. Where the responsibilities
for a specific intersection overlap between two or more applicants,
funding shall be required on a basis proportional to the trips
generated from each development and the proximity of the
intersection to each development. The decision as to what portion
or for what intersections the closed loop traffic signal system shall
be installed shall be determined by the Board of Supervisors, and,
in doing so, the Supervisors shall take into consideration other
applicants whose proposed development will contribute to the need
for the closed loop traffic system.
B. Required open space. A minimum of 10% of the net tract area shall
either be offered for dedication to the Township or be placed under
permanent easement (the choice to be determined by the Township) for
open space and environmental protection, historic preservation and

ARTICLE XXXI
HLI-II Highway Limited Overlay District II
[Added 6-12-2000 by Ord. No. 00-123Z; amended 9-25-2000 by Ord.
No. 00-130Z]
§ 230-226. Declaration of legislative intent.
In expansion of the purposes and community development objectives
contained in Article I, § 230-2, of this chapter, as amended, the primary
intent of this district is to provide, as an overlay to the underlying LI
Limited Industrial Zoning, an alternative category of land use that permits
an appropriate intensity of development for land fronting on Route 309,
while it prohibits the spread of intensive general retail/commercial uses
that generate high traffic volumes. In addition, other specific intents,
purposes and objectives of this district include the following:
§ 230-227. Use regulations.
Where authorized as a conditional use, one building or a group of
nonconnected buildings may be erected, altered or used, and a lot may be
used or occupied, for any of the following uses and no other:
A. Encourage lower intensity land uses that are primarily nonretail or
specialty retail in nature.
B. Permit land uses that are compatible with limited industrial
development and are traditionally highway-oriented.
C. Encourage uses that generate low to moderate traffic volumes,
especially uses that produce peak traffic generation at times other than
the abutting highway peak hours and traditional general retail
commercial peak hours.
D. Reduce the adverse effects of driveway intersections with Route 309 by
encouraging businesses to coordinate locations of individual access
points, utilize shared access points where feasible and desirable,
develop an integrated circulation system among adjoining lots and
develop alternative access drives where feasible.
E. Minimize the number of traffic generators along Route 309.
A. The uses set forth in § 230-215, Use regulations, of the HLI Overlay
District. However, a motion-picture theater shall not be permitted.
B. Provided that a property or group of properties has both at least a
second means of access other than Route 309 and no more than one
driveway per two buildings on Route 309: individual specialty retail
uses having a minimum gross floor area of 15,000 square feet and a
maximum gross floor area of 45,000 square feet.
(1) A specialty retail use is a retail use that does not sell general
merchandise. A specialty retail use is characterized by an inventory
§ 230-226 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 230-227
1:961
materially limited to one specific market segment. By way of
example, specialty retail uses include stores marketing furniture,
clothing, electronics, and children's clothing and accessories. It is
not the intention of this definition to be all-inclusive, but it is part of
the specific legislative intent that a specialty retail use is a use that
generates less traffic volume than a retail store that carries general
merchandise including, but not limited to, supermarkets, building
supplies, large volume discount merchandise stores, among others.
(2) The square footage of buildings devoted to a specialty retail use
shall be determined by a calculation equal to 75% of the weekday
afternoon adjacent street peak hour trip generation for the largest
general office buildings permitted on a lot located in the HLI-II
District. The calculation of the square footage based upon gross
floor area shall adhere to the following formula:
(a) Calculate the maximum general office buildings permitted on a
building lot in the HLI-II District subject to a maximum
building coverage of 40%;
(b) Calculate the weekday afternoon adjacent street peak hour
total new trips for general office buildings located in the HLI-II
District, in accordance with the Institute of Transportation
Engineers' Trip Generation Formula for Land Use Code 710,
General Office;
(c) Reduce the HLI-II general office buildings weekday afternoon
adjacent street peak hour total new trip generation by 25%;
(d) Increase the reduced new trips by 5% in order to account for
specialty retail interaction trips, in addition to the new trips
generated;
(e) Divide the total (new plus interaction) trips by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Rate for Land Use
Code 814, Specialty Retail, to result in the permitted size of
specialty retail buildings on the building lot; and
(f) Apply a 25% density increase bonus to the permitted specialty
retail buildings size, if access is limited to one-half driveway
per each building along Pa. Route 309 and one driveway
connection to a road other than Pa. Route 309. If an odd
number of buildings is proposed, then the total number of
driveways along Pa. Route 309 will be rounded up to the
nearest whole driveway. Only one driveway connection to a
road other than Pa. Route 309 is required.
C. Assisted living facility and/or independent living units designed for the
elderly and restricted to residents of age 55 and over in accordance
with the Federal Fair Housing Act, as amended.
D. Medical center.
