FOREWORD

History

                  This comprises the codification of the ordinances of the Township of Hampden.  The Township was originally settled in 1731 and was incorporated as a Township on January 23, 1845, from parts of East Pennsboro Township and became a First Class Township on January 1, 1960.  This Code of Ordinances was originally codified by Penns Valley Publishers on July 3, 1984 by Ordinance 84-6.

                  This recodification of the Code of Ordinances of the Township of Hampden was prepared by Penns Valley Publishers, a division of Fry Communications, Inc., and adopted by the Township Board of Commissioners on August 27, 1998 by Ordinance Num­ber 98-07.

 

Organization

                  The Code contains four parts which are (1) the valid current ordinances of the Township contained in Chapters 1 through 27, (2) the Appendix, which lists by abstracted title all ordinances of a temporary or "one time" nature, (3) the Key to the disposition of each ordinance ever enacted by the Township, and (4) the Index, which is an alphabetical arrange­ment of subjects.

                  In the Code each Chapter is separated by a divider tab, and specific ordinances can be located by subject on the contents page at the beginning of each Chapter.  The Index may also be used to search for a subject when one is looking for general information on a particular subject, or if it is not known in which Chapter the subject might be found.  The Appendix consists of several general categories containing a chronologi­cal listing of short subject descriptions along with a reference to the original ordinance and its date of enactment, if known.

                  The Key to disposition indicates what action has been taken by the Board of Commissioners with regard to every ordinance ever enacted.  An ordinance has either been (1) specifically repealed, (2) superseded by another ordinance, (3) is located in a Chapter of the Code book, or (4) is located in the Appendix.  Annual tax rate and budget ordinances are located only in the Key.  The Key is a cross reference to the original ordinance books of the Township, and to the location within the Code of each ordinance by number.

The purpose of this test plan is to determine if a building in excess of 32,000 square feet will allow emergency personnel to send and receive communications from within all areas of building; or alternately, to verify the performance of a building equipped with emergency communications equipment (e.g., radiating cable, passive antennas, bi-directional amplifiers, distributed antenna systems) so that emergency personnel can send and receive communications from all areas within the building.

A Grid Acceptance Test (GAT) will be used to demonstrate that the required reliability of communication is provided among 95% of the total number of grid cells at a Delivered Audio Quality 3.4 (i.e., “Speech understandable with repetition only rarely required.  Some Noise/Distortion.”).

Terms and testing methodology described within the GAT are based on Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) Telecommunications Systems Bulletin TSB-88-B, “Wireless Communications System – Performance in Noise and Interference-Limited Situations – Recommended Methods for Technology – Independent Modeling Simulation, and Verifications.”

 

Grid Acceptance Test:

For new commercial buildings, including new additions, the facility owner is responsible to have a Grid Acceptance Test (GAT) prior to requesting a certificate of occupancy (CO). 
The GAT shall be performed by an Approved Vendor (AV).
The approved vendor shall be responsible to submit the results of the GAT directly to Hampden Township Community Development Department and the CCDPS. 
If the facility has passed the GAT or the appropriate Township Code Official determines that the facility is worthy of a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy (TCO), the Township shall issue an approval letter or certificate. 
If the Building Code Official issues a TCO, the facility owner or their representative will be required to have the approved vendor submit a passed GAT to the Township Community Development Department prior to receipt of a CO. 
In the case of a shell and core – tenant fit-out construction arrangement, the process shall be as follows:

The facility owner shall commission a completed GAT test for shell and core CO.

The approved vendor shall submit the results of the shell and core GAT to the Township Community Development Department for a pass/fail designation.

If the facility has passed the GAT, the Township Community Development Department shall issue an approval letter.

The facility owner shall commission an additional, complete GAT test for each “initial” tenant “fit-out” following the same processes discussed above.
The test will be conducted after exterior walls, roof, windows and doors have been constructed/installed and all interior rooms, their walls and ceilings, are in place and doors have been hung as appropriate for the CO application being sought, i.e., shell and core or complete tenant fit-out.

The test will be conducted using portable radios which operate on the Cumberland County Emergency Radio Communications System.

The test team will verify that the test radios are functioning properly and meet minimum manufacturer’s performance standards prior to test execution, to include coordination with CCDPS prior to commencement of any testing. 

All testing will be performed in accordance with the requirements set forth by Cumberland County Ordinance 2017-2, as amended. 

The building floor plan for all floors shall be overlaid with a uniform grid pattern.  The test grid shall be established with each grid unit measuring 25 feet by 25 feet.  A grid side shall not exceed 25’ and must not be less than 15’.  Each grid unit (cell) shall be uniquely identified and the results will be recorded in the Grid Acceptance Test Log (GAT Log, Appendix B).  The grid map must be attached to the grid acceptance test log. 

Grids in areas where electromagnetic interference (EMI) will interfere with the efficient operation of equipment sensitive to EMI’s will be excluded from the test and reliability calculations.  When determining the coverage percentage, the total number of grids to be tested will be based on the total number of grids in a building minus the number of grids in EMI areas.

Stairwells and elevators are critical areas where communication on both forward and reverse (transmit, “Tx” & receive, “TRx”) paths must meet or exceed the DAQ 3.4 level to pass the requirements of this test.  If an elevator fails in a grid area the grid and elevator will be tested separately. 

When acceptance testing is performed in elevators, the internal and external doors shall be closed, and the test will be repeated on each floor. 

The test procedures shall require the quality of communication to be judged by a stationary tester and mobile tester while the mobile tester moves from grid unit (cell) to grid unit (cell), throughout the building, covering all grid units (cells) on all floors.  The procedure has the following attributes:

The test requires two testers.One tester shall be stationary and located in a known good reception area (the stationary tester).The mobile tester shall systematically roam all floors throughout the building.
 
From each grid unit (cell), at least one (1) test call shall be made by the mobile operator to the stationary operator.

Tests will be conducted at the center of the grid.If the centermost point of the grid is not accessible the next closest area to the center of the grid will be used.Any grids not accessible will be excluded from the test and reliability calculations.

The mobile tester shall verbally count from one (1) to five (5) and five (5) to one (1) (for a total of ten numbers verbalized).The stationary receiver shall be required to acknowledge the DAQ and whether call quality is or is not acceptable.

The stationary tester shall then verbally count from one (1) to five (5) and five (5) to one (1) (for a total of ten numbers verbalized).The mobile receiver shall be required to acknowledge the DAQ and whether call quality is or is not acceptable.

The test will consider both forward and reverse (Tx & TRx) communication paths.Communication on both paths shall meet or exceed the DAQ 3.4 level to meet the requirements of this test.

The tester initiating the call from within each grid unit (cell) shall determine the success or failure of the call.Results will be recorded in the GAT Log with a pass/fail rating system by the stationary tester.

The mobile tester must issue a “pass” decision to constitute a successful result for each tested grid unit (cell).This process will be repeated for each grid unit (cell) that is part of the grid acceptance test.

Once all data is collected, coverage percentage (CP), will be determined by Equation One (1):
CP=(Tp)/(Tc) x 100%

CP = Coverage Percentage

Tc= Total Number of Grid Units (cells)

Tp= Total Number of Grid Units Passed (cells)

Note:  CP is a function of the Pass/Fail results for each grid unit tested within the building, not the ratio of successful calls to unsuccessful calls within each specified grid unit.

Township Emergency Services Personnel may, at their discretion, witness coverage testing.

In the event Cumberland County’s testing requirements are more stringent than the requirements set forth in Chapter 4, Part 3, to include Appendix A and Appendix B, the County’s requirements shall apply.

PART 4

PAYMENT, ESCROW AND USE OF FIRE LOSS CLAIMS

§401.  Legislative Intent, Legal Authority and Background.

            The legislative intent, legal authority and background of this Part are as follows:

                              A.    The Township of Hampden is a municipal corporation 				organized and existing under the Pennsylvania First Class 				Township 
                                      Code.

            B.    As such, it is a municipality as defined in the Act of May 17, 		1921, P.L. 682, No. 284, known as the Insurance Company
                 Law of 1921, added July 9, 1992, P.L. 678, No. 98, as 		amended October 13, 1994, P.L. 609, No. 93, 40 P.S. § 638 		(herein the "Act").

            C.    The Board of Commissioners intends to ensure the payment 		of delinquent taxes, assessments, penalties and user charges
                out of the payment by insurers of fire loss claims involving 		structures and buildings within Hampden Township.

            D.    The Board of Commissioners desires to insure the payment 		of costs incurred by the Township in the removal, repair or
                securing of buildings or structures damaged by fire out of 		fire loss claims paid by insurers for structures and buildings
                 within Hampden Township.

            E.     It is the purpose of this Part to deter the commission of 		arson and related crimes, to discourage the abandonment of
                property and to prevent urban blight and deterioration. 

            F.     The Board of Commissioners has determined that it is in the 		best interest of its citizens that the economic consequences of
                 fire damage to buildings and structures in the Township not be 		borne by it, nor be paid out of its financial resources.

 

§402.  Definitions.

 §405.  Certificate of Amount and Transfer of Insurance Proceeds: Municipal Costs for Removal, Repair or Securing Fire Damaged Structures.

            A.    No insurer doing business in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall pay a fire loss claim of a named insured unless the insurer and the named insured comply with the provisions of this Part.

            B.    The Municipal Officer shall, upon the written request of the insurer or named insured specifying the tax description of the property, name and address of the insurer and the date agreed upon by the insurer and the named insured as the date of the receipt of a loss report of the claim, furnish the insurer either of the following within 14 working days of the request:

                    (1)     A certificate, or at the discretion of Hampden Township, a verbal notification which shall be confirmed in writing by the insurer to the effect that, as of the date specified in the request, Hampden Township has not certified any amount as total costs incurred by the Township of Hampden for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property.

                    (2)     A certificate and bill showing the amount as of the date specified in the request that, as of the date of the Municipal Officer's certificate, the amount of the total costs, if any, certified to the Municipal Officer that has been incurred by Hampden Township for the removal, repair or securing of a building or other structure on the property.  For the purposes of this provision, Hampden Township shall provide to the Municipal Officer the total amount, if any, of such costs, if available, or the amount of costs known to the Township at the time of the Municipal Officer's certificate.

            C.   After full compliance with the requirements of Section 405.B, above, the insurer shall pay the claim of the named insured, provided however, that if the loss agreed upon by the named insured and the insurer equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability on all applicable fire policies, the following procedures shall be followed:

                  1.        The insurer shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Municipal Officer the aggregate of $2,000 for each $15,000 or a claim and for each fraction of that amount of a claim, provided:

                   (a)    This section is to be applied such that if the claim is $15,000 or less, the    amount transferred to Hampden Township shall be $2,000.

                            (b)    That, if at that time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure in an amount less than the amount calculated under the foregoing transfer formula, the insurer shall transfer to Hampden Township from the insurance proceeds the amount based upon the estimate.

                  2.        The transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all insurers and on all applicable policies.  Policy proceeds remaining after the transfer to Hampden Township shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms. 

After the transfer of proceeds to the Municipal Officer pursuant, the named insured may submit a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure and the Municipal Officer shall return to the named insured the amount of the funds transferred to Hampden Township in excess of the estimate, provided that Hampden Township has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
            E.  Upon the receipt of proceeds under this section, Hampden Township shall do the following:

                  1.   The Municipal Officer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used solely as security against the total costs which are incurred by Hampden Township for removing, repairing or securing the building or structure.  Such costs shall include, without limitation, any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by Hampden Township in connection with such removal, repair or security of the building or any proceedings related thereto.

                  2.   At the time of transfer of such proceeds, the insurer shall provide Hampden Township with the name and address of the named insured.  Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the name and the address of the named insured, the Municipal Officer shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have been received by Hampden Township and notify the named insured that the procedures under this section shall be followed.

                  3.   When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable regulations and orders of Hampden Township and the required proof of such completion received by the Municipal Officer and if Hampden Township has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured.  If Hampden Township has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, Hampden Township shall transfer the remaining funds to the named insured.

                  4.   To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by Hampden Township pursuant to this section, and retained by it, such interest shall belong to Hampden Township.  To the extent that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned or such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the time that the proceeds are returned. 

            F.  Nothing in this Part shall be construed to limit the ability of Hampden Township to recover any deficiency.  Furthermore, nothing in this Part shall be construed to prohibit Hampden Township and the named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured if some reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.

 

§406.  Additional Procedures and Regulations by Resolution. 

            The Board of Commissioners may, by resolution, adopt additional procedures and regulations to implement this Part and may, by resolution, fix reasonable fees to be charged for Municipal activities or services provided pursuant to this Part including, but not limited to, issuance of certificates and bills, performance of inspections and opening separate fund accounts.

 

§407.  Violations and Penalties.

            Any person who shall violate any provisions of this Part shall, upon conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $300 and costs of prosecution and, in default of payment of such fine and costs, to imprisonment for not more than 30 days.

Revocation shall be made only after hearing before the Manager after 5 days written notice to the applicant, given by personal service or deposited in the U.S. mail, addressed to the applicant at the address given in the application.  The action of the Manager may be appealed to the Board of Commissioners as heretofore.  If in the opinion of the Manager, public health, safety or welfare is endangered, the Manager may suspend any permit granted under this Part, pending the hearing for the revocation of such permit.  Such revocation or suspension shall be in addition to any other penalties provided in this Part. 

(Ord. 72-7, 12/5/1972, §14)

 

§114. EXPIRATION AND ISSUANCE OF SUPPLEMENTAL PERMIT. 

In the event any excavation or fill for which a permit has been granted under this Part is not commenced within 6 months from the date of such permit, or in the event the work of excavation or fill is at any time abandoned for a period of 6 consecutive months, such permit shall automatically terminate, without notice, and no further excavation or fill shall be made; providing, however, that the conditions and responsibilities in such permit shall remain binding upon the person or firm to whom such permit was issued, and all legal and equitable remedies shall be available against such person or firm for any breach thereof.  When the amount of material excavated or filled equals the number of cubic yards authorized by the permit, no further excavation or fill may be made until a supplemental permit has been issued.

(Ord. 80-3, 11/5/1980, §1)

 

§202. PREFACE; POLICY AND INTENTION. 

The people and citizens of the Township and citizens of the Township of Hampden acting by and through their duly elected government body, this Board of Commissioners, are aware that businesses exist in our nation that market and advertise for sale and sell paraphernalia that are utilized by our residents in the introduction into their bodies of prohibited controlled substances and that this business is not effectively controlled, regulated or prohibited.  This Board of Township Commissioners believes that this industry panders to our youth, encourages them, physically, to utilize controlled substances and, in this way, encourages such persons in the illegal use of controlled substances.  This Board of Township Commissioners believes that such use of controlled substances is harmful to the user thereof and poses a clear, present and substantial danger to the health and welfare of the persons who utilize such substances.  Therefore, in answer to these factors, this Part is enacted to promote the health, safety and public welfare of the citizens and inhabitants of the Township of Hampden.

(1)      All persons or groups requesting use of the facility building, park pavilions, athletic fields, Emergency Services Building Training Room and/or the swimming pool must submit a completed "facility reservation request" or letter of request, along with the appropriate rental fee or deposit required to confirm the reservation.


(2)      Cancellation should be reported to the Township as early as possible.  Rental fees, less nonrefundable deposits, will be returned as long as the Township receives at least 2 weeks advance notice of such intent or if the cancellation is necessary due to inclement weather.


(3)      The person signing the "facility reservation request" is responsible for the condition of the facility and/or equipment located within and any damage to the same.



(4)      All requests shall be reviewed by Township staff and upon approval a "permit" will be issued as a confirmation of the reservation.  Use of the facility shall be restricted to the terms specified on the permit issued to the group. Key and/or equipment may be picked up on the day of the reservation at the Recreation Office between 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Streets, sidewalks and other public property disturbed in the course of installation of a building sewer shall be restored, at the cost and expense of the owner of the improved property being connected in a manner satisfactory to this Township.

5.       If any person shall fail or refuse, upon receipt of a notice of this Township, in writing, to remedy any unsatisfactory condition with respect to a building sewer, within 10 days of receipt of such notice, this Township may refuse to permit such person to discharge sanitary sewage and indus­trial waste into the system until such unsatisfac­tory condition shall have been remedied to the satisfaction of this Township.  This Township may also if necessary, remedy such unsatisfactory condition and may collect from such owner the costs and expenses thereof by the filing of a municipal lien against the property, an action in assumpsit or such other legal proceedings, as may be permitted by law.

6.       This Township reserves the right to adopt, from time to time, such rules and regulations as it shall deem necessary and proper relating to connections with a sewer and the sewer system, which rules and regulations, to the extent appropriate, shall be construed as part of this Part.

                                                   (.002 Q (G in ppm - 70))

                    Where                   Q = Metered quantity charge (subsection 1)

                                                   BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand

                                                   SS = Suspended Solids

                                                   P = Total Phosphorus (as PO4)

                                                   N = Ammonia Nitrogen (as N)

                                                   G = Oil, Grease and Fat

                                                   ppm = Parts per million

B.       If a number in parentheses calculates to be nega­tive, the number shall be considered zero.

C.       If the industrial waste does not contain any of the above substances in excess of the concentrations stated, the charges shall be as set forth in subsection (1).

3.       U.S. Navy Inventory Control Point Contractual Rate.  The rates and charges to be paid by the U.S. Navy Inventory Control Point pursuant to Sewage Disposal Contract N62472-71-C-8123 as last Amendment/Modification No. P-00002 effective October 4, 1993 (Exhibit II) shall be as follows:

2.       Industrial establishments having large variations in the rate of discharging their waste, if required by the Township, shall install suitable holding tanks for equalizing the rate of discharge uniformly over the entire 24 hours of the day.  The peak rate of discharge for any such industrial establishment shall not exceed 200% of the average daily discharge at any time.

(Ord. 64, 4/6/1965, §9)

 

§206. MEASURING VOLUME FOR THE PURPOSES OF §204 ABOVE.

1.       Methods of Measuring Volume.

A.      Whenever a person purchasing all water used from the water supplier discharges sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, the volume of water used, as determined from meter readings made by or made available to, the Township, shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.

B.       In cases where persons have sources of water supply in addition to or other than from the water supplier and discharge sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, those persons may provide a meter on such additional or other source of supply.  The total amount of water used as shown by these meter readings will be used in computing the sewer rentals.  If no such meter is installed, the Sewer Manager shall estimate the total amount of water used for the purpose of determining the sewer rentals.

C.       Where one water meter serves more than one commercial or industrial establishment discharging sanitary sewage and/or industrial waste into the sewer system, a separate meter may be installed by the owner of each such establishments so served.  Readings from such meters shall be used in computing the sewer rentals applicable to the said respective establishments.  If no such meter or meters are installed, the Sewer Manager shall estimate the amount of water used by each of said establishments for purposes of determin­ing the sewer rentals.

D.      In cases where persons use water from the water supplier and/or from any other source such that all or any part of the water so used is not discharged into the sewer system, the quantity of water used to determine the sewer rentals shall be computed by one of the following methods:

(1)      Method No. 1.  By placing a meter or measuring device on the sewer connection.  The readings from the meter or measuring device shall be used in computing the sewer rentals.

(2)      Method No. 2.  By placing a meter or measuring device on the effluent not discharging into the sewer system.  The readings from this meter or measuring device will then be deducted from the total water meter readings and the remainder will be used in computing the sewer rentals.

(3)      Method No. 3.  When in the opinion of the Sewer Manager it is not desirable or not practical to install devices to continuously determine the quantity of water not discharged to the sewer system, the Sewer Manager will determine, in such manner and by such method as he may prescribe, the percentage of metered water discharged into the sewer system and the quantity of water used to compute the sewer rentals shall be the percentage so determined of the quantity measured by the water meter or meters.  Any dispute as to the estimated amount shall be submitted to the Township after notice of the estimate, whose decision on the matter shall be final for the current calendar year.

2.       Measuring Devices. All meters or measuring devices not provided by the water supplier but otherwise used under the provisions of this Part may be furnished and installed by the Township at the expense of the property owner and shall be owned by, and under the control of, the Township and may be tested, inspected or repaired by Township employees whenever deemed necessary.  The owner of the property upon which such measuring device is installed shall be responsible for its maintenance and safekeeping and all repairs thereto shall be made by the Township at the property owner's expense, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or other causes.  Bills for such installation and repairs shall be due and payable at the same time and collected in the same manner as are the bills for sewer services; such bills from and after their due date shall constitute a lien upon the property upon which such measuring device is installed.

3.       Meter Reading. Township shall be responsible for the reading of all meters or measuring devices, unless such readings are otherwise made available to the Township by the water supplier, and they shall be made available to Township employees for meter reading at any reasonable time.

(Ord. 64, 4/6/1965, §10)

 

§207. CHANGES IN CLASSIFICATION, ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS. 

If use or classification of any property should change within any quarter, the difference in sewer rental, prorated on a monthly basis to the nearest calendar month will be charged or credited, as the case may be, on the bill for the succeeding quarter.  Additional classification and additional sewer rentals may be established by the Township from time to time.

(Ord. 64, 4/6/1965, §11)

 

§208. TIME AND METHODS OF PAYMENTS. 

1.       The above connection fees shall be payable upon application for permits to make connections.

2.       All bills for sewer rentals, charges and user fees shall be rendered in calendar quarters in advance, and all such rentals, charges and fees shall be due and payable within 30 days from the first day of the quarter annual period for which the bill is rendered.  Owners of improved properties connected during any calendar quarter shall pay a pro-rata rental, charge and fee for sewer service for the balance of the calendar quarter; such partial billings shall be due and payable within 30 days from the date the bill is rendered.

(Ord. 64, 4/6/1965, §12; as amended by Ord. 84-6, 7/3/1984; and by Ord. 88-7, 10/4/1988, §2)

 

§209. DELINQUENT SEWER RENTALS; PENALTIES AND LIENS.

1.       Quarterly rentals, charges and fees for sewer service shall be subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the face amount of bill therefore if not paid when said bills are due as provided in §207 hereinabove.  If said rentals, charges and fees are not paid within 30 days after becoming due, the face amount of such bill plus the penalty shall bear interest from the due date of said bill at the rate of 1/2% per month or fraction thereof until paid, and the Township shall have the right to terminate service from the delinquent premises and not to restore the same until all delinquent bills, penalties and interest against the same and the cost of terminating and restoring service have been paid.  [Ord. 88-7]

2.       All persons connected to the sewer system must give the Township their correct address.  Failure to receive bills will not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor permit an extension of the period which bills are payable at face.

3.       Payments made by mail, as evidenced by the United States Post Office mark, on or previous to the end of the period during which the bills are payable at face, will be deemed to be a payment within such period.

4.       All sewer rentals, together with all penalties and interest thereon, not paid on or before the end of a period 90 days from the date of each bill, or such other longer time as may be prescribed by applicable statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall be deemed to be delinquent.  All delinquent sewer rentals and all penalties and interest thereon shall be a lien on the property served by said sewerage service, and may be perfected by filing an appropriate municipal claim in the Office of the Prothonotary of Cumberland County, and shall be collected in the manner provided by law for filing and collection of such claims and liens.  Any municipal claim filed shall bear interest at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of filing until paid in full.  [Ord. 92-6, amended by Ord. 14-03]

5.       The Township Manager, in conjunction with the Township Solicitor, is authorized and empowered, without further authorization by the Board of Township Commissioners, to take any and all action to collect delinquent sewer rentals, penalties and interest, including, but not limited to, the termination of sewer service per subsection (1), formal entry of liens on real estate, execution upon, foreclosure or other enforcement of liens, and in­stitution of actions at law or in equity.

B.       Concentrations apply at the point where the industrial waste is discharged to the POTW.  All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise.  At his discretion, the Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to or in place of the concentration based limitations above. 

5.       Township's Right of Revision.  The Township reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in wastewater discharge permits, more stringent standards or require­ments on discharges to the POTW, if deemed necessary, to comply with the objectives presented in §601(1) of this Part or the general and specific prohibitions in §602(1) of this Part. 

6.       Special Agreement. 

A.      The Township reserves the right to enter into special agreements with industrial users setting out special terms under which they may discharge to the POTW.  In no case will a special agreement waive compliance with a pretreatment standard or requirement.  However, the industrial user may request a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR §403.15.  They may also request a variance from the categorical pretreatment standard from EPA. 

B.       Such a request will be approved only if the industrial user can prove that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when establishing that pretreatment standard.  An industrial user requesting a fundamentally different factor variance must comply with the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR §403.13. 

7        Dilution.  No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.  The Superinten­dent may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §602; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§603. PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.

1.       Pretreatment Facilities.  Industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and the prohibitions set out in §602(1), above, within the time limitations specified by the EPA, the State or the Superintendent, whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Township shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense.  Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Township for review and shall be acceptable to the Township before construction of the facility.  The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the Township under the provisions of this Part. 

2.       Additional Pretreatment Measures.

A.      Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste streams and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this Part. 

B.       Each SIU discharging into the POTW greater than 50,000 gallons per day or greater than 18% of the average daily flow in the POTW, which is lesser, shall install and maintain on his property and at his expense a suitable storage and flow control facility to insure equalization of flow over a twenty-four (24) hour period.  The facility shall have a capacity for at least 30% of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the Superintendent.  A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 

C.       Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand, except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential users.  All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection.  Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the owner at his expense. 

D.      Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

E.       At no time shall two readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, be more than 5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 

3.       Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans.  The Superintendent may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan.  At least once every two years, the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan.  Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/control slug plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following:

A.      Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges. 

B.       Description of stored chemicals. 

C.       Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge.  Such notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any of the prohibited discharges in §602(1) of this Part. 

D.      Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge.  Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 

4.       Tenant Responsibility.  Where an owner of property leases premises to any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Part. 

5.       Vandalism.  No person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with or prevent access to any structure, appurtenance or equipment or other part of the POTW.  Any person found in violation of this requirement shall be subject to the sanctions set out in §§610-612, below. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §603)

 

§604. WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ELIGIBILITY.

1.       Wastewater Survey.  When requested by the Superintendent, all industrial users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by completing a wastewater survey prior to commencing their discharge.  The Superinten­dent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial users to update the survey.  Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be considered a violation of this Part. 

2.       Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement. 

A.      It shall be unlawful for any significant industrial user to discharge wastewater into the Township's POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the Superintendent.  Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this Part and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in §§610-612.  Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State and local law. 

B.       The Superintendent may require other industrial users, including liquid waste haulers, to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purposes of this Part. 

3.       Wastewater Discharge Permitting Existing Connections.  Any significant industrial user which discharges industrial waste into the POTW prior to the effective date of this Part and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future shall, within 30 days after said date, apply to the Township for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with subsection (6) below and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 30 days of the effective date of this Part except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the Superintendent. 

4.       Wastewater Discharge Permitting; New Connections.  Any significant industrial user proposing to begin or recommence discharging industrial wastes into the POTW must obtain a wastewater discharge permit prior to the beginning or recommencing of such discharge.  An application for this wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least 30 days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin. 

5.       Wastewater Discharge Permitting; Extrajurisdictional Industrial Users.

A.      Any existing significant industrial user located beyond the Township limits shall submit a wastewater discharge permit application in accordance with subsection (6), below, within 30 days of the effective date of this Part.  New significant industrial users located beyond the Township's limits shall submit such applications to the Superintendent 30 days prior to any proposed discharge into the POTW. 

B.       Alternately, the Superintendent may enter into an agreement with the neighboring jurisdiction in which the significant industrial user is located to provide for the implementation and enforcement of pretreatment program requirements against said industrial user. 

6.       Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents. 

A.      In order to be considered for a wastewater discharge permit, all industrial users required to have a wastewater discharge permit must submit the information required by §606(1)(B) of this Part.  The Superintendent shall approve a form to be used as a permit application.  In addition, the following information may be requested:

(1)      Description of activities, facilities and plant processes on the premises including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or stored at the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged to the POTW.

(7)      Any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Superinten­dent to evaluate the wastewater discharge permit application. 

B.       Incomplete or inaccurate applications will not be processed and will be returned to the industrial user for revision. 

7.       Application Signatories and Certification.  All wastewater discharge permit applica­tions and industrial user reports must contain the following certification statement and be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial user. 

"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete.  I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations."

8.       Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions.  The Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the industrial user and may require additional information.  Within 30 days of receipt of a complete wastewater discharge permit application, the Superintendent will determine whether or not to issue a wastewater discharge permit.  If no determination is made within this time period, the application will be deemed denied.  The Superintendent may deny any application for a wastewater discharge permit.

All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with §604(7). 

B.       All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge.  Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times.  The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 

C.       If an industrial user, subject to the reporting requirements in and of this Section, monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedures prescribed in §606(11) of this Part, the results of this monitor­ing shall be included in the report. 

5.       Report of Changed Conditions.  Each industrial user is required to notify the Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 30 days before the change. 

A.      The Superintendent may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under §604(6). 

B.       The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under §604(8) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §605(4). 

C.       No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the Superintendent has responded to the industrial user's notice. 

D.      For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of 10% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants shall be deemed significant. 

6.       Reports of Potential Problems.

A.      In the case of any discharge including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge or a sludge load which may cause potential problems for the POTW, including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §602(1) of this Part, it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the Township of the incident.  This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 

B.       Within 5 days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this Part. 

C.       Failure to notify the Township of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this Part. 

D.      A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (A), above.  Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 

7.       Reports from Non-significant Industrial Users.  All users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Township as the Superintendent may require. 

8.       Notice of Violation/Repeat Sampling and Reporting.  If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the Control Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Control Authority within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.  The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's site at least once a month or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 

9.       Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.

A.      Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR, Part 261.  Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR, Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge, continuous, batch or other.  If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user:  an identifica­tion of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.  All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences.  Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.  However, notification of changed discharges must be submitted under §606(5), above.  The notification require­ment in this Section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of §606(1)-(3), above. 

B.       Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) of this Section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§261.30(d) and 261.33(e) requires a one time notification.    Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 

C.       In the case of any new regulations under §3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 

D.      In the case of any notification made under this Section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 

10.     Analytical Requirements.  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR, Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard.  If 40 CFR, Part 136, does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 

11.     Sample Collection. 

A.      Except as indicated in subsection (B), below, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques.  In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a represen­tative sample of the effluent being discharged.  In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 

B.       Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection tech­niques.  

12.     Determination of Noncompliance.  The Superintendent may use a grab sample(s) to determine noncompliance with instantaneous maximum allowable discharge limits.

13.     Timing.  Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked.  For reports which are not mailed postage prepaid into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 

14.     Recordkeeping.  Industrial users shall retain and make available for inspection and copying all records and information required to be retained under this Part.  These records shall remain available for a period of at least 3 years.  This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this Part or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Superinten­dent. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §606)

 

§607. COMPLIANCE MONITORING.

1.       Inspection and Sampling.  The Township shall have the right to enter the facilities of any industrial user to ascertain whether the purpose of this Part and any permit or order issued hereunder is being met and whether the industrial user is complying with all requirements thereof.  Industrial users shall allow the Superintendent or his representatives ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties. 

A.      Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Township, State and EPA will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 

B.       The Township, State and EPA shall have the right to set up on the industrial user's property or require the installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 

C.       The Township may require the industrial user to install monitoring equipment as necessary.  The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense.  All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy. 

D.      Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the industrial facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the industrial user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be replaced.  The costs of clearing such access shall be born by the industrial user. 

E.       Unreasonable delays in allowing Township personnel access to the industrial user's premises shall be a violation of this Part. 

F.       Compliance inspection and sampling will be performed by the Township at a frequency determined by the Superintendent, but no less than once per year.  The frequency of facility inspections and sampling will be determined by the type of facility, type and concentrations of pollutants in the discharge and the past performance of and compliance by the industrial user.  When compliance sampling occurs, the industrial user shall, within 30 days of receipt of the invoice, reimburse the Township for commercial laboratory fees. 

2.       Search Warrants.  If the Superintendent has been refused access to a building, structure or property or any part thereof and if the Superintendent has demonstrated probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this Part or that there is a need to inspect as part of a routine inspection program of the Township designed to verify compliance with this Part, any permit or order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then upon application by the Township Solicitor, the District Justice in the Township shall issue a search and/or seizure warrant describing therein the specific location subject to the warrant.  The warrant shall specify what, if anything, may be searched and/or seized on the property described.  Such warrant shall be served at reasonable hours by the Superintendent in the company of a uniformed police officer of the Township.  In the event of an emergency affecting public health and safety, inspections shall be made without the issuance of a warrant. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §607)

 

§608. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits and monitoring programs and from Township inspection and sampling activities shall be available to the public without restriction unless the industrial user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Township that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable State law.  When requested and demonstrated by the industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR §2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §608)

 

§609. PUBLICATION OF INDUSTRIAL USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLI­ANCE.

The Township shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the municipality where the POTW is located, a list of the industrial users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.  The term significant noncompliance shall mean:

A.      Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which 66% or more of wastewater measurements taken during a 6 month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount.

B.       Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant parameter during a 6 month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable criteria, 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH.

C.       Any other discharge violation that the Township believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through including endangering the health of Township personnel or the general public.

D.      Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment or has caused in the Township's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.

E.       Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance.

F.       Failure to provide, within 30 days after the due date, any required reports including baseline monitoring reports, 90 day compliance reports, periodic self-monitoring reports and reports on compliance with compliance schedules.

G.       Failure to accurately report noncompliance.

H.      Any other violation(s) which the Township determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §609)

 

§610. ENFORCEMENT.

1.       Enforcement Policy. 

A.      All violations of the pretreatment requirements are instances of noncompliance and will receive a specific enforcement response.  Pretreatment requirements are a matter of strict liability.  Hence, good faith or lack of negligence on the industrial user's part is no defense to a violation of the pretreatment require­ments.  The enforcement responses  will range from notices of violation to formal civil litigation and/or termination of service, depending on the severity of the violation.  While similar violations will receive similar enforcement responses, there is some inherent discretion within each enforcement response selection.  For example, some violations will trigger either administra­tive action, formal civil litigation or permit revocation.  The selection of the specific enforcement response option shall be at the sole discretion of the Township.

B.       When making determinations on the level of enforcement, the Township shall take into consideration the following:

(1)      Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources and their uses.

(2)      Costs of restoration and abatement.

(3)      Savings to the user as a result of the violation.

(4)      History of past violation by the user.

(5)      Deterrence of future violations.

(6)      Other relevant factors.

2.       Enforcement Response Criteria.

A.      Emergency Authority.

(1)      The Township may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, or causes interference to the sewer system or causes the Township to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.

(2)      Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge.  In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Township shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the sewer system or endangerment to any individuals.  The Township shall reinstate the wastewater contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge.  A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of he harmful discharge and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the Township within 5 days of the date of occurrence.

B.       Enforcement Procedures.  For violations not requiring the Township to invoke its emergency authority, the following procedures shall apply:

(1)      Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Township finds that any user has violated or is violating this Part, wastewater contribution permit, or any prohibition, limitation of requirements contained herein, the Township shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation(s), which may include the assessment of a civil penalty, and require a written response.  Such notice shall include the name, address and telephone number of the person who will receive an appeal.  Within 30 days of the date of the notice, a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to the Township by the user.

(2)      Compliance Schedule. When the Township finds that a user is in violation of this Part, wastewater contribution permit, or requirements herein, the Township may require the user to submit or may itself issue a schedule of compliance for the necessary correction.

(a)      The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the permit requirements (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc.)

(b)      No increment referred to in subsection (1) shall exceed 9 months.

(c)      Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress report to the Township including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to return the construction to the schedule established.  In no event, shall more than 9 months elapse between such progress reports to the Township.

(3)      Show Cause Hearing.

(a)      The Township may order any user who causes or allows a dis­charge of sewage, industrial waste, or other waste into the sewer system in violation of the provisions, requirements or pretreatment standards of this Part or the rules and regulations of the Pennsylva­nia Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or for any violation thereof to show cause before the Township why the proposed assessment of penalty and/or enforcement action should not be taken.  A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Township regarding the alleged violation, setting forth the specific facts and circumstances upon which the proposed enforcement action is to be taken, and directing the user to show cause before the Township why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) upon the user not less than 20 days before the hearing.  Such notice shall contain the name, address and telephone number of the Township Manager or other person responsible for accepting appeals.  Within 15 days from the date of service of the notice, the user shall file with the Manager of the Township a verified answer responding to the allegations in the notice.  Allegations in the notice which are not specifically denied shall be deemed to have been admitted.  Failure to file an answer or to specifically deny the allegations of the notice shall constitute a sufficient basis for the entry of a default adjudication upon expiration of said 15 days.  [Ord. 98-7]

(b)      The Township shall itself conduct the hearing and take the evidence, with at least three members present.

(c)      At any hearing held pursuant to this Part, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded stenographically, and a full and complete record shall be kept of the proceedings.  The testimony so recorded will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual costs thereof.

(d)     After the Township has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the violation, directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances shall have been installed on existing treatment facilities, or that existing devices or other related appurtenances are property operated, or that any other violation be abated.  Other orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and assess­ment of civil penalties.

3.       Civil Proceedings.  If any person discharges sewage, industrial waste or other waste into the sewer system in violation of the provisions, requirements, or pretreatment standards of this Part, PaDEP OR EPA, which presents an imminent danger or substantial harm to the POTW or the public, an imminent or substantial endangerment to the environment, causes the POTW to violate any conditions of its discharge permit, or has shown a lack of ability or intention to comply with said pretreatment provisions, requirements or standards, any other order of the Township, or if other enforcement procedures would not be adequate to effect prompt correction of the conditions or violations, the Township may institute an action to obtain injunctive relief in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, where the activity has taken place, where the condition exists or where the public is affected.  [Ord. 98-7]

4.       Criminal Proceedings.  Any person who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this Part, or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Part will be prosecuted to the extent permitted by law under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §101 et seq.

5.       Revocation of Permit. 

A.      Any user who violates the following conditions of this Part or applicable State and Federal regulations, is subject to having its permit revoked.

(1)      Failure of a user to factually report the wastewater constituents and characteris­tics of its discharge.

(2)      Failure of the user to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and characteristics.

(3)      Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring.

(4)      Violation of conditions of the permit.

B.       If a permit is revoked, the Township may take steps it deems advisable, including severance of the sewer connection, to promote compliance with this Part.

6.       Appeal.  User shall have such right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas having jurisdiction as is provided for under §7(b) of the Act, the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.A. 101 et seq. or Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. §762.

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §610; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§611.  PENALTIES; COSTS.

1.       Civil Penalties.  Any user who is found to have violated the provisions, requirements, or pretreatment standards of this Part, PaDEP, or the EPA, an order, rule, regulation or permit of the Township, whether or not the violation is willful or negligent, shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries.  Each violation for each separate day shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.  The Township may recover its costs for reestablishing the operation of the POTW, in addition to any civil penalty imposed hereunder.  In addition, the Township may recover attorneys' fees, all court costs and all other expenses of litigation to the extent permitted by law.  [Ord. 98-7]

2.       Civil Penalty Assessment Policy.

A.      This subsection constitutes the civil penalty assessment policy required by the Publicly Owned Treatment Penalty Law (herein "Act"), Act No. 9 of 1992, 35 P.S. §752.1 et seq.  When making determinations on the level of enforcement, the Township shall take into consideration the following:

(1)      Damage to air, water, land or other natural resources and their uses.

(2)      Costs of restoration and abatement.

(3)      Savings to the user as a result of the violation.

(4)      History of past violation by the user.

(5)      Deterrence of future violations.

(6)      Other relevant factors.

B.       A user must usually spend money to comply with pretreatment standards and requirements.  The user makes initial capital expenditures for pretreatment equipment or process changes and incurs subsequent operation, maintenance, and repair costs annually.  By delaying or avoiding these costs, the user realizes an economic advantage or benefit over a competitor who complied with pretreatment requirements on time.  Thus, the "economic benefit" of noncompli­ance is defined as the difference between the costs of on-time compliance and delayed compliance. Economic benefits realized by the user who fails to comply by a required deadline can be measured by:

(1)      The money that the user would expect to earn by delaying the purchase of pretreatment equipment and investing the money in more profitable projects.

(2)      The annual costs that the user avoids and the expected return on avoided costs during the period of noncompliance.

(3)      Any competitive advantage the user may gain, such as increased market share over competitors already in compliance, because of cost advantages attributed to delayed compliance.

C.       In this Part, the economic benefit calculation is focused on the first two benefits.  The Guidance Manual for POTWs To Calculate the Economic Benefit of Noncomplia­nce, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, September 5, 1990, may be applied in calculating the penalty.

D.      Consideration of the gravity and length of a violation is important when determining the penalty amount.  Removing the economic benefit of noncompli­ance only places the violating user in the position it would have been had it complied on time.  Both deterrence and fundamental fairness require that the civil penalty include an additional amount to ensure that noncompliance is more costly than compliance, and the Township's policy will be to include such an amount.

(1)      Recovering for Damages to Public Facilities and/or Natural Re­sources.

(a)      Failure to comply with pretreatment requirements may cause damage to the collection system of the Township.  Damage may also be caused to the natural environment.  Therefore, an additional purpose of penalties in pretreatment enforcement shall be to recover for such damages.  Specifically, the Township may determine to require that a violating user pay reparations for any damages caused to the collection system by improper disposal of pollutants.  Such a user may also be required to pay for replacement of equipment, facilities and/or other damaged processes at the POTW caused by pollutant interference.  Pollutants which pass through or interfered with POTW processes may cause damage to natural systems in receiving waters.  In addition to assessing penalties to recover for such damages, the Township may consider requiring mitigation and remediation programs.

(b)      The Township will consider assessing higher penalties for violations resulting in actual or potential harm to the environment.  Such potential environmental harm occurs whenever an industrial user discharges a pollutant into the sewer system that:

1)       Passes through the POTW inadequately treated and causes a violation of the POTW's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit (including water quality standards); or,

2)       Has a potentially toxic effect on the receiving waters (for example, a fish kill).

(2)      Costs of Restoration and Abatement.  Some violations may have negative impacts on the POTW itself.  For example, such violations may result in significant increases in treatment costs, interfere or harm POTW personnel, equipment, processes or operations, or cause sludge contami­nation, resulting in increased disposal costs.  When a user's noncompli­ance harms the POTW, the Township will assess a larger penalty.

(3)      Savings to the User as a Result of Violation.  A user who fails to comply with pretreatment requirements in a timely manner may accrue a significant economic benefit.  A penalty assessed against the violator will be fixed at a level to at least "take away" this economic benefit and make it unprofitable for the user to ignore or violate pretreatment requirements.  These requirements include installation of pretreatment equipment, one time expenditure (e.g., land) and operation and maintenance (O&M) or other annual costs.  The economic benefit calculation described in this Part will be applied to any or all types of pollution control costs.

(4)      History of Past Violations. 

(a)      The Township will consider each violation in assessing the signifi­cance of industrial user noncompliance.  Violations of average effluent limita­tions will be considered a violation for each day of the averaging period.  Therefore, a monthly average violation will be counted as 30 days of violation, a weekly average violation as seven days of violation, and a 4 day average should be counted as four violations.  Violations of different parameters at the same outfall are counted separately, and violations at different outclass or indirect discharge locations are counted separately.  The amount of the penalty will be increased as the number of violations increases.  However, as provided in the Act, a single operational upset shall only be considered as one violation, even though it may result in simultaneous violations of more than one pretreatment standard.

(b)      The Township shall consider increasing penalty amounts for continu­ing, long term violations.  Generally, a "long-term" violation is one that continues for 3 or more consecutive months.  In addition, penalties will be higher for violations that have continued for 3  years than for violations that have only occurred for 6 months.

(c)      Significant non-effluent violations will be considered in assessing penalties.  Violations included in this category include failure to report, late reporting, schedule violations, failure to implement an approved pretreatment program, laboratory analysis deficiencies, unauthorized discharges, operation and maintenance deficiencies and sludge handling violations.

(d)     The Township will consider increasing the penalty amount when the violating user appears to be acting in "bad faith" (that is, by not cooperating with the Township in effecting a timely correction of the violation), when the user experiences unjustified delays in preventing, correcting or mitigating violations, or when the user has already violated prior administrative orders, compliance agreements or consent decrees, or when the user fails to provide timely and full information.  This recalcitrance factor also may be increased during negotiation if the user continues to resist effort to settle.

(e)      When a user demonstrates that it is unable to pay a settlement penalty, the Township will independently evaluate the user's ability to pay.  When it is determined that the user cannot afford to pay the penalty or that payment of all or part of the penalty will preclude the violator from achieving compliance, the Township shall consider other options.  For example, the Township may consider an installment payment plan with the user paying interest.  Only as a last recourse, the Township may consider reducing the penalty amount.  If the user's behavior has been exceptionally culpable, recalcitrant or threatening to human health and the environment, inability to pay will be disregarded.

(5)      Deterrence of Future Violations. 

          (a)      After a user installs the appropriate pollution control equipment to comply with applicable pretreatment regulations, maintaining compliance requires continuing O&M and other annual expendi­tures.  For industrial users who fail to comply with pretreatment requirements, the Township will set its penalties at a level to remove, at a minimum, the economic benefit from avoided annual costs during its period of violations.  The Township thereby determines that assessing a penalty which, at a minimum, elimi­nates the economic benefit of noncompliance (or makes noncompl­iance more expensive than compliance) will encourage users to remain in compliance.

(b)      The intent of these penalties is to deter noncompliance so that pollutant discharges by a user do not have significant negative impacts on the POTW plant, collection systems or receiving waters.  The Township's policy will be not to assess a penalty that is too small (that is, less than the economic benefit from non-complying), so that the violating user and other users may determine that noncompliance is less expensive than compliance.

(c)      EPA can take an enforcement action against a user violating the Clean Water Act, including Federal pretreatment standards and regulations.  Citizens or citizen groups can also bring civil suits against an individual user for violating environmental regulations.  If the violating user has been sued by EPA, a State regulatory agency or citizens, and penalties were imposed upon it from these actions, the Township may consider reducing the penalty by an amount equal to that which the user already paid for the same violation.

(6)      Other Relevant Factors.

(a)      In order to treat all users fairly and equitably, the Township will use its best efforts to assess penalties using a consistent methodolo­gy.  Thus, it will avoid allowing one user to realize an economic benefit from noncompliance which would potentially enable it to gain an economic advantage over complying users.  By assessing a penalty based on economic benefit, the Township will strive to eliminate or remove any financial advantage the violator gains.

(b)      By exercising a consistent penalty methodology, the Township will ensure that all violators are treated equitably.  While the amount used to develop the penalty will be consistent. 

3.       EPA Policy Followed.  The Township will take into account the policies of EPA in setting penalties.  EPA defines "significant noncompliance" in its revisions to the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR §403.8(f) (2) (vii)) as violations which meet one or more of the following criteria:

A.      Violations of wastewater discharge limit:

(1)      Chronic violations are those in which 66% or more of all of the measure­ments (of monitored parameters) taken during a 6 month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter.

(2)      Technical review criteria (TRC) violations are those in which 33% or more of all the measurements for each pollutant parameter taken during a 6 month period equal or exceed the product of the daily average maximum limit or the average limit times the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH).

(3)      Any other violation of pretreatment effluent limit (daily maximum or longer term average) that the POTW determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference (e.g., slug loads) or pass through (including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public).

(4)      Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endanger­ment to human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge.

B.       Violations of compliance schedule milestones contained in a local control mechanism or enforcement in order for starting construction, completing construction, and attaining final compliance by 90 days or more after the scheduled date.

C.       Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules, self-monitoring data, or categorical standards (baseline monitoring reports (BMRs), 90 day compliance reports and periodic reports) within 30 days of the due date.

D.      Failure to accurately report noncompliance.

E.       Any other violation or group of violations that the Township determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.

F.       Violation of the pretreatment requirements which constitute significant noncomplia­nce are considered to be the most serious violation and requires a strong and immediate response.  Assessment of civil penalties is mandatory for significant noncompliance.

G.       In addition to assessing appropriate penalties commensurate with the factors listed above, the Township shall consider assessing larger penalties in cases of repeat violations, including all violations of permit effluent limitations, monitoring and reporting requirements, and other standard and special discharge conditions.  This consideration provides flexibility in assessing penalties for multiple violations.

4.       Criminal Penalties.  Any person who knowingly, willfully, or intentionally makes any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this Part or wastewater contribution permit, or who falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this Part will be prosecuted to the extent permitted by law under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. §101 et seq.

5.       Remedies Cumulative and Concurrent.  The remedies provided for in this Part are intended to be concurrent and cumulative, and the provisions of this Part shall not abridge or alter any right of action or remedy, now or hereafter existing in law, or under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, available to the Township.

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §611; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§612. SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.

1.       Performance Bonds.  The Superintendent may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this Part, any orders or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder unless such user first files a satisfactory bond payable to the Township in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 

2.       Liability Insurance.  The Superintendent may decline to reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this Part, any order or a previous wastewater discharge permit issued hereunder unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge. 

3.       Water Supply Severance.  Whenever a user has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this Part, orders or wastewater discharge permits issued hereunder, water service to the user may be severed.  Service will only recommence, at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply. 

4.       Public Nuisances.  Any violation of this Part, wastewater discharge permits or orders issued hereunder is hereby declared a public nuisance and shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent or his designee. 

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §612)

 

§613. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.

1.       Upset.

A.      For the purposes of this Section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreat­ment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user.  An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 

B.       An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompli­ance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (C) are met. 

C.       An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through property signed, contemporaneous operating logs or other relevant evidence that:

(1)      An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset.

(2)      The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures.

(3)      The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset.  If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within 5 days:

(a)      A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance.

(b)      The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue.

(c)      Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

D.      In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall the burden of proof. 

E.       Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 

F.       The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 

2.       General/Specific Prohibitions.  An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in §602(1) of this Part if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either a local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to and during the pass through or interference or no local limit exists but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the Township was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit and, in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 

3.       Bypass.

A.      Definitions.

BYPASS -  the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 

SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE - substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass.  Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 

B.       An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreat­ment standards or requirements to be violated but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (C) and (D) of this subsection. 

C.       If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW at least 10 days before the date of the bypass, if possible.   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass­ that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass.  A written submission shall also be provided within 5 days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.

D.      Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless:

(1)      Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage.

(2)      There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance.

(3)      The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (C) of this Section. 

E.       The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (D)(1) of this subsection.

(Ord. 93-6, 4/6/1993, §613)

 

§614. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.

Pretreatment Charges and Fees.  The Township may adopt reasonable charges and fees for reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the Township's pretreatment program which may include:

A.      Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the cost of processing such applications.

B.       Fees for monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures including the cost of collection and analyzing an industrial user's discharge and reviewing monitoring reports submitted by industrial users.

C.       Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge procedures and construction.

D.      Fees for filing appeals.

E.       Other fees as the Township may deem necessary to carry out the requirements contained herein.  These fees relate solely to the matters covered by this Part and are separate from all other fees, fines and penalties chargeable by the Township.

Monuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property subdivision, or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey bench mark with the Township shall not be removed or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission to do so is first obtained in writing from the Township.  Permission shall be granted only upon the condition that the permittee shall pay all expenses incidental to the proper replacement of the monument.

§301.   LEGISLATIVE INTENT.

The Board of Township Commissioners ("Board") of this Township hereby declares the following statements as its purpose and intention in enacting this Part:

A.        The Township provides maintenance of certain public streets and roads within this Township, including the removal of natural snow and mitigation of the effects of ice. Considerable resources of this Township have been appropriated to provide equipment and manpower to perform these functions. It is observed that persons living, occupying or otherwise connected with lands abutting said public streets and roads place snow and ice accumulating on private driveways, parking areas and sidewalks upon the public streets and roads after Township forces have undertaken to remove snow and treat ice. Such placement negates the removal/treatment processes and causes dangerous obstructions jeopardizing the traveling public.

B.         Therefore, the Boards declares that is necessary and in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Township and the traveling public at large to prohibit the placement of snow and ice on public streets and roads maintained by this Township and to provide penalties for those who violate or permit the violation of such prohibition.

GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

 

§501. APPLICATION. 

The following principles, standards and requirements will be applied by the Township Commissioners and Planning Commission for evaluating plans for proposed land developments.  The standards and requirements outlined herein shall be considered minimum standards and requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare.  Where literal compliance with the standards herein specified is clearly impractical, the Township Commis­sioners may modify or adjust the standards to permit reasonable utilization of property while securing substantial conformance with the objectives of this Chapter. 

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §501)

 

§502. LAND REQUIREMENTS.

1.       Land shall be suited to the purposes for which it is to be developed. 

2.       Land which is unsuitable for development because of hazards to life, safety, health or property shall not be developed until such hazards are provided for in the land develop­ment plan.  Land included as having unsuitable characteristics would be the following: 

A.      Land subject to flooding or which has a seasonal high groundwater table which will interfere with the construction of basements or habitable areas below grade.

B.       Land which, if developed, will create or aggravate a flooding condition upon other land. 

C.       Land subject to subsidence. 

D.      Land subject to underground fires.

E.       Land containing significant areas of slopes greater than 20%.  

F.       Land which, because of topography or means of ac­cess, is consid­ered hazardous by the Township Com­missioners. 

G.       Land which is subject to ground pollution or contam­ination. 

H.      Land which is defined as wetland area.

3.       Proposed land developments shall be coordinated with existing nearby neighbor­hoods so that the community as a whole may develop harmoniously. 

4.       Proposed land uses shall conform to the Township Zoning Ordinance [Chap­ter 27].

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §502)

 

§503. STREET SYSTEM GENERAL STANDARDS.

 1.      Proposed streets shall be properly related to such street plans or parts thereof as have been officially prepared and adopted by the Township and shall be coordi­nated with existing or proposed streets in adjoining land develop­ments. 

2.       Streets in and bordering a land development, whether such streets are existing or proposed, shall be coordinated and be of such widths and grades and in such locations as deemed necessary to accommodate prospective traffic and facilitate fire protection.  Upgrading of existing road­ways shall be at the developer's expense.

3.       Proposed streets shall further conform to such County and State road and high­way plans as have been prepared, adopted or filed as prescribed by law. 

4.       Streets shall be related to the topography so as to produce usable lots and accept­able grades. 

5.       Access shall be given to all lots and portions of the tract in the land development and to adjacent unsubdivided territory unless the topography clearly indicates that such connection is not feasible.  Streets giving such access shall be improved to the limits of the land development and shall be improved to Township speci­fications.  Reserve strips and land-locked areas shall not be created. 

6.       Streets shall be laid out to preserve the integrity of their design.  Local access streets shall be laid out to discourage their use by through traffic and, where possi­ble, arterial and collector streets shall be designed for use by through traffic. 

7.       Where the proposed land development contains or is adja­cent to an existing or pro­posed arterial street or a highway designated as a limited access highway by the appropriate highway authorities, provisions shall be made for marginal access streets at a distance acceptable for the appro­priate use of the land between the arterial street or limited access high­way and the marginal access streets.  The Township Commis­sioners may also require rear service areas, double frontage lots or such other treatment as will provide protection for abutting proper­ties, reduc­tion in the number of intersections with primary streets and separation of local and through traffic.  [Ord. 98-7]

8.       Half or partial streets will not be permitted in new land developments except where essential to reasonable devel­opment of a tract in conformance with the other require­ments and standards of this Chapter and where, in addi­tion, satisfac­tory assurance for dedication of the re­maining part of the street can be secured. 

9.       Wherever a tract to be developed borders an existing half or partial street, the entire street shall be shown on the plan. 

10.     Dead-end streets shall be prohibited except as stubs (with adequate turning capability) to permit future street extension into adjoining tracts or when designed as cul-de-sacs. 

11.     New median strips including those controlling access to streets shall be forbidden as part of the dedicated street right-of-way.

12.     Where adjoining areas are not subdivided, the arrangement of streets in a pro­posed land development shall be made, constructed and dedicated to provide for the proper projection of streets into the unsubdivided land. 

13.     Street names shall be coordinated with existing or plat­ted street names and, if a new street is a continuation of or is aligned with an existing or platted street, it shall bear the same name as the existing or platted street. 

14.     No street shall be laid out or opened which extends to or crosses any boundary between the Township and any other municipality except with the specific approval of the Township Commissioners and upon such condition as the Town­ship Commis­sioners may impose.  If the street is proposed to serve a commercial area, an industrial area or a residential area of 50 dwelling units or more, located in another municipality, the street shall not be approved unless the area is also served by a street in the other municipality and unless the relevant traffic facilities of the Township are adequate to handle the anticipated volume. 

15.     All streets shall have a uniform width throughout their respective lengths except where otherwise required by the Township Commissioners pursuant to §504(2)(B). 

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §503; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§504. STREET DESIGN.

1.       Street Classification.

A.      Four functional classifications are hereby estab­lished for the streets and roads in Hampden Town­ship: [Ord. 99-07]

(1)      Arterial.  This classification includes high­ways which are major traffic corridors or pro­vide for intermunicipal traffic of substantial volumes where the average trip lengths are usually five miles or greater.  Generally, these highways should accommodate operating speeds of 35 to 55 miles per hour,, and have an estimated average daily traffic (ADT) count of 5,000 vehicles or greater after being fully developed. 

(2)      Collector.  This classification is intended to include those highways which connect local access highways to arterial highways. They may serve as traffic corridors connecting residen­tial areas with industrial, shopping and other service.  They may penetrate residential areas.  Generally, these highways will accommodate operating speeds of 35 miles per hour, and have an estimated average daily traffic (ADT) count of 400 to 5,000 vehicles after being fully developed.

(3)      Local Access.  This classification is intended to include streets and roads that provide di­rect access to abutting land and connections to higher classes of roadways.  Traffic vol­umes will be low and travel distances generally short.  These streets and roads should be de­signed for operating speeds of 25 miles per hour, and have an estimated average daily traf­fic (ADT) count of less than 400 vehicles after being fully developed. 

                    (4)      Heavy-Duty Roads.  This classification is intended to provide access to industrial areas, other areas where truck traffic is expected, and industrial park roads.  [Ord. 99-07]

2.       Street Widths.

A.      Minimum component widths for each type of public street shall be as follows:

Type of Street

Right-of-Way Width

Cartway Width

Arterial

80' - 120'

46'

Collector

60'

34'

Local Access

50'

30'

B.       Where a proposed development abuts or contains an existing public street or road having a right-of-way width less than would be required if said street or road were created under this Chapter, sufficient additional width for right­-of-way shall be provided and dedicated to meet the foregoing standards. 

C.       Additional right-of-way and cartway widths may be required by the Township Commissioners to promote public safety and convenience when special condi­tions require it and to provide parking space in areas of intensive use. 

3.       Cul-de-sac Streets.

A.      Cul-de-sac streets, whether permanent or tempo­rary, shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having a minimum radius to the edge of the finished street cartway or curb line of not less than 50 feet, and not less than 60 feet to the right-of-way line.  

B.       Unless future extension is clearly impractical or undesirable, the turnaround right-of-way shall be placed adjacent to a property line and a right-of-way of the same width as the street shall be carried to the property line in such a way as to permit future extension of the street into the adjoining tract.  At such time as such a street is extended, the overage created by the turnaround outside the boundaries of the extended street shall revert in ownership to the property owners fronting on the cul-de-sac turnaround. 

C.       Commercial and industrial cul-de-sacs shall be reviewed for adequacy by the Township Engineer.  His recommendations will be given to the Township Commissioners who shall have final authority in this matter. 

D.      Permanent cul-de-sac streets shall be kept to a minimum and shall not be less than 250 feet in length and shall not exceed 600 feet in length mea­sured from the curb line of the intersecting street to the radius center of the cul-de-sac. 

E.       A one time fee for each cul-de-sac may be set by resolution by the Township Commissioners, in order to help defer increased costs of snow removal, payable prior to dedication.

4.       Street Alignment.

A.      Whenever street lines are deflected by more than 5 degrees, connection shall be made by horizontal curves. 

B.       The minimum radius at the centerline for horizontal curves on collector and arterial streets shall be 300 feet and, for local streets, the minimum radius shall be 150 feet. 

C.       On local access streets, the minimum tangent between reverse curves shall be at least 100 feet; on collector and arterial streets, the minimum tangent shall be at least 250 feet. 

D.      Sight distance at the intersection of streets shall be measured and comply with PennDOT Publication No. 201.

5.       Street Grades at Centerline.

A.      The minimum grade on all streets shall be 1%. 

B.       The maximum grade on collector or arterial streets shall be seven (7) perc­ent and on local access streets 10% percent. 

C.       Vertical curves shall be used in changes of grade exceeding one (1) percent and shall pro­vide proper sight distances as specified herein above. 

6.       Street Intersections.

A.      Local streets shall not intersect with collec­tor or arterial streets on the same side at intervals of less than 800 feet as measured from centerline to centerline. 

B.       The distance between centerlines of streets opening onto the oppo­site side of a proposed or existing street shall be not less than 250 feet.  Streets shall be placed directly oppo­site each other if at all possible.

C.       Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two streets shall be avoided.  Where this proves impossible, such inter­sec­tions shall be designed with extreme care for both pedestrian and vehicular safety. 

D.      Streets shall be all laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles.  Local streets shall not intersect collector or arte­rial streets at an angle of less than 75 degrees.  The intersection of two local streets shall not be at an angle of less than 60 degrees. 

E.       Minimum curb and right-of-way line radii at the intersec­tion of two local streets shall be at least 25 feet and minimum curve radius at an intersec­tion of a local street and a collector street or arterial street shall be at least 35 feet. Industrial roads or roads being subject to truck traffic shall provide a minimum curb radius of 55 feet.  [Ord. 98-7]

F.       There shall be provided and maintained at all intersections clear sight triangles of 75 feet in all directions mea­sured along the centerline from the point of intersection.  Nothing which obstructs the vision of a motorist shall be permitted in this area. 

G.       Intersections shall be designed with a minimum grade wherever practical. If topography requires grade changes, the following shall be used:

(1)      Where the approach grade of any street is a plus 5% percent or greater, a level­ing area shall be provided for a mini­mum dis­tance of 75 feet, mea­sured from the edge of paved shoulder or curb line of the intersected street, at a grade not greater than 3% percent.

(2)      Vertical curves shall be used where the approach grade exceeds a minus 2%. The vertical curve shall be located to place the low point of the sag vertical curve a minimum of 25 feet from and at an elevation lower than the edge of paved shoulder or curb line of the intersected street.

7.       Pavement Design.

A.      All components of the pavement structure shall be designed and constructed in conformance with the most current Pennsylvania Department of Transportation Specifications, Publication 408 and Publication 72 Roadway Construction Standards. Bituminous Mix Design and Roadway Materials being used shall adhere to the most current approved PA Department of Transportation Specifications at the time of placement. The materials shall be supplied by a Penn Dot approved plant, and certificated in writing as meeting PennDOT specifications.

B.       Minimum Requirements: The following shall be considered minimum standards for street construction in Hampden Township. Where different standards are required by Penn Dot, the Penn Dot specifications will apply and be met.

**Superpave mix design based on ESALs must be approved by the Township prior to

construction.  [Ord11-05]

8.       Driveways and Alleys.

A.      Driveways serving properties located adjacent to an intersec­tion shall be offset from the inter­section not less than 40 feet from the intersec­tion of the right-of-­way lines. 

B.       Alleys are prohibited in residential developments. 

9.       Backfilling in Proposed Right-of-Ways.

A.      Cartway and Shoulder (if applicable).  All openings or exca­vations shall be backfi­lled with a crushed ag­gregate (2A Modified).  The ma­terials shall be placed and compacted in layers, each of which shall not exceed 6 inches in depth.  [Ord. 99-07]

B.       Nonpaved Areas.  All openings or excavations shall be backfilled with onsite backfill material.  Onsite backfill material is onsite exca­vated soil or soil-rock mixed materials free of topsoil, plant life, lumber, metal, refuse, and rock or similar hard objects larger than 6 inches in any dimen­sion.

C.       Ninety-five percent compaction must be achieved in  all backfilled areas.

§507. LOT GRADING FOR SUBDIVISIONS AND LAND DEVELOPMENTS.

1.       Blocks and lots shall be graded to provide proper drainage away from buildings and to prevent the collection of stormwater in pools.  Minimum 2% slopes away from the structures shall be required, for a distance of 10 feet. 

2.       Lot grading shall be of such design as to carry surface waters to the nearest practical street, storm drain or natural watercourse.  Where drainage swales are used to deliver surface waters away from the buildings, their grade shall not be less than 1% nor more than 4%.  The swales shall be sodded, planted or lined as required.  A grading and drainage plan shall be required for all land develop­ments.

3.       No final grading shall be permitted with a cut face steeper in slope than two horizontal to one vertical except under one or more of the following conditions:

A.      The material in which the excavation is made is sufficiently stable to sustain a slope of steeper than two horizontal to one vertical and a written statement of a professional engineer, licensed by the Common­wealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion control, to that effect is submitted to the Township Engineer and approved by him.  The statement shall state that the site has been inspected and that the deviation from the slope specified hereinbefore will not result in injury to persons or damage to property. 

B.       A concrete or stone masonry wall constructed according to sound engineer­ing standards for which plans are submitted to the Township Engineer for review and approval is provided. 

4.       No final grading shall be permitted which creates any exposed fill surface steeper in slope than three horizontal to one vertical except under one of the following conditions:

A.      A written, sealed statement from a professional engineer, licensed by the Com­mon­wealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in erosion control, is submitted to the Township certifying that he has inspected the site and that the proposed deviation from the slope specified above will not endanger any property, adjoining property, street or structure or result in property damage, which statement shall be subject to approval by the Township Engineer. 

B.       A wall is constructed to support the face of the fill, the design for which wall shall be submitted in writing under seal of a professional engineer licensed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and experienced in retaining wall design and subject to approval by the Township Engineer. 

5.       The top or bottom edge of slopes shall be a minimum of three (3) feet from property or right-of-way lines of streets or alleys in order to permit the normal rounding of the edge without encroaching on the abutting property except only when: (a) necessary to provide street access to the property; or (b) when the adjoining property is also owned by the same owner as that property upon which the grading is proposed, in which event an easement noting the area of any grading necessary on adjoining property shall be required.  All areas where walls or slopes are steeper than one (1) horizontal to one (1) vertical and five (5) feet or more in height, shall be protected by a protective fence no less than three (3) feet in height approved by the Township Engineer.

§508. BLOCKS AND LOTS.

1.       The length, width, shape and design of blocks shall be determined with due regard to the provision of adequate sites for buildings of the type proposed, to the land use and/or zoning requirements of the Township, the topography of the land being developed and the requirements for safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 

2.       Unless the topography of the land being developed or the existing pattern of develop­ment in the immediately adjacent area shall be otherwise than herein required, the following minimum standards for the design and size of blocks and lots shall prevail:

A.      Blocks shall not exceed 1600 feet in length nor be less than 500 feet in length. 

B.       Residential blocks shall generally be of sufficient depth to accommo­date two tiers of lots except where reverse frontage lots bordering an arterial or collector street are used or where, due to the contour of the land or the necessary layout of the subdivision, there is insufficient depth between intersecting streets for such two tier design. 

C.       Blocks for commercial and industrial areas may vary from the elements of design contained in this section if the nature of the use requires other treatment.  In such cases, off-street parking for employees and customers shall be provided along with safe and convenient limited access to the street system.  Space for off-street loading shall also be provided with limited access to the street system.  Extension of streets, railroad access right-of-way and utilities shall be provided as necessary. 

D.      Lot lines intersecting street lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 

E.       Lots shall, in general, front on a street which has already been dedicated to the Township or which the developer proposes to dedicate to the Town­ship in connection with approval of the final plan.  In commercial or industrial land developments where access is proposed to be provided by private streets within the land development, these requirements may be waived by the Township Commissioners.    [Ord. 98-7]

F.       The Township shall assign house numbers to each lot within a develop­ment. 

G.       Minimum lot sizes shall be in accordance with the Township Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27].

I.        Double frontage lots are prohibited except in accordance with §508(2)(B) above.

J.        No residential lots shall be created which access upon an arterial street as defined in §504(1)(A)(1) herein.  Where lots must access onto a collector street, a turnaround area must be provided in addition to the driveway area. 

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §508; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§509. DEVELOPMENT ON PRIVATE STREETS PROHIBITED.

1.       It is the policy of this Township that all subdivided lands shall have immediate access to a public street, except only with regard to subdivisions along existing private streets, as limited by subsection (2).

2.       No subdivision will be approved on an existing private street or road if more than two lots already front such street or road or, if after subdivision, more than two lots will front on such private street or road.

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §509; as amended by Ord. 95-5, 7/27/1995, §1)

 

§510. OPEN SPACE, LOT SITING, PLANTING AND BEAUTIFICATION FOR SUBDIVI­SION AND LAND DEVELOPMENTS.

1.       In order to promote the highest environmental quality possible, the degree to which the developer of a land development plan has preserved existing salient natural features and land forms intrinsic to the site shall be assessed.  Terms of approval of a plat may be subject to the manner in which the layout or design of the plan has preserved existing natural features such as, but not limited to trees, wooded areas and watercourse. 

2.       Open space developments are encouraged where permitted as a conditional use.  An open space development alternative is suggested at the sketch plan or prelimi­nary plan stage.

3.       Open Space.  Where the applicant is offering for dedication or is required by ordinance to establish a reservation of open space or preserve an area of scenic or historic importance, a "limit of work" which will confine excavation, earthmoving procedures and other changes to the landscape may be required to ensure preser­vation and prevent despoliation of the character of the area in open space. 

4.       Tree Preservation.  Whenever possible, trees shall not be removed unless they are located within the proposed street right-of-way, within the proposed building area or within utility locations and equipment access areas.  In areas where trees are retained, the original grade level shall be maintained, if possible, so as not to disturb the trees.

5.       Topsoil Preservation. All of the topsoil from areas where cuts and fills have been made should be stockpiled and redistributed uniformly after grading.  All areas of the site shall be stabilized by seeding or planting on slopes of less than ten (10) percent and shall be stabilized by sodding on slopes 10% or more and planted in ground cover on slopes 20% or greater. 

6.       Landscaping.  For all multifamily, apartment, office, commercial and industrial land developments, a landscaping plan shall be provided and shall include sufficient plantings for the required open space, planting strips, screenings, formal gardens, shade trees and natural barriers. 

7.       Buffer Planting Requirements.  Buffer yard requirements should be as specified in the Township Zoning Ordinance [Chapter 27]. 

8.       Preserved Landscaping.  When there is a conscientious effort to preserve the existing natural integrity and character of a site and where such preservation effectuates areas of woodland and trees comparable to required planting improve­ments, i.e., landscap­ing and buffer screening, the plan may be received in lieu of additional landscaping requirements. 

9.       Trees.  The planting of trees within the street right-of-way line shall not be permit­ted.  The planting of any trees within the private property of each residential lot shall be at the discretion of the property owner or developer.

10.     Watercourse Protection. Where a land development is traversed by a natural water­course, there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-of-way con­forming substantially with the line of such watercourse and of such width, as stated in §506 and, as will be adequate to preserve natural drainage.  Such easement shall be in addition to the open space required in §510(2). 

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §510)

 

§511. CONTRIBUTION FOR RECREATION PURPOSES.

1.         It is the policy of this Township to provide recreational facilities for all the residents of the Township.  Centralized facilities are preferred over local neighbor­hood facilities.  New and additional facilities are required in direct proportion to increases in population and workforce.  Developers causing such increases must share in the cost of additional recreational facilities.

2.         A contribution for recreational purposes shall be made at the rate of $1,000.00 per dwelling unit with respect to residential subdivisions or land developments and $1,500.00 per acre minimum or fraction thereof with respect to nonresidential subdivisions or land developments, which fee shall be payable as a condition of recording of the approved final plan and shall be calculated on the basis of the entire area of the lot regardless of disturbed area. The Board of Commissioners may change the rate set forth above from time to time by Resolution. 

3.         Except as provided in subsection 4, when an applicant or developer provides the Township with evidence that a recreation contribution has been paid for a specific lot of record then the Township will not require any additional contribution for future land development on that lot of record.

4.         A.        When a residential subdivision creates new lots of record, each new lot of record shall be subject to a contribution as provided in this section, less a contribution for the original lot of record if evidence of a contribution for the original lot is provided; otherwise, all new lots of record shall be subject to a contribution for each lot.

      B.         In the event of a residential reverse subdivision, each newly formed lot of record shall be subject to a contribution as provided in this section, less a contribution for the original lot or lots of record if evidence of a contribution for the original lot or lots is provided; otherwise, all newly formed lots of record shall be subject to a contribution for each lot.

      C.         In the event of a commercial reverse subdivision, only the original lot or lots of record for which no previous contribution has been made shall be subject to a contribution as provided in this section. 

5.   The requirements of Section 511.2 shall be noted upon the final subdivision or land development plan.

(Ord. 95-1, 2/2/1995, §511, as amended by Ord. 00-07, 03/02/2000, §1; by Ord. 06-01, 01/03/2006, §1; and by Ord. 08-02, 01/07/08, §1-deleted in its entirety and replaced by

§512. EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL.

1.       General Purpose.

A.      The Township Commissioners find that the minimization of erosion and control of sedimentation in connection with land development is in the public interest affecting public health, safety and welfare and, therefore, those regulations governing erosion control and sedimentation control are necessary for the Township. 

B.       No changes shall be made in the contour of the land, no grading, excavat­ing, removal or destruction to the topsoil, trees or other vegetative cover of the land shall be commenced until such time that a plan for minimizing erosion and sedimentation has been processed with and reviewed by the Township Engineer and/or Cumberland County Soil Conservation District or there has been a determination by the above entities that such plans are not necessary. 

C.       No land development plan shall be approved unless there has been an erosion and sedimentation control plan approved by the Township Engi­neer that provides for minimizing erosion and sedimentation consis­tent with this §512 and an improvement bond or other acceptable securities are deposited with the Township in the form of an escrow guarantee which will ensure installation and completion of the required improvements.

D.      Where not specified in this Chapter, measures used to control erosion and sedimentation shall as a minimum meet the standards and specifications of the Cumberland County Soil Conservation District.  The Township Engi­neer, or other officials as designated, shall ensure compliance with the appropriate specifications, copies of which are available from the Soil Conservation District.

E.       All aspects of the approved soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be installed, wherever possible, prior to beginning actual vegetation stripping, regrading or similar excavation activities. Installation of the control features shall be included in the construction time schedule re­quired under §610.

2.       Performance Principles.  The following measures are effective in minimiz­ing erosion and sedimentation and shall be included where applicable in the control plan:

A.      Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be done in such a way that will prevent all but minor erosion, and must be accom­plished according to the construction time schedule required under this §610.  All construction schedules proposing earth disturbance between October 1 and March 31 must be approved by the Township Engineer prior to any site activity. The developer may be restricted from disturbing stabilized areas during this period.

B.       Development plans shall preserve salient natural features, keep cut-fill opera­tions to a minimum and ensure conformity with topography so as to create the least erosion potential and adequately handle the volume and velocity of surface water runoff. 

C.       Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supple­mented.  

D.      The disturbed area and the duration of exposure shall be kept to a practical minimum.  In no event shall said exposure be more than 20 days.  Planting of all disturbed areas must be completed by October 1.

E.       Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable. 

F.       Temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to protect exposed critical areas during development. 

G.       The permanent final vegetation and structural erosion control and drainage measures shall be installed as soon as practical in the development. 

H.      Provisions shall be made to effectively accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after develop­ment.  Where necessary, the rate of surface water runoff will be structurally retarded. 

I.        Sediment in the runoff water shall be trapped until the disturbed area is stabi­lized by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps or similar measures.

J.        All public streets and/or rights-of-ways shall be kept mud, dirt and dust free during construction. Construction entrances shall be installed and maintained to provide for mud, dirt and dust free public streets and/or rights-of-ways.

3.       Grading for Erosion and Other Environmental Controls.  In order to provide suitable sites for building and other uses, improve surface drainage and control erosion, the following requirements shall be met:

A.      Streets shall be improved to a mud-free or otherwise permanent passable condition. All construction shall be installed in accordance with §504(7) and as approved in the final plan. 

B.       Provisions shall be made to prevent surface water from damaging the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills by installa­tion of tempo­rary or permanent drainage across or above these areas. 

C.       Fill shall be placed and compacted so as to minimize sliding protec­tion against erosion during periods of flooding. 

D.      During grading operations, necessary measures for dust control will be exer­cised. 

E.       Grading equipment will not be allowed to enter into flowing streams.  Provi­sions will be made for the installation of temporary or permanent culverts or bridges. 

4.       Responsibility.

A.      Whenever sedimentation damage is caused by stripping vegetation, grad­ing or other development, it shall be the collective responsibili­ty of the developer and of the contractor, person, corporation and other entity causing such sedimenta­tion to remove it from all adjoining surfaces, drainage systems and watercourses and to repair any dam­age at his expense as quickly as possible. 

B.       Maintenance of all erosion and sedimentation control facilities during the construction and development period is the responsibili­ty of the land developer or subdivider. 

C.       It is the responsibility of any developer and any person, corporation or other entity doing any act on or across a communal stream, water­course or swale or upon the floodplain or right-of-way to maintain as nearly as possible in its present state the stream, water­course, swale, floodplain or right-of-way during the pendency of the activity to return it to its original or equal condition after such activity is  com­pleted. 

D.      The land developer shall provide and install, at his expense in accor­dance with Township requirements, all drainage and erosion control improve­ments (temporary and permanent) shown on the erosion and sediment control plan. 

5.       Compliance with Regulations and Procedures.  The instal­lation and design of the re­quired erosion and sediment control measures shall be in accor­dance with standards and specifica­tions of the Cumberland County Soil and Conservation District.

Once the preliminary styles are reviewed by the Township, and the Township provides the applicant with written comments, additional and more detailed preliminary plan, architectural renderings, prepared by a registered architect, shall be submitted for all proposed buildings, together with a list and samples of types of exterior building materials that will be visible from any public street. Similarly, a rendered landscape plan, prepared by a registered landscape architect shall also be submitted for review. An outdoor lighting plan shall also be submitted for review.

Township approval of proposed architectural and streetscape design is required for the land development application to be approved.
Overall Site Coordination: The site shall be designed as a unified development, with a coordinated site design, landscape plan, signage, wayfinding, lighting, site amenities, paving and other similar site features

Location of Parking: The site shall be designed to minimize the view of parking lots from the street. Parking shall be concentrated to the side and rear of the building(s) and behind the front yard setback line.

Vehicle Access:In order to facilitate efficient internal traffic circulation and minimize road traffic for short trips, all parking areas shall be designed to connect directly to parking areas on adjacent lots. If a connection is not possible at the time of land development, site design provisions shall be made for a future connection to adjacent properties.Permanent cross-access easements between properties shall be enacted. Shared or common driveways shall be provided.

If a lot is developed or redeveloped, any new vehicular access point shall be located along a side lot line in order to create a shared driveway with the adjacent lot.

Pedestrian Circulation: A safe and direct pedestrian access shall be provided from the trails and sidewalks to the building entrances and exits.

When 150 feet or more of new building wall is constructed between a sidewalk or pedestrian / bicycle way and parking at the rear of the building, a pedestrian access way shall be provided (i.e., through a lobby or via an alley) from the pedestrian way to the parking facilities.

Accessibility: An accessible route shall be provided for persons with disabilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local standards.

Buildings and Streetscape Design Standards: Treatments between any building and the street edge shall utilize the following design standards: 
Building Orientation and Access.

Buildings shall be designed with windows, public access points and signage facing streets, sidewalks and pedestrian ways.

Grade level exterior doors that swing onto a public walkway are prohibited.

The Primary Building Entrance.

A primary pedestrian building entrance shall be located on one or more primary front facades facing the street and pedestrian way, rather than the rear or sides of the building, and shall be well articulated and visible from the street as described herein. Secondary access points may be located along other facades.

In multiuse buildings, each building use and street floor tenant space shall have at least one functional entrance directly visible and accessible from the street. Where tenant entrances are via common lobbies, lobby entrances shall create architectural emphasis through design features such as changes in building plane, step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies, towers, bays, or similar features.

If the primary building entrance is not located along the primary front façade then the applicant must demonstrate that the primary building entrance may not feasibly be located along the primary front façade and the primary building entrance shall be located to the side of the building in accordance with the following:

Buildings with the primary building entrance on the side shall be visually emphasized to make the entry visible from adjacent and nearby public roadways. Architectural emphasis shall be achieved through design features such as changes in building plane, step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies, towers, building entries, bays, or similar features.

Buildings with the main entry on the side shall be accessible by a public walkway connecting the sidewalk along the site’s street frontage to the parking areas.

Building Architectural Design Standards: The architectural design standards are intended to ensure that the size, proportions and design of new or substantially improved buildings create a pedestrian-friendly environment, that is highly articulated as described herein. The visual mass of all buildings shall be de-emphasized through the use of architectural elements including building form, architectural features and materials, in order to reduce their apparent bulk and volume, to enhance visual quality and contribute to human scale development in accordance with the following: 
All structures proposed under the same land development application shall consist of a unified and coordinated architectural theme.

Exterior Building Materials: The predominant material of all facades facing public streets shall be brick, stone, highly textured masonry block, curtain wall, metal panel systems with concealed fasteners, glazed panels, cement-board siding or wood.Stucco or dryvit may be utilized provided it is no more than 20% of non-window facades at the street floor level and no more than 50% of non-window facades above the street floor level.

All sides of a building shall be architecturally designed to be consistent with regard to style, materials, colors and details. The architectural treatment of the front facade shall be continuous in its major features around all visibly exposed sides of a building with the exception of parking structures or that portion of a building containing a parking structure. Blank walls or service area treatment of side and/or rear elevations visible from public view shall be prohibited.

Vertical Articulation: Buildings are required to provide articulation on the exterior of any wall surface in order to provide architectural interest and variety to the massing of a building and to relieve the effect of a single, long monotonous wall or roof. Blank facades, without windows or architectural elements to create interest, are prohibited.

The massing of any one building wall shall not exceed 50 feet (horizontal dimension) without a vertical articulation along its entire height. Vertical articulation may include a change of building façade plane or material.The depth of change in façade plane for vertical wall articulation shall be a minimum of 2’-0”. Such articulation may consist of building wall offsets, recesses and projections such as bays, balconies, canopies, awnings, pilasters, columns and other similar features.

Building corners located at the intersections of public streets shall incorporate the following:

Building corners shall be chamfered at least 10’ from the corner setback.The chamfer shall extend from the ground to the top of the building unless the following features are incorporated:

Building corner chamfers may be limited to the street level story only if the portion of building corners above the street level story is visually emphasized through design features, such as step backs, fenestration patterns, balconies, towers, building entries, bays, or similar features.

Horizontal Articulation: Horizontal articulation of the building facade, including changes to the horizontal building plane and/or materials, shall be used to break up the scale of the building facade. Such horizontal articulation may be provided by roof terraces, setbacks or other devices. Horizontal
articulation shall emphasize the building base, body and roof/parapet edge.

Buildings greater than 40 feet in height shall be designed utilizing a definition of the base, body and roof or parapet edge (or similar designations) as the primary method of defining and relating buildings to one another.

The base shall generally be considered the first story of the facade facing a public street, but can vary depending on the overall building height and range from ground plane to the floor line of the third floor in buildings of at least four stories in height. The design of the base should be emphasized through the design, quality and durability of its materials to create visual interest. The transition from the base of a building to the body may be expressed either horizontally, through a shift in the horizontal plane and/or through a change in building materials.

The top of a building greater than 40 feet in height shall be architecturally distinguished by providing a visual termination to the facade and interest at the skyline by incorporation of highly detailed architectural elements that are visible from street level.

Any building measuring taller than 40 feet in height shall provide an expression line on the wall plane, continuing around all sides of a building above the first or second floor. The expression line may consist of a projecting element, a minimum 4 inches in depth, such as a belt course or cornice as well as a terrace that sets back the walls of the building above the expression line.

Roofs:

Rooflines shall be articulated vertically with a change in roof line every 50’.This requirement does not apply to flat roofs.

On buildings with flat roofs, all visibly exposed walls shall have an articulated cornice that projects a minimum of 4 inches horizontally from the top of the vertical building wall.

Fixed or retractable canvas / fabric awnings are permitted at street floor level and on upper levels where appropriate, if they complement a building’s architectural features. On buildings with multiple storefronts, or on adjacent buildings on the same lot, compatible awnings shall be used as a means of unifying the structures. Metal or internally lit non-fabric awnings are prohibited.

All roof-top mechanical equipment, including antennas, shall be visually and acoustically screened from view of both the public right-of-way and adjacent properties. Screening may be accomplished by using parapets, walls or roof elements. Such screening shall be integral to the architectural design of the building.

Vegetated roofs are encouraged and may be used for stormwater mitigation based on conformance with applicable stormwater regulations.

Proportions of Walls to Openings for Street Level Facades:

A street level façade is the building wall or walls where there are primary and secondary customer entrances and where they are the prominent facades as viewed from streets or parking areas.

A wall to clear window/door ratio of between 2 to 1 and 4 to 1 is required. For street floor level commercial and retail uses, a wall to clear window ratio between 1 to 1 and 2 to 1 is required.

The maximum length of a blank wall between clear window/door openings shall be 15’

Elements such as pent eaves, pediments, or sills and lintels above and below windows and doors are required.

Windows:

For Retail and Commercial uses. smoked, reflective, tinted or black glass in windows at street level is prohibited.Glazing shall have a minimum visible transmittance of .75 and also meet energy code compliance.

Any street level facades with less than 50% of clear windows shall be articulated by two or more of the following:

Articulation of building facade plane, and/or changes in materials;

If the building is occupied by a commercial use at street level,
recessed or projecting display window cases or simulated windows.

Outdoor trash storage area screening shall be provided as required by the MU Mixed Use Zoning Overlay Ordinance. Screen design shall consist of a unified and coordinated architectural theme and durable materials that are compatible with the design of the buildings that they serve.

Parking Structures: The following shall apply to parking structures

Architectural elevations shall be provided to demonstrate that front facades of parking structures sufficiently screen vehicles in the parking garage from view of the street and shall demonstrate that parking structures are architecturally compatible with the character of surrounding buildings and meet the architectural design guidelines for mixed use districts.

If the front façade of the parking structure is within the minimum or maximum front yard setback, at least 75% of first (ground) floor of the structure shall contain other permitted uses.

Other architectural design standards for parking structures are as follows:

Horizontal façade articulation of the parking structure, including changes in building plane and materials, shall be used. The depth of such articulation shall be a minimum of 2’-0”, and occur at a maximum horizontal 50’ interval.

Vertical architectural features of the parking structure façade, including changes in building materials, shall be used. The change in architectural articulation shall occur at a maximum of every 20’ of height.

The Primary Front Facade of a Parking Structure shall be pedestrian oriented and scaled.

The visual impact of sloping floors from any public access way shall be minimized through design treatment of the parking structure’s facade.

Requirements for sidewalks and trails:
Pedestrian crosswalks: Pedestrian crosswalks shall be marked with a textured paving treatment. Pedestrian crosswalks shall also be installed where sidewalks intersect driveways and roadways.

ARTICLE I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 101. Short Title

This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Hampden Township Stormwater Management Ordinance.”

Section 102. Statement of Findings

The Board of Commissioners of Hampden Township finds that:

A. Inadequate management of accelerated runoff of stormwater resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to carry and control stormwater, undermines flood plain management and flood control efforts in downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, threatens public health and safety, and increases non-point source pollution of water resources.

B. A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated runoff, is fundamental to the public health, safety and welfare and the protection of people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.

C. Stormwater is an important water resource, which provides groundwater recharge for water supplies and base flow of streams, which also protects and maintains surface water quality.

D. Federal and state regulations require certain municipalities to implement a program of stormwater controls. These municipalities are required to obtain a permit for stormwater discharges from their separate storm sewer systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).

E. Non-stormwater discharges to storm sewer systems can contribute to pollution of water of the Commonwealth.


Section 103. Purpose

The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote health, safety, and welfare within Hampden Township and its watershed by minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits described in Section 102 of this Ordinance, through provisions designed to:

A. Meet legal water quality requirements under state law, including regulations at 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect, maintain, reclaim and restore the existing and designated uses of the waters of this Commonwealth.

B. Preserve the natural drainage systems as much as possible.

C. Manage stormwater runoff close to the source.

D. Provide procedures and performance standards for stormwater planning and management.

E. Maintain groundwater recharge, to prevent degradation of surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water resources.

F. Prevent scour and erosion of stream banks and streambeds.

G. Provide proper operation and maintenance of all permanent Stormwater Management (SWM) Best Management Practices (BMPs) that are implemented within the Municipality.

H. Provide standards to meet NPDES permit requirements.

I. Meet general water quality and soil disturbance goals by implementing measures to:

1. Minimize disturbance to floodplains, wetlands, natural slopes over 15%, and existing native vegetation.

2. Preserve and maintain trees and woodlands by, for example, maintaining or extending riparian buffers, protecting existing forested buffers and by providing trees and woodlands adjacent to impervious areas whenever feasible.

3. Establish and maintain non-erosive flow conditions in natural flow pathways.

4. Minimize soil disturbance and soil compaction.

5. Direct runoff to pervious areas, wherever possible.

6. Incorporate the techniques for Low Impact Development Practices described in the most current version of “The Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual” (SWM Manual) 1. (Any footnote reference in this Ordinance is a reference to a corresponding number for a publication contained in Article IX – References.)

7. Minimize thermal impacts to waters of the Commonwealth.

Section 104. Statutory Authority

A. Primary Authority.

Hampden Township is empowered to regulate these activities by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S. Section 680.1, et seq., as amended, the “Storm Water Management Act” and the First Class Township Code.

Hereafter, all earth disturbance activities and land development within Hampden Township, including without limitation, the location, design and construction within the watershed of storm water management systems, obstructions, flood control projects, subdivisions and land developments, highways and transportation facilities, facilities for the provision of public utility services and facilities owned or financed in whole or in part by funds from the Commonwealth, shall be in full compliance with the requirements of Cumberland County Storm Water

Management Plan and this Ordinance and shall be conducted in a manner consistent therewith. Any violation of the Cumberland County Storm Water Management Plan shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance.

B. Secondary Authority.

Hampden Township also is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, No. 247, the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.

Section 105. Applicability

All regulated activities and all activities that may affect stormwater runoff, including land development and earth disturbance activity, are subject to regulation by this Ordinance as is reasonably necessary to prevent injury to health, safety or other property. The following activities are defined as “regulated activities” and shall be subject to the provisions of this Ordinance (unless otherwise exempted by Section 302):

A. Land development and/or redevelopment
B. Subdivision
C. Construction of new or additional impervious or semi-pervious surfaces (driveways, parking lots, etc.)
D. Construction of structures or additions to existing structures, as determined by the municipality
E. Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel
F. Installation of stormwater management facilities or appurtenances thereto
G. Forest management/timber operations that include logging road construction and timber harvesting
H. Earth disturbance activities

Section 106. Repealer

Any other ordinance provision(s) or regulation of Hampden Township inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Ordinance is hereby repealed to the extent of the inconsistency only.

Section 107. Severability

In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction declares any section or provision of this Ordinance invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of this Ordinance.

Section 108. Compatibility with Other Requirements

Approvals issued and actions taken under this Ordinance do not relieve the Applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other code, law, regulation or ordinance. To the extent that this Ordinance imposes more rigorous or stringent requirements for stormwater management, the specific requirements contained in this Ordinance shall prevail and be followed.


Section 109. Erroneous Permit

Any permit or authorization issued, or approved based upon false, misleading or erroneous information provided by an applicant is void without the necessity of any proceedings for revocation. Any work undertaken or use established pursuant to such authorization is unlawful.


Section 110. Waiver Procedure


A. If the Municipality determines that any requirement under this Ordinance cannot be achieved for a particular regulated activity, the Municipality may, after an evaluation of alternatives, approve measures other than those in this Ordinance subject to Section110, paragraphs B and C.

B. Waivers or modifications of the requirements of this Ordinance may be approved by the Township if enforcement will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, provided that the modifications will not be contrary to the public interest and that the purpose of the Ordinance is preserved. Cost or financial burden shall not be considered a hardship. Modification may be considered if an alternative standard or approach will provide equal or better achievement of the purpose of the Ordinance. A request for modifications shall be in writing and accompany the Stormwater Management Site Plan submission. The request shall provide the facts on which the request is based, the provision(s) of the Ordinance involved and the proposed modification.

C. It shall be the burden of the applicant to demonstrate compliance with the above conditions.


Section 111. Subsequent or Amended Publications, Standards, Laws, Codes and
Regulations.

Any reference in this Ordinance to any publication, manual, standard, law, code or regulation shall include any and all subsequent amendments, supplements and successor publications, standards, laws, codes and regulations thereto without the need to amend this Ordinance to make specific reference thereto.

The chief consideration is the inherent capacity of soil bare of vegetation to permit infiltration.  Infiltration rates of soils vary widely and are affected by subsurface permeability as well as surface intake rates.  Soils are classified into four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum infiltration rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting.  The NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the soils in the United States and their group classification.  The soils in the area of the development site may be identified from a soil survey report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or conservation district offices.  Soils become less pervious as the HSG varies from A to D (NRCS 3, 4).

Impervious Surface (Impervious Area) - A surface that prevents the infiltration of water into the ground.  Impervious surfaces (or areas) shall include, but not be limited to, roofs, patios, additional indoor living spaces, garages, storage sheds and similar structures, and streets, sidewalks, driveways, parking areas, and paved surfaces.

Section 303.  Volume Controls

Water volume controls shall be implemented using the Design Storm Method in Subsection 1 or the Simplified Method in Subsection 2 below for all Regulated Activities not otherwise exempted by Section 302.  For Regulated Activity areas equal to or less than one (1) acre that do not require hydrologic routing to design the stormwater facilities, this Ordinance establishes no preference for either methodology; therefore, the applicant may select either methodology on the basis of economic considerations, the intrinsic limitations on applicability of the analytical procedures associated with each methodology, and other factors.

A.        The Design Storm Method (see Section 8.7 of the most current version of the SWM Manual1) is applicable to any size of Regulated Activity.  This method requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.

1.         Do not increase the post-development total runoff volume for all storms equal to or less than the 2-year 24-hour duration precipitation.

2.         For modeling purposes:

i.          Existing (pre-development) non-forested pervious areas must be considered meadow or its equivalent.

ii.         Twenty (20) percent of existing impervious area, when present, shall be considered meadow in the model for existing conditions.

B.        The Simplified Method (see Section 8.7 of the most current version of the SWM Manual1) provided below is independent of site conditions and should be used if the Design Storm Method is not followed.  This method is not applicable to Regulated Activities greater than one (1) acre or for projects that require design of stormwater detention or rate control facilities.  For new impervious surfaces:

1.         Stormwater facilities shall be sized to capture at least the first two inches (2”) of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.

2.         At least the first one inch (1.0”) of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff flow -- i.e. it shall not be released into the surface waters of this Commonwealth.  Removal options include reuse, evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration

3.         Infiltration facilities should be designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least the first one-half inch (0.5”) of the permanently removed runoff shall be infiltrated.

4.         The second one inch (1.0”) of runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be detained using structural and non-structural BMPs (as outlined in the most current version of the SWM Manual) and released at a controlled rate.

 

Section 304.  Rate Controls (see Section 8.3 of the most current version of the SWM Manual1)   

A.        Areas not covered by a Release Rate Map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan:

Post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates for the 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, 25- and 100-year storms.  If it is shown that the peak rates of discharge indicated by the post-development analysis are less than or equal to the peak rates of discharge indicated by the pre-development analysis for 1-, 2-, 5, 10-, 25-, 50-,and 100-year, 24-hour storms, then the requirements of this section have been met.  Otherwise, the applicant shall provide additional controls as necessary to satisfy the peak rate of discharge requirement.

B.       Areas covered by the Cedar Run Watershed Release Rate Map from an approved Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan (see Appendix C):

 

For the 1-, 2-, 5, 10-, 25, 50, and 100-year storms, the post-development peak discharge rates will follow the applicable approved release rate maps (see Appendix  C).  For any areas not shown on the release rate maps, the post-development discharge rates shall not exceed the predevelopment discharge rates. 

 

 Section 305.  Riparian Buffers

A.        In order to protect and improve water quality, a Riparian Buffer Easement shall be created and recorded as part of any subdivision or land development that encompasses a Riparian Buffer.

B.        Except as required by Chapter 102, the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be measured to be the greater of the limit of the 100 year floodplain or a minimum of 35 feet from the top of the streambank (on each side).

C.        Minimum Management Requirements for Riparian Buffers.

Existing native vegetation shall be protected and maintained within the Riparian Buffer Easement.

Whenever practicable invasive vegetation shall be actively removed and the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be planted with native trees, shrubs and other vegetation to create a diverse native plant community appropriate to the intended ecological context of the site.
D.        The Riparian Buffer Easement shall be enforceable by the municipality and shall be recorded in the appropriate County Recorder of Deeds Office, so that it shall run with the land and shall limit the use of the property located therein.  The easement shall allow for the continued private ownership and shall count toward the minimum lot area a required by Zoning, unless otherwise specified in the municipal Zoning Ordinance.

E.         Any permitted use within the Riparian Buffer Easement shall be conducted in a manner that will maintain the extent of the existing 100-year floodplain, improve or maintain the stream stability, and preserve and protect the ecological function of the floodplain.

F.         The following conditions shall apply when public and/or private recreation trails are permitted within Riparian Buffers:

Trails shall be for non-motorized use only.
2.   Trails shall be designed to have the least impact on native plant species and other sensitive environmental features.

G.        Septic drainfields and sewage disposal systems shall not be permitted within the Riparian Buffer Easement and shall comply with setback requirements established under 25 Pa. Code Chapter 73.

 

Section 306.  Stormwater Management Districts

Hampden Township has been divided into two (2) stormwater management districts as shown on the Cedar Run Watershed Release Rate Map in Appendix C. All areas of the Municipality not specifically identified on the Watershed Release Rate Map are assumed to be in the 100% Release Rate District.

Standards for managing runoff from each subarea for the 1, 2, 10 and 100-year design storms are shown below.  Development sites located in each of the districts must control post-development runoff rates to pre-development runoff rates for the design storms as follows:

 

DISTRICT

CONTROL CRITERIA

100%

Post-development peak discharge for all design storms must be no greater than pre-development peak discharges.

75%

Post-development peak discharge for all design storms must be no greater than 75 percent of the pre-development peak discharges.

 

Section 306.  Stormwater Management District Implementation Provisions (Performance Standards)

General - Post-development rates of runoff from any regulated activity shall not exceed the peak release rates of runoff prior to development for the design storms specified on the Stormwater Runoff Peak Rate Districts Map, Ordinance Appendix C and Section 304 of the Ordinance.

District Boundaries - The boundaries of the Stormwater Management Districts are shown on the Cedar Run Watershed Release Rate Map, which is available for inspection at the municipal office.A copy of the Map at a reduced scale in included in the Ordinance Appendix C.

Sites Located in More Than 1 District - For a proposed development site located within two or more release rate districts, the peak discharge rate from any subarea shall be the pre-development peak discharge for that subarea multiplied by the applicable release rate.The calculated peak discharges shall apply regardless of whether the grading plan changes the drainage area by subarea.An exception to the above may be granted if discharges from multiple subareas re-combine in proximity to the site.In this case, peak discharge in any direction may be a 100% release rate provided that the overall site discharge meets the weighted average release rate.

Off-Site Areas - Off-site Areas that drain through a proposed development site are not subject to release rate criteria when determining allowable peak runoff rates.However, on-site drainage facilities shall be designed to safely convey off-site flows through the development site.

Site Areas - Where the site area to be impacted by a proposed development activity differs significantly from the total site area, only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the release rate criteria.

"Downstream Hydraulic Capacity Analysis" - Any downstream capacity hydraulic analysis conducted in accordance with this Ordinance shall use the following criteria for determining adequacy for accepting increased peak flow rates:
Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased runoff associated with a 2-year return period event within their banks at velocities consistent with protection of the channels from erosion.Acceptable velocities shall be based upon criteria included in the DEP Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual.

Natural or man-made channels or swales must be able to convey the increased 25-year return period runoff without creating any hazard to persons or property.

Culverts, bridges, storm sewers or any other facilities which must pass or convey flows from the tributary area must be designed in accordance with DEP, Chapter 105 regulations (if applicable) and, at a minimum, pass the increased 25-year return period runoff.
G.        Regional Detention Alternatives - For certain areas, it may be more cost-effective to provide one control facility for more than one development site than to provide an individual control facility for each development site.  The initiative and funding for any regional runoff control alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers.  The design of any regional control basins must incorporate reasonable development of the entire upstream watershed.  The peak outflow of a regional basin would be determined on a case-by-case basis using the hydrologic model of the watershed consistent with protection of the downstream watershed areas.  "Hydrologic model" refers to the calibrated model as developed for the Stormwater Management Plan.

Pipes shall be designed with a minimum of 12 inches of cover between top of pipe and subgrade elevation for pipes within paved areas. Pipes outside paved areas shall have minimum of 12 inches of cover between top of pipe and finished ground elevation.

Inlet spacing shall be designed to limit spread of water on streets in accordance with PennDOT criteria.

Inlets, junction boxes or manholes shall be provided at all locations of pipe size change or direction change, whether horizontal or vertical.

Frames, covers and grates shall be provided in accordance with PennDOT standards. All inlets within paved areas shall have bicycle safe grates.
8.  Pipe materials shall be one of the following:

                         a. High-density polyethylene.

                         b. Reinforced concrete.

                         c. Aluminized steel..

                         d. Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC)December 20062ganization  who is considered a Public  Nuisance under this Ordinance is subject to the penaltuies stipulated in S

9.  Pipe trench excavation and backfill shall be in accordance with PennDOT Standards.

Waiver of Peak Rate Control Requirement – For certain development sites in close proximity to stream channels, the Municipality may consider a waiver of the peak rate control requirement, upon recommendation of the Municipal Engineer. Developer is responsible to demonstrate “no harm” by providing engineering analysis, in accordance with the following:

Developer must demonstrate that discharge without peak rate control will improve drainage conditions by draining the development site prior to peak stream flows from the upstream drainage area.

Developer must demonstrate that all drainage facilities downstream from the site have adequate capacity to safely convey the undetained increased peak flows for the storm events listed in Section 304. This analysis may be required for any drainage facility between the development site and the discharge point of the nearest receiving stream.
Approval of a detention waiver shall not relieve the developer from meeting the Volume Control (Section 303) requirements.

 

Section 307.  Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities

Detention and Retention Facilities

As approved by the municipal engineer

 

All calculations consistent with this Ordinance using the soil cover complex method shall use the appropriate design rainfall depths for the various return period storms presented in Table A-1 in Appendix B of this Ordinance.If a hydrologic computer model such as PSRM or HEC-1 is used for stormwater runoff calculations, then the duration of rainfall shall be 24 hours.The NRCS 'S' curve shall be used for the rainfall distribution.

For the purposes of predevelopment flow rate determination, undeveloped land shall be considered as "meadow" good condition, unless the natural ground cover generates a lower curve number or Rational 'C' value (i.e. forest).

All calculations using the Rational Method shall use rainfall intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland flow and return periods as specified in Section 301 J.Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, NRCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time by NRCS).Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's equation.

Runoff Curve Numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to be used in the soil cover complex method shall be obtained from Table A-2 in Appendix B of this Ordinance.

Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use in the Rational method shall be obtained from Table A-3 in Appendix B of this Ordinance.

Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydrauliccomputations, and to determine the capacity of open channels, pipes, and storm sewers. Values for Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table A-4 in Appendix B of this Ordinance.

Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance standards of this Ordinance using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.

The design of any stormwater detention facilities intended to meet the performance standards of this Ordinance shall be verified by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the Storage-Indication Method.For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.The municipality may approve the use of any generally accepted full hydrograph approximation technique that shall use a total runoff volume that is consistent with the volume from a method that produces a full hydrograph.

The Municipality has the authority to require that computed existing runoff rates be reconciled with field observations and conditions.If the designer can substantiate through actual physical calibration that more appropriate runoff and time-of-concentration values should be utilized at a particular site, then appropriate variations may be made upon review and recommendations of the Municipal Engineer.Calibration shall require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the particular site in question.

An Impervious Area Flash (IAF) analysis shall be conducted for all sites. The analysis requires that the watershed impervious area be modeled without the pervious areas. The time of concentration should also be determined from the impervious areas only. If the IAF analysis results in a higher post-development peak runoff rate, this higher value must be used for the final design/comparison.
 

Section 309.  Erosion and Sediment Control Requirements

Whenever the vegetation and topography are to be disturbed, such activity must be in conformance with Chapter 102, Title 25, Rules and Regulations, Part I, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Protection, Subpart C, protection of Natural Resources, Article II, Water Resources, Chapter 102, "Erosion Control," and in accordance with the Cumberland County Conservation District (CCCD) and the standards and specifications of the Municipality.

No regulated activities shall commence until Erosion and Sediment Control Plan consistent with this Ordinance is approved by the Municipality and the Cumberland County Conservation District, if applicable.

Evidence of any permits required by PaDEP or CCCD must be provided to the Municipality.

Plan review, approval and permitting functions under this Section may be delegated by the Municipality to another entity, if such agreement is entered into by the Municipality.

Additional erosion and sediment control design standards and criteria that must be applied where infiltration BMPs are proposed include the following:

Areas proposed for infiltration BMPs shall be protected from sedimentation and compaction during the construction phase, so as to maintain their maximum infiltration capacity.
A copy of the approved Erosion and Sediment Control Plan and any required permits shall be available at the project site at all times.

Any permanent stormwater detention or retention facility that also functions as a sediment control facility during construction must be designed to meet the permanent peak rate release design requirements for the 10-year storm event during the construction period. Documentation of this design shall be included with the Stormwater Management Site Plan. This requirement is in addition to design parameters that may be required by other agencies.

Each employer shall use his employment and payroll records from the first day of January to March 31 each year for determining the number of employees from whom said tax shall be deducted and paid over to the collector on or before April 30 of the same calendar year.  Supplemental reports shall be made by each employer on July 30, October 30 and January 31 for new employees as reflected on his employment and payroll records from April 1 to June 30, July 1 to September 30 and October 1 to December 31, and payments on these supplemental reports shall be made on July 30, October 30 and January 30, respectively.

 

§310.  INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN MORE THAN ONE OCCUPATION.

In the event a person is engaged in more than one occupation; that is, concurrent employment, or an occupation which requires working in more than one political subdivision during the payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the tax shall be in the following order:

            1.     The political subdivision in which the person maintains his principal 		     office or is principally employed.

	2.     The political subdivision in which the person resides and works, if the 		tax is levied by that political subdivision.      
	3.     The political subdivision in which the person is employed and which 		imposes the tax nearest in miles to the person’s home.

In the case of concurrent employment, an employer shall refrain from withholding the Local Services Tax, if the employee provides:

A.        a recent pay statement from a principal employer that includes the name of the employer, the length of the payroll period and the amount of Local Services Tax withheld; and

B.         a statement from the employee that the pay statement is from the employee’s principal employer and the employee will notify other employers of a change in principal place of employment within two weeks of its occurrence.

The situs of the tax shall be the place of employment on the first day the person becomes subject to the tax during each payroll period.  It is the intent of this section that no person shall be subject to the payment of the Local Services Tax by more than one political subdivision during each payroll period.


§311.   EXEMPTIONS TO THE LOCAL SERVICES TAX

The Local Services Tax shall be no more than $52 on each individual for each calendar year, irrespective of the number of political subdivisions within which an individual may be employed.

The following persons shall be exempt from the Local Services Tax:

Any person who served in any war or armed conflict in which the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under honorable circumstances from active service if, as a result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic or a double or quadruple amputee or has a service connected disability declared by the United States Veterans’ Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent permanent disability 

Any person who serves as a member of a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year.
A person seeking to claim an exemption from the Local Services Tax may annually file an exemption certificate with the collector of the tax for the political subdivision levying the tax and file a copy of the certificate with the person’s employer affirming that the person reasonably expects to receive earned income and net profits from all sources within the Township of less than $12,000 in the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. 

The exemption certificate shall have attached to it a copy of all of the employee’s last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within the Township for the year prior to the fiscal year for which the employee is requesting to be exempted from the Local Services Tax. 

Upon receipt of the exemption certificate and until otherwise instructed by the collector of the tax the employer shall not withhold the tax from the person during the calendar year or remainder of the calendar year for which the exemption certificate applies. With respect to a person who claimed an exemption from the Local Services Tax, upon notification to an employer by the person or by the collector of the tax, that the person has received earned income and net profits from all sources within the Township equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year or that the person is otherwise ineligible for the tax exemption for that calendar year, or upon an employer’s payment to the person of earned income within the Township in an amount equal to or in excess of $12,000 in that calendar year, an employer shall withhold the Local Services Tax from the person as follows:

If a person who claimed an exemption for a given calendar year from the Local Services Tax becomes subject to the tax for the calendar year the employer shall withhold the tax for the remainder of that calendar year.

The employer shall withhold from the person, for the first payroll period after receipt of the notification under the above paragraph, a lump sum equal to the amount of the tax that was not withheld from the person due to the exemption certificate filed by the person, plus the per payroll amount due for that first payroll period. 

The amount of tax withheld per payroll period for the remaining payroll periods in that calendar year shall be the same amount withheld for other employees. 

In the event the employment of a person subject to withholding of the Local Services Tax under this exception is severed in that calendar year, the person shall be liable for any outstanding balance of tax due and the political subdivision levying the tax may pursue collection under this act.

Employers shall not be responsible for investigating exemption certificates, monitoring tax exemption eligibility or exempting any employee from a Local Services Tax.

Employers shall be responsible for retaining a copy of all exemption certificates filed by employees within a given calendar year for a minimum of three (3) years.  Employers who have failed to withhold the Local Services Tax from an employee or employees, and do not have copies of the employee exemption certificate or certificates, will be held responsible for the payment of the Local Services Tax as if the tax had been originally levied against the employer.

 

§312.   SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS

All self-employed individuals and individuals whose employer is not required to withhold local taxes (certain state and federal agencies) will be billed quarterly for the Local Services Tax.  The full amount of tax must be paid by the date indicated on such billing.  If such taxpayer qualifies for a low-income exemption, the taxpayer may complete the required exemption certificate or make application for a refund of the tax paid.

 

§313.   EMPLOYEES AND SELF-EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS RESIDING BEYOND THE LIMITS OF HAMPDEN TOWNSHIP.

All employers and self-employed individuals residing or having their place of business outside Hampden Township but who engage in any occupation within Hampden Township, do by virtue thereof agree to be bound by and subject themselves to the provisions, penalties and regulations promulgated under this Part with the same force and effect as though they were residents of Hampden Township.  Further, any individual engaged in an occupation within Hampden Township and an employee of a non-resident employer may for the purpose of this Part be considered a self-employed person and in the event this tax is not paid, the collector shall have the option of proceeding against either the employer or employee for collection of this tax as hereinafter provided.

 

§314.  ADMINISTRATION OF TAX.

    1.     It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and receive payments of this tax and to keep a record thereof showing the amount received by him from each employer or self-employed person, together with the date the tax was received.  It shall be the duty of the collector to accept and keep a record of the information submitted by employers relating to the number of employees subject to the tax, the number of employees exempt from the tax and the employee exemption certificates and refunds of the tax paid to individuals and employers. 

     2.      The collector is hereby charged with the administration and enforcement of this Part and is hereby empowered to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of this Part, including provisions for the examination of the payroll records of any employer subject to this Part; the examination and correction of any return made in compliance with this Part; and any payment alleged or found to be incorrect or as to which overpayment is claimed or found to have occurred.  Any person aggrieved by any decision of the collector shall have the right to appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County as in other cases provided.

3.     The collector is hereby authorized to examine the books and payroll records of any employer in order to verify the accuracy of any return made by an employer; or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due.  Each employer is hereby directed and required to give the collector the means, facilities and opportunity for such examination.

 

§315.  SUIT FOR COLLECTION.

    1.     In the event any tax under this Part remains due or unpaid 30 days after the due date above set forth, the collector may sue for the recovery of such tax due or unpaid together with interest and penalty.

    2.     If for any reason the tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the amount of said tax shall be calculated beginning with the due date of said tax and a penalty of 5% shall be added to the flat rate of said tax for nonpayment thereof.  Where suit is brought for the recovery of this tax, the individual liable therefore shall, in addition, be responsible and liable for the costs of collection, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees.

 

§316.  FINE AND PENALTY.

Whoever makes any false or untrue statement on any return required by this Part, or who refuses inspection of his books, records or accounts in his custody and control in order to determine the number of employees subject to this tax who are in his employment, or who fails or refuses to file any return required by this Part, or fails or refuses to pay the tax herein levied shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than $600 plus costs and, in default of payment of said fine and costs, to a term of imprisonment not to exceed 30 days.  It is further provided that the action to enforce the fine and penalty herein provided may be instituted against any person in charge of the business of any employer who has failed or refused to file a return required by this Part.

The Township Treasurer shall inform the claimant of the preliminary determination.

5.

8.        Upon receipt of any claim pursuant to subsections (6) and (7) hereof, the Board of Commis­sioners shall review the claim and make a final determination.

STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR HOGESTOWN RUN AND

TRINDLE SPRING RUN


§101. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

1.       Statement of Findings.  The Board of Township Commissioners of the Township of Hampden hereby finds that:

A.      Inadequate management of accelerated stormwater runoff resulting from development throughout a watershed increases flood flows and velocities, contributes to erosion and sedimentation, overtaxes the carrying capacity of existing streams and storm sewers, greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey and manage stormwater, undermines floodplain manage­ment and flood reduction efforts in upstream and downstream communities, reduces groundwater recharge, and threatens public health and safety.

B.       A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including reasonable regulation of development and activities causing accelerated erosion, is fundamental to the public health, safety, welfare and the protection of the people of the Township and all the people of the Commonwealth, their resources and the environment.

2.       Purpose.  The purpose of this Part is to promote health, safety and welfare only within the Hogestown Run Watershed and Trindle Spring Run Watershed to the extent that such watersheds exist within the Township of Hampden by minimizing the damages described in §101(1)(A) of this Part through provisions designed to:

A.      Manage accelerated runoff and erosion and sedimentation problems at their source by regulating activities that cause these problems.

B.       Utilize and preserve the existing natural drainage systems.

C.       Encourage recharge of groundwater where appropriate and prevent degradation of groundwater quality.

D.       Maintain existing flows and quality of streams and watercourses in the Township and the Commonwealth.

E.       Preserve and restore the flood carrying capacity of streams.

F.       Provide proper maintenance of all permanent stormwater management facilities that are constructed in the Township.

G.       Provide performance standards and design criteria for stormwater management and planning.

3.       Statutory Authority.  The Township is empowered to regulate land use activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), the "Stormwater Management Act."

4.       Applicability.  This Part shall only apply to permanent stormwater management facilities constructed as part of any of the regulated activities listed in this Section. Stormwater management and erosion and sedimentation control during construction activities are specifically not regulated by this Part, but shall continue to be regulated under existing laws and ordinances.   The following activities are defined as "regulated activities" and shall be regulated by this Part:

A.      Land development.

B.       Subdivision.

C.       Construction of new or additional impervious or semi-pervious surfaces (driveways, parking lots, etc.).

D.      Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.

E.       Diversion or piping of any natural or manmade stream channel.

F.       Installation of stormwater management facilities or appurtenances thereto.

within the Hogestown Run Watershed and Trindle Spring Run Watershed to the extent that such watersheds exist within the Township of Hampden.

G.       When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions, natural drainage ways on the site cannot adequately provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed conforming substantially to the line and grade of such natural drainage ways.

H.      Sinkholes shall be protected as follows:

(1)      Stormwater from roadways, parking lots, storm sewers, roof drains or other concentrated runoff paths shall not be discharged directly into sinkholes.

(2)      Sinkholes with sufficient capacity to receive appreciable amounts of storm- water shall be designated as such by posting onsite notices clearly visible at the sinkhole prohibiting any disposal of refuse, rubbish, hazardous wastes, organic matter or soil into the sinkhole. Rock fill may be permitted in the sinkhole for the purpose of preventing dumping of said materials. The discharge of stormwater runoff to the subsurface using sinkholes shall be considered as potential pollution and prohibited unless the disposal  method is designed so that contaminants in the runoff will be absorbed/adsorbed in the soil mantle and be acted upon by the bacteria naturally present in the mantle before reaching the groundwater. Systems intended to meet this requirement shall be designed by a hydrogeologist.

(3)      If increased or concentrated runoff is to be discharged into a sinkhole, including filtered discharge, a geologic assessment of the effects of such runoff on increased land subsidies and groundwater quality shall be prepared and the results submitted with the drainage plan. Such discharge shall be prohibited if the Township Engineer determines that the discharge poses a hazard to life, property or groundwater resources.

I.        Investigations.

(1)      Perform investigations for all subdivisions and land developments except minor construction projects such as residential building extensions or accessory structures to map the following karst features of feature indicators:

(a)      Closed depressions.

(b)      "Ghost lakes" after rainfall.

(c)      Open sinkholes.

(d)     Outcrops of bedrock.

(e)      Seasonal high water table indicators.

(f)      Surface drainage into ground

(g)      Unplowed areas in plowed fields.

The map shall be at the same scale as the development or subdivision plan. The map shall be prepared by an engineer/geologist with a minimum of 3 years of professional experience in preparing such maps. This map shall be prepared from but not necessarily limited to a review of aerial photographs, soils, maps, geologic and other similar related data. The engineer shall also conduct a site inspection of the property.

(2)      Based upon the above preliminary work the engineer/geologist shall determine what further testing, if any, shall be performed by the developer to enable compliance with the geologic design standards set forth below. Testing methodology shall be reasonable and consistent under the circumstances, including (1) the scale of the proposed develop­ment and (2) the hazards revealed by examination of available data and site inspection.

(3)      The geologic mapping and test results shall be submitted as part of the overall subdivision and land development plan data. The report shall address the capability of the site to support the proposed develop­ment in a manner in which the risks attendant to development in carbonate areas are either eliminated or minimized.

(4)      Recommendations for site development relating to stormwater manage­ment facilities shall be included.

(5)      Additional studies or testing as deemed necessary by the Township Engineer in order to produce an adequate study given the scale of the proposed development and the hazards revealed, may be required of the developer.

J.        Geologic Design Standards:

(1)      All stormwater management facilities and related structures shall be so situated, designed and constructed as to minimize the risk of structural damage from existing or future sinkholes.

(2)      Stormwater management facilities such as groundwater recharge pits, beds or trenches and detention ponds shall not be located within 100 feet of the karst features identified above in subsection (1) unless (1) the engineer/geologist demonstrates that a minimal risk of structural damage due to sinkholes will exist or (2) mitigating measures are taken to minimize the risk of structural damage. These mitigating measures shall be designed by developer's engineer/geologist.  Stormwater shall not be redirected into a sinkhole.

2.       Stormwater Management Performance Standards. 

A.      The applicable performance standards for managing runoff from each sub area in the Hogestown Run/Trin­dle Spring Run watersheds for the 2, 10 and 25 year design storms are provided in the release rate table on Plate 4 of this Part. Post-development peak flows at the mouth of each of the sub-areas, shown on Plate 4 must not exceed the arithmetic product of the applicable sub-area release rate times the predevelopment peak flow from the particular site under consideration. 

B.       The peak discharge for each sub-area in either watershed shall be calculated based upon the weighted CN which has been adjusted in accordance with the following equations:

(1)      Trindle Spring Run.

Adjusted CN = (1.3 x weighted CN)-30, for the 2 and 25 year events.

Adjusted CN = (1.2 x weighted CN)-20, for the 10 year events.

(2)      Hogestown Run.

Adjusted CN = (1.1 x weighted CN)-10, for the 2 and 25 year events.

Adjusted CN = (1.2 x weighted CN)-20, for the 10 year events.

C.       Stormwater management facilities that reduce post-development peak flows may not be required or be recommended for some sub-areas as specified on Plate 4 of this Part.  However, the capacity of existing drainage facilities in these sub-areas may be inadequate for conveying post-development peak flows. Where the existing drainage facilities are inadequate for conveying post-development peak flows, the developer shall either release post-development peak flows at 100 percent of the existing peak flow or increase the conveyance capacity of the inadequate drainage elements as specified in this Part.

D.      When post-development peak flows are released at 100% of the predevel­opment peak, significant changes in the timing of post-development runoff shall not be permitted. The release of post-development peak flows at 100% of the predevelopment peak flow may increase the duration of the peak discharge from a site and may in turn increase peak discharges in an area that are located downstream of the site. Increases in peak discharges at downstream locations resulting from releasing post-development peaks at 100% of predevelopment peak flows shall not be permitted and an acceptable alternative stormwater management facility or technique or capacity improvements must be implement­ed as part of the development.

E.       Within those watershed areas designated as "provisional no detention" the developer may discharge post-development peak runoff directly into existing conveyance systems (detention facilities need not be constructed) provided there is no adverse affect on the total watershed peak flow. In certain instances, however, the "local" runoff conveyance facilities, which transport runoff from the site to the main channel, may not have adequate capacity to safely transport increased peak flows associated with not providing detention for a proposed development. In those instances, the developer shall either use a 100% release rate control or provide increased capacity of downstream drainage elements to convey increased peak flows consistent with §103(3)(I). In determining if adequate capacity exists in the existing local watershed drainage network, the developer must assume that the entire local watershed is developed per current zoning and that all new development would use the runoff controls specified by this Part. Similarly, any capacity improvement must be designed to convey runoff from development of all areas tributary to the improvement consistent with the capacity criteria specified in §103(3)(C).

3.       Design Criteria for Stormwater Management Facilities.

A.      Incorporate stormwater management techniques into the design to reduce the runoff volume and rate of discharge. (These techniques may include minimizing impervious surfaces, planting flat grassed waterways and using any other means to increase the time of concentration and filtration of the runoff.) Then compute and compare pre and post development runoff hydrographs at each point-of- interest for the 2, 10 and 25 year events. When analysis indicates that the post-development hydrographs and volumes are less than or equal to the pre-development hydrographs in peak and volume, additional stormwater controls are not required for the portion of the site draining to the point- of-interest. Stormwater detention facilities will be required, in addition to the stormwater management reduction techniques, when analysis illustrates that post-development peak runoff rates and volumes are greater than the pre­development runoff rates and volumes. Design the detention facilities and related structures to release the 2, 10 and 25 year events in accordance with the performance standards found on Plate 4 and in other sections of this Part.

B.       Rules and Regulations.

(1)      PA DEP, Chapter 105, Rules and Regulations, apply to the construction, modification, operation or maintenance of both existing and proposed dams, water obstructions and encroachments throughout the watershed. Inquiries on permit requirements or other concerns should be addressed to the Southcentral Regional Office, One Ararat Boulevard, Room 147, Harrisburg, Pennsylva­nia 17110.  [Ord. 98-7]

(2)      Any stormwater management facility required or regulated by this Part shall be designed to provide an emergency spillway to handle flow up to the 100 year post-development conditions. The height of embank­ment must be set as to provide a minimum of 1 foot of freeboard above the maxim­um pool elevation computed when the facility functions for the 100 year post-development inflow. However, criteria for design and construction of stormwater management facilities are not the same criteria that are used in permitting of dams under the Dam Safety Program.  Depending upon the physical characteristics of a dam, a dam permit may be required and the design will have to meet the provisions of Chapter 105 of the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act. Depending on the physical characteristics of a dam, the design could require that anywhere from a 50 year to a probable maximum flood storm event be considered.

C.       Any hydraulic capacity analysis conducted in accordance with this Part shall use the following criteria to determine if adequate hydraulic capacity exists:

(1)      Open channels must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 2 year design storm within their banks at velocities that would not erode the channel bed or banks. Acceptable velocities shall be based on criteria included in the PA DEP Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control Manual (as amended or replaced from time to time by PA DEP) and presented in  Table A-4 in the Appendix of this Part.  [Ord. 98-7]

(2)      Open channels must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 100 year design storm within their banks with a minimum 1 foot of freeboard and not create hazard to any persons or property.

(3)      Any other drainage conveyance facility that does not fall under Chapter 105 regulations must be able to convey, without damage to the drainage structure or roadway, runoff from the 25 year storm with a minimum 1.0 foot of freeboard measured below the lowest point along the top of the roadway. Any facility located within a PennDOT right-of-way must meet PennDOT minimum design standards and permit submission require­ments.

(4)      Storm sewer inlet spacing and road cross-section design must ensure that post-development runoff resulting from 10 year design storm of 5 minute duration does not flood more than 1/2 of a traffic lane, i.e., excluding the parking lane.

(5)      Storm sewers must be able to convey post-development runoff from a 25 year design storm without surcharging inlets. Prevent the exfiltration of stormwater from storm sewer pipes by providing a water tight seal at all pipe section junctions and at inlet boxes.

D.      Easements along open channels shall be provided.  The minimum width of the required easement shall be equal to the width of the 100 year water surface (for post-development conditions), including a minimum 1 foot of freeboard.

E.       In sub-areas where individual stormwater management facilities would be provided for each development site, the individual stormwater management facilities shall be designed to ensure that the post-development peak discharge  at the mouth of the sub-area does not exceed the arithmetic product of the applicable release rate, specified on Plat 4 of this Part and the predevelo­pment peak flow from the particular site under consideration.

F.        For development sites that would be located in two or more sub-areas, the applicable release rates for the portions of the site located in different sub-areas shall be based on natural sub-area drainage boundaries. The natural drainage boundaries between sub-areas shall not be modified, nor shall drainage from a development site be diverted or otherwise conveyed from one sub-area to another sub-area, except where runoff naturally crosses sub-areas drainage boundaries.

G.       No Harm Option. 

(1)      For any proposed development site not located in a provisional no detention sub-area, the developer has the option of using a less restrictive runoff control (including no detention) if the developer can prove that "no harm" would be caused by discharging at a higher runoff rate than that specified by the plan. Proof of "no harm" would have to be shown from the development site through the remainder of the downstream drainage network to the confluence of the Hogestown Run/Trindle Spring Run with the Conodoguinet Creek. Proof of "no harm" must be shown using the capacity criteria specified in §103(3)(C) if downstream capacity analysis is a part of the "no harm" justification.

(2)      Attempts to prove "no harm" based upon downstream peak flow versus capacity analysis shall be governed by the following provisions:

(a)      The peak flow values to be used for downstream  areas for the design return period storms (2, 10 and 25 year) shall be the values from the calibrated Hogestown Run/Trindle Spring Run watershed. These flow values would be supplied to the developer by the Township Engineer upon request.

(b)      Any available capacity in the downstream conveyance system as documented by a developer may be used by the developer only in proportion to his development site acreage relative to the total upstream undeveloped acreage from the identified capacity (i.e., if the site is 10% of the upstream undeveloped acreage, the developer may use up to 10% of the documented downstream available capacity).

(c)      Developer proposed construction generating increased peak flow rates at documented storm drainage problem areas would, by definition, be precluded from successful attempt to prove "no harm," except in conjunction with proposed capacity improvements for the problem areas consistent with this Part.

(d)     The developer must assume that the entire sub-area in which the site is located is developed in accordance with the zoning in effect at the project is to be approved for development.

(3)      Any "no harm" justification shall be submitted by the developer as part of the drainage plan submission per §104.

H.      Regional or Sub-Regional Stormwater Management Facilities.  For certain areas within the watersheds, it may be cost-effective to provide one stormwater management facility for an entire sub-area, group of sub-areas or portion of a sub-area incorporating more than one development site. The initiative and funding for any regional or sub-regional stormwater management alternatives are the responsibility of prospective developers and will be approved by the Township on a case-by-case basis. The design of any regional stormwater management facilities must assume development of the entire area that would drain to the regional facility. The type and amount of development that the developer(s) must consider shall be based on current Township Zoning [Chapter 27]. The peak outflow from a regional stormwater management facility must be consistent with the Hogestown Run/Trindle Spring Run  watersheds, Act 167 "Stormwater Management Plan" using a model which is acceptable to the Township Engineer. When regional or sub-regional stormwater management facilities are utilized, the effect of phased growth on stormwater runoff flows must be considered. At no time from the initial phase through ultimate development shall the peak runoff flows exceed the predevelo­pment peak multiplied by the applicable release rate.

I.        Capacity Improvements.  If the developer can prove that it would be feasible to provide capacity improvements to relief the capacity deficiency in the existing drainage network, then adequate capacity improvements can be provided by the developer in lieu of stormwater management facilities on the develop­ment site. Any capacity improvements would be designed based on development of all areas tributary to the improvement and the capacity criteria specified in this Part. The type and amount of development that the developer must consider shall be based on current zoning and existing land uses. It shall be assumed that all new development upstream of a proposed capacity improvement would implement applicable stormwater management techniques, consistent with this Part.

J.        Erosion protection shall be provided along all open channels and at all points of discharge. Design erosion protection in accordance with Erosion and Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual, as amended, published by the PA DEP.  [Ord. 98-7]

K.       Existing and proposed ponds and other similar open water features that are not  designed as stormwater management facilities shall be designed in accordance with the United States Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), Ponds - Planning, Design, Construction (as amended or replaced from time to time by SCS) and shall be treated as impervious surfaces for stormwater runoff computations.

L.       The design of all stormwater management facilities shall incorporate sound engineering principles and practices. The Township Engineer shall reserve the right to disapprove any design that would result in the occurrence or perpetua­tion of an adverse hydrologic or hydraulic condition within the watershed.

4.       Calculation Methodology.

A.      Stormwater runoff calculations involving drainage areas greater than 20 acres, including on and off-site areas, shall use any generally accepted calculation technique that is based on the SCS soil cover complex method.  Use the rational method to estimate peak discharges from drainage areas that contain less than 20 acres.

B.       Design stormwater detention facilities to meet the performance standards of this Part by routing the design storm hydrograph through these facilities using the storage-indication method. For drainage areas greater than 20 acres in size, the design storm hydrograph shall be computed using a calculation method that produces a full hydrograph.  For drainage areas containing less than 20 acres, calculate the full hydrograph using approximate techniques.

C.       All calculations using the soil cover complex method shall use the Soil Conservation Service Type II 24 hour rainfall distribution. The 24 hour rainfall depths for the various return periods to be used with this Part are (taken from rainfall duration frequency tables for Pennsylvania, PA DEP) as follows:  [Ord. 98-7]

R­e­turn P­eriod

24 Hour Rainfall Depth

10 Year

3.7 Inches

25 Year

4.4 Inches

100 Year

5.3 Inches

D.      All calculations using the rational method shall use rainfall intensities consistent with appropriate times of concentration for overland flow and return periods published by PennDOT in Design Manual 2, as amended. Times of concentration for overland flow shall be calculated using the methodology presented in Chapter 3 of "Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds," SCS, TR-55 (as amended or replaced from time to time SCS). Times of concentration for channel and pipe flow shall be computed using Manning's equation.

E.       Runoff curve numbers (CN) for both existing and proposed conditions to be used in the soil curve complex method shall be obtained from Table A-1 in the Appendix of this Part.

F.       Runoff coefficients (c) for both existing and proposed conditions for use in the rational method shall be obtained from either Table A-2 or Figure A-1 in the Appendix of this Part.

G.       Where uniform flow is anticipated, the Manning equation shall be used for hydraulic computations and to determine the capacity of open channels, pipes and storm sewers. Where non-uniform flow is anticipated, the hydraulic effects of "backwater" caused by hydraulic obstructions (e.g. culverts, bridges, dams, reservoirs, etc.) shall be evaluated using the standard step method for determining water surface profiles.  Values for Manning's roughness coefficient (n) shall be consistent with Table A-3 in the Appendix of this Part. Permissible velocities for channels shall be no more than the values indicated in Table A-4 of the Appendix.

H.      Outlet structures for stormwater management facilities shall be designed to meet the performance standards of this Part using any generally accepted hydraulic analysis technique or method.

F-P, FLOODPLAIN

 

§401.  GENERAL PROVISIONS.

1.       Purpose.  The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and governmen­tal services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public funds for flood protection and relief and the impair­ment of the tax base by:

A.       Regulating uses, activities and development which, acting alone or in combina­tion with other existing or future uses, activities and development, will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and frequencies. 

B.       Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activities and development from locating within areas subject to flooding. 

C.       Requiring all those uses, activities and development that do occur in floodprone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and flood damage. 

D.      Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards. 

2.       Applicability.  These provisions shall apply to all lands with­in the jurisdiction of Hampden Township and shown on the Official Zon­ing Map as being located within the boundaries of any floodplain area determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and approved by the Township Commission­ers.   [Ord. 93-10]

3.       Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereinafter be used and no structure shall be located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged or structurally altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this Chapter and any other applicable ordi­nances and regula­tions which apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this Chapter. 

4.       Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood pro­tection sought by the provisions of this Chapter is considered reason­able for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering methods of study.  Larger floods may occur on rare occasions.  Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris.  This Chapter does not imply that land outside the floodplain areas or that land uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages.

5.       This Part shall not create liability on the part of Hampden Township or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Part or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 

6.         Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This Part supersedes any other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain areas.  However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is any conflict between any of the provisions of this Part, the more restrictive shall apply. 

(Ord. 84­-2, 3/29/1984, §400; as amended by Ord. 93-10, 6/1/1993, §2; and by Ord. 09-07, 04/02/2009, §1(A)).


§402. ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOOD ZONING AREAS.

1.       Description of Areas.

A.       Basis of Flood Areas.  The identified floodplain areas shall be those areas of the Township of Hampden which are subject to the 100 year flood as identified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for said Township by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated March 16, 2009, and any subsequent revisions thereof.  [Ord. 09-05]

(1)      FW (Floodway Area).

(a)      Those areas identi­fied as "Floodway" in the AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study prepared by FEMA. The term shall also include floodway areas which have been identi­fied in other available studies or sources of information for those floodplain areas where no floodway has been identified in the Flood Insurance Study.

(b)      For the purpose of this Part, the floodway is based upon the criteria that a specific area within the floodplain would be capable of carrying the water of the 100 year flood with­out increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than 1 foot at any point.

(2)      FF (Flood-Fringe Area). 

(a)      The remaining portions of the 100 year flood­plain in those areas identified as an AE Zone in the Flood Insurance Study where a floodplain has been delineat­ed.

(b)      The basis for the outermost boundary of this area shall be the 100 year flood elevations as shown in the flood pro­files contained in the Flood Insurance Study.

				[Ord. 93-10]

(3)      FA (General Floodplain Area) shall be that floodway area for which no detailed flood elevations or floodway information have been provided. They are shown as "Zone A" on the maps accompanying the FIS prepared by the FIA.  Where available, floodway information from other sources shall be used.  Where the spe­cific 100 year flood elevation cannot be determined for this area by the Zoning Officer to his satis­faction, using other sources of data such as the US Army Corps of Engineers, Floodplain Information Reports, or the US Geological Survey Flood Prone Quadran­gles, then the Zoning Officer may require the applicant for the proposed use, development or activity to determine the elevation in accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engi­neering tech­niques.  Hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect current­ly accepted technical concepts.  All such studies, analyses, or computa­tions shall be submit­ted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough tech­nical review by the Township.  [Ord. 92-5]

B.       Overlay Concept.

(1)      The floodplain areas described above shall be overlays to the existing underlying districts as shown on the official Hampden Township Zoning Map and, as such, the provisions for the floodplain areas shall serve as a supplement to the underlying district provi­sions. 

(2)      In the event of any conflict between the provisions or requirements of any of the floodplain areas and those of any underlying zoning district, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 

(3)      In the event any provision concerning a flood­plain area is declared inapplicable or illegal as a result of any legislative or administrative actions or judicial decision, the regulations of the under­lying district shall remain applicable. 

2.       Zoning Map.  The boundaries of the floodplain areas are estab­lished as shown on the Floodway Boundary Map which is declared to be a part of this Chapter and which shall be kept on file at the Hampden Township Office. 

3.       Interpretation of Area Boundaries.  Initial interpreta­tions of the boundaries of the floodplain areas shall be made by the Zoning Officer.  Should an applicant dispute the boundaries of any of the areas, the Zoning Hearing Board shall make the necessary determina­tion.  The person ques­tioning or contesting the location of the area boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires. 

4.       Boundary Changes. The determination of any of the flood­plain areas may be revised by the Township Commissioners where natural or manmade changes have occurred or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the US Army Corps of Engineers River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual and such studies provide the basis for such change.  However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).

B.       Under no circumstances shall any use, activity and/or develop­ment adversely affect the capacity of the channels or floodways of any water­course, drainage ditch or any other drainage facility or system. 

C.       Prior to any proposed alteration or relocation of any stream or watercourse within the Township, any required permit shall be obtained from the Depart­ment of Environ­mental Protection, Dams and Encroachment Division.  Further, documentation shall be submitted, substantiat­ing that notification of the proposal has been given to all affected adjacent municipalities.  The Federal Insurance Administration and the Department of Community and Economic Development or its successors shall also be notified in advance of any such alteration or relocation.  [Ord. 98-7]

2.       Floodway Area (FW).  Within any FW (Floodway Area), the follow­ing provisions shall apply:  [Ord. 93-10]

1.       In passing upon applications for special exceptions and varianc­es, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider all relevant factors and procedures specified in other Sections of this Chapter and:

 A.      The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.  No special exceptions or variance shall be granted in any floodway for any proposed use, development or activity that will cause any increase in flood levels during the 100 y­ear flood. 

B.       The danger that materials may be swept on to other lands or down­stream to the injury of others. 

C.       The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamina­tion and unsanitary condi­tions. 

D.      The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners. 

E.       The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community. 

F.       The requirements of the facility for a waterfront loca­tion. 

G.      The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use. 

H.      The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and develop­ment anticipated in the foresee­able future. 

I.        The relationship of the proposed use to the compre­hen­sive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 

J.        The safety of access to the property in times of flood of ordi­nary and emergency vehicles. 

K.      The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sedi­ment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site. 

L.       The effect upon the Township flood insurance program.

M.      Such other factors which are relevant to the purposes of this Chapter. 

2.       The Zoning Hearing Board may refer any application and accompa­nying documenta­tion pertaining to any request for a special exception or variance to any engineer or other qualified person or agency for techni­cal assistance in evaluating the proposed project in relation to flood heights and velocities and the adequacy of the plans for protection and other related matters. 

3.       Special exceptions and/or variances shall only be issued after the Zoning Hearing Board has determined that the granting of such will not result in:

A.       Unacceptable or prohibited increase in flood heights.

B.       Additional threats to public safety.

C.       Extraordinary public expense.

D.      The creation of nuisances.

            5.        If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification     	 		necessary to provide relief. 

6.         In granting any variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall attach whatever reasonable conditions and safeguards it considers necessary in order to protect the public health, safety, and welfare and to achieve the objectives of this Ordinance.

7.         Whenever a variance is granted, the Zoning Hearing Board shall notify the applicant in writing that:

          	  a.   The granting of the variance may result in increased premium rates for 		flood insurance. 

           	 b.   Such variances may increase the risks to life and property. 

8.         In reviewing any request for a variance, the Zoning Hearing Board shall consider, at a minimum, whether there is good and sufficient cause and whether failure to grant the variances would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant. 

9.         A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall be maintained by the Township.  In addition, a report of all variances granted during the year shall be included in the annual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

10.       No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would cause any increase in the one hundred (100) year flood elevation.

11.       No variance shall be granted for any construction, development, use or activity within any FE area that would, together with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the one hundred (100) year flood elevation more than one (1) foot at any point.

§1603.          TENTATIVE REVIEW AND APPROVAL.

1.       Prior to the issuance of a planned residential development permit by the Zoning Officer, a plan must be reviewed by the Hampden Township Planning Commission and the Cumberland County Planning Commission and approved by the Hampden Township Board of Commissioners.  The County Planning Commission shall be required to report to the Hampden Township Board of Commissioners within 30 days or forfeit the right to review.  The Township Planning Commission, as preparatory to review, shall hold at least one public hearing pursuant to public notice and may hold additional public hearings upon such notice as it shall determine advisable.  Upon review of the plan and recommendations by the Cumberland County Planning Commission, the Township Planning Commission shall present to the Township Board of Commission­ers their recommendations and explanatory materials.  Before approving the plan, the Board of Commissioners may continue the hearing from time to time and may refer the matter back to the Township Planning Commission for the report provided, however, that, in any event, the public hearings shall be concluded within 60 days after the date of the first public hearing.  The Board of Commissioners, within 30 days following the conclusion of the public hearing, shall, by official written communication to the landowner, either:  [Ord. 98-7]

A.       Grant tentative approval of the development plan as submit­ted;

B.       Grant tentative approval subject to specified conditions not included in the development plan as submitted; or

               C.       Deny tentative approval of the development plan. 

Failure to so act with­in said peri­od shall be deemed to be a grant of tentative approval of the development plan as submitted.  In the event, however, that tentative approval is granted subject to conditions, the landowner may, within 30 days after receiving a copy of the official written communication of the Board of Commissioners, notify such Board of his refusal to accept all said condi­tions, in which case, the Board shall be deemed to have denied tentative approval of the development plan.  In the event the landowner does not, within said period, notify the Board of Commis­sioners of his refusal to accept all said conditions, tenta­tive approval of the development plan, with all said conditions, shall stand as granted. 

2.       The granting or denial of tentative approval by official written communication shall include not only conclusions but also findings of fact related to the specific proposal and shall set forth the reasons for the grant, with or without conditions, or for the denial, and said communication shall set forth particularly in what respects the development plan would or would not be in the public interest including, but not limited to, findings of fact and conclusions of the following:

A.       In those respects in which the development plan is or is not consistent with the comprehensive plan for the development of the Township.

B.       The extent to which the development plan departs from zoning and/or subdivision regulations otherwise applica­ble to the subject property including, but not limited to, density, bulk and use and the reasons why such departure is or is not deemed to be in the public interest

C.       The purpose, location and amount of the common open space in the planned residential development, the reliability of the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common open space and the adequacy of the amount and purpose of the common open space as related to the proposed density and type of residential development. 

D.      The physical design of the development plan and the manner in which said design does or does not make adequate provision for public services, provides adequate control over vehicular traffic and, further, the amenities of light and air, recreation and visual enjoyment. 

E.       The relationship, beneficial or adverse, of the proposed planned residential development to the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be established. 

F.       In the case of a development plan with  pro­posed develop­ment over a period of years, the sufficiency of the terms and conditions intended to protect the interest of the public and of the residents of the planned residential development in the integrity of the development plan. 

3.       In the event a development plan is granted tentative approval, with or without conditions, an application for final approval of the development shall be filed not later than 6 months.  In the case of a development plan which provides for development over a period of years, applica­tions for final approval of each part of the plan shall be filed within 12 months of the previous application for final approval of a portion of the development. 

4.       The official written communication provided for in this Part shall be certified by the Secretary of the Township and shall be filed in the office of the Township and a certified copy shall be mailed to the landowner.  Where tentative approval has been granted, this shall be recorded on a Township map. 

5.       Tentative approval of a development plan shall not qualify a plot of the planned residential development for recording nor authorize development or the issuance of any building permits.  A development plan which has been given tentative approval as submitted or which has been given tentative approval with conditions which has been accepted by the landowner, shall not be modified or revoked nor otherwise impaired by action of the Township pending an application or applications for final approval, without the consent of the landowner, provided applications are filed within the period of time specified in the official written communication granting tentative approval. 

6.       In the event that a development plan is given tentative approval and thereafter, but prior to final approval, the landowner shall elect to abandon said development plan and shall so notify the Township in writing or in the event the landowner shall fail to file application or applications for final approval within the required period of time or times, as the case may be, the tentative approval shall be deemed to be revoked and all that portion of the area included in the development plan for which final approval has not been given shall be subject to those local ordinances otherwise applicable thereto as they may be amended from time to time and the same shall be noted on the Township map and in the records of the Secretary of the Township. 

(Ord. 84-2, 3/29/1984, §1502)

§1604.          FINAL APPROVAL.

1.       An application for final approval may be for all the land included in a development plan or, to the extent set forth in the tentative approval, for a section thereof.  Said application shall be made to the Zoning Officer within the time or times specified by the official written communica­tion granting tentative approval.  The application shall include any drawings, specifications, covenants, easements, performance bond and such other requirements as may be specified by the Board of Commissioners as well as any conditions set forth in the official written communication at the time of tentative approval.  A public hearing on an application for final approval of the development plan, or part thereof, shall not be required provided the development plan, or the part thereof submitted for final approval, is in compliance with the development plan theretofore given tentative approval and with any specified conditions attached thereto. 

2.       In the event the application for final approval has been filed together with all drawings, specifications and other documents in support thereof and as required by the ordi­nance and the official written communication of tentative approval, Hampden Township shall, within 45 days of such filing, grant such development plan final approval.  [Ord. 86-6]

3.       In the event the development plan as submitted contains variations from the development plan given tentative approval, the Board of Commissioners may refuse to grant final approval and shall, within 30 days from the filing of the application for final approval, so advise the landowner in writing of said refusal; setting forth in said notice the reasons why one or more of said variations are not in the public interest.  In the event of such refusal, the landown­er may either:

A.       Re-file his application for final approval without the variations objected; or,

B.       File a written request with the Board of Commissioners that it hold a public hearing on his application for final approval.  If the landowner wishes to take either such alternate action, he may do so at any time within which he shall be entitled to apply for final approval or within 30 additional days if the time for applying for final approval shall have already passed at the time when the landowner was advised that the development plan was not in substantial compliance.  In the event the landowner shall fail to take either of these alternate actions within said time, he shall be deemed to have abandoned the develop­ment plan.  Any such public hearing shall be held pursuant to public notice within 30 days after the request for the hearing is made by the landowner and the hearing shall be conducted in the manner prescribed in this Part for public hearings on applications for tentative approval.  Within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of Commissioners shall, by official written communication, either grant final approval to the development plan or deny final approval. 

4.       A development plan or any part thereof which has been given final approval shall be so certified without delay by the Board of Commissioners and shall be filed or recorded forthwith in the office of the Recorder of Deeds before any development shall take place in accordance therewith.  Upon filing or recording of the development plan, the zoning and subdivi­sion regulations otherwise applicable to the land included in such plan shall cease to apply thereto.  Pending comple­tion within a reasonable time of said planned residential development or of that part thereof, as the case may be, that has been finally approved, no modification of the provisions of said development plan or part thereof, as finally approved, shall be made by the Township except with the consent of the landowner. 

5.       In the event that a development plan or a section thereof is given final approval and thereafter the landowner shall abandon such plan or the section thereof that has been finally approved and shall  so notify the Board of Commissioners in writing; or, in the event the landowner shall fail to commence and carry out the planned residential development within three years after final approval has been granted, no development or further development shall take place on the property included in the development plan until after said property is resubdivided and is reclassified by enactment of an amendment to this Chapter unless written request for an extension of the time period is granted by the Board of Commissioners to the landowner.

If the center-line elevation of the road cartway has a higher elevation than the ground elevation at the proposed sign location, when measured along a line connecting these two points and running perpendicular to the adjoining lot line, the sign height limit may be increased by the resulting difference in elevation; however no sign or any part thereof (including braces, supports or lights) shall exceed a height of 20 feet above the center line elevation of the road cartway if erected at the right-of-way line of the street, road or highway adjoining the premises on which the sign is located, plus 1 foot additional height for each 3 lineal feet that said sign is located from such street, road or highway as measured on a perpendicular line from such right-of-way line to the nearest part of the sign.  If this same method of measurement indicates that the ground at the proposed sign location has either a higher elevation than or the same elevation as the center-line elevation of the road cartway from which the sign is intended to be viewed, then the sign height limit shall not exceed a height of 20 feet if erected at the right-of-way line of the street, road or highway adjoining the premises on which the sign is located, plus 1 foot additional height for each 3 lineal feet that said sign is located from such street, road or highway as measured on a perpendicular line from such right-of-way line to the nearest part of the sign.    

The above notwithstanding, under no circumstances shall any sign exceed 35 feet in height regardless of its distance from the right-of-way line.

ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION

 

§2201.          ZONING HEARING BOARD. 

The Township Commissioners shall appoint a Zoning Hearing Board, which shall have the number of members, such duties, powers, jurisdiction and authority as set forth in Article IX of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 417 of 1968) as enacted or amended.  The duly estab­lished Zoning Hearing Board shall have the following functions:

 

          A.       Hearings.  The Board shall conduct hearings and make decisions in accordance with §908 of the Pennsylva­nia Municipalities Planning Code, as amended.  Notice shall be given to the public, the applicant, the Zoning Officer, and any person who has made timely request for same.  Notices shall be given at such time and in such manner as shall be prescribed by rules of the Board.  In addition, notice shall be conspicuously posted on the affected tract of land. 

B.       Appeals.  The Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that the Zoning Officer has failed to follow prescribed procedures or has misinterpret­ed or misapplied any provision of a valid ordinance or map or any valid rule or regulation governing the action of the Zoning Officer.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to deny to the appellant the right to proceed directly in court where appropriate.  [Ord. 98-7]

C.       Challenge to Validity.  Except as provided in §2201 below relating to variances, the Board shall have no power to pass upon the validity of any provision of an ordinance or map adopted by the Township Commissioners.  Recognizing that challenges to the validity of an ordinance or map may present issues of fact and interpretation which may lie within the special competence of the Board, and to facili­tate speedy disposition of such challenges by a court, the Board may hear all challenges wherein the validity of the ordinance or map presents any issue of fact or interpreta­tion not hitherto properly determined at a hearing before another competent agency or body and shall take evidence and make a record thereon as provided in §2201(1) above.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall decide all contested questions of interpreta­tion and make findings on all relevant issues of fact, which shall become part of the record on appeal to court. 

D.      Variances. The Board shall hear requests for variances where it is alleged that the provisions of this Chapter inflict unnecessary hardship upon the applicant.  The Board shall by rule prescribe the form of application and require a preliminary application to the Zoning Officer.  The Board may grant a variance, provided the following findings are made where relevant in a given case:

(1)      That there are unique physical circumstances or condi­tions, including irregulari­ty, narrowness or shallow­ness of lot size or shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property, and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not the circum­stances or conditions generally created by the provi­sions of this Chapter in the neighbor­hood or district in which the property is located. 

(2)      That because of such physical circumstances or condi­tions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with the provi­sions of this Chapter and that the authorization of a variance is therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property. 

(3)      That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the appellant. 

(4)      That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, or substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of adjacent property, or be detrimental to the public welfare. 

(5)      That the variance, if authorized, will repre­sent the minimum variance which will afford relief and represent the least possible modification of the regulation in issue. 

(6)      In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reason­able conditions and safeguards as it may deem neces­sary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and of the Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247 of 1968), as amended.

F.       Special Exceptions.  Special exceptions may be granted or denied by the Board pursuant to expressed standards and criteria set forth in this Chapter.  The Board shall hear and decide requests for such special exceptions in accordance with such standards and criteria.  In granting a special exception, the Board may attach such reasonable conditions and safe­guards, in addition to those expressed in this Chapter, as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of this Chapter and of Act 247 of 1968, as amended.  The Board shall pursue the following procedure: 

(1)      The Board's decision to grant a permit for special exception use shall be made only after public notice and hearing.  Such permit shall apply specifically to the application and plans submitted and presented at said public hearing.  Any subsequent amendments or conditions shall be subject to the provisions of this §2201. 

(2)      No permit shall be granted by the Zoning Hearing Board for any special exception use until said Board has first received and considered an advisory report thereon from the Planning Commission with respect to the location of such use in relation to the needs and growth pattern of the Township, and, where appropriate, with reference to the adequacy of the site area and the arrangement of buildings, driveways, parking areas, off-street truck loading spaces and other pertinent features of the site plan.  The Planning Commission shall have 30 days from the date of its receipt of the applica­tion within which to file its report thereon.  In the event that said Commission shall fail to file its report within 30 da­ys, such applica­tion shall be deemed to have been approved by said Planning Commis­sion.  The Planning Commission may have representa­tion at the public hearing held by the Zoning Hearing Board on such applica­tion.  After receipt of the report, the Zoning Hearing Board shall hear and decide the application in the same manner and under the same procedure as required by law and this Chapter. 

(3)      A special exception use for which a permit is granted by the Zoning Hearing Board pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall constitute a conforming use. 

G.      Time Limitations.  The time limitations for raising certain issues and filing certain proceedings with the Board shall be the following:

(1)      No person shall be allowed to file any proceed­ing with the Board later than 30 days after any applica­tion for development, preliminary or final, has been approved by any appropriate municipal officer, agency or body if such proceeding is designed to secure reversal or to limit the approval in any manner unless such person alleges and proves that he had no notice, knowledge, or reason to believe that such approval had been given.  If such person has succeeded to his interest after such approval, he shall be bound by the knowledge of his predecessor in interest. 

(2)      The failure of anyone other than the landowner to appeal from an adverse decision on a tentative or preliminary plan by the Board of Commissioners or from an adverse decision by the Zoning Officer on a challenge to the validity of an ordinance or map shall preclude an appeal from a final approval except in the case where the final submission substantially deviates from the approved tentative or preliminary approval. 

H.      Stay of Proceedings.  Upon filing of any proceedings referred to in this item and during its pendency before the Board, all land development pursuant to any challenged ordi­nance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer or any agency or body and all official action thereunder shall be stayed, unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certify to the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or property; in which case, the development or official action shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board or the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals on petition after notice to the Zoning Officer or other appropriate agency or body.  When an application for development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons other than the appli­cant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdic­tion of zoning appeals to order such persons to post bond as a condition to continuing the proceedings before the Board.  The question of whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of the bond shall be within the sole discretion of the court.

(Ord. 84-2, 3/29/1984, §2100; as amended by Ord. 98-7, 8/27/1998)

 

§2202.         ZONING APPEALS TO COURT. 

The procedure to be followed in filing appeals to the courts shall be in accordance with the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act 247 of 1968), as amended. 

(Ord. 84-2, 3/29/1984, §2101) 

 

§2203.         ZONING OFFICER. 

It shall be the duty of the Zoning Officer, and he is hereby given the necessary power and authori­ty to enforce the provi­sions of this Chapter.  The Zoning Officer shall examine all applications for permits, issue permits for construction and uses which are in accordance with the requirements of this Chapter, record and file all applica­tions for permits with accompanying plans and documents, and make such reports as the Township Commissioners may require.  The Zoning Officer may seek the advice and recommendation of the Planning Commission.  Permits for construction and uses which are a special exception or a variance to requirements of this Chapter shall be issued only upon written order of the Zoning Hearing Board. 

(Ord. 84-2, 3/29/84, §2102, Ord. 15-06, 4/2/15))

 

§2204.         PERMITS.

1.       Requirement of Permits.  A zoning permit shall be required prior to the erection, addition or alteration of any building or structure or portions thereof, prior to the use or change in the use of a building or land, and prior to the change or extension of a nonconforming use.  It shall be unlawful for any person to commence work for the erection or alteration of any building or structure for a change in land use, until a permit has been duly issued therefor.  No zoning permit shall be required in cases of normal maintenance and repairs which do not structurally change a building or structure.  [Ord. 98-7]

2.       Applications for Permits. All applications for permits shall be accompanied by a plan, in duplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location of any buildings existing on the lot, the lines within which the proposed building or structure shall be erected or altered, the existing and intended use of each building, the number of families or dwelling units the building is designed to accommodate, and such other information as may be necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter and all other pertinent ordinances.  One copy of the plans shall be returned to the owner when the plans are approved by the Zoning Officer or other appropriate person or body. 

3.       Issuance of Permits.  No permit shall be issued until the Zoning Officer has certified that the proposed use of land, building, addition or alteration complies with all the provisions of this Chapter, as well as with all the provi­sions of any existing or hereafter enacted Building Permit Ordinance or other ordinance or provision thereof pertaining to building permits.  A permit issued hereunder shall become void 12 months after the issuance date.  The applicant and owner shall comply with all terms and conditions of any zoning permit issues and failure to do so shall constitute a violation of this Section.  [Ord11-05]

The Zoning Hearing Board shall refer the matter to the Planning Commission for a report thereon, but shall not be bound thereby.  The general standards and findings set forth in §2201 of this Chapter shall be used as guidelines by the Planning Commission in making its report and by the Zoning Hearing Board in acting upon the application for special exception.
