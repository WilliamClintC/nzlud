referendum proceedings by filing with the Town Clerk an affidavit stating
they will constitute the petitioners' committee and be responsible for
circulating the petition and filing it in proper form, stating their names and
addresses and specifying the address to which all notices to the committee
are to be sent, and setting out in full the proposed initiative ordinance or
citing the ordinance sought to be reconsidered. Promptly after the affidavit
of the petitioners' committee is filed, the Town Clerk shall issue the
appropriate petition blanks to the petitioners' committee.
§ C-76. Petitions. [Amended 11-7-1978; 11-7-2000]
A. Initiative. The qualified electors of the Town have the power to propose
ordinances to the Town Council and, if the Town Council fails to adopt
an ordinance so proposed without any change in substance, to adopt or
reject it at a Town election. These initiatives may not pertain to the
budget or capital program or any ordinance relating to the
appropriation of money, levy of taxes or salaries of Town officers or
employees.
B. Referendum. The qualified electors of the Town have the power to
require reconsideration by the Town Council of any adopted ordinance
and, if the Town Council fails to repeal an ordinance so reconsidered, to
approve or reject it at a Town election. Such power shall not extend to
the budget or capital program or any emergency ordinance or
ordinance relating to appropriation of money or levy of taxes.
A. Number of signatures. Initiative petitions for purposes of proposing
ordinances to the Town Council must be signed by electors equal in
number to 5% of the total number of electors. If a proposed ordinance
so initiated is not adopted by the Town Council without change of
substance, it shall then be submitted to the registered electors of the
Town at a Town election as hereinafter provided, but only if petitions
proposing the ordinance have been signed (either before or after
presentation to the Town Council) by electors equal in number to 10%
of the total number of electors. Referendum petitions must be signed by

Town Council vote thereon. If no regular Town election is to be held within
the period prescribed in this section, the Town Council shall provide for a
special election; otherwise, the vote shall be held at the same time as such
regular election, except that the Town Council may at its discretion provide
for a special election at an earlier date within the prescribed period. Copies

qualified registered voter of the Town at the time the petition is
presented to the Town Clerk. The term "the total number of electors" as
used herein means the total number of qualified registered electors of
the Town at the most recent regular Town election. The Board of
Canvassers has the authority to issue further rules not inconsistent with
these provisions regulating the form of petitions, the form of evidence
to be required with respect to the circulation and signature of petitions
and other procedural matters which reasonably should be regulated
with respect to initiative and referendum petitions. The Town Clerk
shall make all determinations as to the sufficiency of petitioners, the
validity of signatures and the like, subject to the right of the petitioners'
committee to appeal the same to the Board of Canvassers, whose
determination shall be final and binding on all parties.
C. Procedure as to valid petitions. When an initiative or referendum
petition has been finally determined sufficient, the Town Council shall
promptly consider the proposed initiative ordinance or reconsider the
referred ordinance, in both cases in the same manner as provided for
adoption of an ordinance proposed by a member of the Town Council,
including public hearing. If the Town Council fails to adopt a proposed
initiative ordinance without any change in substance within 60 days or
fails to repeal the referred ordinance within 60 days after the date of
public hearing, and if by the expiration of that period valid petitions
signed by the requisite number of electors are on file with the Town
Clerk, it shall submit the proposal or referred ordinance to the electors
of the Town.

to the 15th day preceding the day scheduled for a vote of the Town by
filing with the Town Clerk a request for withdrawal signed by at least
four members of the petitioners' committee. Upon the filing of such

thereon shall be terminated.
B. If an initiative or referendum petition bearing the signatures of at least
5% of the total number of electors has not been submitted to the Town
Clerk within 120 days after the receipt of petition blanks by the
petitioners' committee, then the initiative or referendum petition shall
be considered as withdrawn and has no further force or effect and all
proceedings thereon shall be terminated.
A. Initiative. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a proposed
initiative ordinance votes in its favor, it shall be considered adopted
upon certification of the election results and shall be treated in all
respects in the same manner as ordinances of the same kind adopted by
the Town Council; provided, however, any initiative ordinance enacted
under this Charter may not be repealed by the Town Council less than
one year following its adoption. If conflicting ordinances are approved
at the same election, the one receiving the greatest number of
affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.
B. Referendum. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a referred
ordinance votes against it, it shall be considered repealed upon
certification of the election results. No referred ordinance repealed
under this Charter shall be reenacted by the Town Council less than one
year following its repeal.

enact an ordinance of a general and permanent nature embracing a
subject not previously existing in the Code, which the Town Council

following language may be made a part of the ordinance: "It is the
intention of the Town Council, and it is hereby ordained, that the
provisions of this ordinance shall become and be made part of the
Charter and Code of the Town of East Greenwich, Rhode Island, and the
sections of this ordinance may be renumbered to accomplish such

a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the
Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become
obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared

ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5) Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code, but
in no case shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or
effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already
embodied in the Code.

of Police and shall recommend sanctions, other than incarceration, and
shall direct restitution for any injuries resulting from the commission of

permanent collection and stagnation of surface or underground waters,
and the flooding or erosion of surrounding property.

roads used for vehicular ingress or egress to any tract of land
upon which earth removal is conducted and to the regularly traveled
roads within any such tract of land.
B. Drainage. When earth removal operations cease, all slopes on any tract
of land upon which earth removal has been conducted shall remain at
the natural angle of repose, so that stagnant water will not permanently

§ 85-3 CHARTER § 85-5
C:183
§ 85-6. Revision of removal plan.
A licensee under this chapter may apply for the revision of the plan

B. Application. As a condition precedent to the issuance of a license, an
application for the license shall be made to the Building Inspector. Such
application shall contain:
(1) A plan prepared by a registered engineer setting forth the existing
contours of the portion of the tract of land upon which earth
removal is to be conducted and, based upon classifications of
preliminary samples of the material to be removed, the final
contours of such portion of the tract of land upon completion of
earth removal operations, and the type of ground cover to be
planted or applied upon completion of earth removal operations to
effectively control wind and water erosion; provided, however, that
if suitable fertile ground cover existed at the beginning of earth
removal, then such plan shall show that enough of such ground
cover is to be held in reserve and reapplied for a minimum
thickness of three inches.
(2) The opinion by a registered engineer that upon completion of earth
removal operations all slopes on the portion of the tract as set forth
in the plan shall remain at the natural angle of repose.
(3) The time, not to exceed three years, within which earth removal
shall cease and the plan complied with.
(4) A bond not to exceed $100 for each acre of such portion of the tract
of land to ensure compliance with the plan as filed.
C. Issuance. Upon the submission of a license application which meets the
requirements of this chapter, the Building Inspector shall consider the
application and, upon his approval thereof and the payment of the
current fee,45 shall issue a license for earth removal on the portion of
the tract of land specified in such approved application. Such approval
by the Building Inspector shall be based upon his finding that the
application as presented is in proper order and that adherence to the
required plan contained therein will, upon completion of earth removal
operations on such portion of the tract of land, provide the following:
(1) That all slopes shall remain at the natural angle of repose.
(2) That the portion of the tract will not permanently collect stagnant
water.
(3) Ground cover of a type and thickness sufficient to effectively
control wind and water erosion shall be provided.

application, shall meet the requirements of an original plan as specified in
this chapter, shall contain a statement indicating the applicant's reason for
seeking a revision, and shall specify the time within which earth removal
shall cease and the revised plan complied with. Such time shall not exceed
the then-unexpired portion of the time specified therefor in the original,
approved application. Such revised plan may be approved by the Building
Inspector upon his finding that the revised plan meets the requirements
of § 85-5 for the approval of an original application and that the revision
is not sought to alleviate a hardship created by the licensee's failure to
conduct earth removal operations in such a way as to reasonably anticipate
the needs of, and provide for the implementation of, the plan contained in
the original application.
§ 85-7. Public notice of license issuance or approval of revised plan.
Notice of the issuance of an earth removal license or the approval of a
revised plan under an issued license shall be given by publication of notice
to that effect in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town, which
notice shall be published within seven days of such issuance or approval.
§ 85-8. Failure of licensee to complete plan; lien.
If a licensee under this chapter shall fail to complete the plan contained in
the approved application within the time specified therein, then, in addition
to action against the licensee's bond, the Director of Public Works, after 30
days' written notice to the licensee, is authorized to undertake and complete
the plan. In the event of such undertaking by the Director of Public Works,
the owner of the land specified in the application shall reimburse the Town
for its necessary expenses in connection therewith, and such expenses shall
constitute a lien upon the entire tract of land of which any portion has been
specified in an approved application.
§ 85-9. License revocation.
The Zoning Board of Review, upon petition or on its own motion, may revoke
any earth removal license issued pursuant to this chapter for violation of
any of the provisions of this chapter. Prior to any action of the Zoning Board
of Review, it shall hold a hearing thereon and give the licensee seven days'
notice of the hearing.

Suit may be brought in the Superior Court in the name of the Town to
restrain any violation of, or compel compliance with, the provisions of this
chapter.
§ 85-11. Special exceptions.
Upon special application, and after a showing that the literal enforcement
of this chapter will work a hardship, the Zoning Board of Review may grant
§ 85-6 CHARTER § 85-11
C:185
an exception to any terms of this chapter upon a finding that such exception
will not result in a substantial depreciation of surrounding property.
§ 85-12. Appeals to Zoning Board of Review.
Appeals from the decisions of the Building Inspector to the Zoning Board
of Review shall be taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules
of the board after publication of the notice of such decision as provided in
§ 85-7. Such appeals shall be taken in the same manner as other appeals to
the Zoning Board, and the procedure as to notice and hearings shall be the
same insofar as consistent herewith.
§ 85-13. Effect on existing earth removal project.
A. The provisions of the article shall not apply to earth removal being
conducted on February 28, 1974, until 60 days thereafter, except that
application for a license may be made and a license issued as provided
by this chapter during the sixty-day period following February 28, 1974;
provided, however, that the plan required in such application need not
set forth existing contours for that portion of the tract of land on which
earth removal has been completed on February 28, 1974. Upon
submission to the Director of Public Works of the plan and material as
aforesaid, the Director of Public Works shall forthwith issue an earth
removal license for the continuance of earth removal on such land.
B. Real property acquired or leased prior to November 6, 1973, for the
purpose of earth removal and held for such purpose on February 28,
1974, shall be considered in use for earth removal whether or not
extraction has then actually commenced. To qualify under this
subsection, the following conditions shall be considered as conclusive
evidence that such real property was acquired or leased and held for
the purpose of later mineral extraction:
(1) Such real property was acquired or leased prior to November 6,

Development Impact Fees
[Adopted 4-9-2012 by Ord. No. 820]
§ 93-2. Legislative findings.
The Town Council of the Town of East Greenwich finds, determines and
declares that, in accordance with R.I.G.L. § 45-22.4-1 et seq., the Town has
conducted a needs assessment (Tischler, 2001) and a "Review of Impact
Fees," dated October 18, 2008. Further review in Winter 2011-2012
resulted in use of an updated annual capital improvements program (CIP)
to identify those capital investments required to meet the needs created by
growth in population, housing and business establishments going forward
into the future.
§ 93-3. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING  Residential housing that has a sales price or
rental amount that is within the means of a household that is moderate
income or less. In the case of dwelling units for sale, housing that is
affordable means housing in which principal, interest, taxes (which may be
adjusted by state or local programs for tax relief) and insurance constitute
no more than 30% of the gross household income for a household with
less than 120% of the area median income, adjusted for family size. In the
case of dwelling units for rent, housing that is affordable means housing for
which rent, heat and utilities other than telephone constitute no more than
30% of the gross annual household income for a household with 80% or
less of area median income, adjusted for family size. To meet the definition
of "affordable," housing must carry a deed restriction guaranteeing that
affordability for a period of not less than 30 years.
BEDROOM  A room located within a dwelling or dwelling unit intended to
be used for sleeping purposes.
Such room(s) shall consist of the following:
A minimum of 70 square feet with no horizontal dimension less
than seven feet;

A minimum finished ceiling height of seven feet six inches for not
less than 50% of the required room area;
(2)
At least one window meeting the definition of "emergency escape
and rescue window" per the Rhode Island State Building Code (R1
SBC-2) or an exterior door which leads directly to the outside; and
(3)
(4) An operable interior door which provides privacy to the room.
A.
§ 93-2 CHARTER § 93-3
C:197
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM  That component of the municipal
budget that sets out the need for public facility and equipment capital
improvements, the cost of the improvements, and proposed funding
sources. A capital improvement program must cover at least a five-year
period and should be reviewed at least every five years.
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS  Improvements with a useful life of 10 years
or more which increase or improve the service capacity of a public facility.
DEVELOPER  A person or legal entity undertaking development.
FEE PAYER  A person obtaining a building permit for an activity requiring
payment of an impact fee pursuant to § 93-4 of this article and any
successor in interest of such person.
IMPACT FEE  The charge imposed upon new development to fund all or a
portion of the capital improvements affected by the new development from
which it is collected.
PROPORTIONATE SHARE  That portion of the cost of system
improvements which reasonably relates to the service demands and needs
of the project.
PUBLIC FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT 
TOWN  The Town of East Greenwich.
§ 93-4. Imposition of impact fee.
In such cases where a dwelling or dwelling unit contains additional
rooms meeting the minimum criteria for a bedroom, but are identified
by the owner or applicant for other purposes (i.e., bonus room, office,
study, etc.), the Building Official shall determine the total number of
rooms defined as bedrooms and may rely on the Rhode Island State
Building Code and/or Rhode Island Department of Environmental
Management (RI DEM) guidelines to edify the interpretation.
B.
A. Parks and recreation land and facilities;
B. Open space;
Municipal buildings and equipment, including those for public works,
sewer treatment and public safety;
C.
D. Public schools; and
Roadway system improvements consistent with the Town's capital
improvement program.
E.
A. Any developer who, on or after passage of this article, seeks to develop
land within the Town of East Greenwich by applying for a building or
alteration permit is hereby required to pay impact fees in the manner
and amount set forth in this article, unless exempted by § 93-9 hereof.
§ 93-3 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 93-4
C:198
§ 93-5. Payment of fees.
§ 93-6. Use of funds.
B. Alteration of existing development requiring a permit that increases the
number of bedrooms, as defined in § 93-3 above, shall pay impact fees
on the additional bedrooms or floor area.
C. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any development which
was constructed or altered pursuant to a building or alteration permit
issued on or after passage of this article until all impact fees required
by this article, calculated as of the date of issuance of the building
permit, have been paid in full.
A. The fee payer shall pay the impact fees required by this article to the
Town Manager or his/her designee prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.
B. All funds collected shall be promptly transferred for deposit into a
special proprietary fund to be held and used solely for the purposes
specified in this article. Said funds shall be invested with all interest
accruing to the trust fund.
A. Within eight years of the date of collection, capital improvements
impact fees shall be expended or encumbered for the construction of
public facilities or acquisition of equipment of reasonable benefit to the
development paying the fees and that are consistent with the capital
improvement program.
B. Where the expenditure or encumbrance of fees is not feasible within
eight years, the Town Council may retain impact fees for a longer
period of time if there are compelling reasons for the longer period. In
no case shall impact fees be retained longer than 12 years.
C. In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for
advance provision of capital facilities or equipment for which impact
fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on
such bonds or similar debt instruments.
D. At least once each fiscal year, the Town Manager shall present to the
Town Council a proposed impact fee fund utilization plan for eligible
facilities and equipment. This plan shall recommend expenditure of
impact fee funds, including any accrued interest, for specific projects
and related expenses. Monies, including any accrued interest, not
assigned in any fiscal year shall be retained in an impact fee fund until
the next fiscal year, except as provided by the refund provisions of this
article.
E. Funds may be used to provide refunds as described in § 93-8 hereof.
§ 93-4 CHARTER § 93-7
C:199
§ 93-7. Recouping costs.
The Town may recoup costs of excess capacity in existing capital facilities,
where the excess capacity has been provided in anticipation of the needs of
new development, by requiring impact fees for that portion of the facilities
constructed for future users. The need to recoup costs for excess capacity
must have been documented by a preconstruction or pre-acquisition
assessment that demonstrated the need for the excess capacity. The fees
imposed to recoup the costs to provide the excess capacity must be based
on the Town's actual cost of acquiring, constructing, or upgrading the
facility and must be no more than a proportionate share of the costs
to provide the excess capacity. That portion of an impact fee deemed
recoupment is exempted from the provisions of § 93-6A hereof.
§ 93-8. Refund of impact fees.
§ 93-9. Exemptions and credits.
A. If impact fees are not expended or encumbered within the period
established in § 93-6, the Town shall refund to the fee payer or his or
her successors the amount of the fee paid and accrued interest. The
Town shall send the refund to the fee payer at the last known address by
certified mail within one year of the date on which the right to claim the
refund arises. All refunds due and not claimed within one year shall be
retained by the Town.
B. If the Town seeks to terminate any or all impact fee requirements, all
unexpended or unencumbered funds shall be refunded as provided
above. Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be
terminated, the Town shall place a notice of termination and availability
of refunds in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at
least two times. All funds available for refund shall be retained for a
period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds may be
transferred to the general fund and used for any public purpose. The
Town is released from this notice requirement if there are no
unexpended or unencumbered balances within a fund or funds being
terminated.
A. Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from payment of an
impact fee:
(1) Remodeling, rehabilitation or other improvements to an existing
structure or rebuilding a damaged structure, unless there is an
increase in the number of bedrooms, as defined in § 93-3, for which
an impact fee is collected. Impact fees shall be imposed when
property which is owned or controlled by federal, state or Town
government is converted to private ownership or control.

B. Credits.
(1) Land and/or capital improvements may be offered by the fee payer
as total or partial payment of the required impact fee. The need for
the dedication or construction must be clearly documented in the
Town's capital improvement program or Comprehensive
Community Plan. The land proposed for dedication or the facilities
to be constructed will not be accepted unless the Town Manager
determines them to be appropriate for the proposed purpose. The
offer must specifically request or provide for an impact fee credit. If
the Town Manager accepts such an offer, the credit shall be
determined and provided in the following manner:
(a) Credit for the dedication of land shall be valued at 100% of the
most recent assessed value by the Town Tax Assessor or by fair
market value established by a private appraiser acceptable to
the Town Manager. Credit for the dedication of land shall be
provided when the property has been accepted by the Town
Council and conveyed at no charge to the Town.
(b) Applicants for credit for construction of improvements shall
submit acceptable engineering drawings and specifications
and construction cost estimates to the Town Manager, who
shall determine the credit for construction based upon either
these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria
and construction cost estimates if the Town Manager
determines that such estimates submitted by the applicant are
either unreliable or inaccurate. The Town Manager shall
provide the applicant with a letter or certificate setting forth
the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, and
the legal description or other adequate description of the
project or development to which the credit may be applied. The
applicant must sign and date a duplicate copy of such letter or
certificate indicating his or her agreement to the terms of the
letter or certificate and return such signed document to the
Town Manager before credit will be given. The failure of the
applicant to sign, date and return such document within 60
days shall nullify the credit.

ARTICLE I
Fire Marshal
[Adopted 6-4-2018 by Ord. No. 876]
§ 100-1. Fire prevention, inspection and investigation division (Fire
Marshal).
A. Summary.
(1) Under the authority of the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal, there
shall be a Fire Marshal who shall enforce and perform the duties
required by the Comprehensive Fire Safety Act, and all other
provisions of the general and public laws insofar as such powers
and duties relate to fires, fire prevention, fire protection, fire
inspection, fire investigation, fire training and public education
programs. The Fire Marshal also serves as the fire department
representative at all Technical Review Committee meetings to
ensure early development input. The mission of the Fire Marshal is
the comprehensive, professional, and consistent enforcement of
the Fire Safety Code to ensure that the minimum requirements
necessary for fire and life safety are met. This requires the Fire
Marshal to perform the roles of code enforcement official, fire
investigator and educator.
(2) Fire prevention activities that are provided by the Town are part of
a comprehensive plan to protect life and property from fire and
other hazards. Code enforcement, preconstruction plan review,
public fire education and the investigation of fires are all
components of the prevention plan. The Fire Marshal, or his or her
qualified designee, are responsible for implementing and managing
activities under this section. The Office of State Fire Marshal
certifies staff serving in these positions.
(3) Inspections of commercial occupancies are conducted to monitor
and rectify conditions that may cause fire situations or the spread
of fire. The primary objective of these inspections is to ensure the
safe egress of occupants or employees who may be endangered by
fire or its byproducts. The Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified
designee, shall work in cooperation with building, planning and
zoning, and potential commercial and residential property owners
to facilitate proper certifications for occupancy. It is also the
responsibility of the Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee,
to enforce all aspects of local, state and federal regulations/codes
pertaining to fire and life safety compliance.
B. Plan review.
(1) Any person, including any partnership, corporation or association,
undertaking the erection, extension, alteration, repair, or moving of
a structure, or undertaking any changes that may affect the fire
safety or fire alarm system of a building or any portion thereof,
§ 100-1 CHARTER § 100-1
C:205
shall be required to make application for plan review to the Fire
Marshal, or his or her qualified designee. Said application shall be
made prior to the start of any construction or work and shall be
accompanied by the proper fee or fees as described in Subsection
B(2) hereof. All rough and final inspections, as necessary, shall be
considered as part of the plan review fee and will not be charged
separately. No construction or work shall be started until the
required application has been approved by the Fire Marshal, or his
or her qualified designee.
(2) A plan review application must be submitted along with the initial
plans. When filling out this application, be sure to fill out all
sections completely before submitting. In his code enforcement
role, the Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, conducts a
review of all submitted plans to determine the adequacy of the
plans before starting a formal review. If the plans submitted are
complete and satisfactory, they will be accepted, and the formal
review process will begin. All fees for such reviews shall be in
accordance with RIGL 23-28.2-26, Plan review fees.
(3) In all matters relating to plan review, the interpretations and
decisions of the Town's Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified
designee, shall be binding. If the applicant disagrees with the
decision of the Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, the
applicant may request a variance or seek appeal to the Rhode
Island Fire Safety Code Board of Appeal and Review.
(4) The Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, shall perform
smoke and carbon monoxide detector inspections in all residential
occupancies and shall, at the time of inspection, be allowed to
charge a fee of $30 for the inspection of any residential occupancy.
The responsibility of this charged fee will be borne by the seller on
each occurrence before title to the property is transferred. A fee of
$30 will be allowed for any subsequent reinspection of the same
residential occupancy due to improper installation, wrong location,
improper wiring method, or the seller's failure to maintain a
mutually agreed-upon appointment with the Fire Marshal. The fees
collected by the Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, shall
be used for fire prevention purposes.
(5) The following residential/commercial/businesses are inspected by
the East Greenwich Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee:
(a) All elementary, secondary and high schools (K-12).
(b) Private colleges.
(c) Retail gas stations and service stations.
(d) Apartment houses.
(e) Theaters.
§ 100-1 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 100-1
C:206
(f) Hotels and motels.
(g) Bed-and-breakfast buildings.
(h) Lodging or rooming houses.
(i) All industrial occupancies.
(j) All private business occupancies.
(k) All private mercantile occupancies.
(l) All private storage occupancies.
(m) All Town-licensed and -registered businesses per Town
ordinance.
(n) Rough and final commercial and residential inspections from
plan review.
(o) Complaints related to code violations.
C. Investigations.
(1) The Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, is authorized by
statute to respond to any fire or apparently attempted fire and
investigate the cause or origin of the fire. The Fire Marshal, or his
or her qualified designee, will also request that the State Fire
Marshal respond to every fire of suspicious origin and any fire that
results in a fatality. The Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified
designee, responds to all building fires as well as when requested
by the responding fire officer. All investigators follow industry
guidelines to establish the cause and determine whether the fire
will be classified as accidental, incendiary, natural, or
undetermined. Due to the complex nature of fire investigation, the
Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified designee, often works closely
with other local, state, and federal agencies.
(2) The investigations of all fires arc conducted to determine cause and
origin of ignition. This information is required to prevent the
occurrence of future fires or, at the least, reduce the severity of
such incidents. If a fire is determined to be of suspicious origin, a
thorough investigation is intended to prosecute the guilty party. In
this case, the investigation becomes a deterrent to the crime of
arson. When necessary, the Fire Marshal, or his or her qualified
designee, may utilize the expertise of mutual aid fire investigators,
members of the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal's Office or agents
from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms or Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

encroachment, and to maintain the capability of floodplains to retain and
carry off floodwaters. The Town of East Greenwich elects to comply with the
requirements of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (P.L. 90-488, as
amended).
§ 113-2. Establishment of special flood hazard areas; administration
and enforcement.
A. Special flood hazard areas (b, c, d, e communities with modifications).
For communities adopting specific panel numbers with countywide
FIRMs and FIS: The special flood hazard areas are herein established
as a floodplain overlay district. The district includes all special flood
hazard areas within the Town of East Greenwich designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A99, V, or VE on the Kent County Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) and Digital FIRM issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National
Flood Insurance Program. The map panels of the Kent County FIRM
that are wholly or partially within the Town of East Greenwich are panel
numbers: 44003C0116H, 44003C0117H, 44003C0118G,
44003C0119G, 44003C0136G, 44003C0138G, 44003C0231G,
44003C0232G, 44003C0251G dated December 3, 2010, and
44003C0137H, 44003C0139H dated September 18, 2013. The exact
boundaries of the district may be defined by the one-hundred-year base
flood elevations shown on the FIRM and further defined by the Kent
County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated October 2, 2015. The
office of the Building Official is responsible for floodplain management.
The FIRM and FIS report, and any revisions thereto, are incorporated
herein by reference and are on file with the Building Official, Town
Clerk and the Planning Department. [Amended 9-8-2015 by Ord. No.

B. Administrative provisions.
(1) Building permit. All proposed construction or other development
within a special flood hazard area shall require a permit.
(a) The National Flood Insurance Program special flood hazard
area requires permits for all projects that meet the definition of
"development," not just building projects. Development
projects include any filling, grading, excavation, mining,
drilling, storage of materials, temporary stream crossings. If
the construction or other development within a special flood
hazard area is not covered by a building permit, all other
nonstructural activities shall be permitted by either the Rhode
Island Coastal Resources Management Council and/or the
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, as
applicable. Therefore, if another state agency issues a permit,
the local Building Official must have the opportunity for input
and keep a copy of the respective permit in his files.

applicant shall submit evidence that all necessary permits and
approvals have been received from all government agencies
from which approval is required by federal or state law. A
permit fee (based on the cost of the construction) may be
required to be paid to the Town of East Greenwich, and a copy
of a receipt for the same shall accompany the application. An
additional fee may be charged if the Code Enforcement Officer
and/or Board of Appeals needs the assistance of a professional
engineer.
(2) Disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by
this chapter is considered reasonable but does not imply total flood
protection.
(3) Severability. If any section, provision or portion of this chapter is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court, the remainder of
the chapter shall not be affected.
(4) Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter shall not in any
way impair/remove the necessity of compliance with any other
applicable laws, ordinances, regulations, etc. Where this chapter
imposes a greater restriction, the provisions of this chapter shall
control.
(5) Enforcement. The Building Official shall enforce all provisions as
applicable in reference to R.I.G.L. § 23-27.3-108.1.

residential structures shall have the top of the lowest floor at least
§ 113-3 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 113-4
C:214
as high as the FIRM's depth number above the highest adjacent
grade, and nonresidential structures shall be elevated or
floodproofed above the highest adjacent grade to at least as high as
the depth number on the FIRM. On FIRMs without a depth number
for the AO Zone, structures shall be elevated or floodproofed to
at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade (c, d, e
communities, if AO appear).
(3) In Zones A1-30 and AE, along watercourses that have a regulatory
floodway designated on the Kent County FIRM, encroachments are
prohibited in the regulatory floodway which would result in any
increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge (d, e communities).
(4) All subdivision proposals must be designed to assure that:
(a) Such proposals minimize flood damage;
(b) All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
(c) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards (b, c, d, e communities).
(5) Detached accessory structures in Zones A, AE, A1-30, AO and AH
(i.e., garages, sheds) do not have to meet the elevation or dry
floodproofing requirement if the following standards are met:
(a) The structure has a value less than $1,000.
(b) The structure has unfinished interiors and must not be used for
human habitation. An apartment, office or other finished space
over a detached garage is considered human habitation and
would require the structure to be elevated.
(c) The structure is not in the floodway.
(d) The structure is not used for storage of hazardous materials.
(e) The structure is used solely for parking of vehicles and/or
limited storage.
(f) The accessory must be wet floodproofed and designed to allow

C:215
§ 113-5. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this chapter
pertain to floodplain management and have the same meanings as they have
in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
(6) Existing contour intervals of site and elevations of existing
structures must be included on plan proposal (optional for b, c, d,
e communities).
(7) No person shall change from business/commercial to residential
use of any structure or property located in the floodway of a special
flood hazard area so as to result in a use or expansion that could
increase the risk to the occupants.
(8) The space below the lowest floor shall be:
(a) Free of obstructions as described in FEMA Technical Bulletin
5, "Free of Obstruction Requirements for Buildings Located in
Coastal High Hazard Area in Accordance with the National
Flood Insurance Program"; or
(b) Constructed with open wood latticework or insect screening
intended to collapse under wind and water without causing
collapse, displacement or other structural damage to the
elevated portion of the building or supporting piles or columns;
or
(c) Designed with an enclosed area less than 300 square feet that
is constructed with nonsupporting breakaway walls that have a
design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 nor more
than 20 pounds per square foot.
C. Base flood elevation and floodway data.
(1) Floodway data. In Zones A, A1-30 and AE, along watercourses that
have not had a regulatory floodway designated, the best available
federal, state, local or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit
encroachments in floodways which would result in any increase in
flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(2) Base flood elevation data. Base flood elevation data is required for
subdivision proposals or other developments greater than 50 lots
or five acres, whichever is the lesser, within unnumbered A Zones.
(3) Base flood elevations in A Zones. In the absence of FEMA BFE data
and floodway data, the best available federal, state, local or other

the Harbormaster shall determine the number of moorings
available for new mooring space as the sum of all authorized
mooring spaces for which acceptable applications for renewal were
not received. In accordance with Coastal Resources Management
Council (CRMC) Harbor Management Guidelines, moorings shall
be allocated in a ratio of no greater than three East Greenwich
residents to each nonresident. If at any time a mooring field is
established or relocated to within a federal navigation project, then
the mooring allocations shall meet the Army Corps of Engineers
requirement of "open to all on a fair and equitable basis."
(2) Only one mooring permit may be issued to a boat owner other than
a commercial user. In order to ensure an adequate number of
moorings to be available for individual permit applicants, no more
than a total of 35 commercial mooring permits may be issued.
(3) Consideration shall be given to water quality concerns, parking,
boating safety and public access when determining the total
number of mooring permits to be issued.
D. Original application for mooring permit. Application shall be made on
mooring application forms provided by the Parks and Recreation
Department and shall be filed with the Parks and Recreation
Department. No mooring shall be located or maintained unless the
owner has obtained a current mooring permit.
E. Mooring permit waiting list. A waiting list for mooring permits will be
established and maintained by the East Greenwich Parks and
Recreation Department. Chronological order of date of application will
determine the waiting list. Persons on the waiting list who do not apply
for a permit within 10 business days when notified that a mooring
location appropriate to their boat size is available will be removed from
the mooring waiting list.
F. Mooring permits valid for one year only. Mooring permits are valid for a
period not to exceed one year, unless renewed as referenced in this
chapter.
G. Application for mooring permits and renewals.
(1) Applications for new or abandoned moorings may be made at any
time.
(2) Applications for mooring renewals must be submitted no later than
March 1 of each succeeding year. No applications for renewals of
§ 128-6 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 128-6
C:232
mooring permits will be accepted after March 1. All valid permits,
if not renewed, shall expire March 1 of the next year.
(3) Failure to renew an existing mooring, properly permitted, by March
1 of any given year shall result in the registered owner's
abandonment of all rights and interest in said mooring.
(4) A new permittee will be granted a mooring permit without a boat
for no more than one boating season.
(5) A current permit holder must have a registered boat on file but may
renew the permit for no more than one consecutive boating season
without a registered boat.
(6) Commercial mooring holders must submit documentation with the
mooring application indicating that the business is a registered
commercial business and provide proof of insurance naming the
Town of East Greenwich as an additional insured.
H. Mooring registration fee. All applications shall be accompanied by the
registration fee established by the Town Council. Registration fees shall
not be refundable. Upon approval of a mooring permit, the full mooring
fee shall be paid to the Parks and Recreation Department within 10
days.
I. Mooring permits nontransferable.
(1) Permits issued under this chapter shall not be transferable.
(2) An assigned mooring shall be used only by the boat registered to it.
The boat using a residential or nonresidential mooring must be
registered to the mooring permit holder. This restriction shall not
apply to commercial moorings or recreational boating facilities/
marinas. Exceptions to this shall be made at the Harbormaster's
discretion.
J. Mooring location. All mooring locations will be approved and
designated by the Harbormaster through the Mooring Committee. If a
replacement vessel is significantly smaller, larger or of different draft or
type, the Harbormaster shall have the right to relocate the vessel to
another, more suitable mooring.
K. Transient moorings. Space for rental transient moorings is made
available through the East Greenwich Yacht Club.
L. Appeal of permit denial. Appeals of permit denial or no action must be
made to the Town Manager within 10 working days.
M. Illegal moorings/abandons.
(1) Any mooring on or maintained in Greenwich Cove which has not
been issued a permit and/or does not comply with each and every
specification set forth in this chapter shall be deemed an illegal
§ 128-6 CHARTER § 128-6
C:233
mooring and shall be removed at the owner's expense. All existing
moorings must be registered and approved and comply or they
shall be removed.
(2) Whenever any mooring is placed in or remains in Greenwich Cove
in violation of this chapter, the Harbormaster shall cause the
mooring to be removed.
(3) The permit holders or other such persons concerned with moorings
that have been removed by the Harbormaster shall be liable to pay
the cost and expenses of such removal, or to repay the cost and
expenses when paid out by the Town, and the cost and expenses
may be recovered in an action brought by the Town against such
persons.
N. Mooring tackle specifications. Utilization of proper mooring tackle is
necessary to moor vessels adequately at their moorings. This chapter
hereby establishes a minimum standard for tackle to moor vessels in
Greenwich Cove. The Town assumes no liability for personal injury or
property damage which results from the utilization of any tackle which
meets or exceeds these recommendations.
(1) Boat and/or mooring owners shall be liable for any damage caused
by faulty, inadequate or improperly placed moorings.
(2) It is the owner's responsibility to maintain the mooring and to have
the tackle inspected by a qualified mooring inspector at least every
three years. Certification of inspection will be kept on file with the
Harbormaster.
(3) Each mooring which has been approved as set forth shall be
assigned a registration number. Each mooring buoy or float must
be clearly visible and legibly marked with its assigned number. All
mooring buoys shall be marked with a clearly legible number
(three-inch minimum number height) assigned by the Parks and
Recreation Department.

General Provisions
§ 134-1. Purpose and policy.
A. This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for indirect industrial
wastewater discharges in the Town and enables the Town to comply
with all applicable state and federal laws required by the Clean Water
Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part
403).
B. The objectives of this chapter are:
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the
system or contaminate the resulting sludge;
(2) To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere, or
otherwise be incompatible with the system;
(3) To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters and
sludges from the system; and
(4) To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the municipal
wastewater system.
C. This chapter provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributors to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance
of permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of
general requirements for other users, authorizes monitoring and
enforcement activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing
customer's capacity will not be preempted, and provides for the setting
of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established in this chapter.
D. This chapter shall apply to the Town and to persons outside the Town
who are, by contract or agreement with the Town, users of the Town
POTW. This chapter is a supplement to the existing rules and
regulations controlling the installation and connection of building
sewers and the discharge of waters and wastes into the public sewer
system in the Town, and the requirements and stipulations of this
chapter are in addition to those of the rules and regulations. Except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, the Director of Public Works of the
Town POTW shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of
this chapter.

Regulation of Discharges
§ 134-12. General discharge prohibitions. [Amended 7-26-1994 by
Ord. No. 614]
A. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the
operation or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions
apply to all such users of a POTW, whether or not the user is subject to
National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other national,
state or local pretreatment standards or requirements. A user may not
contribute the following substances to any POTW:
(1) Any liquid, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are or may be sufficient, either alone or by interaction with
other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any
other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW, including,
but not limited to, waste streams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than 140° F. or 60° C. using the test measures specified in 40
CFR 261.21 or its successor section. At no time shall two
successive readings on an explosion hazard meter at the point of
discharge into the system (or any point in the system) be more than
5% nor any single reading over 10% of the lower explosion limit
(LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited
to, gasoline, kerosene, petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil,
or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause
interference or pass-through, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylenes,
ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates,
bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides, and any other
substances which the Town, the state or the EPA has notified the
user is a fire hazard to the system.
(2) Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the
wastewater treatment facilities, such as but not limited to grease,
garbage with particles greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension,
animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or
fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand,
spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings,
grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper, wood,
plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or
polishing wastes.
(3) Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 9.5, or
wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing
damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the
POTW.
§ 134-12 CHARTER § 134-12
C:247
(4) Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a
hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving
waters of the POTW, or exceed the limitation set forth in a
categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic pollutant shall include
but not be limited to any pollutant identified pursuant to Section
307(a) of the Act.
(5) Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which, either
singly or by interaction with other wastes, are sufficient to create a
public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance and repair.
(6) Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW, such as residues, sludges or scums, to be
unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the
reclamation process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the
POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or
disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
Section 405 of the Act or any criteria, guidelines or regulations
affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid
Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control
Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method
being used.
(7) Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality
standards.
(8) Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions.
(9) Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but
in no case a wastewater discharge which causes the wastewater
temperature at the point of introduction to the POTW treatment
plant to exceed 29° C. (85° F.) at any time.
(10) Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.),
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user
knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW.
In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain
concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time
period longer than 15 minutes more than 5 times the average
twenty-four-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal
operation.
(11) Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by
§ 134-12 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 134-12

the Director in compliance with applicable state or federal
regulations.
(12)No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will pass through the
POTW into the waters of Greenwich Cove.
(13) Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
B. When the Director determines that a user is contributing to the POTW
any of the enumerated substances in this section in such amounts as to
interfere with the operation of the POTW or otherwise inhibit the
achievement of the objectives of this chapter the Director shall:
(1) Advise the user of the impact of the contribution on the POTW; and
(2) Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the
interference with the POTW.
A. In accordance with and consistent with the objectives of this chapter,
the Director may establish specific limitations on pollutant discharges
to the Town's POTW. The Director shall limit any specific pollutant
discharges where such limitation is considered in the best interests of
the Town in properly maintaining and operating the POTW.

chapter.
§ 134-16. Town's right of revision.
The Town reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal
system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in
§ 134-1.
§ 134-17. Excessive discharge.
No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt
to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate
treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards or in any other pollutantspecific
limitation developed by the Town or state. Dilution through the
combination of waste streams may be an acceptable means of complying
with some of the prohibitions set forth in § 134-12, e.g., the pH prohibition.
§ 134-18. Accidental discharges.
limits in the federal pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall
mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature
of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic
or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in
95% of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures
set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2) of Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 403, "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing
and New Sources of Pollution," promulgated pursuant to the Act. The
Town may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal
pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR, Part
403, Section 403.7, are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval
authority is obtained.
A. Protection required. Each user shall provide protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this
chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own
cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Town for
review and shall be approved by the Town before construction of the
facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan within 180 days of
the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived.
No user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective
date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived shall be
permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental
§ 134-14 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 134-18
C:254
discharge procedures have been approved by the Town. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter. In the case of an
accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall
include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume,
and corrective actions.
B. Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the
user shall submit to the Director a detailed written report describing
the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense loss damage or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
by this chapter or other applicable law.
C. Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's
bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that
all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to
occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of
the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where requested by the Director, of
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable
pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be
prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis
shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by
the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with
any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling
shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by
the Administrator. Where 40 CFR Part 136 does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication "Sampling and Analysis
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority

A. The Town shall require to be provided and operated, at the user's own
expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems.
The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the Town may, when such a location would be impractical
or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed

obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
B. There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
user.

shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review and shall be
approved by the Director before construction of the facility. The review
of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the Director under the provisions of this
chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or
method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Director prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
B. The Town shall annually publish, in the Rhode Island Pendulum
newspaper, a notice as to the users which, during the previous 12
months, were significantly violating applicable pretreatment standards
or other pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this
subsection, a significant violation is a violation which remains
uncorrected 45 days after notification; which is part of a pattern of
noncompliance over a twelve-month period; which involves a failure to
accurately report noncompliance; or which resulted in the Town
suspending a discharge permit or taking other emergency action under
this chapter.
C. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the approval authority upon request.
A. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
§ 134-26 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 134-28
C:262
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is
able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Town that the release of
such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as a trade secret of the user.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not
be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses
related to this chapter, the national pollutant discharge elimination
system (NPDES) permit, the state disposal system permit and/or the
pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a
report shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will
not be recognized as confidential information.
C. Information accepted by the Town as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the
Town until and unless a ten-day notification is given to the user.

The Town Council enacts this legislation for the sole purpose of securing
and promoting the public health, comfort, safety and welfare of its citizenry.
While recognizing inherent constitutional rights of freedom of speech and

regulate the use of sound-amplifying equipment in order to protect the
correlative constitutional rights of the citizens of this Town to privacy and
freedom from the public nuisance of loud noise.

It shall be unlawful for any person, other than personnel of law enforcement
or governmental agencies, to install, use or operate within the Town soundamplifying
equipment out of doors in a fixed or movable position or mounted
upon any sound truck for any purpose without first obtaining a permit from
the Town Council if held by an entertainment license holder, and from the
Chief of Police or his designee if not by an entertainment license holder.
§ 152-9. Filing and approval or disapproval of permit.
A. Application for nonentertainment license holder. Every person not
holding an entertainment license and seeking to use sound-amplifying

the likely effect of the particular application on traffic, both vehicular
and pedestrian, as well as the effect on public health, safety and

applications for use only in a designated area as established in this
chapter. In so doing, only one permit shall be assigned to a given
designated area. The permittee shall be assigned to the designated area

welfare.

prominently display the special event permit issued pursuant to the

greengrocer, nor within 300 feet of places of worship, or places of
worship 1/2 hour before, during or 1/2 hour after services or activities
within such places of worship. No flowers shall be sold within 300 feet
of the intersection of two or more arterial streets (those having a rightof-
way width of 60 feet or greater) or from any location from which the
activity would restrict or interfere with the ingress or egress of abutting
property owners, create a public nuisance, increase traffic congestion
or delay, constitute a hazard to life and property, or obstruct adequate
access to fire, police or safety vehicles.

advancement can only be made by superior police work, intelligence

opportunity is theirs if they but apply themselves studiously to the
performance of their police duties.

protection of life and property. We shall have the respect of the people
of East Greenwich if we perform our duty in accordance with the

Law Enforcement Code of Ethics
As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve
mankind; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent
against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation, and
the peaceful against violence and disorder; and to respect the
constitutional rights of all men to liberty, equality, and justice.
I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all; maintain
courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop selfrestraint;
and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others and honest
in thought and deed in both my personal and official life. I will be
exemplary in obeying the laws of the land and the regulations of my
Department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is
confided in me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless
revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.
I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices,
animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no
compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I
will enforce the law courageously and appropriately without fear or
favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence,
and never accepting gratuities.
I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I
accept it as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics
of the police service. I will constantly strive to achieve those objectives
and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my chosen professionlaw
enforcement.

Rules and Regulations
§ 179-10. Introduction.
§ 179-11. Severability.
If any part of these regulations is rendered inoperable or declared illegal
by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the balance of the entire
manual will remain in full force and effect.
§ 179-12. Gender of words.
Every word importing the masculine gender only shall be construed to
extend to and to include females as well as males.
A. The regulations in the Town's Police Manual are adopted as a guide for
the discipline and government of the Police Department. It cannot be
expected that any set of regulations will cover all situations or
emergencies which arise. In a role as complex as that of a police officer,
intelligence and discretion will often be the only available guidelines.
B. There is a need for standards of conduct and general rules in any
organization, especially one in an area as important as law
enforcement. These regulations are formulated to meet that need and
shall consist of Sections I, II and III of the Town's Police Manual.
Section I of the manual is entitled "Rules and Regulations" and defines
the minimal expectations of all members and employees of the Police
Department. Section II contains job descriptions and is called "Duties
by Rank and Assignment." Section III contains "Policies and
Procedures." These are the policies of the Department for a variety of
situations which may arise during an officer's tour of duty. Procedures
for implementing each policy are also listed.69
C. Department members and employees are required to read and be
familiar with the contents of the Police Manual. The purpose of this
manual is not to provide the Chief or appointing authority with a tool for
punishing officers. Rather it is an attempt at improving the
effectiveness of the Police Department by making clear to all officers
and employees what is expected of them and what they can expect of
fellow officers and employees.
D. It is anticipated that from time to time this manual will need revision.
Times, attitudes and policies change. This manual was printed in looseleaf
form so that revisions can be made more easily. New pages will be
printed and inserted whenever changes are made.
69.Editor's Note: Sections I and II of the Town Police Manual appear in this chapter as
Articles II and III. Section III is on file in the Clerk's office.

A. Summary.
(1) The Town Manager, with the approval of the Town Council upon the
recommendation of the Chief of Police, shall appoint superior
officers subordinate to the Chief of Police in the manner prescribed
by ordinance. Superior officer ranks shall be designated as
Captain, Lieutenant and Sergeant. Superior officers shall take
precedence by seniority, i.e., date of appointment in present rank.

elevation to present rank shall be the factor determining the
seniority. The assigned senior officer present for duty in each
subdivision of the force shall be in command of the subdivision if
and when a superior officer is not on duty, unless otherwise ordered
by competent authority.
(2) Every superior officer in the Department, by law and by these rules
and regulations, has sufficient authority to perform his assigned
mission, and any superior officer who is directed to act in a capacity
of rank above his ordinary or usual rank shall for that necessary
time possess the authority of that rank.
§ 179-50 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 179-51
C:374
(3) Every member of the permanent force has a supervisory officer;
namely the next officer above him in the line of command. All
supervisory officers, and those temporarily assigned as such, are
accountable for the proper execution of every order and are
therefore required to supervise the execution of every order,
written regulation, oral instruction or delegation of authority. The
lack of his physical presence does not relieve the superior of his
supervisory responsibilities. It is his specific duty to know who his
immediate supervisory officer is and to ensure that all subordinates
know their supervisory officer.
B. Duties and responsibilities. It is the duty and responsibility of a superior
officer to:
(1) Effectively perform his assigned duties as detailed in the
Department rules and regulations, manuals, orders (written or
verbal) or in the generally accepted and traditional customs of the
police service. He shall convey the intent and spirit of orders and
directives to all subordinates.
(2) Display personal and supervisory qualities that foster efficiency,
discipline and morale in his subordinates. He shall set an example
in sobriety, courtesy, initiative, courage, integrity, sincerity,
decisiveness, judgment, fairness and devotion to duty.
(3) Be continually responsible to members of higher rank and always
follow through on his assignments to ensure that subordinates
know and understand Department policies, procedures and orders.
(4) Promptly obey all orders of his commanding officer and issue
orders in a clear, concise and definite manner to his subordinates.
He shall not issue any order that is unlawful or in violation of
Department regulations.
(5) Except in an emergency or when it is required for the good of the
Department, not give any order to a subordinate who is not
assigned to his command.
(6) Conduct personal inspections at suitable intervals to determine
that all assignments are performed as ordered, anticipated results
are attained, Department resources are fully exploited for the
accomplishment of the police mission, and that any apparent needs
or operational deficiencies of the Department are revealed.
(7) Make an immediate, impartial report to his commanding officer
relating any incident which he is aware of that involves a violation
of law or Department regulation by any subordinate member or
employee of the Department. He shall similarly bring to the
attention of his commanding officer any complaint lodged against
any member or employee by another person.
§ 179-51 CHARTER § 179-51
C:375
(8) Make certain that subordinates observe regulations, obey orders
and properly execute the details, assignments and functions of the
Police Department, and otherwise maintain high standards of
discipline.
(9) Not abuse those under his command by tyrannical or capricious
conduct; by disrespect for their dignity as human beings; or by
harsh, abusive and degrading language.
(10) Inspire confidence and industriousness in his subordinates by the
use of tact in giving orders and by constructively correcting
mistakes. He shall test understanding of instructions with care so
that the subordinate will know in detail what he is to do and how he
is to do it.
(11) Avoid, as far as circumstances may permit, the censuring of a
subordinate in the presence of others, and he shall be fair and
impersonal in evaluating the work of subordinates.
(12) Be responsible for the development and maintenance of proper
professional attitudes of his subordinates in their dealings with the
public.
(13) After the completion of his tour of duty, report to his relief officer
all the facts and conditions relative to police business that may be
necessary so that the relief section coming on duty may know what
police action has been taken and what remains to be done.
(14) Designated to serve as acting Chief of Police in the absence of the
Chief of Police, perform the functions of the office of the Chief of
Police with the delegated authority of that office.
(15) Upon assignment, assist at, be present for, or conduct roll call in
accordance with specific orders of his commanding officer. A
superior officer participating in roll call shall be held equally
responsible with the superior officer calling the roll for the
attendance of all subordinate personnel. He shall ensure the fitness
for duty of all personnel and shall inspect their uniforms, weapons
and equipment. He shall be responsible that all special duty
assignments, orders or instructions necessary for the proper
performance of the police mission are carried out.
(16) Upon assignment, conduct roll call for all incoming members of
patrol units after the completion of the tour of duty. He shall
inspect their physical condition, uniforms, weapons and equipment.
Absence from roll call by any member shall be reported
immediately to the commanding officer. Reports from the incoming
relief shall be collected and delivered to the commanding officer,
and any notices or details shall be announced at this time.
(17) Perform other such duties as assigned.

of private sewer lines belonging to such residents and to the public sewer
system of the Town. The agreements and contracts shall be binding upon
future Directors of Public Works and upon the Town.
§ 197-3. Designation of person authorized to make connections.
Only such drain layers as are designated by the Director of Public Works
shall be allowed to make connection with the sewers or lay any drains in
connection therewith, and any person so designated shall give personal
attention to any work done under his permit. He shall also employ only
competent persons to do such work.
§ 197-4. Notice prior to opening streets.
Notice must be given to the Director of Public Works 24 hours before any
street or public way can be opened for the purpose of laying a private drain
or before any drainpipe can be extended from work previously done and
accepted, or new connections of any kind be made.
§ 197-5. Removal of street materials.
In opening any street or public way, all materials for paving or ballasting
must be removed with the least possible injury or loss of such materials and,
together with the excavated materials from the trenches, must be placed
where they will cause the least practical inconvenience to the public. As
little as possible of the trench must be dug until the junction piece into the
sewer is found, unless it is first determined to make a new opening into the
sewer.
§ 197-1 CHARTER § 197-6
C:387
§ 197-6. Minimum inclinations.
The minimum inclination that can be allowed for water closet, kitchen and
all other drains not over six inches in diameter and liable to receive solid
substances is 1/2 inch in two feet; and for cellar or other drains to receive
water only, 1/4 inch in two feet. The depth of the crown of a drain at the

the sewer directly opposite.
§ 197-7. Catch basins.
§ 197-8. Connection when junction is unavailable.
Where it shall be necessary to connect a drainpipe with a public sewer and
no junction is left in the sewer, the new connection with the sewer can only
be made under the direction of some person designated by the Director of
Public Works.
§ 197-9. Interior of pipe; scraping.
The inside of every drain, after it is laid, must be left smooth and perfectly
clean throughout its entire length; to ensure such standard, a scraper of
suitable material, the shape of the pipe and slightly less in diameter, shall
be drawn through each length of the pipe after the pipe has been laid.
§ 197-10. Plugging of pipes.
The ends of all pipes not to be immediately connected are to be securely
stopped by brick and cement or other watertight and imperishable
materials.
§ 197-11. Traps; venting.
All persons are required to place an effective trap in the line of drain
just before it leaves the premises and to make an open connection with a
downspout back of the trap. In addition, when possible, they shall make an
open connection with the highest part of the soil pipe within the premises
through a large pipe or flue to a point above the roof of the building, unless
a special permit to vary from such standard shall be granted by the Director
of Public Works.
A. All pipes that must be left open to drain cellars, areas, yards or gardens
must be connected with suitable catch basins which are properly
trapped.
B. No private catch basin may be built in a public street but must be
placed inside the line of the lot to be drained, except when the
sidewalks are excavated and used as cellars.
§ 197-6 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 197-12
C:388
§ 197-12. Interference with public travel.

may from time to time direct.
§ 197-13. Safeguards required.
Every drain layer must enclose any opening which he may make in the
public streets or ways with sufficient barriers, must maintain red lights
at the opening by night, and must take all other necessary precautions
to adequately guard the public against all accidents from the beginning
to the end of the work. The drain layer can only lay drains on condition
that he shall use every precaution against accidents to persons, vehicles or
property of any kind.
§ 197-14. Backfilling; settling; protection of water pipes.81
Backfilling over drains after they are laid must be puddled or solidly
rammed and, together with the replacing of ballast and paving, must be
done within 48 hours after the completion of that part of the drain lying
within the public way; done so as to make the sidewalk, gutter and roadway
at least as good as they were before they were disturbed; and done to
the satisfaction of the Director of Public Works. The owner will be held
responsible for any settlement of ground which occurs within one year on
account of laying such drain. All water pipes must be protected from injury
or settling.
§ 197-15. Completion report.
The drain layer who obtains the permit shall carefully fill out the blank
return provided for new work, alterations or additions, and return the same
to the Director of Public Works within 48 hours after the completion of the
work.

Rates and Charges
§ 197-24. Rates, charges and budget adoption.
A. Established. Pursuant to Chapter 3651 of the Public Laws of 1956,
Chapter 123 of the Public Laws of 1966, Chapter 187 of the Public Laws
of 1970, Chapter 227 of the Public Laws of 1970, and Chapter 38 of the
Public Laws of 1972, the following procedures are established to adopt
an operating budget, rate structure and capital budget:
(1) Assessment of sewer use charges.
(a) Every person whose particular sewer enters into the system at
12:00 midnight on December 31 of each year shall pay a sewer
use charge annually.
(b) In the case of sewers connected to the system subsequent to
December 31, the annual rate shall be prorated as determined
by the Director of Public Works.
(c) The Director of Public Works shall supply to the Town Clerk a
list of persons to be so charged, and the Town Clerk shall
provide this list to the Town Council and Town Manager.
(d) The Town Clerk shall also provide this list to the Town

expenditures, revenues and a sewer use rate structure, which
shall maintain at least a balance between expenditures and
revenues. The public hearing shall be advertised and copies of
the proposed budget shall be made available.
B. Sewer user classifications.
(1) To distinguish between the various potential needs of sewer system
users, this section hereby establishes the following sewer user
classifications. The Director of Public Works shall determine the
user class of all discharges to the public sewers in the Town, and
the annual charge for the use or the availability of such sewers
shall be as determined by the Director by the methods set forth in
this section.
Class Description Basis of Charge
Residential Residential (domestic),
discharging a
wastewater of "normal"
characteristics
Charge based on 85% of
water consumption at
the general rate
Commercial A Commercial
establishments
discharging wastewater
of "normal"
characteristics
Charge based on 100%
of water consumption at
the general rate
Commercial B Commercial
establishments typically
discharging wastewater
with "abnormal"
strength characteristics
(typically greater than
domestic wastes)
Charge based on 100%
of consumption at a
premium rate of 145%
of the general rate
Governmental Governmental
establishments (church,
school, public buildings,
etc.) discharging

establishments
discharging a
wastewater of "normal"
characteristics
Charge based on 100%

§ 197-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 197-24
C:394
Class Description Basis of Charge
Industrial B Industrial
establishments typically
discharging a
wastewater of
"abnormal"
characteristics
Charge based on 100%
of water consumption or
on 100% of metered
sewage discharge, plus
a surcharge for excess
BOD and SS, and/or
other waste
constituents impacting
system costs
Out of Town A user, classified as
above, located outside of
the corporate limits of
the Town of East
Greenwich
Charge based on 150%
of the fee calculated for
the user class in
Subsection B(1) of this
section for in-Town
users
(2) Based on the annual budget for the operation and maintenance of
the Town's sewerage facilities, the Director of Public Works shall
annually establish a fee rate schedule for use of the public sewers
and wastewater treatment facilities in the Town.
(3) Any sewer user wishing to dispute the sewer user classification, as
determined by the Director of Public Works, shall appeal the
classification within 15 days of being notified of such classification.
The appeal shall be made in writing to the Director of Public Works
and shall include all related documentation for the Director to
consider in reviewing the assigned classification. Within 30 days of
the receipt of such an appeal for reconsideration of a sewer user
classification, the Director shall provide a hearing in his office with
the sewer user or an authorized representative to review the
classification. A final decision on the appeal shall be made within
15 days of the hearing.
C. Procedures for establishing user charges.
(1) All users of the public sewers shall be assigned a classification as
established in Subsection B of this section. Charges for any
individual user shall be based on the rates and methods of
determining such charges as set forth in Subsection C of this
section.
(2) All users of the public sewers shall pay regular charges for the use
of such sewer services in addition to other charges and
assessments for construction of sewers, application fees, entrance
fees or connection charges, and maintenance and repair charges
for work done on private sewers by the Department of Public
Works. Such charges shall be those found necessary to provide for
the operation and maintenance of the East Greenwich sewage
§ 197-24 CHARTER § 197-24
C:395
collection system and for the proper treatment of all sewage at the
Town's wastewater treatment plant.
(3) Individual user charges shall be determined by the application of a
rate to the user's water consumption, depending upon the assigned
classification as presented in Subsection B of this section, unless
specified otherwise in this section. In the case of users classified
Industrial B or in other cases where sewage of abnormally high
strength is being discharged to the public sewers, additional
charges shall be made based on the strength of the sewage being
discharged. The basic rate and the surcharges for sewage of
abnormally high strength shall be as determined by the Director of
Public Works.
(4) Where water meters are not installed, or where a public sewer user
obtains all or a part of its water supply from a source other than the
Kent County Water Authority system, the Director shall require that
the owner install a sealed water meter, of a type and manufacture
approved by the Director, to determine the water consumption on
the premises.
(5) Where an individual user can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Director that water consumption on specific premises does not
reasonably reflect proportionate sewage discharge with other
users of the same classification, special provisions may be made to
more accurately and equitably determine the means for
establishing the basis for the sewer use charge. Such special
provisions may include such means as installation of a separate
water meter to measure and record water consumption which is
not a potential source of sewage discharge, installation of a sewage
discharge meter, and allowances for a large one-time or periodic
user of water for which there is no potential for sewage discharge.
All costs associated with special provisions allowed to determine a
sewer use charge shall be borne by the sewer user. A petition for
such arrangements may be made at any time and shall be made
through the appeal process established under Subsection C(10) of
this section. Special provisions related to one-time or periodic
water consumption not potentially leading to a sewage discharge
shall be arranged prior to the event.
(6) The user charges established by the Director of Public Works shall
apply to all classes of users and all premises which are connected
to the public sewers, including residential, commercial,
institutional, governmental, industrial, charitable and nonprofit.
Surcharges, over and above the standard rates so established, shall
be added to those charges to Industrial B users and other
dischargers of high strength sewage to recover the added expenses
incurred due to the abnormally high strengths of wastewater being
discharged by such users.
§ 197-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 197-24
C:396
(7) In the case of users classified Industrial B, or other users which
discharge sewage of abnormally high strength to the public sewers,
the Director of Public Works may require that adequate facilities be
provided by the owner to allow for the observation, metering and
sampling of such discharges by the Director and that such facilities
be readily accessible to the Director at all times. The user shall
reimburse the Town for all expenses incurred by the Department of
Public Works in carrying out the sampling and testing of such
discharges.
(8) In addition to the stipulations set forth in Subsection C(5) of this
section, the Director of Public Works may establish a minimum
charge for all users or potential users of the sewer system. This
minimum charge shall apply to all users and be levied on all users
or on owners whose property is connected to the public sewers but
providing no discharge as a basic charge for the availability and
readiness to serve of the overall system.
(9) The Tax Collector shall issue bills for sewer user charges to all
owners of premises within the Town which are connected to the
public sewers, and the Town shall have the authority to collect
those charges and payments when due in accordance with state
statutes and the Code of the Township of East Greenwich. In
addition to the charges as otherwise determined under this section,
the Director may also impose special charges on certain user
classes where special services and/or tasks are required to oversee
and administer the use of Town sewers by such users.
(10) Any sewer user wishing to dispute the use of that user's water
consumption as the basis for establishing the charge for sewer
service may appeal the chargeable water volume base within 60
days of receipt of the annual sewer use charge billing. The appeal
shall be made in writing to the Director of Public Works and shall
include all related documentation for the Director to consider in
reviewing the claim for a chargeable water consumption volume at
a lower level than prescribed for that user's classification under
this section. Within 30 days of the receipt of such an appeal for
reconsideration of a sewer user classification, the Director shall
provide a hearing in his office with the sewer user or an authorized
representative to review the classification. A final decision on the
appeal shall be made within 15 days of the hearing.
D. Determination of annual user charge.
(1) All actual or estimated costs allocable to the proper operation and
maintenance of the sewerage facilities in the Town for a billing
period shall be paid from revenues derived from charges upon all
users of those facilities. Such costs shall include but not be limited
to those costs for heat, light, fuel, telephone, power, consumables,
and maintenance and repair of equipment, for the wages of
sewerage facility personnel whose duties are to operate, repair and
§ 197-24 CHARTER § 197-24
C:397
maintain the system, and for all other miscellaneous costs related
to the proper operation of the system.
(2) The actual or estimated total costs for the operation and
maintenance of the sewers in the Town and for the satisfactory
treatment of the sewage prior to discharge shall be the basis for the
determination of the charges upon users for such use. The user
charge rate discussed in Subsection C(3) of this section shall be
determined by subtracting from the actual or estimated total
sewerage service costs all other revenues, actual or estimated, to
be reviewed by the Department of Public Works in relation to the
Town's sewers; any grants or stipends awarded the Town for use in
operating and maintaining the system; the estimated added
revenues resulting from the application of a minimum charge to all
users; the estimated added revenues resulting from surcharges for
sewage discharges of abnormally high strength; and any surpluses
from previous charges which are considered to be in excess of that
needed as a reserve fund to offset the impact of unforeseeable
major costs of repair or replacement of facilities. The resultant
adjusted total cost shall then be divided by the actual or estimated
number of billable water consumption units consumed on all
premises in the Town, adjusted by a factor of 85% for all residential
users, including water consumed from both public and private
sources, which are served by the public sewers. The sewer user
charge rate in dollars per 100 cubic feet of water so calculated
shall then be used to determine the charge for sewer services for
all users in the Town.
(3) Surcharges above and beyond those costs as determined in
Subsection D(2) of this section shall be levied upon those sewer
users whose sewage exhibits abnormally high strength
characteristics. These surcharges shall be determined from rates
as determined by the Director of Public Works from time to time
and shall be reflective of the added costs for handling and treating
such sewage. Surcharges shall be made in accordance with the
following. In no case shall a credit be allowed for wastewaters with
constituent loadings below the established thresholds of 300 mg/1
for BOD and 375 mg/1 for SS. Basic use fees allow for the discharge
of wastewaters with constituent concentrations up to the threshold
limits. Surcharges are due only for wastewaters of greater
strength.
(a) Pounds of BOD subject to a surcharge shall be calculated by
the following equation: (C1  300) x 0.00624 x Q = lb. of BOD
subject to surcharge where C1 is the concentration of BOD in
mg/1 of the wastewater, and Q is the actual/adjusted metered
water use or wastewater discharge measured in units of 100
cubic feet. A negative surcharge or credit shall not be allowed.
This calculation is valid only where C1 is greater than 300 mg/
1.

C:398
§ 197-25. Due date; payment; interest. [Amended 2-4-2013 by Ord.
No. 826]
The annual charges shall split in half and be due and payable on April 1 and
November 1, and all charges not paid on or before April 30 and November
30 shall bear interest at the rate of 8% from May 1 for the April 30th due
date and December 1 for the November 30th due date. The payment shall
be for the fiscal year from July to June in which the collection due date rests.
(b) Pounds of SS subject to a surcharge shall be calculated by the
following equation: (C2  375) x 0.00624 x Q = lb. of SS subject
to surcharge where C2 is the concentration of suspended
solids in mg/1 of the wastewater, and Q is the actual metered
water use or wastewater discharge measured in units of 100
cubic feet. A negative surcharge or credit shall not be allowed.
This calculation is valid only where C2 is greater than 375 mg/
1.
(c) Where wastewater of abnormally high strength is generated
but the regular monitoring of such discharges is not
reasonable, practical and/or desirable, additional charges may
be made by means of a basic surcharge. This can be
accomplished by assigning a classification "Commercial B" to
the user. Additional charges for wastes of abnormally high
strength discharged by users classified as Commercial B shall
be made on the basis of a rate charge which is 145% of the
charge for residential class users.
(4) The Director of Public Works, irrespective of the stipulations set
forth in Subsection D(2) of this section, may establish a minimum
charge for the use of public sewers in the Town. This minimum
charge shall be considered as an availability or readiness-to-serve
charge, and no user or user unit as set forth in Subsection B(1) of
this section shall pay less than that minimum charge as determined
by the Director for use of the system regardless of the water
consumption on those premises.

any street or highway in or along which any sewer constituting any portion
of such project may be located or otherwise specially benefited by such
project.
§ 197-27. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the
context clearly indicates a different meaning:
ASSESSABLE FOOT FRONTAGE 
PROJECT  Project for the construction, completion, extension,
enlargement or improvement of the sewage disposal system.
TOWN SEWER FUND  The fund into which sewer use fees are paid for the
use of the sewer system of the Town, pursuant to Article III of this chapter.
§ 197-28. Assessment of residential estates.
The cost of a project for the construction, completion, extension,
enlargement or improvement of the sewage disposal system shall be
The frontage, in feet, of an estate along a street or highway, in or along

may be located, where the estate abuts only one street or highway in or
along which such sewer is located;
A.
The frontage, in feet, of an estate along a street or highway, in or along
which street or highway a sewer connection is available, such sewer
connection being a part of a sewer constituting any portion of a project,
where the estate abuts more than one street or highway and the sewer
is located in and along both streets or highways;
B.
The frontage, in feet, of an estate along the entire side or entire rear
boundary, along which side or rear boundary a sewer connection is
available, such sewer connection being a part of a sewer constituting
any portion of a project where the sewer is located along one side or

§ 197-26 CHARTER § 197-28
C:401
assessed by the Town Council upon the owners of estates zoned residential
and abutting that portion of any street or highway in or along which any
sewer constituting any portion of such project or projects may be located or
otherwise benefited by such project, in the following manner:
§ 197-29. Assessment of farming estates.
The cost of a project for the construction, completion, extension,
enlargement or improvement of the sewage disposal system shall be
assessed by the Town Council upon the owners of estates zoned Farming,
Farming F-1 and Farming F-2 and abutting that portion of any street or
highway, side yard, rear yard, or through an easement in or along which any
sewer constituting any portion of such project may be located or otherwise
benefited by such project or projects, in the following manner:
A. The total cost of such project shall be divided by the total assessable
foot frontage of all such estates, regardless of zoning (whether
Residential R-10, Residential R-20, Residential R-30 or any other
residential zone) or use. The result shall be the rate of assessment per
linear foot of frontage.
B. In any separate residential zone where there are 10 or more estates in
that zone, the average linear foot frontage for each separate residential
zone shall be determined for each separate residential zone by dividing
the total foot frontages for each separate residential zone by the total
number of estates within the respective separate residential zone.
C. In any separate residential zone when there are fewer than 10 estates
in that zone, the average linear foot frontage for each separate
residential zone shall be determined for each separate residential zone
by dividing the total front footage for each separate residential zone by
the total number of estates within the respective separate residential
zone; provided, however, that the average front footage shall not be
greater than the minimum front footage for the respective separate
residential zone, as specified by Chapter 260, Zoning, of the Code of the
Town of East Greenwich.
D. The average linear foot frontage for each separate residential zone, as
determined above, shall be multiplied by the rate of assessment per
linear foot of frontage, as determined in Subsection A of this section,
and the resulting sums shall then be reduced by 1/3. The resulting sums
after such reduction shall be the amounts of assessment levied against
the owners of estates in each separate residential zone, so that all such
owners of such estates within the same residential zone shall pay the
same amount of assessment.
E. The deficit in paying for such project resulting from the reductions
described in this section shall be paid by the Town Council from the
Town Sewer Fund.

or industrial purposes and abutting that portion of any street or highway in
or along which any sewer constituting any portion of such project may be
located or otherwise benefited by such project, in the following manner:
A. The total cost of such project shall be divided by the total assessable
foot frontages of all such estates, regardless of zoning (whether
Farming, Farming F-1 or Farming F-2) or use. The result shall be the
rate of assessment per linear foot of frontage.
B. In any separate farming zone where there are 10 or more estates in that
zone, the average linear foot frontage for each separate farming zone
shall be determined for each separate farming zone by dividing the total
foot frontages for each separate farming zone by the total number of
estates within the respective separate farming zone.
C. In any separate farming zone where there are fewer than 10 estates in
that zone, the average linear foot frontage for each separate rate
farming zone shall be determined for each separate farming zone by
dividing the total front footage for each separate farming zone by the
total number of estates within the respective separate farming zone;
provided, however, that the average front footage shall not be greater
than the minimum front footage for the respective separate farming
zone, as specified by Chapter 260, Zoning, of the Code of the Town of
East Greenwich.
D. The average linear foot frontage for each separate farming zone, as
determined in this section, shall be multiplied by the rate of assessment
per linear foot of frontage as determined in Subsection A of this section,
and the resulting sums shall then be reduced by 1/3. The resulting sums
after such reduction shall be the amounts of assessment levied against
the owners of estates in each separate farming zone, so that all such
owners of such estates within the same farming zone shall pay the same
amount of assessment.
E. The deficit in paying for such project resulting from the reductions
described in this section shall be paid by the Town Council from the
Town Sewer Fund.
A. The actual foot frontage for an estate zoned commercial or industrial or
used for commercial or industrial purposes shall be multiplied by the
rate of assessment per linear foot of frontage (as determined in
§ 197-28). The resulting sums shall be the amounts of assessments
levied upon the owners of estates in commercial or industrial zones or
upon the owners of estates used for commercial or industrial purposes,
so that all such owners of such estates shall pay varying amounts of
assessment, depending upon the actual linear foot frontage of the
estate assessed.

C:403
§ 197-31. Unimproved estates; deferred payment.
Any owner of an estate which is unimproved shall pay 1/2 of the assessment
as levied, and payment of the balance shall be deferred until such time
as the estate is improved. Such deferred payment shall not be subject to
interest. At the time of improvement of such estate, the balance of 1/2 of the
assessment as levied shall immediately become due and payable.

disposal system. Such adjustments shall include but not be limited to the
following:
§ 197-36. Errors in assessments.
The assessments shall name the owners assessed, describe their estates and
state the amounts of the assessment, but no error or omission in the name
or description shall invalidate the assessment as long as either the owner or
the estate is substantially identified.
§ 197-37. Recording; lien.
A copy of such assessments shall be recorded with the Town Clerk as a
public record. From the date of delivery to the Town Clerk, the assessment
and interest accruing thereon shall constitute a lien upon the respective
estates on a parity with the lien for Town taxes, until paid in full. The
Collector of Taxes of the Town shall have the same rights to enforce such
liens against the estates and to collect such assessments and interest from
the owners as he has in the case of Town taxes.
§ 197-38. Notice of assessment.
Prior to or forthwith after the delivery to the Town Clerk of a copy of
the assessment, the Collector of Taxes shall cause notice to be sent to
the owner of each estate assessed. The notice shall substantially identify
the estate assessed, state the amount of the assessment and refer to the
remedy available under this article. The notice shall be mailed, postpaid,
and directed to the last known address of the addressee. If there are owners
whose addresses are unknown, a similar notice covering the assessments
A. Any property or estate owned by the Town will not be assessed, nor
shall the assessable front footage for such estate be used in any
calculation as described in this article.
B. Any property or estate owned by a public utility, including but not
limited to the railroad, and used exclusively as a utility, with the
exception of properties with structures thereon, will not be assessed,
nor shall the assessable front footage for such estate be used in any
calculation as described in this article. This subsection shall not apply
to property or estates owned by a public utility if buildings or structures
are located thereon.
C. Any estate not reasonably connectable due to gravitational restrictions
shall not be assessed unless work is performed or provisions of any
description are made so that gravitational restrictions are overcome,
nor shall the assessable front footage for such estate be used in any
calculation as described in this article.
D. Those estates used exclusively for burial sites shall not be assessed, nor
shall the assessable front footage be used for such estates in any
calculation as described in this article.
§ 197-35 CHARTER § 197-38
C:405
against their estates shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Town, and such published notice may be a single collective
notice for all such owners. No irregularity in the notice required by this
section shall excuse the nonpayment of the assessment or affect its validity
or any proceedings for the collection thereof, as long as there is substantial
compliance with the provisions hereof. No deficiency in the notice to the
owner of an estate assessed shall excuse the nonpayment by others of
the assessments against their estates or affect the validity thereof or any
proceedings for the collection thereof.
§ 197-39. Petition for relief.
Any person aggrieved by any such assessment or corrected assessment
may, within 90 days after the mailing or publication of notice to him, file
a petition for relief against the Town as respondent in the Superior Court,
and the Clerk shall thereupon issue a citation to summon the Town, and
such petition and citation shall be subject to the provisions of R.I.G.L.
§ 44-5-29. If the Court finds such assessment invalid in whole or in part, it
shall give judgment reducing the amount thereof accordingly. The filing of
such a petition shall not relieve the estate involved from the lien provided
for in § 197-37 or prevent the assessment becoming due as provided in
the following section, but the final judgment of the court reducing such
assessment in whole or in part shall reduce such lien and the amount due
accordingly. The remedy provided in this section shall be exclusive, and no
action or proceeding questioning the validity of any such assessment shall
be begun after the expiration of the ninety-day period.
§ 197-40. Correction of assessments.
If an assessment is partially or wholly invalid, the Town Council may make
a corrected assessment to replace the invalid assessment or portion. The
corrected assessment shall be made in the same manner as an original
assessment. The first installment of a corrected assessment shall be
sufficient to compensate without interest for all installments which would
have become due then or theretofore if the corrected assessment had been
made at the time of the original assessment. The corrected assessment shall
bear interest from the date notice of the corrected assessment had been
made at the time of the original assessment. The corrected assessment shall
bear interest from the date notice of the corrected assessment is delivered
to the Town Clerk.
§ 197-41. Installment payment of assessments. [Amended 2-4-2013
by Ord. No. 826]
A. Assessments for a project may be payable over a period of 10 or 20
years, as determined by the Town Council. If such owner elects to pay
such assessment by installments, then the assessment shall be paid in
annual equal installments upon May 1 in each year and shall bear
interest from June 1 until paid in full at the rate of 8% per annum. The
whole assessment against any owner or estate may be paid without
§ 197-38 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 197-41
C:406
interest at any time prior to the due date of the first installment thereof.
The whole unpaid balance of any such assessment, together with the
interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, may be paid at any
time.
B. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, the tentative amount of an
assessment may be increased by the Town Council by a reasonable
amount in lieu of interest where it is assumed that the assessment will
be paid in annual installments over either 10 or 20 years, and the
assessment shall be made in the aggregate amount of the tentative
assessment plus such interest charge, and such assessment shall be
payable in equal annual installments on May 1 of each year, and
amounts not paid on or before May 31 shall bear interest at the rate of
8% from June 1. If any such installment is paid in full before the
expiration of such period, there shall be an equitable adjustment of the
interest charge so that interest will be paid on the unpaid balance of the
tentative assessment for the period up to such payment in full.

§ 207-2. Findings.
A. The Town Council finds that excessive quantities of soil are eroding
from certain areas of the Town which are undergoing development for
certain nonagricultural uses, such as housing developments, industrial
areas, recreational facilities, commercial facilities, and roads.
B. Soil erosion occurring in areas undergoing nonagricultural
development makes costly repairs necessary to gullies, washed-out fills,
roads and embankments. The resulting sediment clogs storm sewers
and road ditches and deposits silt into ponds, rivers, streams and
brooks.
C. Silt resulting from erosion threatens the water supply, as well as the
recreational, aesthetic and wildlife habitat values associated with these
waters.
D. Other construction wastes, including construction debris and
chemicals, concrete truck washout, oil and grease, litter and sanitary
waste may cause adverse impacts to water quality when discharged
from a construction site. [Added 11-6-2006 by Ord. No. 781]
§ 207-1 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 207-3
C:414
§ 207-3. Purpose. [Amended 11-6-2006 by Ord. No. 781]
The purpose of this article is to control the discharge of construction waste
and to prevent soil erosion and sedimentation from occurring as a result
of nonagricultural development within the Town by requiring the use of
appropriate best management practices (BMPs) to reduce or eliminate the
pollutants in stormwater discharges during and after construction so as to
promote the safety, public health and general welfare of the citizens of the
Town.
§ 207-4. Authority.
§ 207-5. Applicability.
A. The Town Council shall grant the Building Official and/or his designee
the authority necessary to administer this chapter under the provisions
of R.I.G.L. § 45-46-1 et seq., Soil Erosion and Sediment Control.
B. Application for determination of applicability required. It shall be
unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades and
contours of land in a manner that may affect the quality of stormwater
discharges associated with the construction activity without first
applying for a determination of applicability from the Building Official
or his designee. [Amended 11-6-2006 by Ord. No. 781]
A. Generally. This chapter shall be applicable to any situation involving
any disturbance to the terrain, topsoil or vegetative ground cover upon
any property within the Town after a determination of applicability by
the Building Official or his designee based upon criteria outlined in this
chapter.
B. Application for determination of applicability required. It shall be
unlawful for any person to disturb any existing vegetation, grades and
contours of land in a manner that may affect the quality of stormwater
discharges associated with the construction activity without first
applying for a determination of applicability from the Building Official
or his designee. [Amended 11-6-2006 by Ord. No. 781]
C. Contents of application for determination of applicability. The
application for determination of applicability shall describe the
location, nature, character and time schedule of the proposed landdisturbing
activity in sufficient detail so as to allow the Building Official
or his designee to determine the potential for soil erosion and
sedimentation resulting from the proposed development project.
D. Criteria for determination of applicability.
(1) In determining the applicability of this chapter to a particular landdisturbing
activity, the Building Official or his designee shall
consider site topography, drainage patterns, soils, proximity to
watercourses, and other such information as deemed appropriate
by the Building Official or his designee.
§ 207-3 CHARTER § 207-5
C:415

wetlands and groundwater; contamination of drinking water supplies;
alteration or destruction of aquatic and wildlife habitat; and flooding.
Regulation of illicit connections and discharges to the municipal storm
drain system is necessary for the protection of the Town of East
Greenwich's water bodies and groundwater and to safeguard the public
health, safety, welfare and the environment.
B. The objectives of this article are:
(1) To prevent (or reduce to the maximum extent practicable)
pollutants entering the municipally owned separate storm sewer
system;
§ 207-22 CHARTER § 207-23
C:431
§ 207-24. Statutory authority.
This article is promulgated pursuant to the Rhode Island Department of
Environmental Management's ("DEM") General Permit Rhode Island
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Storm Water Discharge from Small
Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems and from Industrial Activity at
Eligible Facilities Operated by Regulated Small MS4s and in accordance
with the Administrative Procedures Act, R.I.G.L. § 42-35-1 et seq.
§ 207-25. Discharge prohibitions.
(2) To prohibit illicit connections and unauthorized discharges to the
MS4;
(3) To require the removal of all such illicit connections and
discharges;
(4) To comply with state law and federal statutes and regulations
relating to stormwater discharges; and
(5) To set forth the legal authority and procedures to carry out all
inspection, monitoring and enforcement activities necessary to
ensure compliance with this article.
A. Prohibition of unauthorized discharges. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the municipal separate storm sewer system
or watercourses any pollutant or nonstormwater discharge unless such
a nonstormwater discharge is outlined in Part I.B.3 of the MS4 general
permit. The allowable nonstormwater discharges (described below) are

testing water; and
(14) Hydrostatic test water that does not contain any treatment
chemicals and is not contaminated with process chemicals.
C. Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or
continued existence of illicit connections to the municipal separate
storm sewer system is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes,
without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of
whether the connection was permissible under law or practices
applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. A person is
considered to be in violation of this article if the person connects a line
conveying sewage to the MS4 or allows such a connection to continue
and must provide corrective action.
A. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Building Official may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened nonstormwater discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator
fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the
Building Official may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent
or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize
danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her
MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The Building Official will notify a violator of the
proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the
Building Official for reconsideration and a hearing. A person commits
an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated
pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the Building
Official.
C. Entry to perform duties under this article. To the extent permitted by
state law, or if authorized by the owner or other party in control of the
§ 207-25 CHARTER § 207-26
C:433
§ 207-27. Industrial and construction activity discharge.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity RIPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Building Official prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 207-28. Inspections and monitoring.
The Building Official shall be permitted, upon the presentation of
credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to:
§ 207-29. Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants.
In an attempt to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants, any
person engaged in activities or operations or owning facilities or property
which will or may result in pollutants entering stormwater, the storm sewer
system or waters of the state shall implement best management practices
to the extent they are technologically achievable to prevent and reduce
such pollutants. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial
establishment shall provide reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm
drain system or watercourses. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes shall be provided and maintained at
the owner's or operator's expense.
§ 207-30. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
property, the Building Official, his or her agents, officers and

C:434
the property reasonably free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and
other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate or significantly retard the
flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to
a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse. The owner or lessee
shall not remove healthy bank vegetation beyond that actually necessary for
maintenance, nor remove said vegetation in such a manner as to increase
the vulnerability of the watercourse to erosion. The property owner or
lessee shall be responsible for maintaining and stabilizing that portion
of the watercourse that is within his or her property lines in order to
protect against erosion and degradation of the watercourse originating or
contributed from his or her property. Nothing in this section shall preclude
any owner/lessee from compliance with relevant provisions of the Rhode
Island Fresh Water Wetlands Act, R.I.G.L. § 2-1-18 et seq., or other
applicable laws or regulations.
§ 207-31. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in
unauthorized discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the
storm drain system, or waters of the state from said facility, said person
shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and
cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of a hazardous
material, said person shall immediately notify emergency response officials
of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services (911). In the event of
a release of nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the Building
Official no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by
phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the
Building Official within three business days of the phone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
Nothing in this section shall preclude any owner/lessee from compliance
with relevant provisions of the Rhode Island Clean Water Act, R.I.G.L.
§ 46-12-1 et seq., or other applicable laws or regulations.
§ 207-32. Notice of violation.
A. Whenever the Building Official finds that any person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the Building
Official may order compliance by written notice of violation to the

this article, the Building Official may enter into a negotiated settlement to
resolve the appeal of the notice of violation. Such settlement may impose
upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain
stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
§ 207-35. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If no timely appeal of a notice of violation has been taken and the violation
has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice
of violation or, in the event of an appeal, within 30 days of the decision of
the Building Official upholding the decision of the Building Official, then
representatives of the Town of East Greenwich shall undertake all necessary

Exemption for Renewable Energy Systems
[Adopted 5-22-2017 by Ord. No. 86989]
§ 227-47. Findings and authority.
Pursuant to Section 44-3-21 of the Rhode Island General Laws, as amended,
renewable energy systems may be exempt from taxation. The Town Council
finds that it would be in the public interest to exempt from taxation
renewable energy systems as provided for in § 227-48.

An application for a renewable energy system tax exemption must be made
to the Town Tax Assessor no later than March 15 each year on forms to be
provided by the Tax Assessor.
§ 227-50. Rules and regulations for Commercial Renewable Energy
Systems' Tangible Tax Value.
A. The additional cost or value of any renewable energy device which is
being utilized as a primary or auxiliary power system for the purpose of
heating or otherwise supplying the energy needs of the property on
which it is located, not to exceed 250KW.
B. The additional cost or value of any renewable energy system in excess
of 250KW primarily utilized to produce energy for sale beyond the

by the Town Council for the amount of property value to be exempt.
A. Purpose.
(1) The purpose of these regulations is to provide consistent and
foreseeable tax treatment of renewable energy to facilitate and
promote installation of grid-connected generation of renewable
energy. The Office of Energy Resources shall adopt a statewide
tangible tax value and formula, which shall be used by all
municipalities utilizing ordinances and resolutions for commercial
renewable energy systems proposed within their respective
municipalities beginning on January 1, 2017.
(2) All existing municipal renewable energy ordinances and/or
resolutions will need to be amended by town and city councils to
reflect the requirements of the regulation and the associated tax
value and associated formula. Municipalities that plan on adopting
89.Editor's Note: This ordinance provided that it shall be effective as of 1-1-2017.
§ 227-47 CHARTER § 227-50
C:505
first-time ordinances and/or resolutions for renewable energy will
need to reflect the requirements of the regulation and the
associated tax value and associated formula in their respective
ordinances and/or resolutions.
(3) For any renewable energy systems that are installed on residential
and manufacturing properties, the renewable energy equipment is
exempt from local taxation per RIGL 44-3-3, Subsections (48) and
(49).
B. Scope. These rules and regulations apply to towns and cities collecting
tangible taxes from commercial renewable energy systems pursuant to
RIGL § 44-5-3. These rules and regulations only apply to towns and
cities and do not apply to any other entities or instrumentalities that
may have tax-collecting authority but are not authorized to tax
renewable energy systems under RIGL § 44-5-3.
C. Applicability. The adopted tangible tax value and formula shall take
effect on January 1, 2017. Any renewable energy resource projects that
have executed interconnection service agreements with the electric
distribution company as of December 31, 2016, shall not be subject to
the rules developed under § 44-5-3(c) and shall maintain the tax status
applicable before the rules are adopted, unless otherwise agreed
pursuant to § 44-3-9(a).
D. Authority. These regulations arc promulgated pursuant to Chapter
44-57, and in accordance with Chapter 42-35 of the Rhode Island
General Laws of 1956, as amended, and grant the Office of Energy
Resources the authority to adopt, amend and implement such rules as
may be necessary to desirable to effectuate the purposes of this
chapter.
E. Definitions. For the purposes of these regulations, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:
A/C  Alternating current for the nameplate capacity of the commercial
renewable energy system.
ELIGIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES  Those technologies
defined under RIGL 39-26-5.
$/PER kW  The kilowatt/dollar/kilowatt amount adopted through the
regulations that municipalities will be compensated from a commercial
renewable energy system annually.
OFFICE  The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources.
REG PROGRAM  The Renewable Energy Growth Program where a
renewable energy system sells electricity through a fifteen- or twentyyear
tariff with National Grid.
NET METERING  A renewable energy system installed on a property
that is offsetting electric bills pursuant to RIGL § 39-26.4-1 et seq.
§ 227-50 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 227-50
C:506
VIRTUAL NET METERING  A renewable energy system that is
installed on private or public property where the off-taker of the
electricity is a municipality, public school, state or quasi-state public
entity pursuant to RIGL § 39-26.4-1 et seq.
F. Tangible tax value for commercial renewable energy systems.
The following formula and associated $5.00 per kW is adopted by the
Office in establishing the tangible tax value for commercial renewable
energy systems to provide reasonable compensation to a municipality
effective January 1, 2017. All such municipal ordinances and
resolutions assessing tangible tax on commercial renewable energy
systems must apply the following dollar value and formula.
$ 5.00 kW x _Kilowatt AIC Capacity of the Commercial
Renewable Energy System =
$______
Example 1: A two-megawatt ground-mount solar system that will be
receiving a twenty-year tariff under the REG program and selling the
electricity back to National Grid.
$5 kW X 2,000 kW AIC capacity of the commercial renewable energy
system =
$10,000 annual revenue to the municipality
$200,000 total revenue over the twenty-year REG Program tariff
to the municipality
Example 2: A one-and-five-tenths-megawatt wind-turbine system that
will be receiving a twenty-year tariff under the REG Program and
selling the electricity back to National Grid.
$5 kW X 1,500 kW AIC capacity of the commercial renewable energy
system =
$7,500 annual revenue to the municipality
$150,000 total revenue over the twenty-year REG Program tariff
to the municipality
G. Municipal tax waiver option for renewable systems not selling power.
(1) Pursuant to § 44-3-21, a town or city council may elect not to assess
a tangible tax on all commercial renewable energy systems or
specifically on net-metered systems that are strictly designed to
offset and reduce electricity bills on a property and not developed
for commercial revenue purposes. A town or city council would
need to enact an ordinance to waive tangible taxes on those types
of renewable systems.
(2) For any renewable energy systems that are installed on residential
and manufacturing properties, the renewable energy equipment is
exempt from local taxation per RIGL § 44-3-3, Subsections (48) and
(49).
§ 227-50 CHARTER § 227-50
C:507
H. Reporting. All commercial renewable energy systems shall be required
to provide the municipality and respective tax assessor with a copy of
the initial interconnection application and formal interconnection
service agreement and any documentation of program enrollment (e.g.,
renewable energy growth or net metering enrollment forms), indicating
whether the commercial renewable energy system is either a REG, netmetered,
or virtual net-metered installation.
I. Severability. If any provision of these regulations or the application
thereof, to any person or circumstance, is held invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of the regulations
shall not be affected thereby.
J. Application. The terms and provisions of these regulations shall be
liberally construed to permit the Office to effectuate the purposes of
state law, goals, and policies.
K. Effective date.
(1) The foregoing regulations, after due notice, are hereby adopted
and filed with the Secretary of State this November 16 of 2016, to
become effective January 1. 2017, in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 44-57, and in accordance with Chapter 42-35
of the Rhode Island General Laws of 1956, as amended.
(2) The adopted regulations and associated commercial renewable
energy system tangible tax value shall remain in effect from
January 1, 2017, through January 1, 2022, and the Town Council
shall have the authority to review and update these regulations if
deemed warranted.

hearing shall be held before a hearing officer. The hearing officer shall
conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by

proper, then the hearing officer shall enter an order supporting the
removal and ordering the costs of removal and storage to be paid
before redemption of the vehicle.
(2) The action of the law enforcement officer in taking the vehicle into
custody was invalid, then the hearing officer shall:
(a) Order the vehicle released to the owner;
(b) Find that the owner is not liable for any towing or storage
charges occasioned by the taking; and
(c) Order the Town to satisfy the towing and storage lien. If the

redeem it promptly, then any subsequent charges shall be paid
by the owner or person entitled to possession.

the hearing officer shall order the lien satisfied before release of
the vehicle.

officers shall be persons other than the person who directed the impounding
and storage of the vehicle. The issues before the hearing officers shall be
whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question and
the creation and amount of the lien attached to the vehicle. "Probable cause
to impound" shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of

local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for the removal of the
vehicle.

Purpose and Intent

The zoning regulations and districts herein set forth have been made in
accordance with the goals and policies articulated in the East Greenwich

the public health, safety and general welfare of the Town. They are designed
to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic
and other dangers; to control nuclear and toxic wastes; to provide adequate
light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue
concentration of population; and to facilitate the adequate provision of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public
requirements. They are made with reasonable consideration, among other
things, of the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for
particular uses and with a view to conserving the value of property and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the Town.

A. Authority. This chapter of the Code of the Town of East Greenwich is
adopted pursuant to the authority conferred by Rhode Island General
Law § 45-24-27 et seq.
B. Effectiveness. This chapter shall take effect immediately upon passage.
All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with this chapter are
repealed.
C. Applicability. No structure or land shall be used, and no structure shall
be erected, enlarged or relocated, unless it conforms to the provisions
of this chapter. No lot shall be created unless it conforms to the
provisions of this chapter. Uses and structures lawfully existing on the
effective date of this chapter, however, which are nonconforming to the
provisions of this chapter, shall be permitted to continue in existence.
A. Interpretation. When the provisions of this chapter are interpreted or
applied they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public safety, health and general welfare.
B. Conflict. The provisions of this chapter are not intended to interfere
with or abrogate or annul any ordinance, rule, regulation or permit
previously adopted or issued and not in conflict with any provision of
this chapter, or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law
relating to the use of land or building or ordinance not in conflict with
this chapter; nor is it intended by this chapter to interfere with or
abrogate or annul any easement, covenant or other agreement between
parties; except when this chapter imposes a greater restriction, this
chapter shall control.

Rhode Island and the Town of East Greenwich shall be exempted from the
regulations contained herein.
§ 260-5. Severability.
If any provision of this chapter or of any rule, regulation or determination
made thereunder, or the application thereof to any person, agency or
circumstances, is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the

Zoning Districts
§ 260-7. Districts established.
For the purpose of this chapter, the Town of East Greenwich is divided into
the following fixed zoning districts, as shown on the Zoning Maps filed in
the office of the Town Clerk and entitled "East Greenwich Zoning Map" and
dated July 25, 2000, and further described below:
A. Residential District (R-4) 4,000 square feet. This district is designed to
provide very high-density residential multifamily and affordable
housing development. A minimum of 10% and a maximum of 20% of the
units in an R-4 development shall be for low- and moderate-income
persons as defined by the state or federal government providing the
subsidy for the housing and shall meet the requirements of the Rhode
Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act, R.I.G.L. § 45-53-1 et
seq., as amended.
B. Residential District (R-6) 6,000 square feet. This district is designed to
provide for high-density residential development within the Town.
C. Residential District (R-10) 10,000 square feet. This district is designed
to provide for medium/high-density residential development within the
Town.
D. Residential District (R-20) 20,000 square feet. This district is designed
to provide for medium-density residential development within the
Town.
E. Residential District (R-30) 30,000 square feet. This district is designed
to provide for medium/low-density residential development within the
Town.
F. Farming District (F/F-1) one acre. This district is designed to preserve
existing farmland and provide low-density residential development
within the Town.
G. Farming District (F-2) two acres. This district is designed to preserve
farmland and open space and provide for very-low-density residential
development within the Town.
H. Commercial Downtown One District (CD/CD-1). This zone is designed to
provide multiple uses on Main Street properties between Division
Street and First Avenue/Rocky Hollow Road to promote active use of
East Greenwich's downtown area by residents, shoppers and serviceuse
clients and to provide vehicle and pedestrian safety. This district
emphasizes first-floor (street-level) uses which promote and encourage
pedestrian activity and stops at more than one business.
I. Commercial Downtown Two District (CD-2). This zone is designed to
provide multiple uses on Main Street properties between First Avenue/
§ 260-7 CHARTER § 260-7
C:609
§ 260-8. General regulations. [Amended 2-25-2002 by Ord. No. 717;
11-4-2002 by Ord. No. 729]
The following regulations shall be applicable to all zones unless otherwise
indicated:
Rocky Hollow Road and Cedar Avenue/Forge Road to provide a
transition between the high-density Commercial Downtown (CD-1)
District and the CH Districts.
J. Commercial Highway District (CH). The purpose of this district is to
provide for those uses which generate a high amount of vehicular traffic
in a manner that is safe and efficient.
K. Waterfront District (W). The purpose of this district is to provide for
water-dependent and water-related uses along Greenwich Cove, and to
limit other uses. The Town of East Greenwich has little waterfront land
and only by recognizing this can the Town best utilize this limited
resource.
L. Light Industry and Office District (M/LIO). The purpose of this district is
to provide low-density, low-impact industrial and office park
development primarily along the Route 2/South County Trail corridor
and retain that district's farming and scenic qualities.
M. Planned Development (PD). This is a designation which allows for
residential land uses through environmentally sensitive design. It would
provide for residential development on a single parcel, for example, a
townhouse design.
N. Mixed Use Planned Development (MUPD). This is a designation which
allows for multiple uses on one parcel. It is offered as a development
option as an encouragement to construct and develop low-density
commercial uses to offset the tax burden of higher density residential
units. Low- and moderate-income residential units are particularly
encouraged in an MUPD.
O. Rocky Hill Fairgrounds (RHF). The purpose of this district is to provide
for the development of a private education center and open space,
including a golf course; development located within 4,000 feet of an
interstate highway having frontage on two or more public roads and
having ingress and egress to a state highway serviced by public sewer,
gas, water and electricity. [Added 10-26-2004 by Ord. No. 750;
amended 5-9-2011 by Ord. No. 814]
A. Where residential structures are permitted, only one residential
structure shall be located on a lot.
B. For all new residential construction, the maximum bottom of the
foundation elevation of the principal structure shall be two feet above
the proven wet-season high-water table. A site plan submitted as part of
the building permit application shall note this relationship.
§ 260-7 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-8
C:610
C. Ordinary projections of window sills, cornices and other structural
features may not extend more than 12 inches into the space above a
required setback.
D. On a street in a residential zone in which 25% or more of the frontage is
improved with buildings, the front setback for a building hereafter
erected may extend to the average alignment of such existing buildings
on the same side of the street instead of as provided for in Table 2 of
this chapter, except that no buildings shall have a front setback of less
than 10 feet.109
E. The Zoning Board of Review may, by special use permit, grant relief
from the dimensional and intensity regulations of this chapter for any
use it authorizes by special use permit.
F. Accessory structures, swimming pools and/or tennis courts shall only be
permitted in rear yards in the building envelope and shall not fall within
any required side or front setbacks. Such structures may be no closer
than 10 feet from the rear lot line in the R-30, F-1 and F-2 Zones, and no
closer than five feet in the R-20, R-10, R-6 and W Zones. On corner lots
where no rear yard or rear lot line is present, accessory structures may
be permitted to be sited within the side setback, subject to the
limitations as noted above.
G. No wall, fence, structure, vehicle, tree, shrub or other growth on the
property shall so obstruct the view as to cause a hazard to traffic in the
street nor shall it cause pedestrians to walk in the street where a
sidewalk or road shoulder would otherwise be available. At street
intersections, no structure shall be erected and no vegetation shall be
planted or maintained in the space between the heights of 2 1/2 feet
and 10 feet above the triangle formed by the street lines and a third line
joining points on the street lines 15 feet from the intersection.
H. Development of the lot shall provide no increase in stormwater runoff
quantity or reduce the quality of the runoff from the lot. Where
additional runoff cannot be retained on site, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Department of Public Works that the existing public
drainage systems are capable of transporting the increased runoff.
I. Where permitted, commercial uses shall be buffered from adjacent
residential uses through landscaping and/or screening, as further
defined in Article VI. When a lot in an LI/O or CH Zone is situated on the
opposite side of the street from or is bounded by property zoned for
residential use, a buffer strip not less than 100 feet in width shall be
provided on each side of such lot which is situated on the opposite side
of the street from or which bounds property zoned for residential use.
Each such buffer strip shall be maintained in its natural state or shall be
planted with evergreen trees or shall be made to contain other opaque
screening.
109. Editor's Note: Table 2 is attached to this chapter.
§ 260-8 CHARTER § 260-8
C:611
J. Where permitted, outside storage and dumpsters shall be enclosed and
buffered from adjacent properties (including rights-of-way) as may be
further defined in Article VI. The owner or operator of any commercial
establishment which receives a license or permit from the Town Council
and where swill, garbage or refuse accumulates shall provide at such
establishment a covered container, which does not leak, for the deposit
of all swill, garbage and refuse. The container shall have a cover, which
shall be fully closed at all times except when refuse is deposited or
removed. No excess refuse may protrude from said container. If deemed
necessary and feasible by the Building Official, all containers shall be
placed on either a concrete or asphalt pad with an adequate water
supply and drainage available for washing the container and the pad.
Unless the Building Official determines that it is not feasible, any
container which is visible from the street and which holds perishable
food waste shall be located within an opaque fenced area, which fence
must be at least one foot higher than the highest point of the container
on three sides. The fourth side shall have a properly hinged access door,
which shall be kept closed at all times except for the depositing or
removal of refuse. All containers holding perishable food waste shall be
located more than 30 feet from the nearest residence unless the
Building Official determines it is not feasible to do so.110
K. Curb cuts shall require approval by the Director of Public Works. Only
one curb cut for vehicle access to a parcel shall be provided from each
street frontage. Gas stations shall be permitted two curb cuts along a
single frontage and one curb cut along a second frontage, for a
maximum of three curb cuts.
L. Where the rear of a property falls along Greenwich Cove, the rear
setback shall be used for a combination of landscaping and boardwalk
along waterfront properties. The rear setback shall not be covered with
an impervious surface but shall allow for natural infiltration in order to
protect the water quality of the Cove.
M. Fences and walls not exceeding 10 feet in height in the LI/O Zone and
seven feet in all remaining zones may be constructed. Fencing for
tennis courts may exceed the seven-foot maximum but must be no
greater than 12 feet around the playing surface of the court.
N. It shall be the policy of the Town of East Greenwich that high-voltage
transmission lines should be sited so as to reduce the risk of
electromagnetic field exposure to the lowest possible level obtainable
by existing technology. Since the siting of such lines is within the
jurisdiction of the Energy Facility Siting Board (EFSB), the Town shall
actively participate in the EFSB review process, and Town agencies
rendering advisory opinions to the EFSB shall urge that said
transmission lines be regulated in accordance with the Town's policy.
O. Private streets shall be prohibited in all residential developments.

§ 260-8 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-8
C:612
§ 260-9. Uses and zones.
P. Subject to compliance with the requirements of all applicable federal
and state wetlands regulations, wetlands created by action of the Town
of East Greenwich other than stormwater detention and retention
measures shall be excluded from the calculation of wetlands with
respect to the requirements of the PD and MUPD Zones, cluster
development and minimum building envelope.111
A. The following uses shall be allowed as outright permitted uses and shall
be allowed in all zones unless otherwise indicated:
(1) Off-street parking.
(2) Signs (as provided for in Article VII).
(3) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the following
uses are permitted uses within all residential zoning use districts of
a municipality and all industrial and commercial zoning use
districts except where residential use is prohibited for public
health or safety reasons:
(a) Households.
(b) Community residences.
(c) Family day-care homes.
(4) Any time a building or other structure used for residential purposes
or a portion of a building containing residential unit is rendered
uninhabitable by virtue of a casualty such as fire or flood, the owner
of the property is allowed to park, temporarily, mobile and
manufactured home or homes, as the need may be, elsewhere upon
the land for use and occupancy of the former occupants for a period
of up to 12 months, or until the building or structure is
rehabilitated and otherwise made fit for occupancy. The property
owner, or a properly designated agent of the owner, is only allowed
to cause the mobile and manufactured home or homes to remain
temporarily upon the land by making timely application to the local
Building Official for the purposes of obtaining the necessary
permits to repair or rebuild the structure.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, appropriate
access for people with disabilities to residential structures is
allowed as a reasonable accommodation for any person(s) residing,
or intending to reside, in the residential structure.
(6) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an accessory
family dwelling unit in an owner-occupied, single-family residence
shall be permitted as a reasonable accommodation only for family
111. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
IV).
§ 260-8 CHARTER § 260-9
C:613
members with disabilities. The appearance of the structure shall
remain that of a single-family residence, and there shall be an
internal means of egress between the principal unit and the
accessory family dwelling unit. If possible, no additional exterior
entrances should be added. Where additional entrance is required,
placement should generally be in the rear or side of the structure.
When the structure is serviced by an individual sewage disposal
system, the applicant shall have the existing or any new system
approved by the Department of Environmental Management. The
Zoning Enforcement Officer shall require that a declaration of the
accessory family dwelling unit for the family member or members
and its restrictions be recorded in the land evidence records and
filed with the Zoning Enforcement Officer and the Building Official.
Once the family member or members with disabilities no longer
resides in the premises on a permanent basis or the title is
transferred, the property owner shall notify the Zoning Official in
writing, and the accessory family dwelling unit shall no longer be
permitted, unless there is a subsequent valid application.112
(7) When used in this section, the terms "people with disabilities" or
"member or members with disabilities" means a person(s) who has
a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or
more major life activities, as defined in R.I.G.L. § 34-37-3. [Added
3-14-2016 by Ord. No. 849]
(8) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, plant
agriculture is a permitted use within all zoning districts, including
all industrial and commercial zoning districts, except where
prohibited for public health or safety reasons or the protection of
wildlife habitat. [Added 3-14-2016 by Ord. No. 849]
B. The following uses shall be permitted as accessory uses in all zones and
within the provisions of this chapter unless otherwise indicated:
(1) The keeping of household pets, as defined in § 260-6, for enjoyment

shall be granted in accordance with the original terms upon
demonstrated need by the applicant.
(4) The storage of building materials and equipment incidental to onsite
construction.

ARTICLE IV
Substandard Lots of Record
§ 260-11. Creation of substandard lots.
No lot of record shall be reduced in area or subdivided so that yards, other
open spaces, total area, and/or frontage shall be less than prescribed for the
zone in which the lot is located.
§ 260-12. Existing substandard lots of record.
A. Minimum lot size.
(1) A single substandard lot of record located in any zone may be used
for permitted and accessory uses as allowed in the respective
zoning district, provided that the parcel has a minimum of 35 feet
of frontage on a public road and a minimum lot area equal to at
least 3,500 square feet where municipal sewer is available.
(2) If a substandard lot does not have municipal sewers, the minimum
lot area shall be at least 20,000 square feet and an approved
individual sewage disposal system (ISDS) shall be required.
B. Merger provision. If two or more contiguous substandard lots are under
common ownership on or after the effective date of this chapter, such
lots shall be considered to be an undivided parcel of land for the
purpose of this chapter, and no single lot or portion thereof shall be
used in violation of the requirements of this chapter as to lot lines and
area.
C. Reduction of yards. Where substandard lots of record exist per the
provisions of this article, the dimensional requirements for the rear and
side yard setback requirements may be reduced in the proportion that
the area of the substandard lot is reduced from the minimum area
requirements.

ARTICLE V
Nonconforming Development
§ 260-13. Purpose.
§ 260-14. Nonconforming by dimension.
§ 260-15. Nonconforming by use.
A. Nonconforming uses are incompatible with and detrimental to
permitted uses in the zoning districts in which they are located, cause
disruption of the comprehensive land use pattern of the Town, inhibit
present and future development of nearby properties and confer upon
their owners and uses a position of unfair advantage.
B. It is a fundamental principle of this article that nonconformities may be
continued until abandoned but shall not be increased and shall be
reduced to conformity according to the fair interests of the parties
involved.
A. Any structure, building, sign or other improvement lawfully existing at
the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter but which is
nonconforming by dimension shall be permitted to continue in the same
manner. If said legally nonconforming structure, building, sign or other
improvement is intentionally destroyed, relocated or altered, it shall
lose its nonconforming status. However, if such destruction, relocation
or alteration is the result of fire or a natural catastrophe, the legal
nonconforming improvement may be rebuilt in its previous
configuration.
B. Any extension, addition or enlargement of a nonconforming structure
shall comply with the dimensional regulations and parking
requirements of this chapter. Additionally, the whole structure must
comply with the zone's maximum lot coverage requirement.
A. Any use or activity lawfully existing at the time of adoption or
amendment of this chapter but which is nonconforming by use shall be
permitted to continue in the same manner until said use or activity is
abandoned, relocated or changed. Abandoned uses shall not be
reestablished.
B. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall consist of either an owner's
(or legal tenant's, if applicable) overt act or failure to act which
demonstrates that there is neither a claim nor any interest in
continuing the nonconforming use. If any nonconforming use is
discontinued for a period of one year, the nonconforming use will be
presumed to have been abandoned unless determined otherwise by the
Zoning Enforcement Officer.
§ 260-13 CHARTER § 260-15
C:619
§ 260-16. Change of use.
§ 260-17. Nuisances.
The interpretation of this article shall not prohibit the regulation of
nuisances.
C. A nonconforming use in any zone shall not be enlarged, expanded,
intensified or changed from one nonconforming use to another
nonconforming use.
A. A nonconforming residential use may change only to a use that
conforms to the provisions of this chapter.
B. A nonconforming agricultural, commercial or industrial use may be
changed only to a use that conforms to the provisions of this chapter or
to an equal or less intense use in the same category.
C. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, property
nonconforming by use and dimension may be expanded by special use
permit without the necessity of a dimensional variance.

ARTICLE VI
Off-Street Parking Regulations
§ 260-18. Purpose and intent.
§ 260-19. Applicability.
A. The purpose of this article is to ensure that all structures and land uses
are provided with off-street parking spaces that adequately meet the
parking demands that are generated.
B. Therefore, this article has been set forth with the intent of providing
free movement of public and private traffic at all times, reducing
congestion in the streets, permitting the efficient and safe passage of
emergency vehicles, facilitating the maneuvering of public emergency
equipment in the streets and on site, facilitating the removal and/or
storage of snow, and for all related purposes.
A. Existing structures and uses. Off-street parking spaces associated with
any existing building or use shall be maintained so long as the existing
building or use remains.
B. Alterations, additions, changes of use. All new vehicular use areas,
those altered or improved subsequent to the adoption of these
regulations, and structures that are enlarged or whose use is changed
such that an increase in required off-street parking results (per
§ 260-20, Table of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces) shall be subject
to the provisions of this article and shall be required to submit a
parking plan as described under § 260-21 of this article.
C. Nonconforming parking.
(1) Where parking spaces are provided and maintained in connection
with a building or use legally existing at the time this article
became effective and are insufficient to meet the requirements for
the use as now set forth by this article, such lots will be considered
legally nonconforming.
(2) Where extensions, additions or enlargements to the building or use
are contemplated, no such extension may be made unless the
applicant can demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this
article through the submission of a parking plan as detailed under
§ 260-21 of this article.
D. Exemptions. Any property which provides at least 50% of the required
parking for the building or use and is destroyed by fire or natural
causes may be restored to its original use, provided that the floor area
is not increased without conforming to the parking requirements of this
article.

§ 260-27 CHARTER § 260-27
C:639
§ 260-28. General regulations.
maximum of 36 inches in height and no greater than six inches from the

either total 30 square feet in area or be a maximum of 48 inches in
height and no greater than 10 inches from the wall. For businesses
located within shopping centers having greater than 100,000 square
feet of gross floor area, such signs shall not be limited in height or
width but shall not exceed 30% of the building's facade associated
with the business. This provision shall only apply to those businesses
located within the main structure(s) and shall not apply to any other
freestanding structures (i.e., pad sites, kiosks, outbuildings, etc.). All
wall signs must directly advertise or promote the business, entity or
enterprise located within the building or structure to which they are
attached, painted or erected as described above. Any wall signs that do
not directly advertise or promote said business, entity or enterprise are
strictly prohibited.
WINDOW SIGN  Any sign that is placed inside a window, upon the
window panes or glass, or within 12 inches of the window (exclusive
of merchandise display). Permanent window signs may be applied to,
painted on or attached to the inside of each window associated with
a business. The area of such window signs shall be counted toward
the maximum visible sign area as addressed by § 260-28A herein.
Temporary interior signs advertising business openings, specials, sales,
events and greetings shall be permitted in accordance with the
definition above of "temporary sign" for a period not to exceed 14 days.
B. Computations. The following principles shall control the computation of
sign area and sign height.
(1) Sign display. The sign display is a portion of the permitted sign
area. The area of a sign display shall be computed by means of the
smallest square or rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits
of the writing, representation, emblem or other display.
(2) Sign area, single-faced signs. The area of a sign face (which is also
the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face) shall be
computed as the area of sign display together with any material or
color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed.
(3) Sign height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign pole at normal grade to the
top of the sign area. The height of a monument sign shall be
computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade
to the top of the sign area. Normal grade shall be construed to be:
a) the lower of existing grade prior to the construction; or b) the
newly established grade after construction.
§ 260-27 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-28
C:640
A. Maximum sign area. The maximum visible sign area associated with any
business, or any product or service available therein, shall not exceed
100 square feet for properties in the CD-1 or CD-2 and Waterfront
Districts and shall not exceed 140 square feet for properties in the
Route 2 corridor and the MUPD, RHF, CH and L1/O Zones. This
provision applies to all sign types requiring approval, including wall
signs, freestanding and projecting signs. Directional and incidental
signage is not included. For businesses located within shopping centers
having greater than 100,000 square feet of gross floor area, the
maximum visible sign area shall not exceed 30% of the building's facade
(building face providing primary ingress/egress) associated with the
tenant space. No business in such shopping centers shall have greater
than 300 square feet of visible sign area, taking into account all sign
types excluding directional and incidental ones. This provision shall
apply only to those businesses located within the main structure(s) and
shall not apply to any other freestanding structures (i.e., pad sites,
kiosks, outbuildings, etc.).
B. Signs other than those affecting historic properties. The installation,
enlargement, reduction or relocation of permitted signs in all zones are
allowed as indicated in the Sign Table following approval and the
issuance of a building permit from the Building Official unless
otherwise indicated elsewhere in this article.
C. Signs affecting historic properties. All new signs proposed on
properties included in the Article XI, Historic Districts, either as part of
a district or individually or on properties individually listed on the
National Register of Historic Places, shall require sign approval from
the Historic District Commission in addition to a building permit unless
otherwise indicated elsewhere in this article. All requests shall be
submitted for review as part of an overall sign proposal for the business
and/or property.
D. Changes to nonconforming sings. Enlargement or relocation of legal
nonconforming signs requires additional approval from the Zoning
Board of Review as described elsewhere in this chapter.
E. Rhode Island Building Code. Within all zones and districts, all signs
shall comply with applicable provision(s) of the Rhode island State
Building Code and the National Electric Code.
F. Sign maintenance. Within all zones and districts, all signs shall be
maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with Subsection
D and in conformance with this article (unless otherwise allowed
through the Zoning Board of Review) at all times.
G. Landscaping requirements. For the purposes of this article,
"landscaping" shall include any combination of living plants such as
grass, ground cover, shrubs, vines or hedges and nonliving landscape
materials such as rocks, pebbles, sand mulch or decorative paving
material. In the case of freestanding or monument signs, the
§ 260-28 CHARTER § 260-28
C:641
requirement shall be that the area immediately underneath the sign
and the entirety of an area extending two feet radially from the sign
base or supports shall be landscaped. Landscape materials may not
obstruct the view of the sign message.
H. Illumination. Within all zones, except as provided elsewhere in this
article, all signs may be illuminated under the following criteria:
(1) Internal illumination or backlighting of signs is prohibited in the
Commercial Downtown (CD) and Waterfront (W) Districts.
(2) Internal illumination or backlighting of signs is permitted in other
zones only where any of the following exist:
(a) The background is darker than the letters placed against it; or
(b) The background is opaqued; or
(c) The background is ivory or a similar shade to give the
impression of opaquing.
(3) Signs may be illuminated by a stationary white or off-white steady
light only. These lights shall not provide glare, nor shall they direct
light or shine off the premises.
I. Alterations. Any legally existing sign (including legal nonconforming
signs) may be altered either to update the sign content or to reflect new
information, provided that the alteration does not result in any change
in the sign's size, extent, location or illumination. Such updates do not
require review or approval by the Historic District Commission or a sign
permit.
J. Criteria for review.
(1) All sign proposals shall be evaluated under the following
guidelines:
(a) Compliance with ordinances.
(b) Clarity of design and message.
(2) In addition to the criteria listed in Subsection H(1) and (2), all
proposals reviewed by the Historic District Commission shall
conform with the Historic District Commission's Guidelines for
Review.

NOTES:
1 Sign approval not required.

K. Town signs. Governmental signs authorized by the Town may be used
for the display of private commercial messages with the approval of the
Town Council. The commercial message display area may be for a
business, product, service or other commercial activity that is not
located on the same premises. The display area of the commercial
message may be equal to but shall not exceed the display area of the
governmental message.
A. It is recognized here that, unlike on-premises identification signs which
are actually a part of a business being conducted at the property where
the sign is located, "off-premises signage" is a separate and distinct use
which is unrelated to the business, product or service being conducted
at the property where the sign is located. With a view to this distinction,
and in furtherance of the above-stated goals, off-premises signs are
regulated differently from on-premises signs.
B. In addition to the signs described as prohibited under the Sign Table in
§ 260-28J, the following signs and sign materials are also expressly
prohibited by this article:
(1) Types of signs prohibited.
(a) Signs which advertise an activity, business, product or service
no longer produced or conducted on the premises upon which
the sign is located. No such sign shall remain in place in or on
vacated premises for more than 90 days from the date the
vacancy commenced.
§ 260-28 CHARTER § 260-29
C:645
§ 260-30. Nonconforming signs.
(b) Signs which are attached to natural features, stone walls,
utility poles, utility boxes, traffic signs, fences or highway
structures.
(c) Signs attached to or placed on or against trailers or vehicles,
whether registered or unregistered. This does not include
signs adhered or painted onto vehicles.
(d) Signs in the public right-of-way, except for those installed by
the government.
(e) Signs which imitate and may be confused with an official traffic
control sign or signal, or an emergency or road equipment
vehicle.
(f) All other signs which have not been expressly permitted within
this article.
(g) All existing signs erected without the necessary approvals and/
or permits.
(h) Commercial off-premises signs including billboards.
(2) Additional signs prohibited. The total number of permitted exterior
signs at any business shall not exceed four. This number shall
include any combination of wall signs, freestanding signs,
monument signs, projecting signs, canopy signs, marquee signs,
and sandwich board signs.

(a) Pennants, ribbons, streamers, spinners, other moving devices.
(b) Internal illumination or backlighting of signs is prohibited in
the Commercial Downtown CD and Waterfront W Zones.
Internal illumination or backlighting of signs in all other zones
is prohibited, except as permitted § 260-28H of this chapter.
A. A sign shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming status when:
(1) The sign is enlarged or reduced without approvals. (See also
§§ 260-28 and 260-29 of this chapter.)
(2) The sign is relocated without approvals. [See § 260-29B(1).]
(3) The sign advertises or calls attention to any products, businesses or
activities which have not been carried on or sold at the premises for
the past 90 days.
(4) The sign shall not have been repaired or properly maintained
within 30 days after written notice to that effect has been given by
§ 260-29 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-30
C:646
§ 260-31. Indemnification of Town.
Any permit granted or permission given pursuant to this article shall be
upon the express condition that the permittee and/or grantee and every
owner, person or entity maintaining any such sign shall be liable for and
save the Town harmless from and indemnify said Town against any and all
liability, costs and expenses incurred and any damages sustained by persons
or property caused by the construction, existence or maintenance of any
such sign.
§ 260-32. Administration and enforcement.
the Building Official and/or Director of Planning, or their
designees.
(5) The sign is removed and replaced with another nonconforming
sign, regardless of its size.
B. A sign shall not lose its legal nonconforming status when:
(1) A wall sign is removed for construction, painting and/or restoration
of the building, provided that the sign is returned to its location
within 30 days of completion of the building work.
(2) The sign is removed to facilitate repair, maintenance and/or
repainting and replaced immediately upon completion of such
work.
C. No sign that had been erected in violation of any previously existing
sign ordinance shall, by virtue of adoption of this article, become legal
nonconforming.
A. A permit may be required from the Building Department prior to
erecting, (re)placing, (re)building, (re)constructing, or (re)locating any
sign. A permit is not necessary for sign repair and maintenance,
provided that the work is done in conformity with this article.
B. Application(s) for a sign permit(s) shall be accompanied by a sketch
plan of the site and elevation drawings of the proposed sign, caption of
the proposed sign, and such other data as is pertinent to the application
and consistent with this article, as determined by the Building Official.
C. Any newly installed sign found to be in violation of these regulations is
subject to removal by the Town of East Greenwich and/or other
penalties consistent with § 260-79B of this chapter, specifically.
(1) Where the ZEO determines a violation to have occurred, the ZEO
shall have the authority to issue an injunction and an order to
restore the property to its previolation state.
(2) The ZEO shall also require the payment of a penalty fee for such
violation. Each day any violation of any provision of this chapter
(including the failure to perform any act or duty required by this
§ 260-30 CHARTER § 260-32
C:647
chapter) continues shall constitute a separate offense. Penalties
shall be as set forth in § 260-79, Violations and penalties.117

IV).

ARTICLE VIII
Planned Development and Mixed Use Planned Development Overlay
§ 260-33. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to govern the erection, design, use and reuse
of buildings and land approved as either Planned Developments (PD) or as
Mixed Use Planned Developments (MUPD). These districts are intended to
provide the following:
§ 260-34. Applicability.
§ 260-35. Permitted uses.
A. Planned development: a designation which allows for residential land
uses through environmentally sensitive design. It would provide for
residential development on a single parcel (as in a townhouse design,
etc.).
B. Mixed use planned development: a designation which allows for
multiple uses on one parcel. It is offered as a development option as an
encouragement to construct and develop low-density commercial (retail
and/or office) uses so as to offset the tax burden of higher density
residential units. Low- and moderate-income residential units would be
particularly encouraged in an MUPD.
A. Designation of either of these districts requires an amendment to this
chapter and Zoning Map for the Town of East Greenwich. These
districts may be allowed where general impacts and environmental
constraints are minimal and there is a proper fit with existing uses.
B. Development of a parcel under either of these use designations
additionally requires approval under the tenets of Chapter A263,
Development and Subdivision Review Regulations.
C. The standards of this article shall also be applied to projects that are
developed in phases.
A. The following are permitted uses within the PD Zone:
(1) Single-family attached dwellings, including, but not limited to,
duplexes and quadraplexes.
(2) Off-street parking.
(3) Signs (as provided for in Article VII).
B. The following are permitted uses within the MUPD Zone:
(1) Single-family attached dwellings.
(2) Multifamily dwellings and duplexes.
(3) Offices.
§ 260-33 CHARTER § 260-35
C:649
§ 260-36. Accessory uses.
§ 260-37. General requirements.
(4) Health and fitness facilities.
(5) Medical walk-in facilities/outpatient care.
(6) Day care, day-care centers.
(7) Off-street parking.
(8) Signs (as provided for in Article VII).
(9) Assisted living and long-term health care.
A. The following uses are permitted as accessory uses to legally existing
principal uses in both the PD and the MUPD Zones:
(1) The keeping of household pets for residential or educational uses.
(2) Family day-care in the home.
(3) A temporary sales or promotion office in connection with adjacent
construction. Such office may be located in a trailer. "Temporary" is
considered to be one year, but renewal for good cause may be
allowed with application to the Building Official.
(4) Storage of building materials and equipment incidental to on-site
construction.
(5) Storage of inspected, registered vehicles, owned or used by a
person residing on the premises, which are physically capable of
being operated on a public roadway.
(6) Storage of a maximum of one inspected, commercially registered
vehicle, owned or used by a person residing on the premises, that
has a maximum of one-ton capacity, which is physically capable of
being operated on a public roadway. Storage of unregistered
vehicles shall not be permitted.
(7) In-law apartments.
(8) Bed-and-breakfasts by special use permit only.
A. The following requirements shall apply to both the PD and MUPD
Zones:
(1) No accessory structure, swimming pool and/or tennis court shall be
located in any part of the required front and side setbacks.
(2) Proposals for planned developments and mixed use planned
developments are required to follow review procedure spelled out
§ 260-35 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-37
C:650
in Chapter A263, Development and Subdivision Review
Regulations.
(3) Planned developments and mixed use planned developments are
required to participate in any impact program required for such
uses.
(4) All such developments shall be serviced by Town sewer and public
water.
(5) All such developments shall be oriented to the Town's principal
arterials.
(6) All roads within a PD and MUPD shall be constructed to the Town's
standards and may be dedicated as public streets.
(7) The total number of residential dwelling units to be permitted shall
be computed by using the following formula:
D = (GA  NA)/UZ
D = Density (maximum number of residential units, this
number shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number to establish the total number of allowed
units in this development)
GA = Gross acreage (gross area of the proposed
development in acres and tenths of acres)
NA = Not Allowed (the area, in acres and tenths of acres,
of all wetlands or other natural areas protected
under this chapter; all wetland areas shall be
defined by the Department of Environmental
Management; the NA total shall include the total
land area allowed for streets)
UZ = Underlying Zone (gross development density in
units per acre permitted in the underlying zoning
district)
(8) A minimum of 30% common open space shall be provided. Common
open space shall comply with the following criteria:
(a) Wetland areas, as delineated by the state, shall not be counted
toward the 30% required open space. Perimeter wetlands may
be included to meet this requirement;
(b) Up to 20% of the common open space may be devoted to paved
areas or structures used to provide recreational or cultural
facilities for residents of the development, consistent with the
intended use of the common open space and approved by the
Planning Board;
(c) The location, size and shape of common open space shall be
reviewed and approved by the Planning Board. Strips of
§ 260-37 CHARTER § 260-37
C:651
common open space are not permitted unless they provide

of objects erected or placed by authorized public or quasi-public agencies
for public safety and/or public welfare purposes and with the exception of
tables, chairs and planters maintained on sidewalks in conjunction with a
duly authorized business establishment. "Street object" is defined as any
object erected or placed on a public way or sidewalk on a temporary
or permanent basis. Authorized public safety/public welfare street objects
include, but are not limited to, such objects as street lights, traffic lights,
United States Post Office mailboxes, fire hydrants, utility poles, street trees
and municipal trash receptacles.
§ 260-61. Application procedures.
(1) A building permit or demolition permit is required for such work or
the work proposed will affect the exterior appearance of the
structure or its appurtenances. The Building Official may not issue
a permit until the Commission has granted a certificate under the
provisions of this article.121
(2) The proposed project is for exterior work.
(3) The proposed project is not a replacement-in-kind.
C. Stone walls. A certificate is necessary for the alteration, relocation and/
or demolition of any stone wall located within a historic district or on a
listed outlying property per § 260-58B above, whether or not a building
permit is required for such work. No work on an applicable stone wall
may begin until the Commission has issued a certificate in accordance
with the provisions of this article.
D. Additional regulations. The regulations pertaining to the various zoning
districts which may be included within any historic district or which
may apply to the outlying property identified in § 260-58B shall apply,
together with the additional requirements as set forth in this section
and this article.
A. Application requirements and procedures.
(1) Applications for a certificate shall be submitted to the Commission
through the Planning Department, which shall determine if such
application is complete in accordance with the Commission's Rules
of Procedure. All complete applications shall be forwarded,
together with all maps, plans and other data, to the Commission,
except where a staff review per § 260-62C of this article applies.
Any accepted application shall be filed with the Commission on the

last business day of the month in which it was submitted and placed
on the following month's agenda.
(2) Applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall contain
information which is necessary to evaluate the proposed
construction, alteration, repair, removal, relocation or demolition,
including but not limited to plans, drawings and photographs, as
required in the Commission's rules.
(3) Incomplete applications shall be returned to the applicant within
seven working days of receipt by the Planning Department.
(4) In applying for a certificate of appropriateness, a property owner
must comply with the application procedures as established by the
Commission and the provisions of this article.
B. No new application for the same or similar work shall be accepted or
filed within six months after rejection of the application unless the
structure, accessory or stone wall has been changed in some way from
casualty.
A. Structures and accessories. In reviewing applications for the alteration,
construction, relocation, repair or demolition of a new or existing
structure and/or accessory, the Commission shall give consideration to
the following:
(1) The historic, architectural or archaeological significance of the
structure and/or its accessories.
(2) The way in which the structure, stone wall and/or its accessories
contribute to the historical, architectural or archaeological
significance of the neighborhood and the Town.
(3) The appropriateness of the general design, arrangement, texture,
material and siting proposed in the plans.
(4) Solar system installations. In addition to those standards provided
in § 260-123, in reviewing an application for the installation of a
solar energy system (i.e., solar panels), the HDC will consider
building-mounted or building-integrated systems; ground-mounted
systems are prohibited in the downtown historic district. Solar
panels should be placed in areas that are least viewable to the
public. Installations that would alter the characteristic features of a
historic structure should be avoided. Panels should not be visible
above the roofline, and panels installed on flat-roof buildings
should be set back from the edge. Where solar panels and other
appurtenances will not be visible from any public way, they shall be
eligible for administrative staff review and approval (consistent
with § 260-62C of the Zoning Code) rather than a review by the full
§ 260-61 CHARTER § 260-62
C:671
Historic District Commission. [Added 11-6-2017 by Ord. No.
873]
B. Stone walls. In addition to those standards provided in § 260-61A, in
reviewing an application for the alteration, construction, relocation,
repair or demolition of a stone wall, the Commission shall give
consideration to the following:
(1) The historical importance of stone walls in delineating the property
boundary of land.
(2) The scenic importance of stone walls along the designated scenic
roadway and the neighborhood.
(3) The impact that the proposed plans would have on the historical
integrity of the stone wall(s).
(4) The ability of a plan to show due regard for stone walls and not
disturb any identified unique and significant archaeological sites.
(5) The retention of stone walls whenever possible and their proper
maintenance.
(6) Breaks for roads, utility easements or fire lanes such that they are
the minimum necessary and are sufficient to provide emergency
vehicles clear access onto and off the site.
C. Staff reviews. The Town Manager may designate a member of his/her
professional staff to render a decision on an application on behalf of the
Commission for work categories listed in Subsection C(3) hereof. In
order to be eligible for a staff review, two copies of a completed
application form for a certificate of appropriateness signed by the
applicant and owner of the subject property must be submitted. A
detailed description of the work to be performed is also required, along
with labeled and dated current photographs of the property. In some
cases, manufacturer's specs, product information, elevations or other
technical or descriptive information may also be required. Requests for
approval of dumpster enclosures and fences require submission of a
site plan.
(1) Unfavorable staff review. In order to qualify for staff-level review
and approval, the work must conform to the guidelines outlined and
comply with all other applicable regulations. Should staff
determine that the application does not conform to the guidelines,
it shall be scheduled before the full Commission for a formal
hearing and decision.
(2) Favorable staff review. Staff shall issue a stamped certificate of
appropriateness just as the full Commission does, and the staff
member issuing it shall sign his/her name to the approval.
(3) Work categories eligible for staff review.
§ 260-62 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-62
C:672
(a) Dumpster enclosures. Wooden opaque fence styles are
appropriate dumpster enclosures. Such fences shall have flat
tops, preferably capped, as this not only gives a finished look
but also protects the end grain of the wood, lending a longer
life for the fence. Most flat-board, closed-space, wooden fences
are acceptable. Stockade fences shall not be approved. Metal
posts may be used but should be placed inside the enclosure
and be completely concealed from view by the fence face.
(b) Fences, gates and arbors. Capped flat-board, closed-space,
wooden fences are acceptable. Lattice toppers are also
appropriate, provided that they do not increase the fence
height beyond seven feet. Such toppers shall be proportioned
consistent with the following: For a fence height totaling six
feet, 4.5 feet shall be board fence with 18 inches of lattice; this
amounts to a 3:1 ratio of board fence to topper. Traditional
spaced picket fences shall also be approved at heights not
exceeding four feet. The space between pickets shall not
exceed the width of one picket; a tighter spacing is preferred.
Stockade-style, chain-link and vinyl fence proposals shall not
be eligible for staff-level review and approval and are generally
not approved by the Commission.
(c) Awnings, except as signs. Any awning making use of text or
graphics to advertise a business name or location shall be
considered a sign and must be reviewed as such by the full
HDC. Other awnings, in use as sun shields, for sheltering of
merchandise or customers, for conservation of energy, or
simply to dress up a storefront, add architectural interest or
make a building more inviting, are encouraged. Awning
materials should be soft canvas, acrylic or vinyl rather than
wood or metal. Awnings should be installed without damaging
the building or visually impairing distinctive architectural
features. Awnings may be fixed or retractable and must
provide at least eight feet of clearance from the bottom edge to
grade.
(d) Replace/repair in kind where tax credits are requested.
Ordinary repairs/replacements in kind require no certificate of
appropriateness. However, if state or local tax credits are
requested, a certificate is necessary. This provision empowers
staff to issue such certificate if the following conditions are
met: Deteriorated architectural features should be repaired
rather than replaced whenever possible. If replacement is
necessary, the new feature should match the existing or
original feature in design, composition, texture, material and
other visual qualities. Replacement of missing features should
be substantiated by documentary, physical or pictorial
evidence. Replacement-in-kind of nonconforming materials or

C:673
§ 260-63. Decisions.
§ 260-64. Demolition.
features exceeding 25% of the total shall require full
Commission review and decision.
A. The Commission or municipal professional staff, as designated by the
Town Manager, shall either approve, approve with conditions or deny
an application and issue all of its decisions in writing. Staff denial
constitutes referral to the full Commission. Such decisions shall include
an explanation of the reasons and basis of each decision within the
disposition.
B. In the case of a decision not to issue a certificate of appropriateness,
the Commission shall include the basis for its conclusion that the
proposed activity would be incompatible with those aspects of the
structure, accessories or stone walls, or with aspects of the district and/
or outlying properties generally, that the Commission has determined to
be historically, architecturally or archaeologically significant.
C. All decisions shall reflect the Commission's Rules of Procedure and the
Town's Standards and Guidelines for Historic Properties.
D. The Commission or staff shall forward a copy of the decision to the
applicant.
E. Extensions. Failure of the Commission to act within 45 days from the
date of a completed application shall be deemed to constitute approval
unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the
Commission.
F. Continuations. A continuation for a period of up to 90 days from the
date a completed application was filed may be granted by the
Commission in the event that the Commission finds that the
circumstances of a particular application require further time for
additional study and information that cannot be obtained within the
forty-five-day application filing period. Notification of this continuation
shall be made to the applicant within seven days of the decision to
continue.
A. Standards for decision.
(1) If the Commission is presented with an application for the removal,
relocation, alteration or demolition of a structure, its accessories
and/or a stone wall and finds that the approval of such an
application would pose a significant threat or total loss to the Town,
state or nation, it shall endeavor to work out with the owner an
economically feasible plan for the preservation of the structure,
accessories, and/or stone wall.
§ 260-62 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-64
C:674
§ 260-65. Exemptions.
(2) Applications for demolition shall require proof that the retention of
the structure, accessory or stone wall would constitute a public
safety hazard (as defined by the Rhode Island Building Code)122
which cannot be eliminated by any economic means available to the
owner. If the Commission remains unconvinced that retention is a
hazard, the Commission shall forward its rejection of the
application for demolition to the Building Official.
B. External considerations. If any of the following conditions apply, the
Commission may approve the application for a certificate:
(1) Preservation of such structure, accessory or stone wall is a
deterrent to a major improvement program which will significantly
benefit the Town.
(2) Preservation of such structure, accessory or stone wall would cause
undue or unreasonable financial hardship to the owner, taking into
account the financial resources available to the owner, including
the sale of the structure to any purchaser willing and able to
preserve such structure.
(3) Preservation of such structure, accessory or stone wall would not
be in the best interest of the community as a whole.
C. Alternatives to demolition and removal.
(1) When considering an application to demolish or remove a
structure, accessory or stone wall of historic, cultural, architectural
or archaeological value, the Commission shall assist the owner in
identifying and evaluating alternatives to demolition.
(2) In addition to any other criteria, the Commission shall also consider
whether there is a likelihood that some person or group of persons
other than the current owner is willing to purchase, move and
preserve such structure or accessory and whether the owner has
made continuing, bona fide and reasonable efforts to sell the
structure to any such purchaser.
A. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent replacement-inkind,
painting, routine maintenance or repair of any structure,
accessory or stone wall within a historic district, outlying property or
along a scenic road, provided that such maintenance or repair does not
result in any change of design, type of material, or appearance of the
exterior of the structure, accessory or stone wall. The following work
categories are specifically exempt:

alteration, repair, relocation or demolition of any structure or accessory
previously allowed under a permit issued by the Building Inspector
prior to the passage of this article.
A. Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the
Historic District Commission shall have the right to appeal such
decision to the Zoning Board of Review.
B. When hearing appeals from the Commission's decision(s), the Zoning
Board of Review shall not substitute its own judgment for that of the
Commission but must consider the issue upon the findings and record
of the Commission. The Zoning Board of Review shall not reverse a
Commission decision except on a finding of a prejudicial procedural
error, clear error, or lack of support by the weight of the evidence in
record. All such decisions by the Zoning Board of Review shall be in
writing and shall articulate and explain the reasons and basis of its
decision. Copies of such a decision shall be sent to the Commission.

ARTICLE XII
Telecommunications Towers
[Added 8-25-2003 by Ord. No. 737; amended 6-6-2005 by Ord. No.
755]
§ 260-68. Purpose and intent.
A. The purpose of this article is to establish general guidelines for the
siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. It is specifically
recognized that this article is subordinate to the Federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996. If any provision of this article is found
to be in conflict with the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is
the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 that will be controlling.
B. The goals of this article are to:
(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
(2) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas;
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(4) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers;
(5) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and
innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) Encourage users of antennas to locate them, to the extent possible,
inside of existing clock towers, bell steeples, church steeples and
similar structures, and on existing light poles, signs and other
similar structures, in such a manner as to minimize the adverse
visual impact of the antennas;
(8) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently; and
(9) Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
C. In furtherance of these goals, East Greenwich shall give due
consideration to the Town's Comprehensive Community Plan, Zoning
Map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in
approving sites for the location of towers and antennas.
§ 260-68 CHARTER § 260-69

C:680
§ 260-71. General requirements.
array. Additional tower units may be added within the perimeter of the
AM array by right.
A. Permitted zoning districts. Telecommunications towers shall be
permitted by special use permit issued after public hearing by the
Zoning Board of Review in the districts noted on Table 1,125 subject to
the provisions of this article and the underlying zoning district.
Telecommunications towers shall be prohibited in all other zoning
districts except by a use variance from the Zoning Board of Review.126
B. Antennas. Telecommunications antennas not attached to a
telecommunications tower may be permitted by special use permit
issued after public hearing by the Zoning Board of Review as an
accessory use to any commercial, industrial, office, institutional or
public utility structure, provided that:
(1) The antenna is completely contained within the structure.
(2) Any communication equipment or accessory building complies with
all other applicable zoning requirements and building codes.
(3) All requirements for public notice and public hearing as otherwise
requited by this article and by this chapter are met.

IV).
§ 260-70 CHARTER § 260-71
C:681
F. Removal of abandoned towers. Any telecommunications tower that is
not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered
abandoned. The owner of an abandoned tower is required to remove
the same within 90 days of receipt of notice from the Town notifying the
owner of the abandonment. Failure to remove an abandoned tower shall
be grounds to remove the tower at the owner's expense. If there are two
or more users of a single tower, then this provision shall not become
effective until all users cease using the tower.
G. Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower
shall provide to the Zoning Enforcement Officer and Planning Director
an inventory of its existing towers, antennas and/or sites approved for
towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of East
Greenwich or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific
information about the location, height and design of each tower. The
Zoning Enforcement Officer and Planning Director may share such
information with other applicants applying for special use permits or
use variances under this article or other organizations seeking to locate
antennas within the jurisdiction of East Greenwich; provided, however,
that the Zoning Enforcement Officer and Planning Director are not, by
sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that
such sites are available or suitable.
H. State or federal requirements. All towers and antennas must meet or
exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any
other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to
regulate towers and antennas. If such standards are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring
such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards
and regulations within six months of the effective date of such
standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring
towers or antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
I. Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of
towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in
compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local
building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If upon inspection the Town concludes that a tower fails to
comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to
persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of
the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said 30 days shall constitute grounds for the removal
of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.
J. Municipal use. Towers shall provide space for Town of East Greenwich
municipal use at no cost to the Town.
§ 260-71 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-71
C:682
§ 260-72. Development standards.
The following standards shall apply to all applications:
K. Performance bond. Each applicant shall post a performance bond with
the Town of East Greenwich to cover the cost of removal of its
abandoned tower(s) and the cost of maintaining its tower(s) in
accordance with building codes and safety standards and, if applicable,
FAA regulations.
A. A reasonable effort shall be made to utilize existing structures for
telecommunications antennas. Should an existing structure not be
utilized, evidence as to why an existing structure is not to be utilized
shall be submitted.
B. Town-owned sites that are located in the prospective development area
and which could potentially accommodate the proposed antennas and
communication towers shall be identified.
C. Communication towers shall be set back from all property lines a
minimum of one foot for each one foot of tower height. When the
property abuts a residential district or historic district, the setback
distance shall be 1 1/2 feet for each one foot of tower height. All guy
wires and guyed towers shall be clearly marked so as to be visible at all
times, and all guy wires shall be set back from all property boundaries
the minimum of the zoning district in which they are located.
D. All communication tower supports and peripheral anchors shall be
located entirely within the boundaries of the development site and shall
be set back from all property boundaries the minimum of the zoning
district in which the communication tower is located, but no less than
25 feet. When located in or abutting a residential district or historic
district, the minimum setback distance shall be 35 feet. Supports and/or
peripheral anchors shall not encroach upon the minimum landscaped
screening requirement. All supports and anchors shall have, at a
minimum, a ten-foot horizontal setback from any overhead utility line.
E. Communication equipment buildings and structures shall be considered
accessory uses and comply with the following setbacks:
(1) One hundred square feet or less, shall be set back from all property
boundaries a minimum of 15 feet, unless located within or abutting
a residential district or historic district, which shall require a
minimum of 25 feet;
(2) Greater than 100 square feet, shall be set back from all property
boundaries a minimum of 25 feet, unless located within or abutting
a residential district or historic district, which shall require a
minimum of 35 feet.
F. Communication towers shall be constructed and situated to fit in with
the topography and features of the surrounding environment. Towers
§ 260-71 CHARTER § 260-72
C:683
shall be completely screened from all adjacent properties and streets,
and appropriately camouflaged if required. Plantings shall be of a
height and density to ensure complete screening. Screening shall
consist of plants and/or trees accepted by the Chapter A263,
Development and Subdivision Review Regulations, or as accepted by
the Director of Planning. Screening shall comprise 10% of the minimum
established setback requirement, but shall not be less than five feet
in width unless located in or abutting a residential district or historic
district, which will require that it not be less than 10 feet in width.
Screenings may be waived by the Zoning Board of Review on those
sides or sections that are adjacent to undevelopable land or land not
in public view. Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum
extent possible and may be used as a substitute for or supplement
towards meeting the landscaped screening requirement. The owner of
the property shall be responsible for all maintenance and shall replace
any dead plantings within 30 days.
G. Communication towers shall be enclosed by a fence no less than eight
feet in height or more than 10 feet in height from finished grade. Access
shall be through a locked gate. Communication towers in or abutting a
residential district or historic district shall have opaque fencing made
of wood or stone. The Town of East Greenwich reserves the right to
choose the color of the tower.
H. Communication towers shall not be artificially lighted except as
required for public safety purposes, by the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA), or by the Town.
I. No signs shall be allowed on any communication tower except as
required for public safety purposes, by the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), or by the Town.

of the close of the public hearing.
E. Decisions; standards of review.
(1) Review of Planning Board or Historic District Commission
decisions.
(a) In instances of the Board of Appeal's review of a Planning
Board or Historic District Commission decision, the Board of
Appeal shall not substitute its own judgment for that of the
Planning Board or Historic District Commission but must
consider the issue upon the findings and record of the Planning
Board or Historic District Commission. The Board of Appeal
shall not reverse a decision except on a finding of prejudicial
procedural error, clear error, or lack of support by the weight
of the evidence in the record.
(b) The concurring vote of three of the five members of the Board
of Appeal sitting at a hearing is necessary to reverse any
decision of the Planning Board or Historic District Commission.
(c) In the instance where the Board of Appeal overturns a decision
of the Planning Board or Historic District Commission, the
proposed project application is remanded to the Planning
Board or Historic District Commission, at the stage of
processing from which the appeal was taken, for further
proceedings and/or for the final disposition, which shall be
consistent with the Board of Appeal's decision.
(d) The Board of Appeal shall keep complete records of all
proceedings, including a record of all votes taken, and shall put
all decisions on appeals in writing. The Board of Appeal shall
include in the written record and the reasons for each decision.
(2) In exercising its powers with respect to all other appeals, the
Zoning Board of Appeal may reverse or affirm wholly or partly and
may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination

C:708
§ 260-91. Standards of review.
appealed from and may make any orders, requirements, decisions
or determinations that ought to be made, and to that end has the
powers of the officer from whom the appeal was taken.
A. In reviewing an application for a variance (either use or dimensional)
the Board shall require that evidence satisfying standards in this
section be entered into the record of the proceedings. Such evidence
shall satisfy the following standards:
(1) That the hardship from which the applicant seeks relief is due to
the unique characteristics of the subject land or structure and not
to the general characteristics of the surrounding area and not due
to the physical or economic disability of the applicant.
(2) That said, hardship is not the result of any prior action of the
applicant and does not result primarily from the desire of the
applicant to realize greater financial gain.
(3) That the granting of the requested variance will not alter the
general character of the surrounding area or impair the intent or
purpose of this chapter or the Comprehensive Community Plan
upon which said chapter is based.
(4) That the relief to be granted is the least relief necessary.
B. In addition to those standards outlined above in Subsection A, an
applicant for a use variance must additionally demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Board the following: That the subject land or
structure cannot yield any beneficial use if it is required to conform to
the provisions of this chapter. Nonconforming use of neighboring land
or structures in the same district and permitted uses of lands or
structures in an adjacent district shall not be considered in granting a
use variance.
C. In addition to those standards outlined above in Subsection A, an
applicant for a dimensional variance must demonstrate, to the
satisfaction of the Board, the following: The hardship that will be
suffered by the owner of the subject property if the dimensional
variance is not granted shall amount to more than a mere
inconvenience. The fact that a use may be more profitable or that a
structure may be more valuable after the relief is granted is not
grounds for relief. The Zoning Board of Review has the power to grant
dimensional variances where the use is permitted by special use permit
as provided for in the special use permit sections of this chapter.
[Amended 5-22-2006 by Ord. No. 767; 3-14-2016 by Ord. No.
849]
D. In reviewing an application for a special use permit, the Board shall
require that evidence satisfying standards in this section be entered
§ 260-90 CHARTER § 260-91
C:709
into the record of the proceedings. Such evidence shall satisfy the
following standards:
(1) That the public convenience and welfare will be substantially
served.
(2) That the proposed development will be in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of this chapter and the Comprehensive
Community Plan.
(3) That the proposed development will not result in or create
conditions that will be inimical to the public health, safety, morals
and general welfare of the community.
(4) That the granting of the special use permit will not substantially or
permanently injure the appropriate use of the property in the
surrounding area or district.
E. Bed-and-breakfast homes.
(1) In reviewing an application for a special use permit for a bed-andbreakfast
home, the Board shall require that evidence satisfying
standards in this section be entered into the record of the
proceedings. For bed-and-breakfast homes, the applicant must, in
addition to those standards outlined in Subsection D of this section,
demonstrate the following:
(a) That the bed-and-breakfast home and use shall be an accessory
use to a single-family house and that it shall be subordinate to
the residential use of the premises. The bed-and-breakfast
home shall be operated by the homeowner.
(b) That each guest room of the bed-and-breakfast home is in
compliance with the Rhode Island State Housing Maintenance
and Occupancy Code.132
(c) That there will be no change in the outside appearance of the
building and/or premises nor any visible or audible evidence
detectable from outside the lot as to the presence of a bed-andbreakfast
home except for signage as permitted under Article
VII.
(d) That there shall be no meals served to the general public.
Breakfast may be served to guests of the bed-and-breakfast
home.
(e) That minimum off-street parking requirements shall be
provided such that one parking space is provided per guest
unit or guest room. Stacked parking (where one car parks
behind another, essentially blocking it in) is acceptable. All
parking areas shall be paved or graveled. Parking areas for

§ 260-91 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-91
C:710
bed-and-breakfast homes with only two guest rooms or less
may be grassed. Where parking spaces are not provided on
site, the owner shall produce a lease, for a minimum of one
year, for use of a private parking lot. During review of annual
licensing renewal, the owner shall be required to submit proof
of the continuing availability of minimum parking
requirements prior to the license being renewed.
(f) That where deemed necessary to preserve and protect the
residential nature of the neighborhood, the Board may require
a landscape buffer, fence or other screening between the bedand-
breakfast home's parking area and the neighbors'
properties or street.
(g) That the bed-and-breakfast home shall be in compliance with
all applicable provisions of the Rhode Island State Fire Safety
Code, the Rhode Island State Building Code,133 regulations of
the Department of Environmental Management, Department of
Health and any other relative code or agency.
(2) Additionally, licensing shall be required for all bed-and-breakfasts
per the requirements of § 93-1, Schedule of fees and charges, in the
East Greenwich Code.
F. Special use standards for compassion centers in the CH (Commercial
Highway) and M/LIO (Light Industry/Office) Zones. Compassion centers
shall be permitted as a special use permit use in the CH and M/LIO
Zones, subject to all applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance,
including Subsection D above, and all of the following additional
requirements: [Added 1-11-2016 by Ord. No. 846]

the use of any property used for school, public or private park,
playground, play field, youth center, licensed day-care center, or
any location where groups of minors regularly congregate.
(3) The requested use at the proposed location will be sufficiently
buffered in relation to any residential area in the immediate vicinity

physical constraints to development, including but not limited to
wetlands, topography, groundwater characteristics, and existing
improvements. A yield plan shall meet all conventional zoning and
subdivision requirements, including minimum buildable area
requirements, and shall not assume that any waivers, variances or
special use permits will be granted. On parcels located in areas not
serviced by public sewers and not proposed for extension of public
sewers, the yield plan shall include the location of an appropriate onsite
wastewater treatment system on each lot.
E. For all applicable projects under the preceding, at least 20% of the
proposed base developable yield must qualify as affordable housing as
defined per Subsection A(3) above. Affordable units must be deed
restricted to remain affordable to households with gross incomes at or

affordable housing.
below 120% of the area median income, adjusted for family size, per
R.I.G.L. § 42-128-8.1(d)(1).
F. When a subdivision or land development project that creates fewer than
five new dwelling units is approved on a portion of a parcel of land,
leaving another portion of the same parcel undeveloped, the portion left
undeveloped shall not be subdivided or developed for residential or
mixed use unless the undeveloped portion is subject to the inclusionary
requirements of this chapter. The number of inclusionary units required
in the later development shall be calculated as if the earlier
development were part of it. This provision does not apply when an
entire parcel receives Master Plan approval and is developed in phases.
A. Consistent with Chapter 93 of the Town Code, Fees, Article II,
Development Impact Fees, affordable housing units [those referenced
in § 260-98A(3) above] are exempt from the Town's development impact
fee and this fee waiver shall constitute a municipal government subsidy
as defined in R.I.G.L. § 45-53-3, the Rhode Island Low and Moderate
Income Housing Act, Definitions.
B. All projects subject to the provisions of this article wherein low- and
moderate-income housing units are being provided on site as part of an
approved development shall be entitled to a density bonus of up to 20%
more units than otherwise allowed consistent with Subsection C below.
Development of projects that include a density bonus shall require a
special use permit (consistent with the standards listed in § 260-91D of
this Code) from the Zoning Board of Review that incorporates
deviations from the ordinary dimensional standards. Such permit can
also be used to allow multiple residential structures on one lot.
C. Additional units/lots allowed under this zoning incentive provision shall
constitute a municipal government subsidy as defined in the Rhode
Island Low and Moderate Income Housing Act. In addition to the yield
plan required of each developer to show the maximum base number of
units/lots, developers shall also be required to submit a second yield
plan that includes the additional units as permitted with the zoning
incentive. The Planning Board may require the modification via special
use permit of the building height cap and/or minimum dimensional
standards, including overall lot size, lot coverage, setbacks, and
frontage requirements to accommodate affordable units. Lot size,
coverage, setback, and frontage requirements can be reduced by up to
20% but only following an affirmative finding by the Planning Board
that:
(1) Using a flexible zoning standard is in the best interest of good
planning practice as evidenced by consistency with the
Comprehensive Community Plan, including the Housing Plan; and
§ 260-98 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-99
C:718
(2) Using a flexible zoning standard would not impair the purpose or
intent of the Zoning Ordinance and meet the standards of review
spelled out in Chapter 260 of the Town Code, § 260-91D.
D. A "yield plan" indicates the basic maximum number of units or lots a
parcel can support. A minimum of 20% of all proposed lots or units shall
be affordable to low- or moderate-income households as defined in
R.I.G.L. § 45-53. Where such calculation yields a fraction of a unit and
such fraction is 0.5 or higher, the requirement shall be rounded to the
next higher, whole number. Where such calculation yields a fraction of a
unit and that fraction is less than 0.5, the requirement shall be rounded
to the lower whole number.
E. All affordable units provided within a development shall comply with all
of the following requirements:
(1) All affordable units shall be dispersed throughout the development
so as to ensure a true mix of market-rate and affordable housing.
(2) All affordable units shall be visually compatible with market-rate
units in the same development. Affordable units shall be
comparable to market-rate units in terms of location, type, quality,
character, architectural style, and primary exterior building
finishes and materials.
(3) Except as otherwise authorized by the Town, all affordable units
shall contain one or more bedrooms. The mix of unit sizes and
number of bedrooms per unit among the affordable units shall be in
the same proportion as the mix among the market-rate units. If only
one affordable unit is required and the other units in the
development are of various sizes with varying numbers of
bedrooms, the affordable unit shall contain an average of the
number of bedrooms located in the market-rate units rounded to
the nearest whole number.
(4) In assessing the compatibility of character between the affordable
units and the market-rate units within a development, the Planning
Board may consider building elevations, renderings, models and
any other materials it deems necessary to assess and compare
building features, including but not limited to overall height, roof
pitch, building shape and footprint, exterior materials, structural
massing and window pattern, style, and sizes.
(5) The owners or renters of affordable units shall have all rights,
privileges and responsibilities accorded to market-rate owners or
renters, including access to all non-fee amenities within the
development.
(6) Certificates of occupancy (C/Os) for affordable units shall be issued
prior to, or simultaneously with, the certificates of occupancy for
market-rate units. In phased developments, the affordable units
shall be phased, built, and occupied at least at the same

proportionate rate as the market-rate units. If the off-site exaction
is exercised (see § 260-101.1) and affordable units are rehabilitated
or constructed at some other location, certificates of occupancy for
the off-site units shall be issued at the same rate as certificates of
occupancy for the market-rate units in the development.
F. Any dwelling units proposed to be deed-restricted and counted as
affordable units must be in full compliance with all applicable
construction and occupancy codes, and shall be sufficiently maintained
or rehabilitated so that all major systems meet standards comparable to
new construction.
A. Complete applications for construction of affordable housing on
substandard lots of record (nonconforming by dimension) will be
reviewed as land development projects.
B. Applications for development of two or more substandard lots of record
shall include the complete Master Plan checklist in the Land
Development and Subdivision Review Regulations.135
C. Applications for development of one substandard lot of record not

completed Master Plan Checklist in the Land Development and
Subdivision Review Regulations, § A263-17, Subsection (a), Items 1
through 12, 14, 17, 18, and 23 and Subsection (b), Items (3) and (9).
D. The Planning Board, with advice from the Technical Review Committee,
shall recommend the dimensional requirements for these applications.
The Zoning Board of Review retains purview over projects requiring
variances and special use permits, and any necessary relief shall be
subject to its review and approval.
A. A Town-Solicitor-approved monitoring service agreement with a
qualified organization; and
B. Town-Solicitor-approved land lease and/or deed restriction to be in

§ 260-99 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-101.1
C:720
A. Purpose. It is acknowledged that not every subdivision proposal or
project site will be compatible with the goals and requirements of this
Affordable Housing Ordinance. Therefore, the Planning Board, with
input from the Town professional staff and Technical Review
Committee, may exempt a subdivision or land development project from
the requirement to provide affordable units on-site, and instead require
an off-site exaction. The Planning Board may allow off-site exactions
when, in its determination, either of the following conditions is met:
(1) It would not be feasible to provide affordable units on-site due to
existing physical conditions that present unusual development
challenges. These challenges may be environmental or regulatory
and could impact the public safety or welfare. Examples include
high water tables, presence of sensitive wildlife habitat, lot
geometry, and surrounding traffic circulation patterns.
(2) The off-site alternative would be beneficial to the Town or to future
residents of the units because it is more likely to produce housing
that accomplishes the goals of the Town's Affordable Housing Plan,
which calls for, among other things, housing locations to be closely
related to the presence of existing public services and facilities,
jobs, transit and other amenities.
B. Options. On-site affordable unit provision within a new development is
strongly preferred. In special circumstances consistent with the above,
the following off-site exactions may be allowed by the Planning Board in
priority order:
(1) Purchase, deed-restrict and rehabilitate existing buildings to
create affordable units;
(2) New construction of off-site affordable units.
C. Compatibility. Off-site units rehabilitated or constructed in other
neighborhoods remote from the proposed development site shall be
compatible in siting, style, character, quality, and scale with existing
dwelling units in the surrounding area.
D. Concurrent development. Any required off-site affordable units shall be
developed concurrently with the market-rate units in the subject
subdivision or land development project, and certificates of occupancy
(C/Os) for market-rate units shall be issued at the same proportionate
rate as C/Os for newly constructed or rehabilitated affordable units.
Where only one affordable unit is required to be provided, the Planning
Board shall impose a condition of final plan approval that stipulates the
timing of the availability of the affordable unit. In no case shall the final
C/O for a market-rate unit in a development be granted before
rehabilitation/construction of all required affordable units is complete.
E. Rehabilitation. Existing housing units provided to satisfy the affordable
housing requirement as described herein shall be rehabilitated
consistent with the definition of "low or moderate income housing"
§ 260-101.1 CHARTER § 260-101.1
C:721
§ 260-101.2. Reports.
found in the R.I.G.L. § 45-53-3(9). Affordable off-site units provided
without any rehabilitation shall not be accepted.
F. Incentive. Pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 45-24-46.1, which requires a subsidy or
financial incentive for all residential projects with an inclusionary
component, the twenty-percent density bonus over the base
developable yield shall also be applied to projects pursuing an off-site
exaction. As an example, if a parcel's yield plan shows development
potential for six units, the developer, taking advantage of the density
bonus, could propose construction of seven units on the project site but
would also need to construct and deed-restrict, or purchase,
rehabilitate and deed-restrict, an off-site unit as well. Consistent with
§ 260-99B above, projects including density bonus units shall require a
special use permit from the Zoning Board of Review that incorporates
any necessary deviations from the ordinary dimensional standards.
A. The local review board shall submit a report on affordable housing
activities in each fiscal year to the Town Council not later than August
14 of the following fiscal year.
B. The report shall include the following:
(1) The number of applications to construct or rehabilitate affordable
housing units submitted, accepted as complete, and rejected as
incomplete.
(2) The total number of dwelling units proposed to be constructed or
rehabilitated in applications that are accepted and the number of
dwelling units that are proposed to be affordable in such
applications.

Wind Energy Systems
[Added 10-6-2014 by Ord. No. 839]
§ 260-113. Legislative findings; purpose.
§ 260-114. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
OWNER  The individual or entity that intends to own and operate a wind
facility in accordance with this article.
A. The Town Council of the Town of East Greenwich finds, determines, and
declares that, in accordance with R.I.G.L. § 45-24-27 et seq., the Town
is empowered to regulate and control land use in order to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of its residents. The Town has made a
thorough study of wind energy systems as a land use and has identified
several issues, especially pertaining to potential negative impacts on
the environment and on the health of residents in the vicinity of
turbines, that are cause for concern in siting such facilities.
B. The Town has determined that, in much of the community, given the
density and proximity of properties and the existing mix of uses within
the Town limits, and given the sheer size and scale of most effective
wind energy systems, such construction would be inconsistent with
protection of the general health, safety and welfare. Such systems have
an inherent impact on community character and aesthetics and would
not be consistent with preserving the cultural and historical fabric of
downtown or other historically zoned areas or the visual character of
our scenic corridors.136
C. The purpose of this article is to accommodate wind energy systems in
appropriate geographic locations and at appropriate scales while
simultaneously protecting the public health, safety and welfare. This
article will provide for a review and approval process for limited wind
energy projects that will ensure compliance with the standards and
regulations established herein. A special use permit process will be
created for the construction and operation of wind systems, providing
clear standards for the placement, design, construction, monitoring,
modification and removal of wind facilities to address public safety and
minimize impacts on the scenic, natural and historic resources of the
Town and to provide adequate financial assurances regarding the
viability of such projects from construction, through operation and
maintenance, to ultimate decommissioning and removal.
136. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
IV).

C:727
RATED NAMEPLATE CAPACITY  The maximum rated output of electric
power production equipment. This output is typically specified by the
manufacturer with a nameplate on the equipment.
TOWER  The monopole, freestanding or guyed structure that supports a
wind generator.
TURBINE HEIGHT  The vertical distance from ground level at the base of
the turbine to the tip of a rotor blade at its highest point.
WIND ENERGY FACILITY  A facility consisting of any and all equipment,
machinery and structures utilized in connection with the conversion,
storage or transfer of wind into electrical energy. It includes all
transmission, storage, collection and supply equipment as well as
substations, transformers, turbines and accessways (examples include but
are not limited to all blades, base, foundations, rotors, towers, vanes, wires,
inverters, batteries, generators and/or other components of the system).
WIND TURBINE  A device that converts kinetic wind energy into
rotational energy that drives an electrical generator. A wind turbine
typically consists of a tower, nacelle body, and a rotor with two or more
blades.
§ 260-115. Restrictions; permit requirements.
UTILITY-SCALE WIND FACILITY  A commercial wind facility where
the primary use is intended to be electrical generation that will be sold
to wholesale electricity markets.
A.
SMALL WIND ENERGY FACILITY  A wind facility located at a
commercial, industrial, agricultural, residential, institutional or public
facility that is designed and intended to generate electrical output
primarily for the use or benefit of structures on the same lot or on
contiguous commonly owned lots. Small wind facilities have a rated
nameplate capacity of 80 kilowatts or less and a total height not
exceeding 35 feet.
B.
A. Utility-scale wind facilities are not permitted.
B. Wind energy facilities are prohibited in all local historic districts and on
any outlying property covered by historic zoning.
C. On-site small wind energy facilities may be installed, erected or
constructed in the F-2, M/LIO, RHF and MUPD Zones on lot sizes not
less than two acres, subject to the issuance of a special use permit by
the Zoning Board of Review, provided that the use complies with all
requirements set forth herein. Such systems are not permitted in any
other zones. All permitted wind facilities shall be constructed and
operated in a manner that minimizes any adverse visual, safety, and
environmental impacts. No special use permit shall be granted unless
the ZBR finds specifically in writing that the specific site is an
appropriate location for such use; and the use is not expected to
adversely affect the surrounding neighborhood; and there is not

§ 260-116. Design and installation standards.
expected to be any serious hazard to pedestrians or vehicles from
the use; and no nuisance is expected to be created by the use; and
adequate and appropriate facilities will be provided for the proper
operation, maintenance and protection of the use. In order to affirm
the above-required findings of fact, the Zoning Board must assess the
compliance of all proposed wind facilities with the design, installation,
safety, aesthetic and environmental standards outlined below in
§§ 260-116 and 260-117.
D. All special use permit applications for small wind energy systems shall
be accompanied by a fee equal to the fee charged for
telecommunications towers per Subsection A(3) of § 260-89, Variance
and special use permit application procedure and fees, of this chapter.
E. Where permitted, only one small wind energy system shall be allowed
on a property.
F. All approved small wind energy systems shall be required to undergo an
annual safety review, and a certified inspection report shall be filed with
the Zoning Officer.
G. All approved turbines shall be set back a distance either 1) equal to or
exceeding the maximum projectile distance (or thrown hazard) as
determined by the manufacturer; or 2) equal to two times or greater the
overall blade tip height of the turbine from the nearest existing
residential or commercial structure, whichever is greater, and a
distance at least equal to the overall blade tip height of the turbine from
the nearest property line or public right-of-way. All other components of
the wind facility (equipment, storage/generator sheds, transformers,
substations, guy wires or support footings) shall meet the standard
setbacks for the zone and all other relevant dimensional regulations,
including those pertaining to lot coverage, buffers and accessory
structure heights.
H. All wind energy facility owners shall provide a copy of their site plans
and construction plans, and, ultimately, the as-built plan sets, to local
emergency service providers and cooperate with same in developing an
emergency response plan.
A. Controls. Wind turbines shall have automatic braking, governing,
feathering, deicing and/or shutdown systems as needed to prevent
uncontrolled rotation, overspeeding, rotor breakage, or excessive
pressure on the tower structure, blades and other turbine components.
B. Lighting. Wind turbines shall only be lighted if required by the FAA.
Lighting of nontower parts of a wind turbine, such as appurtenant
structures, shall be limited to that required for safety, security and
operational purposes and shall be shielded from abutting properties
consistent with the "dark skies" principle outlined in the land
§ 260-115 CHARTER § 260-116
C:729
development and subdivision regulations.137 Lighting glare on abutting
properties shall be minimized except as required by the FAA.
C. Outside experts. The Zoning Board of Review may hire outside
consultants and experts as needed at the applicant's expense to peer
review studies done by a wind energy facility applicant or to otherwise
evaluate the design and installation impacts of a proposed wind turbine.
Such review may cover any of the impacts addressed by this section and
may also include a structural analysis of the proposed turbine,
assessments of the expected power generation output of the facility,
and any other topics deemed relevant by the ZBR.
D. Visual impacts. To assess the visual impacts on a neighborhood, area or
viewshed of a proposed wind system, the Zoning Board may require
color photos of a site and its surrounding areas along with color photo
simulations, by a qualified graphics professional, of said site and
surroundings with the proposed wind facility superimposed thereon.
E. Warnings. Clearly visible warning signage concerning voltage shall be
placed at the base of all wind turbines, and turbines shall be designed
to prevent unauthorized access. The Zoning Board may require
protective fencing as reasonably necessary given the location of the
wind turbine on the site or in relation to the neighboring area.
F. Shadow flicker. Wind turbines shall be sited to minimize the shadow
flicker effect on neighboring property. The applicant bears the burden
of proving that significant adverse impacts will not occur, and failure to
show same shall result in denial of the wind system petition. Required
documentation may include simulations showing the angle of the sun at
various times of the day and of the year and at any/all angles wherein
surrounding property may be affected depending on projected turbine
height.
G. Utility connections. No special use permit for a wind energy facility will
be issued until an applicant submits documentation from the relevant
electrical utility, as applicable, approving the proposed connection.
H. Environmental analysis. Depending on proposed size, scale and siting,
wind energy facility applicants may be required to submit to the Zoning
Board of Review a report, from a professional environmental consulting
firm, that addresses the following factors:
(1) Constraints imposed by environmental and/or archaeological
regulations.
(2) The presence of plant communities or animal species of concern or

the maximums established by the Town Code at Chapter 152, Noise.
Noise levels are measured at the lot lines of the turbine site, consistent
with the provisions for assessing noise effects as found in
aforementioned Chapter 152, Noise. The applicant may be required to
produce documentation from a qualified acoustics professional
demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Zoning Board of Review that
the proposed installation complies with the purpose and intent of this
requirement.
G. The Zoning Board in issuing a special use permit may also consider
potential impacts on communications, including local emergency
responder telecommunications, other military or civilian radio use or
telecommunications and/or interference with other transmissions,
including television. The Zoning Board may require local expert
testimony to this effect or other written testimony from qualified
personnel.
H. Clearing of natural vegetation shall be limited to that which is
necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the wind
facility and as otherwise prescribed by applicable state and local laws,
regulations and ordinances.
I. Wind facilities shall comply with all applicable requirements of the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
A. All permitted wind turbines shall be maintained in good working
condition. Maintenance shall include painting, structural repairs, and

of the issuance of the building permit as part of an annual safety
certification process.
B. An applicant for a wind energy facility project shall be required to post
a bond of a type, of a duration, and in an amount to be determined by
the Town.
C. When a wind energy system is scheduled for decommissioning, the
applicant shall notify the Town by certified mail of the proposed date of
discontinued operation and plans for removal. The owner/operator shall
§ 260-117 EAST GREENWICH CODE § 260-118
C:732
remove the entire wind system no more than 150 days after the
discontinuation.
D. At the time of removal, the wind energy facility site shall be restored to
its state from before the facility was constructed. Removal shall include
all associated equipment, with appropriate disposal of any hazardous
materials. Stabilization and revegetation of the site shall occur as
necessary to minimize erosion. The Zoning Officer may allow the owner
to leave established vegetation and possibly below-grade foundations
where they would minimize erosion and limit site disturbance.
E. The owner/operator of a facility shall implement current industry
practices during removal to ensure minimal adverse impacts on the
public health, safety and welfare. Environmental impacts shall also be
minimized, with appropriate notice to state regulatory agencies as
required.
F. After 12 months or one year of inoperability of any wind energy system,
the Zoning Officer may reasonably determine the system to be
abandoned and shall issue a notice of abandonment to the property
owner. The owner shall have the right to respond to the notice within 30
days of receipt. Abandonment constitutes the voiding of any special use
permit granted for a wind energy project on site.
G. Should the property owner fail to respond to the notice of
abandonment, the Zoning Officer shall allow 90 days from original
receipt of the notice to accommodate complete physical removal of the
offending wind energy system. If the system is not removed within 90
days, the Zoning Officer may impose the penalties outlined in § 260-79,
Violations and penalties, of this chapter or will seek all available legal
remedies through a court of competent jurisdiction.
H. The owner of an abandoned or decommissioned wind energy facility
shall remove the turbines, towers, bases and associated structures and
components. If the owner fails to do so, the Town, through the Zoning
Officer, shall pursue all legal remedies available to it and/or seek
satisfaction through the posted bond and/or place a lien against the
property. The Town reserves the right to salvage the wind facility
demolition debris to defray the cost of demolition and site stabilization.

ARTICLE XX
Solar Energy Systems and Facilities
[Added 11-6-2017 by Ord. No. 873]
§ 260-119. Purpose and intent.
The purpose of this article is to establish protocols for the construction and
operation of solar energy systems in the Town of East Greenwich, subject
to reasonable conditions that will protect the public health, safety, and
welfare.
§ 260-120. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BUILDING-INTEGRATED SYSTEM  A solar energy system that is
constructed as an integral part of a principal or accessory building or
structure and where the building integrated system features maintain a
uniform profile or surface of vertical walls, window openings and roofing.
Such a system is used in lieu of a separate mechanical device replacing or
substituting for an architectural or structural component of the building or
structure that appends or interrupts the uniform surfaces of walls, window
openings and roofing. A building-integrated system may occur within
vertical facades replacing view glass, spandrel glass or other facade
material into semitransparent skylight systems, into roofing systems
replacing traditional roofing materials or other building or structure
envelope systems.
BUILDING-MOUNTED SYSTEM  A solar energy system that has its
electricity-generating solar panels attached to any part or type of roof
on a building or structure that has an occupancy permit on file with the
municipality and that is either the principal structure or an accessory
structure on a recorded parcel. This system also includes any solar-based
architectural elements and building-integrated systems.
COVERED PARKING SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEM  An active solar energy
system that is structurally mounted to the ground yet additionally maintains
the permanent function of vehicle parking underneath; may be either a
minor or major system.
GROUND-MOUNTED SYSTEM  A solar energy system that has its
electricity-generating solar panels mounted on a structure, pole or series of
poles constructed specifically to support the system and not attached to any
other structure.
MAJOR SOLAR SYSTEM INSTALLATION  A solar energy system
installation designed primarily to sell electricity to a utility supplier or
a solar installation with an output exceeding 25kW. Where any installed
system exceeds 5,000 square feet or 20% of the net buildable area (i.e.,
the total area of the applicable lot, minus setbacks, vegetated buffers, and
wetlands) it shall be classified as a major system installation.
§ 260-119 CHARTER § 260-120

A. General requirements. In addition to the general purposes and
provisions of these regulations, the Permitting Authority (or
Administrative Officer in the case of an administrative subdivision) shall
make positive findings on each of the standards listed below. These
findings shall become part of the proposed project's record. Any
negative finding relative to any of these standards shall constitute
grounds for denial of the project design by the Permitting Authority or
Administrative Officer.
B. Site design standards.
(1) Purpose. The purpose of good subdivision and site design is to
create an efficient, functional and aesthetically pleasing
development, to minimize adverse impacts, and to ensure that a
project will be an asset to the Town. In this regard, land
development projects and subdivisions shall conform to the
following standards, which are designed to result in a well-planned
community without adding unnecessarily to development costs.
(2) Site analysis. An analysis of the subdivision site and nearby areas
shall be required for all major subdivisions. The scope and content
of the required site analysis shall be discussed during the
preapplication meeting and shall be presented by the subdivider
§ A263-21 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-23
C:764
during the master plan stage of review. A site analysis may also
be required for minor subdivisions if the Permitting Authority finds
that the proposed development may have a negative impact on the
existing natural and built environment or would be inappropriate
for the quality of life of the surrounding neighborhood. The site
analysis shall address in graphic and written form the following
characteristics of the subject parcel and immediate vicinity: site
context/locus, geology and soil; agricultural lands, woodlands;
surface water and wetland features; topography; habitat; ecology;
existing vegetation; structures and road networks; visual features
and past and present use of the site. Historic sites, archaeological
features and cemeteries shall also be identified. Tree groves and
significant specimens shall be identified on the plan of existing
conditions.
(3) Subdivision design standards.
(a) The development design shall be compatible with the East
Greenwich Comprehensive Community Plan and state guide
plan and comprehensive plans for adjacent communities.
(b) Development of the site shall be based on the characteristics of
the site and upon the site capacity analysis. Development shall
be located to preserve and enhance outstanding natural
features of the site, to avoid and buffer sensitive environmental
areas, and to minimize negative impacts and/or alteration of
natural, historic and cultural resources. Subdivision design
should also preserve, to the maximum extent feasible, scenic
values, viewsheds and scenic roadways.
(c) To the greatest extent practical, plans should be consistent
with the reasonable utilization of land. The below-listed land
forms and environmental features shall remain in an
undeveloped or open space status:
[1] Land under water;
[2] Unique and/or fragile areas, including freshwater
wetlands and coastal wetlands as defined in Title 2,
Chapter 1, of the General Laws of Rhode Island;
[3] Lands in the floodplain or flood hazard areas as defined by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management
(RIDEM);
[4] Steep slopes in excess of 15% as measured over a ten-foot
interval;
[5] Habitats of endangered wildlife, as defined by Rhode
Island Department of Environmental Management or
Federal Agencies;

C:765
[6] Historically significant structures and sites, as listed on
federal or state or East Greenwich inventory of historic
places;
[7] Significant archaeological sites as identified by the State
Archeologist; and
[8] Significant trees or stands of trees or rare vegetative
species.
(d) The development shall be designed in a manner to avoid
adverse water impacts, especially in terms of protecting the
Hunt River Aquifer drainage basin, wellhead and aquifer
recharge area; to minimize cut and fill; to avoid unnecessary
impervious cover, to prevent flooding, to provide adequate
access to lots and sites; and to mitigate adverse effects of
shadow, traffic, drainage and utilities on neighboring
properties.
(4) Residential subdivision design standards.
(a) The Permitting Authority, at its discretion, may change street
locations, lot configurations and dimensions, yards and
setbacks. Such design alterations shall be made to achieve
sound design principles, economy in the use of impervious
surfaces and for environmental purposes.
(b) Residential lots shall front on local streets wherever possible.
Lots fronting on state highways should be avoided.
(c) Every lot shall have sufficient access to it for emergency
vehicles. Curb cuts shall be sited to avoid traffic conflicts.
(d) Building envelopes of dwelling units in residential
developments shall take into consideration topography,
building height, orientation, drainage and scenic values.
(e) Lots shall be designed to ensure to the maximum extent
possible that the proposed buildings have adequate privacy
from adjacent streets and uses.
(f) Vegetated buffer areas shall be required, as necessary, to
protect adjacent uses from adverse impacts and to retain the
functional habitat for wildlife by providing food, cover and
nesting areas. The Permitting Authority shall determine the
extent, location and size of such buffers and may designate
such areas as "no-cut" buffers. Augmentation of natural
vegetation to improve buffers may be required as needed and
any supplemental planting shall be with native species.
[Amended 11-6-2013]
[1] Mowing existing Town-approved lawn within such buffers
is permitted as is pruning of existing trees and shrubs.
§ A263-23 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-23
C:766
[a] Pruning shall not involve removal of greater than 20%
of existing limbs in any given year.
[b] Mowing shrub scrub vegetation, marsh vegetation, or
forest understory vegetation is not permitted, and new
areas of lawn cannot be created in the buffer.
[c] Even where locally permitted, alterations to regulated
freshwater or coastal wetlands are not permitted
without prior approval by RIDEM or CRMC, as
required.
[d] Within buffer areas, no tree with a two-inch or greater
caliper may be removed unless it is diseased, dying,
invasive or considered a hazardous or dangerous tree.
Evidence of such disease or hazard may be required
from a licensed arborist or like professional. A
replacement plan shall first be approved by the Zoning
Enforcement Officer (ZEO) prior to removal and
planting, except in case of emergency as addressed
below in Subsection B(4)(f)[2].
[2] When vegetation, including invasive species, is removed in
the buffer, it must be replaced with native species  at
least three feet high for large shrub species and 18 inches
high for small shrubs, and at least a two-inch caliper for
trees.
[a] No more than 25% of trees planted as replacement
shall be of any one species, and replacement trees
must be staked, fertilized, mulched and watered as
necessary to ensure survival.
[b] Dead trees do not require replacement, but any stump
removal area should be stabilized with native ground
cover or other native vegetation.
[c] Removal action made necessary by an emergency,
such as windstorm, flood, freeze, utility damage, or
other like disasters, in order to prevent imminent
injury or damage to persons or property, must be
reported to the ZEO within seven business days of the
action and a replacement plan proposed.
(g) Lots shall conform to the minimum buildable standards
outlined in Appendix B.148
(5) Industrial or commercial subdivision design standards. All
industrial and commercial subdivisions shall be designed according
to the same principles governing the design of residential
148. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Lot Design Standards, is attached to this chapter.
§ A263-23 CHARTER § A263-23
C:767
developments; these being, that buildings shall be located in a
manner that considers topography, avoids environmentally
sensitive areas, with proper drainage facilities and surrounding
land uses considered in siting buildings; sufficient access shall be
provided and adverse impacts mitigated.
(6) Vehicular and pedestrian circulation system design.
(a) The road system shall be designed to allow the safe, efficient
and orderly movement of traffic in an economical and logical
manner that is respective of natural features and topography
and to present an attractive streetscape and viewshed.
(b) For residential subdivisions, the road system shall be designed
to serve neighborhood needs to accommodate service and
public safety vehicles and to discourage use by through traffic.
(c) Pedestrian circulation systems shall be segregated from
conflict with vehicular traffic. Sidewalks and paths shall be
placed per the typical street cross sections, with exceptions
permitted to preserve or enhance natural features. Walks and
paths may be established away from the road system with
permission of the Permitting Authority.
(7) Landscape design principles.
(a) Landscaped entranceways may be provided at subdivision
accesses. The type and amount of landscaping, signage and
other improvements shall be subject to review and approval of
the Permitting Authority. Plans for same shall be submitted at
the preliminary project stage.

C:768
§ A263-24. General provisions: public improvement design
standards.
(9) Building architecture.
(a) The guiding principle of architectural design shall be the
appropriateness of the massing, scale, materials and details of
the building for the proposed use, the site, within the context
of the neighboring properties and the general location, within
the height limitations established by the Zoning Ordinance,
and within the standards of review for buildings within the
Historic District.
(b) The building shall utilize appropriate energy conservation
measures in its design and construction, providing for solar
gain, and allowing for solar access for adjacent properties.

149. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Lot Design Standards, is attached to this chapter.
§ A263-23 CHARTER § A263-24
C:769
(1) Frontage on improved streets. All areas to be subdivided shall have
frontage that meets the minimum requirements of the relevant
zone on an existing improved Town street. If such street frontage is
substandard to the specifications of these regulations or to the
minimum engineering standards, the Permitting Authority may
require the subdivider to improve the part of the street abutting or
leading to the property being subdivided as necessary to ensure for
proper drainage, promote public safety, or avoid adverse
development impacts to the surrounding community.
(2) Street classification. Street design within a proposed subdivision
shall conform to the street classification system discussed below.
Rights-of-way and pavement width, curbing, parking, drainage,
location of utilities, sidewalks, bicycle or walking paths and general
road design standards shall be consistent with street function. All
street classifications shall be established by the Permitting
Authority. Streets shall fall within one of the following major
categories:
(a) Arterial. A major public street that serves as an avenue for the
circulation of traffic into, out of or around the Town and carries
high volumes of traffic. All industrial and major commercial
subdivision streets shall be classified as arterial and conform
to such standards.
(b) Collector. A public street whose principal function is to carry
traffic between local streets and arterial streets but that may
also provide direct access to abutting properties. These streets
provide a balance between land access and mobility.
(c) Local. Public streets whose primary function is to provide
access to abutting properties.
(3) Street rights-of-way specifications. All street rights-of-way and road
construction shall conform to the standards shown and
specifications by type of street as noted and illustrated in Appendix
C of these regulations. Figures I, II and III depict typical cross
sections by street type proposed for acceptance and maintenance
by the Town. Paving specifications for streets shall be in accord
with Town Standards as noted in Appendix C.150
(4) Engineering standards. See Appendix C, Table 1.
(5) Street layout and arrangement. The arrangement of streets shall be
considered in relation to existing Town streets and in relation to
topographic and natural systems. The road system shall be
designed: to allow for safe, efficient and orderly movement of
traffic; to have a simple and logical circulation pattern; to respect
natural features and topography; to improve the visual quality of
the subdivision; to increase privacy and reduce unnecessary noise
150. Editor's Note: Appendix C, Road Design, is attached to this chapter.
§ A263-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-24
C:770
and traffic. Within residential subdivisions, the road system shall
be designed to serve the needs of the neighborhood and not
encourage use by through traffic. However, in major subdivisions,
access shall be designed to avoid street systems which have only
one principal means of egress. In order to provide for alternative
access, at least two vehicular access streets may be required in
major subdivisions when determined by the Permitting Authority to
be feasible and appropriate. Proposed streets in major subdivisions
shall provide for their continuation or projection to intersect with
principal streets on the perimeter of the subdivision or with
adjacent vacant property in order that the streets may be extended
in the future.
(6) Private streets. Private streets shall be prohibited in all singlefamily
residential developments.
(7) Culs-de-sac. All cul-de-sac streets shall end in a permanent
turnaround constructed to the standards listed in Appendix C. Culsde-
sac shall not exceed 1,000 feet in length. Culs-de-sac shall have
a minimum length consisting of the frontage required for the base
zone in which the property lies plus the bulb itself. The "bulb" shall
not provide frontage for more than three lots. This standard may be
waived by the Permitting Authority to promote access to landlocked
parcels, to allow for future connection to the existing road network
in the Town or for other cause.
(8) Street names. An extension of an existing street shall have the
same name as the existing street. Names of new streets shall be
determined by the Town Council. Streets shown for proposed
subdivisions that are not extensions of existing streets shall be
referred to as Street "A," Street "B," etc.
(9) Access to adjoining properties. When it is considered desirable by
the Permitting Authority to provide access to adjoining property,
proposed streets shall be continued and improved to the property
line. Access to adjacent parcels for pedestrian and/or bicycle
circulation or promotion of the Town of East Greenwich Linear Park
System shall be required wherever the Permitting Authority
determines that such connection is in the interest of the
community.
(10) Street signs. Street name and traffic control signs, constructed to
Town of East Greenwich specifications, shall be installed by the
developer at his/her expense.
(11) Streetlighting. In all subdivisions, utilities including provision for
streetlighting shall be installed underground.
(12) Landscaping standards.
(a) Landscaping shall be provided as part of project plan and
design. It shall be conceived in a total pattern throughout the
§ A263-24 CHARTER § A263-24
C:771
site, integrating the various elements of a site design,
preserving and enhancing the particular identity of the site and
creating a pleasing site character. Landscaping and natural
vegetative buffers shall be utilized to separate residential
areas from major roadways, commercial and manufacturing
areas.
(b) Landscaping may include plant materials such as trees, shrubs,
ground covers, grass and flowers; other materials to be used
may include rocks, planted berms, stone walls, paving
materials, planters and signage. Areas which may be required
to provide landscaping or screening shall include, but not be
limited to, the following:
[1] Drainage facilities, such as retention/detention basins or
drainage swales;
[2] Subdivision entranceways;
[3] Open space/natural areas;
[4] Recreational facilities;
[5] Buffers; and
[6] Areas subject to regrading or stabilization for soil erosion
and sediment control purposes.
(c) Landscape plan. A landscape plan prepared by a registered
landscape architect shall be submitted to the Permitting
Authority when it is determined that: a) existing landscaping is
insufficient; b) the site of the proposed subdivision requires
restoration; or c) adding landscaping would enhance the visual
aspect of the area or would preserve existing outstanding
landscape features. If submittal of a landscape plan is
required, the applicant shall be advised of this requirement at
the preliminary review stage of an administrative or minor
subdivision and at the master plan stage of a major subdivision.
The plan shall identify existing and proposed trees, stone walls
and rock outcroppings; signs; proposed grading at two-foot
intervals; lighting and other proposed landscaping elements.
The plan shall indicate the location of all proposed landscaping
and shall include construction details. A planting schedule
shall be included to indicate proposed planting by species, size
at time of planting, and maintenance requirements. Where
existing plantings are to be retained, the plan shall indicate
methods for protecting during construction.
(13) Monuments/bounds. Monuments or bounds (granite or concrete
boundary markers) shall be of the type approved by the Town and
paid for by the developer and placed by a registered land surveyor
as approved by the Permitting Authority. Monuments shall be set
§ A263-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-24
C:772
with the finished grade at the right of-way and may be required to
be raised at other locations.
(14) Sidewalks. Sidewalks may be required to be installed on one or
both sides of all proposed new public streets in subdivisions and in
all multifamily developments. This requirement may be waived for
cul-de-sac streets serving five or fewer lots or dwellings or if the
Permitting Authority determines such waivers appropriate.
Sidewalk construction shall be in conformity with the standards
outlined in Appendix C. The Permitting Authority may require that
sidewalks be connected to existing sidewalks on collector or
arterial roads abutting the subdivision.
(15) Bicycle paths. Bicycle paths shall be incorporated into the
proposed subdivision where necessary to extend an existing bicycle
path, to intersect with proposed state or Town bicycle facilities, or
to connect adjacent subdivisions, schools or recreation areas.
(16) Curbing. Concrete curbing, meeting RIDOT Standard 7.11, or
granite curbing, meeting RIDOT Standard 7.51, shall be installed
on all proposed streets.
(17) Curbing at intersection fillet curves. Precast concrete wheelchair
ramp curbs meeting RIDOT Standard 7.19 shall be installed in
conformity with requirements of the Rhode Island Americans with
Disabilities Act.
C. Easements.
(1) In general. All easements shall be appropriately marked with
monuments.
(2) For watercourses. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream, a stormwater
easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with
the lines of such watercourse shall be provided, together with
access strips; such right-of-way or public utility easement shall be
shown on the drainage plan and on the final plan with proper
bearings and distances indicated.
(3) For sanitary sewers. Easements shall be provided for sanitary
sewers where they are anticipated. The Permitting Authority shall
determine the locations and widths of such easements.
(4) For storm drains and drainage channels. Easements through lots
for drainage channels and storm drains shall be provided.
Whenever possible, they shall be located along lot lines and shall be
at least 20 feet in width. Access easements shall be provided where
such facilities are remote from streets or where conditions exist
that require ramps for maintenance vehicles.
§ A263-24 CHARTER § A263-24
C:773
(5) For street widenings. Where a subdivision abuts an existing
substandard Town street, the Permitting Authority may require the
subdivider to convey land to the Town to enable such street to be
widened.
(6) Frenchtown Brook. Whenever Frenchtown Brook passes through
any subdivision, between Saw Mill Pond on Frenchtown Road and
the East Greenwich/West Greenwich town line, the developer shall
transfer and convey to the Town of East Greenwich a fifty-foot-wide
easement along each side of and abutting the mean high-water
bank of Frenchtown Brook, and such easement shall provide for
public access and use of the land area along said brook and be
described in the easement for passive recreation.
(7) Sight distance easements. Where deemed necessary by the
Permitting Authority to establish adequate sight distances for
vehicular traffic, the dedication of an easement to the Town may be
required which would prohibit the erection or maintenance of any
visual obstruction such as structure, tree, shrub, wall, earthen
embankment or other obstruction.
(8) Bicycle or pedestrian access easements. Bicycle and pedestrian
access shall be provided where required on a separate strip of land
dedicated to the Town or on an easement having a minimum width
of 10 feet to 20 feet, depending upon location.
(9) Other easements. All other required easements shall be of
sufficient width and area to serve their intended purpose.
D. Lot configuration. The Permitting Authority and/or Administrative
Officer shall have the right to reject or require modification to lots
which are shaped or configured in such a manner as to conflict with the
use of the land for the intended purposes. The Permitting Authority or
Administrative Officer may require changes or modification to the
proposed layout as deemed necessary to achieve the purposes of these
regulations (see Appendix B).151
E. Stormwater drainage systems and plans.
(1) Stormwater drainage systems.
(a) All proposed subdivisions shall make adequate provision to
properly contain and handle storm flow generated by the
project. All drainage systems shall be designed in accord with
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management
regulations and to the standards of the Town of East
Greenwich. The drainage system may be comprised of natural
and man-made elements. These may include grass swales,
retention and detention basins, curbs. Applicants are
encouraged to incorporate natural elements into the drainage
151. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Lot Design Standards, is attached to this chapter.
§ A263-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-24
C:774
design wherever possible and feasible. All drainage structures
shall be in conformance with the accepted state RIDOT
standards or Town-approved equals.
(b) Drainage plans and drainage calculations shall be prepared by
a registered professional engineer. The stormwater drainage
calculations, runoff rates and system design shall be based on
the application of the appropriate method, as follows:
[1] The Rational Method. This method is the preferred method
for small systems of three acres or less, where no
wetlands, ponds or other storage depressions are present,
and where drainage is toward the point of analysis.
[2] TR-55. This is the preferred method for calculating runoff
volumes, peak discharge rate, and flood storage
requirements for site development over three acres.
(2) All drainage plans and drainage calculations shall provide the
following information:
(a) An estimate of the quantity of stormwater surface runoff
currently flowing from the land proposed to be subdivided
compared to storm flow which would be generated by the
proposed subdivision. (To be calculated on the basis of a
twenty-five-year frequency rainfall.)
(b) An estimate of the quantity of stormwater surface runoff
entering the subdivision naturally from upstream areas within
the watershed under present conditions calculated on the basis
of a twenty-five-year frequency rainfall.
(c) An analysis of the capability of existing watercourses, catch
basins, culverts and other drainage facilities within the land
proposed to be subdivided to handle the runoff as calculated
above and proposals to handle such surface runoff. Design
criteria for drainage improvements shall conform to the State
of Rhode Island specifications cited above as may be modified
by the Town of East Greenwich Department of Public Works.
Culvert and storm sewers shall be designed for a twenty-fiveyear
frequency rainfall (one-hundred-year frequency in a
special flood hazard zone), with a minimum pipe size of 12
inches so that the minimum velocity shall not be less than three
feet per second calculated for the ten-year design storm.
(d) Proposals for disposal of surface runoff downstream from the
subdivision in a manner that will not damage off-site property,
natural features or existing drainage structures and facilities.
(e) The drainage plan shall further indicate how the following
specific requirements will be met:
§ A263-24 CHARTER § A263-24
C:775
[1] That each lot will be adequately drained;
[2] That natural drainage patterns will be maintained
whenever possible;
[3] That all existing watercourses will be left open, unless
approval to enclose is granted by Rhode Island
Department of Environmental Management and the Town
of East Greenwich;
[4] That all new open watercourses will be properly stabilized
using vegetation or stone, depending on soil conditions
and grades;
[5] That a continuous drainage system will be installed and
connected to a natural or man-made watercourse or to an
existing piped storm drainage system. The ultimate
destination of such continuous drainage shall be a
permanent natural body of water or wetland. Where the
Permitting Authority determines that such ultimate
destination is impractical, the Board shall require the
construction of a retention area capable of accommodating
proposed stormwater volumes based on a one-hundredyear
frequency rainfall;
[6] When any part of the drainage system is sited outside the
public street right-of-way, provisions for future access to
and maintenance of same shall be approved by the Town
Council;
[7] That any necessary easements to off-street watercourses
will be obtained by the subdivider and approved by the
Town Solicitor; and
[8] Where volume velocity of the surface runoff is high, the
flow thereof shall be controlled by riprap, sedimentation
basins, flow spreaders or other applicable devices and/or
techniques as recommended in the Rhode Island Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook.
(f) The proposed drainage system shall be designed to
accommodate stormwater such that post-construction
conditions do not result in peak runoff increases in rate from
preconstruction conditions.
F. Utilities.
(1) Sanitary sewers. Sanitary sewers shall be required in all
subdivisions and land development projects where such sewer
service is available to or may be extended to the site in a costeffective
manner.
§ A263-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-24
C:776
(2) Water service. Water service, where available, shall be provided for
each lot in accordance with the requirements of the Kent County
Water Authority. The Permitting Authority may require the
extension of service to a proposed subdivision when such
extensions are possible and could be extended. Dry capped lines
may be required for developments that may have future access to
service due to capital improvements made by the Kent County
Water Authority.
(3) Gaslines. Natural-gas lines may be installed in any subdivision or
land development project at the discretion of the subdivider. If
proposed, gaslines shall be located on the opposite side of the
street from the waterline or as required by the utility.
(4) Other utilities (electric, telephone and cable TV). All electric,
communication (telephone, fire alarm and cable TV) and
streetlighting lines shall be installed underground. Such utilities
shall be installed to the specifications of the appropriate utility.
(5) Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be installed in all subdivisions
where public water supply systems are installed. Hydrant type,
location and spacing shall meet the minimum requirements of the
East Greenwich Fire Department. Amended 12-9-2015]
G. Erosion and sediment control plan permit(s). A soil erosion and
sedimentation control plan and permit application shall be submitted
for all applications meeting the threshold requirements as listed in
Chapter 207 of the Town of East Greenwich Code. Such plan shall meet
the standards of the Code.
H. Requirements for off-site improvements.
(1) Purpose. This section is intended to ensure that subdividers
provide off-site infrastructure improvements in order to mitigate
the impacts which are directly attributable to the new
development. Such improvements may be required by the
Permitting Authority if the Board finds that there is a reasonable
relationship between the requested improvement and the proposed
new development. Off-site improvements may include but not be
limited to the following categories:
(a) Sanitary sewer systems extension.
(b) Water supply systems extension.
(c) Roads.
(d) Sidewalks.
(e) Bicycle paths and pedestrian improvements.
(f) Drainage systems.
§ A263-24 CHARTER § A263-24
C:777
§ A263-25. General provisions: construction and/or improvement
guarantees.
(g) Public safety improvements.
(2) Definition, criteria and principles. As a condition of final approval,
the Permitting Authority may require a subdivider to construct
such improvements that are reasonable and necessary to mitigate
impacts relating to the land being subdivided. Necessary
improvements are those that directly and substantially relate to the
subdivision or land development being proposed. The Permitting
Authority shall provide in its resolution of final approval a finding
that forms the basis for such off-site improvements. The finding
shall be that a significant adverse impact on existing conditions will
result if the off-site improvements are not constructed. The
mitigation required as a condition of approval must relate to the
significance of the identified impact. Required off-site
improvements must be consistent with the character defined for
the affected neighborhood in the Comprehensive Community Plan
or address a particular situation or problem that is raised and
discussed during the consideration of the project.
A. Definition and purpose.
(1) The purpose of this section is to provide a guarantee to the Town
that the required improvements will be constructed.
(2) An improvement guarantee is a security instrument in a form that
is acceptable to the Town to ensure that all improvements, facilities
or work required as a condition of approval of a subdivision plan
will be completed in conformity with the approved plans and
specifications.
(3) Improvement guarantees shall be provided to ensure the proper
installation and maintenance of required street, utility and other
physical improvements and to ensure compliance with other
conditions of final plat approval.
B. General procedures. Before any land development or subdivision plan is
endorsed by the Permitting Authority, and before the recording of any
subdivision plat, the Permitting Authority shall review and approve
agreements for the completion of all required improvements. Such
agreements shall, at the option of the subdivider, take the form of: 1)
completion of actual construction of all improvements; 2) improvement
guarantees; or 3) a combination thereof. At the preliminary plat review
stage, the subdivider shall submit either of the following: 1) a letter to
the Permitting Authority indicating his/her intent to complete the
required improvements prior to the Permitting Authority's endorsement
of the final plat; or 2) a letter requesting that security sufficient to cover
the cost of required improvements be established by the Board,
§ A263-24 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-25
C:778
(1) If improvements are to be constructed without a financial
guarantee, all work shall be completed prior to endorsement and
recording. Inspections shall be made by the Public Works
Department at all required stages of construction as specified in
§ A263-24 above. Written inspection reports shall be prepared by
the inspector(s) and maintained by the Department of Public
Works. All inspection reports shall be submitted to the
Administrative Officer. An inspection fee equal to 2% of the
estimated cost of construction for all public improvements as
determined by Public Works Director shall be paid to the Finance
Director prior to construction. All construction shall be inspected
and approved by the Public Works Director under the direction of
the Administrative Officer and according to the procedures in
§ A263-24. Upon completion of all required improvements, the
Public Works Director shall notify, in writing to the Administrative
Officer, of such completion, and a copy shall be provided to the
subdivider upon request. The final plat shall be endorsed by the
appropriate Permitting Authority member or Administrative
Officer, and the plat shall be recorded as provided in § A263-40, at
which time the lots within the subdivision may be transferred or
sold. The applicant shall be required to post a bond in the amount
of 10% of the construction estimate prior to acceptance of all
required improvements by the Town. Such bond shall be held by
the Town Finance Director for a period of one year to be released
upon written request of the applicant following final inspection by
Public Works and acceptance of the required improvements by the
Town Council with the approval of the Planning Board.
(2) If improvements are to be guaranteed, the below-listed procedures
shall apply.
C. Procedures for financial guarantees.
(1) Amount. All improvement guarantees shall be of sufficient amount
to insure the actual construction and complete installation of all of
the required improvements and the satisfactory completion of all
conditions of final approval within the time periods required for
completion provided in said approval. The amount shall be based
upon actual cost estimates which would be required for the Town to
complete all improvements. These estimates shall be prepared by
the Department of Public Works and forwarded to the
Administrative Officer. In the event the subdivider disagrees with
the estimated amount, he/she shall have the opportunity to submit
a revised estimate along with supporting justification for the
revisions. The Permitting Authority may set the guarantee in a
reasonable amount in excess of the estimated costs in order to
anticipate for increases in economic or construction costs.
However, the amount of such increase shall not exceed more than
20% over the total estimated cost of improvements. At the
expiration of the final plan approval period, if all required
§ A263-25 CHARTER § A263-25
C:779
improvements are not complete the Permitting Authority Board
shall review the status of improvements and may: a) require the
subdivider to extend the duration of the entire improvement
guarantee; b) reduce the amount of the improvement guarantee
to reflect the estimated costs of completed improvements; or c)
authorize the Administrative Officer to take the steps necessary to
ensure completion of the remaining work by using improvement
guarantee funds. If during the guarantee period the procedures,
implementation measures, methods, materials, and/or schedules of
construction are determined by the Permitting Authority not to
be in compliance with the approved plans, the Town may, after
notification to the developer, authorize the use of improvement
guarantee funds to insure proper compliance.
(2) Required form. The security shall be in the form of a financial
instrument acceptable to the Finance Director and Town Solicitor
and shall enable the Town to gain timely access to the secured
funds when necessary. Performance and maintenance guarantees
may consist of, but not be limited to, the following forms:
(a) Security bond. The subdivider may obtain a security bond from
a surety bonding company authorized to do business in the
State of Rhode Island.
(b) Letter of credit. The subdivider may submit to the Town an
irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or other recognized
institution that names the Town of East Greenwich as loss
payee.
(c) Escrow account. The subdivider may deposit cash, or other
instruments readily convertible into cash at face value, either
with the Town or in escrow with a bank with the Town
controlling access to same.
(3) Releases/reductions. At the expiration of the final plan approval
period, if all required improvements are complete, any
improvement guarantee shall be returned to the subdivider. Partial
releases or reductions in the guarantee amount may also be
authorized at any time prior to the expiration of final approval. A
written request for release or reduction of any improvement
guarantees shall be made to the Administrative Officer. After
inspection of all required improvements, the Administrative Officer
shall recommend that the Town Council: a) authorize the Finance
Director to return all improvement guarantees; b) reduce the
guarantee to reflect the estimated cost of completed
improvements; or c) make no release or reductions.
(4) "As-built" plans.
(a) Within 30 days after the completion of all public
improvements, the developer shall submit final "as-built" plans
§ A263-25 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-25
C:780
(two sets), and an electronic copy thereof in the most current
release of AutoCAD®, which shall contain:
[1] All of the information required on the final plan and
decisions on the proposal;
[2] Exact locations, as installed, of all:
[a] Sidewalks and streets.
[b] Monuments, bounds and other survey marks.
[c] Water, sewer, gas and drainage pipes and easements.
[d] Other underground utilities, if any, and the location of
all aboveground fixtures.
[e] Any other public improvements.
[f] Open space areas, recreation sites or reserved areas.
(b) The cost of preparing the as-built plans required by this section
shall be included in the bond amounts.
(5) Phased subdivisions. For subdivisions which are approved and
constructed in phases, the Permitting Authority shall specify
improvement guarantees related to each particular phase. If any
off-site improvements or other improvements or conditions which
are not directly related to a particular phase are required as a
condition of approval, the Authority shall, in setting the guarantee
amount for each phase, clearly specify when and where guarantees
are to be provided.
(6) Maintenance guarantees. The Permitting Authority may also
require that a maintenance guarantee be provided by the
subdivider for all improvements which are being dedicated to the
Town. The amount of the maintenance guarantee shall be 5% of the
original performance bond or other original guarantee amount.
Absent such a guarantee, 5% of the total estimated cost of all
required improvements shall be required. The initial period for
such maintenance guarantee shall be one year. At the end of the
one-year maintenance period, the Director of Public Works shall
inspect all improvements subject to the guarantee and shall certify
in writing to the Administrative Officer as to their condition. If
found to be unacceptable, the Administrative Officer shall
recommend an extension of the guarantee period to the Finance
Director, and the original funds shall not be returned to the
subdivider. If public improvements are in good condition and have
not been damaged due to the fault of the subdivider, or through
faulty workmanship or design, the maintenance guarantee shall be
returned to the subdivider. In cases where it is determined there
are extenuating circumstances, the maintenance period may be
established for a period longer than one year. The rationale for
§ A263-25 CHARTER § A263-25
C:781
§ A263-26. General provisions: requirements for dedication of
public land, public improvements and fees.
establishing a longer maintenance period and the nature of the
circumstances requiring same shall be made a part of the record.
(7) Acceptance of improvements.
(a) Upon completion of all required improvements, the subdivider
shall convey all public improvements to the Town for
ownership and maintenance. Before conveyance, the applicant
shall first request the Department of Public Works to conduct a
final inspection of all improvements. The Director of Public
Works shall certify to the Administrative Officer, in writing,
that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed.
(b) The applicant shall also request, in writing to the
Administrative Officer, that public improvements, streets, land
easements or other facilities be accepted by the Town.
(c) This request shall contain a description of all facilities to be
accepted and shall be accompanied by an accurate description
of all streets, easements, land or other facilities by metes and
bounds and by reference to the final plat drawing(s) and by a
warranty deed transferring ownership to the Town and
describing any special conditions or other requirements.
(d) Upon certification of completion of all required improvements,
and upon receipt of all required information from the
applicant, the Administrative Officer shall place the request for
acceptance upon the next available agenda of the Town
Council. In such recommendation for acceptance by the Town
Council, the Administrative Officer shall also recommend an
amount for a maintenance bond in accordance with these
regulations and shall recommend to the Town Council that no
public improvements or facilities be accepted for ownership
and maintenance until the maintenance bond has been
submitted as required above.
(e) Upon their acceptance by the Town Council, all improvements
shall be permanently owned and maintained by the Town as
part of the municipal system, and the subdivider shall be no
longer responsible for the repair or maintenance of these
improvements.
(f) Private streets and other private improvements shall not be
conveyed to the Town.
A. Subdivider must provide open space. The Permitting Authority shall
require all land developments and subdivisions subject to the provisions
of these regulations to dedicate a portion of the land being subdivided
§ A263-25 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-26
C:782
for the purpose of providing open space, conservation, park and
recreational facilities to serve present and future residents. The
Permitting Authority may, at its discretion, require the payment of a
fee in lieu of land dedication or a combination of land dedication and
payment of a fee as an alternative to the dedication of land.
B. Relationship to EGORP. The requirement for dedication of land for open
space, conservation, park and recreation facilities shall be based upon
the policies and standards set forth in the East Greenwich Open Space
and Recreation Plan (EGORP) and shall reflect the character defined for
the neighborhood or district in which the subdivision is located. The
land dedication must be suitable for the intended use. Land dedications
proposed for park and recreation land shall be entirely usable land, not
containing any land that is constrained for its intended use for
development. If payments in lieu of land dedication are required, they
shall be kept in a restricted account and shall only be spent for the
intended purpose of providing open space, conservation, park and
recreational facilities.
C. Amount of land to be dedicated. Conveyances of land for recreational
impact shall be in an amount that will be suitable to the intended use of
same. As a general guide, such conveyances shall be minimally at the
ratio of one acre for each 20 lots for all zones requiring minimum lot
sizes of one acre or less or two acres for subdivisions in all other zones.
For subdivision of less than 20 lots, the Permitting Authority
requirements for recreation impact shall be tailored to the
circumstances and location of the proposal. In general, if a parcel that
is suitable and useful for recreational purposes cannot be
accommodated, a fee in lieu of land donation shall be preferred. In
addition the nature, location and amount of land to be conveyed must
be satisfactory to the Permitting Authority and determined appropriate
by the Town Manager for the proposed use.
D. Ownership of land. Land dedications required by this section may be
made by transfer of fee simple ownership to any of the following:
(1) The Town of East Greenwich.
(2) A private homeowners' association.
(3) The East Greenwich Land Trust.
E. Condition of land. The Permitting Authority in requiring the donation of
land for recreational purposes may also require that such land be
cleared and rough-graded by the developer. In addition, the installation
by the developer of signage denoting the intended future use of the land
may be a condition of approval.
F. Fees in lieu of land dedication. Where a fee is required by the
Permitting Authority to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of
such fee shall be based upon the Code of Ordinances Chapter 93,
§ A263-26 CHARTER § A263-26
C:783
§ A263-27. Special provisions: phasing of projects.
Article II, Development Impact Fees. The determination to require a fee
in lieu of land donation shall rest entirely with the Permitting Authority.
A. When a major land development or major subdivision is submitted for
master plan approval, the Permitting Authority shall review the
existence and adequacy of existing and proposed improvements,
services and facilities which may be affected by the proposed
development. If the Permitting Authority determines that such
improvements, services, infrastructure and facilities will not be
adequate to serve the residents of the subdivision or development at
the time of recording of the plat, the Permitting Authority shall have the
authority to establish a rate of development of the entire subdivision by
requiring it to be built in phases and/or placing limits on the issuance of
building permits over a specified time period, thereby relating the rate
of development to the ability of the Town to provide the required
services to the residents of the subdivision or development.
B. For all master plan approval applications, the applicant shall submit a
copy of the master plan narrative report for review and comment to all
relevant Town and other agencies and relevant utilities. Each agency
notified by the applicant shall be requested to provide its comments on
the application by the Administrative Officer. All comments shall be
received from each agency prior to the date of the informational
meeting. If the public informational meeting on the master plan and the
public hearing on the preliminary plan are combined, all comments
from reviewing agencies shall be received prior to the date of the public
hearing.
C. Each department, agency or utility to which such a request for
comments is made shall provide to the Administrative Officer written
comments and any supplementary material requested which describes:
(1) An estimate of the impact of the subdivision on the facilities and/or
services provided by the department or agency;
(2) A determination as to the adequacy of existing facilities and/or
services relative to the anticipated subdivision's residents;
(3) A discussion as to whether plans for the required improvements to
existing facilities and/or services are included in the department or
agency's capital improvement program;
(4) A time line for provision of such improvements to existing facilities
and/or services.
D. Upon consideration of the responses received from the various
departments and agencies, the Permitting Authority shall establish, at
the time of master plan approval, a rate of development of the entire
subdivision or development that will permit residential construction
only when improvements, services and facilities will be adequate to
§ A263-26 EAST GREENWICH CODE § A263-27
C:784
§ A263-28. (Reserved)
§ A263-29. (Reserved)
§ A263-30. Local regulations: procedure for adoption and
amendment.
§ A263-31. Local regulations: public hearing and notice
requirements. [Amended 12-9-2015]
serve the residents of the subdivision or development. As part of such
growth rate plan, the Permitting Authority may require that
improvements be installed or lots sold in two or more phases.
E. If phasing is required, the Permitting Authority shall approve the entire
master plan first. Thereafter, the applicant shall be required to submit
plans for preliminary and/or final review and/or approval indicating the
development of the entire site in two or more phases as required above.
In such review and approval, the Authority may, in its discretion, impose
conditions for determining the physical limits of phases, for allowing
progression to additional phases, for allowing two or more phases to
proceed in review or construction simultaneously, for interim public
improvements or construction conditions, for changes to master or
preliminary plans, and may include other provisions as needed,
including the applicant actually providing the necessary improvements
or payment to a dedicated restricted account in lieu of actual provision.
F. The master plan documents shall contain information on the physical
limits of the phases, the schedule and sequence of public improvement
installation, improvement guarantees, and the work and completion
schedules for approvals and construction of the phases.
G. Vesting of phased projects. The master plan shall remain vested as long
as it can be demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Permitting
Authority, that work is proceeding on either the approval stages or on
the construction of the development as shown in the approved master
plan documents. Vesting shall extend to all information contained in the
approved master plan and related documents.
A. The Permitting Authority, as authorized by the enabling statute and
Town Charter, shall adopt, amend or repeal and provide for the
administration, interpretation, and enforcement of land development
and subdivision review regulations.
A. These regulations shall not be adopted, repealed or amended until after
a public hearing has been held relative to same by the Permitting
Authority. The Authority shall first give notice of the public hearing by
publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the
municipality at least once each week for three successive weeks prior to
the date of the hearing, which may include the week in which the
hearing is to be held. At this hearing, opportunity shall be given to all
§ A263-27 CHARTER § A263-31
C:785
