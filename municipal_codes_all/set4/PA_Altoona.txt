§ 22-1. Abolishment of electrical and engineering civil service
boards.
Any electrical and/or engineering civil service board heretofore created
and/or empanelled is hereby abolished.
§ 22-2. Preservation of rights of certain employees.
Those persons employed in the Electrical and/or Engineering Departments
of the City of Altoona prior to May 19, 2014, shall continue to have all civil
service rights afforded to them as set forth in the Third Class City Code as
amended by Act 22 of 2014. Such rights include the right to a hearing in
the event that such an employee so subject is aggrieved by the suspension,
discharge or discipline imposed by a department director more serious than

§ 22-3. Objective; amendment; severability and restatement/repeal.

service rules to a hearing before the City of Altoona Civil Service Board
for fire and/or police. Although the City of Altoona's Home Rule Charter
shall be in effect for all electrical and/or engineering employees hired after
May 19, 2014, the City of Altoona recognizes the rights of such employees
hired prior to that date under civil service rules. Any prior enactment
which includes any provision similar in nature to this enactment is hereby
amended and restated in its entirety to read as stated in this chapter. Any
other prior enactment or part of any prior enactment conflicting with the
provisions of this chapter is rescinded insofar as the conflict exists. To the
extent that any similar enactment is in force immediately prior to adoption
of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are intended as a continuation
of such prior enactment and not as a new enactment. If this chapter is
declared invalid, any prior enactment for electrical and/or engineering civil
service shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by
adoption of this chapter, and/or this chapter shall be considered to have
been enacted under authority of any other law permitting this chapter to be
valid. If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the similar part of any
prior enactment providing for similar provisions shall remain in effect and
shall not be affected by adoption of this chapter, and/or such part or parts
of this chapter shall be considered to have been enacted under authority
of any other law permitting any such part of this chapter to be valid. The
§ 15-42 ALTOONA CODE § 22-3
C:112
provisions of this chapter shall not affect any act done or liability incurred,
nor shall such provisions affect any suit or prosecution pending or to be
initiated to enforce any right or penalty or to punish offenses under the
authority of any enactment in force prior to adoption of this chapter. Subject
to the foregoing provisions of this section, this chapter shall amend and
restate on the effective date any enactment for electrical and/or engineering
civil service in force immediately prior to the effective date herein.

the "Altoona Paid Firemen's Pension Fund."
B. The Board of Managers may take and receive gifts, grants, devises or
bequests of any monies, real estate, personal property of other valuable
things from whatever source for the purpose of the said fund.

(1) There shall also be paid into this Firemen's Pension Fund an equal
and proportionate monthly charge against each member of the City
of Altoona Fire Department: 5% of the pay of such member. Pay for
purposes of those members hired before January 1, 2014, shall be
base salary, longevity, holiday pay and overtime. Pay for purposes
of those members hired on or after January 1, 2014, shall be base

contributions may be paid or picked up by a reduction in the cash
salary, by an offset against future salary increases or a combination
of both. Affected employees shall not have the option of choosing to
receive the picked up contributions directly in lieu of having them
paid by the employer to the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
contributions so picked up shall continue to be treated as employee
contributions for all purposes of state and local law in the same
manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made
prior to the date of the pick up; including, by way of illustration and
not limitation, being treated as part of the affected employee's
compensation for both Pennsylvania and local income tax laws and
for purposes of computing any benefits under the affected
employee's pension plan.

a sum of money not less than 1/2 of 1% nor more than 3% of all City

extinguish the debt of the City or any part thereof.
E. All assets now or formerly held by the Fire Department Relief

from said organization and received by the Board of Managers hereby
created and shall hereafter be administered by said Board of Managers

to pay the said pensions and service increments in full, together with
refunds.

5651]
(4) All firefighters hired before January 1, 2014, who shall serve for a

furloughed and are recalled to work for the City may, for pension
purposes, restore the break in service by purchasing not more than
24 months of the time lost in the same manner that they would for
restoring a break in service caused by an absence for military duty.
This purchase must be made within 180 days after a recall from

Pension Fund prior to this purchase of furlough time. [Added
3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 5702]

member at the date of retirement. In the case of payment of pensions to
members for permanent injury incurred in commencement of payment
of pension shall be fixed by regulations of the Board. Such regulations
shall not take into consideration the amount and duration of workmen's
compensation allowed by law. Payment to spouses of members retired
on pension or killed in the service on or after January 1, 1960, or who
die in the service on or after January 1, 1968, shall be the amount
payable to the member or which would have been payable had he/
she been retired at the time of his/her death, except that payments

entitled to the pension shall also be entitled to the payment of a
service increment in accordance with the subject to the conditions
hereinafter set forth:
(a) No service increment shall be paid to firefighters hired on or
after January 1, 2014. For firefighters hired prior to January 1,
2014, a service increment shall be paid. The service increment
shall be the sum obtained by computing the number of whole
years after having served 20 years during which a contributor
has been employed by the City and paid out of the City treasury
and multiplying the said number of years so computed by an
amount equal to 1/8 of the retirement allowance which has
become payable to such contributor in accordance with the
provisions of this Act. In computing the service increment, no
employment after the contributor has reached the age of 65
years shall be included and no service increment shall be paid
in excess of $500 per month. Said increments are included in
the COLA calculations to bring the retiree's benefit to the 75%
cap. [Amended 3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 5702]
(b) Each contributor hired before January 1, 2014, shall pay into
the pension fund a monthly sum in addition to his/her pension
contribution, which shall not exceed the sum of $5 per month;
and, provided that such service increment contribution shall
§ 94-4 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-4
C:145
not be paid after the contributor has reached the age of 65
years. [Amended 3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 5702]
(c) Service increment contributions shall be paid at the same time
and in the same manner as pensions and may be withdrawn in
full, without interest, by persons who leave the employment of
the City, subject to the same conditions by which retirement
contributions may be withdrawn, or by persons who retire
before becoming entitled to any service increment.
(d) The said Board of Managers shall have the right, on application
received, to retire on pension any paid fireman accepting the
provisions of this article, if, in its opinion and in the opinion of
two reputable physicians of the City and selected by it, and
who shall make a physical examination and file their opinion in
writing with the Board of Managers (whose fees shall be paid
by the fireman asking to be retired), that such fireman is
physically or mentally incapacitated, through injury received
or disease contracted in the actual performance of duty and by
reason of the performance of such duty and without fault or
misconduct on his/her part, from performing his/her duty in
the City of Altoona Fire Department; provided, however, that
the Board of Managers shall have the authority to order
another examination at the expiration of six months from the
date of retirement and, if the disability of the pensioner shall
be found to have been removed, the said Board of Managers
shall terminate the pension and he/she shall be reinstated as
an active member of the City of Altoona Fire Department.
C. Each contributor, hired on or after January 1, 2014, shall not be entitled
to any service increment and shall not be entitled to any cost of living
adjustment.

firefighter, shall be entitled to a pension of 25% of his annual
compensation. For illness, injuries, or mental capacity not received
in the line of duty after 10 years of service, the compensation shall
be 50% of his annual compensation.
(2) The disability pension shall be payable to the firefighter during his
lifetime and if he/she shall die, the pension payment that he/she
was receiving shall be continued to be paid to his/her spouse if she/
he survives or if she/he subsequently dies, then the child or
children under the age of 19 years or until such children shall have
terminated their status as full-time students, whichever is later.

collective bargaining unit member who retires. Any and all portions of
the service increment earned plus the $100 shall be paid by the pension
fund. This benefit shall not be available to any employee hired on or
after January 1, 2014. [Added 3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 5702]
F. For firefighters hired prior to January 1, 2014, salary computation used
to determine pension benefits shall be base salary, longevity, holiday
pay, and overtime worked by the firefighter. This provision shall not
apply to firefighters hired on or after January 1, 2014. [Added
3-8-2017 by Ord. No. 5702]
A. Effective January 1, 1996, firefighters retiring subsequent to that date
shall receive a cost of living adjustment in and for the first year and
every subsequent January 1 until the initial rate of retirement benefits
reaches 75% of the salary computations used to determine the rate of
monthly benefits. Said cost of living adjustments shall be based on the
existing formula used or the CPI-W National Index measured from
October 1 to October 1 of the previous year, whichever is greater. This
benefit shall not apply to employees hired on or after January 1, 2014.
A. Whenever any person shall become entitled to receive a pension from
the Firemen's Pension Fund and shall have been admitted to participate
therein, he/she shall not thereafter be deprived of his/her right to
participation therein upon the basis upon which he/she first became
entitled thereto, except for one or more of the following causes, that is
to say:
(1) Conviction of a felony or misdemeanor.
(2) Becoming habitual drunkard.
(3) Failing to comply with some general regulation relating to the
management of said fund which may be made by the managers, and
which may provide that a failure to comply therewith shall
terminate the right to participate in the pension fund.
B. A termination of a pension shall be only after such due notice and
hearing as shall be prescribed by regulation of the managers.
A. In any City wherein the members of the Fire Department are members
of a pension fund not established solely for the purpose of pensioning
members of the Fire Department, there shall be transferred from such
other pension fund into the Firemen's Pension Fund required to be
§ 94-4 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-7
C:147
established by this Act, the moneys contributed thereto by members
of the Fire Department who have not been retired, and a just and
equitable proportion of the moneys contributed by the City department.
Such transfers may be made by the transfer of securities. The amounts
to be transferred shall be amicably adjusted by the managers of the
Firemen's Pension Fund and the pension board having the charge of
such other pension fund. In case of disagreement as to the amount so to
be transferred, the disagreement shall be resolved by the City Council,
whose action thereon shall be final.
B. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to relieve any
existing pension fund of its liability to continue the payment of pensions
to retired members of the Fire Department in accordance with the laws
and regulations under which such members were retired.
C. The Board of Managers of the Altoona Paid Firemen's Pension Fund
shall continue to pay any and all pensions and death benefits to those
firemen retired prior to January 1, 1970.
D. Any such City may take, by gift, grant, devise or bequest, any money or
property, real, personal or mixed, in trust for the benefit of such pension
fund and the care, management, investment and disposal of such trust
funds or property shall be vested in such officer or officers of such City,
for the time being, as the said City may designate and such care,
management and disposal shall likewise be directed by ordinance and
the said trust funds shall be governed thereby, subject to such
directions, not inconsistent therewith, as the donors of such funds and
property may prescribe.
E. If for any cause any member of the Fire Department contributing to the
pension fund shall cease to be a member of the Fire Department before
he/she becomes entitled to a pension, the total amount of the
contributions paid into the pension fund by such member shall be
refunded to him in full without interest. If any such members shall have
returned to him the amount contributed, and shall afterward again
become a member of the Fire Department, he/she shall not be entitled
to the pension designated until 20 years after his/her reemployment,
unless he/she shall return to the pension fund the amount withdrawn, in
which event the period of 20 years shall be computed from the time the
member first became a member of the Fire Department, excluding
therefrom any period of time during which the member was not
employed by the Fire Department. In the event of the death of a
member of the Fire Department not in the line of service before the
member becomes entitled to the pension aforesaid and such member is
not survived by a widow or family entitled to payments as hereinbefore
provided, the total amount of contributions paid into the pension fund
by the member shall be paid over to his/her estate.

obtained by the Secretary of the Board immediately upon his/her hiring
with the department.

that this Plan shall meet all the pertinent requirements established for a
governmental plan [as defined in Internal Revenue Code § 414(d)]
under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a), as amended, and the Plan shall
be interpreted, wherever possible, to comply with the terms of said

55.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former § 94-8, Gifts. See now § 94-7D.
§ 94-7 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-8
C:149
E. Limit on accrued benefit.
(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided, this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415 and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If a benefit payable to a
participant under this Plan would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code Section 415, the benefit will be reduced to the maximum
permissible benefit.
(2) Effective date. If there is more than one permitted effective date for
any change, the change shall be effective as of the latest
permissible effective date; however, any adjustment in the dollar
limit under Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), whether required or
permissible, shall take effect automatically as of the earliest
permissible effective date. Effective as of January 1, 2008, the
"applicable mortality table" and "applicable interest rate" are found
in Rev. Rul. 2007-67. The "applicable mortality table" in Rev. Rul.
2001-62 was effective from December 31, 2002, through December
31, 2007.
(3) No reduction in accrued benefits. Notwithstanding the above, no
change in the limits under this article shall reduce the benefit of
any participant.
(4) Multiple plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that are required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code Section 415(b), and
if the aggregated benefits would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code Section 415(b), then benefits shall be reduced first under this
Plan.
(5) Mandatory contributions. Participant contributions are annual
additions, and any benefit attributable to participant contributions
is not included in the benefit subject to the limits of Code Section
415(b). This subsection does not apply to contributions "picked-up"
in accordance with Code Section 414(h).
(6) Permissive service credit. Effective as of January 1, 1998, if a
participant makes a purchase of permissive service credit [within
the meaning of Code Section 415(n)] under the Plan, the benefit
derived from the contributions made to purchase the service credit
shall be treated as part of the benefit subject to the limitations
under this section.
F. Limit on annual additions.
(1) Annual additions. Except as otherwise provided, annual additions
(which include participant contributions) under this Plan shall at all
times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415(c) and the
regulations thereunder, the terms of which are specifically
incorporated herein by reference. If an annual addition would
§ 94-8 ALTOONA CODE § 94-8
C:150
otherwise exceed the limit under Code Section 415(c), the excess
annual addition will be eliminated in accordance with methods
permitted under Rev. Proc. 2008-50 (Rev. Proc. 2006-27 prior to
2009) or its successor.
(2) Multiple plans. If a participant also participates in one or more
other plans that arc required to be aggregated with this Plan for
purposes of determining the limits under Code Section 415(c), and
if the annual additions would otherwise exceed the limit under
Code Section 415(c), annual additions will first be reduced under
the other plan. If there is more than one other plan, annual
additions will first be reduced under the plan with the greatest
amount of annual additions.
(3) Effective date. The limits under which Code Section 415(c) are
adjusted periodically in accordance with changes in the law or costof-
living adjustments without the need for a plan amendment. If
there is more than one permissible effective date for any required
change relating to Code Section 415(c), then the change shall be
effective as of the earliest permissible effective date.
(4) 415(c) compensation. For the purposes of this section,
"compensation" includes only those items specified in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(b)1 or (2) and excludes all items listed in Treas. Reg.
§ 1.415(c)-2(c), the terms of which are specifically incorporated
herein by reference. Effective as of January 1, 2009, to the extent
required by the Heroes Earnings Assistance Tax Relief Tax Act of
2008 (HEART Act),56 differential wage payments shall be included
in compensation.
G. Direct rollovers.
(1) If a participant, a spousal beneficiary, or an alternate payee (who is
a spouse or former spouse of a participant) is entitled (under other
provisions of this Plan) to receive an "eligible rollover distribution"
of at least $200, the distributee may elect that the Plan
Administrator transfer all or part (provided that the part is at least
$500) to any "eligible retirement plan" capable of accepting such a
transfer.
(2) For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions shall
apply:
(a) An "eligible rollover distribution" is any distribution of all or
any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee,
except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: i)
any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal
periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for
the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the
56.Editor's Note: See 26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.
§ 94-8 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-8
C:151
distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period
of 10 years or more; ii) any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); iii) the
portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross
income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net
unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities);
and iv) effective as of January 1, 2002, any hardship
distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2002, clause (iii) does
not apply to any after-tax participant contributions that are
paid to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Code Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a) or 403(a),
or effective as of January 1, 2007, any 403(b) annuity contract
that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred,
including separately accounting for the portion of such
distribution which is includable in gross income and the
portion of such distribution which is not so includable.
(b) An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement
account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual
retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an
annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified
trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the
distributee's eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case
of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving spouse, prior
to January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan was an
individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
Effective as of January 1, 2002, an "eligible retirement plan"
includes an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b)
and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is
maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a
state and which agrees to separately account for amounts
transferred into such plan from this plan. Effective as of
January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA is an "eligible retirement plan."
(c) A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In
addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving
spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or
former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified
domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section
414(p)(11), are distributees with regard to the interest of the
spouse or former spouse.
H. Minimum required distributions. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Plan to the contrary, the distribution of a participant's benefits shall be
made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9).
For purposes of complying with Code Section 401(a)(9), life
expectancies were determined in accordance with the 1987 proposed
§ 94-8 ALTOONA CODE § 94-8
C:152
regulations prior to January 1, 2003, and with the final regulations

§ 94-10. Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP). [Added 3-8-2017
by Ord. No. 570259]
A. Summary of deferred retirement option (DROP). Effective April 1, 2009,
a retirement benefit distribution option is available to members who
qualify and voluntarily elect as provided in the Third Class City Code,60
and the collective bargaining agreement between the City of Altoona
and the Altoona Firefighters Local 299 of the International Association
of Firefighters. This option will be available for eligible bargaining unit
members and shall not affect a member's eligibility for a City pension.
Additionally, participants in the DROP program are considered to be
active firefighters and will continue to be members of the collective
bargaining unit, however, if while in the DROP program, contractual
benefits change which affect retirement, the member already entered
into the DROP will abide by the contract language which was in effect at
the time he/she entered the DROP. Otherwise, participants in the DROP
program are subject to all rights and responsibilities provided by the
collective bargaining agreement until no longer performing the duties
of firefighter and terminate employment with the City of Altoona.
B. Eligibility. A member must be eligible for normal retirement to be
eligible for the DROP. Members eligible to participate in the DROP plan
shall include all members hired subsequent to January 1, 2005, who do
not have the option to buy the postretirement health care coverage
provided by the City with accrued sick leave. Furthermore, any member
hired prior to January 1, 2005, may use his/her accrued sick leave to
purchase either postretirement health care or buy into the DROP, but
not both. In any case, buying into the DROP or postretirement health
care shall mean trading in 87 sick days for the option chosen.
C. Sick leave. Any employee hired before January 1, 2005, must waive the
requirement to be paid for accumulated sick leave, as referenced in
Article X, Section 1(A), in order to participate in the DROP. Firefighters
must have accumulated 87 sick days to participate in the DROP and be
eligible for normal retirement as outlined in Article X, Section 2(A), and
will be paid the value of 20% of all accumulated sick days in excess of
87 up to the maximum number as outlined in Article X, Section 2(G).
For purposes of the DROP, "retirement" as referenced in Article X,
Section 2(G), shall mean termination of service. "Termination of
service" shall mean when the employee is no longer employed as a
firefighter for the City. The above article references in this subsection
are to Article X of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the
City and City firefighters which is effective January 1, 2014.
D. Election to participate.

as prescribed by the Pension Board. Member participating in DROP
must establish a date certain upon which the member shall resign
from service as a City firefighter. This date certain must be prior to
completion of the maximum participation period as set forth below.
As a condition of participation in the DROP program, the individual
member acknowledges that the Union and the City shall have no
responsibility for the financial impact and/or consequences of a
member's participation in DROP, including but not limited to the
investment of the contents of a member's DROP account, the
performance of any such investments, the member decision to
participate in DROP, or any tax consequences flowing from the
DROP participation.
(2) Upon deciding to participate in the DROP, a member must submit,
on forms provided by the City, all of the following: a) a binding
letter of resignation from regular employment with the City which
discloses the member's intent to retire; and b) a written election to
participate in the DROP that details the member's rights and
obligations under the DROP and includes an agreement to forgo:
(a) Active membership in the pension plan.
(b) Any growth in the salary base used for calculating the regular
retirement benefit.
(c) Any additional benefit accrual for retirement purposes.
E. DROP pension payments. Upon entry into the DROP, a member's
pensionable service, as that term is defined and utilized in the collective
bargaining agreement, and the average applicable compensation shall
be frozen and his/her pension and retirement payments shall be
calculated as if he/she actually retired on the date he/she entered the
DROP. The monthly DROP pension payment, plus any applicable COLA,
shall be paid to an individual DROP investment account managed by
Wachovia Securities in its FundSource Program (or comparable
mutually agreed upon program). Wachovia Securities shall maintain the
account, independent of the City of Altoona.
F. Individual DROP investment account.
(1) Each member shall upon electing to enter the DROP meet with a
member of Wachovia Securities to establish a FundSource Account
(or comparable account) and select the investment in his/her
individual investment account from an array of options as offered
by the FundSource Program (or comparable program). The third
party will be the party responsible for all investment options and
recordkeeping of all assets transferred to the member's
FundSource Account (or comparable account) from the pension
fund. All investment and administrative costs incurred with the
third party shall be charged against the individual DROP
investment accounts of the participants.
§ 94-10 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-10
C:157
(2) If at any time Wachovia Securities is no longer able to provide the
individual DROP account satisfactorily as described in this
agreement, the City and Union agree to select a mutually agreed
upon third party to administer the individual DROP accounts.
G. Employee contributions. Upon entry into the DROP, all City and
employee contributions to the Firemen's Pension Fund shall cease, with
no additional cost to the City.
H. Participation period. An eligible member may participate in the DROP
plan for no more 60 months. At any time up to 60 months the member
may terminate his or her employment and enact the payment options
with his or her individual DROP account. Once the maximum
participation has been achieved, the member must terminate
employment and separate from services.
I. Distribution options.
(1) Commensurate with DROP participation, a member shall make an
election, on forms designated by Wachovia Securities and its
FundSource Program, selecting the payout option(s) he/she wishes
at the termination of the DROP period. This election may be
changed at any time prior to termination. The distribution options
are as follows:
(a) A full and lump-sum distribution.
(b) Rollover to another qualified retirement plan (as permitted by
law) or to an IRA.
(c) Purchase of an annuity.
(d) Keep the monies in the individual DROP investment account.
Monies kept in the individual DROP Investment Account may
be withdrawn in any manner desired by the member.
(e) Any other distribution provided by the third party
administrator or any manner permitted by law.
(2) As with the decision to participate in the DROP program, the City
and the Union assume no responsibility for the consequences of the
rollover election made by a participating member, including tax
consequences and issues of the legality of a rollover, of the manner
of distribution which a member selects for the distribution and the
individual DROP participants agree to hold the City and the Union
harmless for any consequences flowing from the member's receipt
of a full or partial distribution of the contents of the member's
DROP account.
J. Beneficiary designation. Commensurate with DROP participation, a
member shall make an election, on forms designated by Wachovia
Securities, designating the beneficiary or beneficiaries he/she wishes to
§ 94-10 ALTOONA CODE § 94-10
C:158
receive the monies in his/her individual DROP investment account in
the event of his/her death before all monies have been distributed.
K. Disability.
(1) A member who becomes permanently disabled during the DROP
period shall be retired from service and, thereafter, shall revert to
his/her normal pension retirement pension. He will directly receive
those pension payments which were being deposited into his/her
DROP investment account. The participant will then have access to
the distribution from his/her DROP investment account.
(2) If a member becomes temporarily disabled during his/her
participation in DROP, the time period while on disability counts
toward the sixty-month participation limit. During such period of
temporary disability, a member shall receive disability pay in the
same amounts as disabled firefighters that are not participating in
DROP. In no event shall a member on temporary disability have the
ability to draw from the DROP account.
(3) However, notwithstanding any other provision in this subsection, if
a member is disabled and has not returned to work as of the date of
his required retirement, then such retirement shall take
precedence over all other provisions herein and said member shall
immediately resign.
L. Cost of management for DROP program. The firefighter, the Union and
the City agree that any cost or fees associated with the management
and/or administration of the DROP accounts shall be paid directly from
the individual DROP account and not by the City.
M. Municipal pension costs. In expressing the normal cost and
administrative expense requirements as a dollar amount under Section
202(b)(2) of Act 205,61 the City shall exclude the compensation of all
DROP participants from the payroll of the active membership of the
pension plan. For purposes of computing and reporting the applicable
number of units under Section 402(e) of Act 205, a DROP participant
shall not be reported to the Auditor General as an active employee.
N. Amendment. Any amendment to the DROP plan shall be consistent with
the provisions covering deferred retirement option plans set forth in
any applicable collective bargaining agreement and shall be binding
upon all future DROP participants and upon all DROP participants who
have balances in their deferred retirement option accounts. The DROP
Plan may only be amended upon a written instrument, not by any oral
agreement or past practice. The firefighters, the Union and the City
recognize the possibility that the General Assembly (Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania) may enact statutes containing definitions and/or
requirements impacting the method and manner by which municipal
DROP plans are maintained. The firefighters, the Union and the City

processes and shall not be seized, taken or subject to detainer or levied
agree to act promptly and in good faith to amend this DROP plan to
ensure compliance with Act 205 and any other applicable law.
O. Interpretation and rights.
(1) The terms of the DROP shall be interpreted under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Participation in the DROP
program does not create any separate entitlement to employment.
In addition, nothing provided hereunder shall be construed as a
change to the parties practice of calculating pensionable
compensation, and except for the ability to establish a DROP
account and participate in the DROP program, nothing herein is
intended to create new pension benefits of any kind which did not
exist as of December 31, 2007.
(2) The establishment of the DROP through collective bargaining and/
or any individual's election to participate in the DROP is not
intended to change any existing procedure or practice between the
Union and the City or individual firefighters and the City and the
current rights and obligations of all parties shall remain
unchanged, except as modified by this agreement for those
individual firefighters who elect to participate in the DROP
program.

create a Paid Firemen's Pension Investment Account.

the amount it may be permitted to pay under the law), for the payment
of all pensions and service increments in full, then said Board may
dispose of and sell such securities as it may hold and use the proceeds
thereof to supply such deficiency.
D. All monies invested for the credit of said account shall be invested in
such investments as are permissible under the Fiduciaries Investment
Act of 1949, being the Act of May 26, 1949, P.L. 1828, as amended.

Subsection A shall be picked up by the employer and shall be
treated as employer contributions pursuant to Code § 414(h)(2).
B. Employer contributions. The actuary, in accordance with the Act, shall
annually determine the minimum municipal obligation of the employer.
The employer shall pay into the Pension Fund, by annual appropriations
or otherwise, the contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum
municipal obligation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
herein shall preclude the employer from contributing an amount in
excess of the minimum municipal obligation.
C. State aid. General municipal pension system state aid received by the
employer in accordance with the Act from the Commonwealth may be
deposited into the pension fund governed by this Plan and shall be used
to reduce the amount of the minimum municipal obligation of the
employer.
D. Gifts. The Council is authorized to take by gift, grant, devise or
otherwise any money or property, real or personal, for the benefit of the
Plan and cause the same to be held as a part of the pension fund. The

vested in the Council or its delegate, the plan administrator, subject to
the direction of the donor and not inconsistent with applicable laws and

assets to be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries, including
payment of any reasonable Plan expenses. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any contributions made by the employer may be returned to
the employer if the contribution was made due to a mistake of fact and

A. Normal retirement. Each participant shall be entitled to a normal
retirement benefit after retirement on or after attainment of normal

(1) Each participant who shall become entitled to a benefit pursuant to
Subsection A hereof shall receive a benefit commencing on the
participant's normal retirement date and paid in the normal form as
provided in § 94-36A hereof. The monthly amount of the normal
retirement benefit shall be equal to 50% of the participant's
average monthly compensation. Such amount shall be reduced by
an amount equal to 40% of the primary insurance amount of social
security paid or payable to the participant. Such reduction shall
commence upon the attainment of the age at which full unreduced
social security benefits are payable to the participant and
determined as of the date employment terminated based only on
the compensation for services rendered in employment and shall
only be redetermined if a decrease in the social security primary
insurance amount shall result in a corresponding decrease in the
amount of the reduction determined herein.
(2) No offset for social security shall apply to the retirement benefit of
employees who become participants on or after January 1, 2005.
C. Elimination of social security reduction.
(1) Each participant of the Plan as of December 31, 2004, who shall
retire on or after December 31, 2004, shall be eligible to eliminate
the social security primary insurance amount reduction applicable
in the case of a benefit payable pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
(2) The Employer, for each participant eligible for such elimination of
Social Security reduction, made a deposit to the Fund in an amount
equal to the difference between 5% of the participant's
compensation from April 1, 1992, through December 15, 2004, and
the actual employee contributions made by the participant during
such period. The employer deposited such amount January 2005.
Such deposit shall not be included in the amount of a participant's
accumulated contributions for purposes of § 94-35B, C or 94-37B.
[Amended 8-8-2018 by Ord. No. 5721]
D. Late retirement. A participant may continue in employment beyond
normal retirement age subject to the employer's rules and regulations
regarding retirement age. If a participant who has met the
requirements of Subsection A of this section continues in employment
beyond normal retirement age, there shall be no retirement benefits
paid until employment has ceased and the participant's retirement
actually commences. The retirement benefit of the participant
described in this subsection shall be calculated in accordance with
§ 94-33 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-33
C:183
Subsection B of this section on the basis of average monthly
compensation and years of credited service as of the participant's
actual retirement date.
E. Application for benefit. A participant must complete and execute an
application for benefit on a form and in the manner prescribed by the
plan administrator and deliver the said application to the plan
administrator at least 30 days prior to the date on which benefit
payments are to commence. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no retirement benefit payments or any other
benefit payments shall be due or payable on or before the first day of
the month coincident with or next following the date that is 30 days
after the date the plan administrator receives the application for
benefit.
F. Limitation of liability. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
employer, the plan administrator, any fiduciary or any agent or
representative of any of the foregoing, to provide any retirement or
other benefit to any participant or beneficiary which cannot be provided
from the assets available in the pension fund, whether such benefits are
in pay status or otherwise payable under the terms of the Plan. The
Council retains the right to amend or terminate this Plan consistent
with applicable law at any time, with or without cause and whether or
not such action directly or indirectly results in the suspension,
reduction or termination of any benefit payable under the Plan or in pay
status, and without liability to any person for any such action.
G. Special provision for restated plans.
(1) The benefit amount of any participant who may have retired prior
to the restatement date shall not be in any way altered by the
provisions of this Plan, except where otherwise expressly indicated
herein, and shall continue to be determined on the basis of the
terms of the Plan in effect on the day preceding the restatement
date.67
H. Maximum benefit limitations. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Plan to the contrary, no benefit provided under this Plan attributable to
contributions of the employer shall exceed, as an annual amount, the
amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted pursuant to
Code Section 415(d), assuming the form of benefit shall be a straight
life annuity (with no ancillary benefits). The limitations described in this
subsection shall be governed by the following conditions and
definitions:
(1) Benefits paid or payable in a form other than a straight life annuity
(with no ancillary benefits) or where the employee contributes to
the Plan or makes rollover contributions shall be adjusted on an

regulations to determine the limitation contained herein;
(2) In the case of a benefit which commences prior to the attainment of
age 62 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on
an actuarially equivalent basis to the amount determined pursuant
to this section commencing at age 62; however, in the case of a
qualified participant (a participant with respect to whom a period
of at least 15 years of service, including applicable military service,
as a full-time employee of a Police or Fire Department is taken into
account in determining the amount of benefit), the limitation
contained herein shall not apply;
(3) In the case of a benefit which commences after attainment of age
65 by the participant, the limitation herein shall be adjusted on an
actuarially equivalent basis in accordance with applicable
regulations to the amount determined commencing at age 65;
(4) Benefits paid to a participant which total less than $10,000 from all
defined benefit plans maintained by the employer expressed as an
annual benefit shall be deemed not to exceed the limitation of this
section, provided that the employer has not at any time maintained
a defined contribution plan in which the participant has
participated; however, in the case of a participant who is not
receiving a disability retirement benefit pursuant to § 94-34, with
fewer than 10 years of participation the limitation expressed in this
Subsection H(4) shall be reduced by 1/10 for each year of
participation less than 10 but in no event shall this limitation be
less than $1,000;
(5) The limitations expressed herein shall be based upon plan years for
calculation purposes, shall be applied to all defined benefit plans
maintained by the employer as one defined benefit plan and to all
defined contribution plans maintained by the employer as one
defined contribution plan, and shall be applied and interpreted
consistent with Code Section 415 and regulations thereunder as
applicable to government plans in general and this Plan in
particular; and
(6) In the case of a disability retirement benefit under § 94-34, the
adjustment under Subsection H(2) hereof shall not apply and the
applicable limitation shall be the limitation contained herein
without regard to the age of the benefit recipient.

Treasury Regulation 1.415(b)-1(b)(2)(iii) shall apply; and [Added

anything contained in Subsection H to the contrary, the limitations,
adjustments, and other requirements prescribed in Subsection H
shall at all times comply with the provisions of Code Section 415
and the Regulations thereunder (as such apply to governmental
plans), the terms of which are specifically incorporated herein by
reference. [Added 8-8-2018 by Ord. No. 5721]
A. Disability retirement. A participant who has completed at least 10 years
of credited service and who incurs a total and permanent disability
before attaining normal retirement age shall be entitled to a disability
retirement benefit determined as of the disability retirement date.
B. Disability retirement benefit. A participant who shall be entitled to a
disability retirement benefit under Subsection A of this section shall
receive a benefit equal to 50% of the average monthly compensation
with no offset for social security.
C. Payment of disability benefit. Payment of a disability retirement benefit
shall be made in the normal form under § 94-36A commencing on the
participant's disability retirement date and ending on the earlier of the
date of death of the participant or the date that the participant's total
and permanent disability shall cease. If the participant's total and
permanent disability shall cease prior to the attainment of the
participant's normal retirement age, the participant shall be deemed to
have terminated employment as of the disability retirement date for
purposes of this Plan unless the participant shall resume active
employment within three months following the date on which such total
and permanent disability ceased. A participant who fails to resume
active employment after total and permanent disability ceases shall not
be entitled to a distribution of accumulated contributions pursuant to
§ 94-37B to the extent that the total amount of disability retirement
benefits paid exceeds the value of the participant's accumulated
contributions as of the disability retirement date, and shall not be
entitled to any other benefits under the Plan as a result of the
accumulation of any years of credited service as of the disability
retirement date.
D. Verification of disability. The plan administrator shall determine
whether a participant shall have incurred a total and permanent
§ 94-33 ALTOONA CODE § 94-34

§ 94-35. Death benefits.
§ 94-36. Payment of benefits.
disability. Proof of total and permanent disability shall consist of the
sworn statement of three practicing physicians designated by the plan
administrator that the participant has incurred a total and permanent
disability. If the plan administrator shall determine that a participant
who is totally and permanently disabled has recovered sufficiently to
resume active employment or if a participant refuses to undergo a
medical examination as directed by the plan administrator (such a
medical examination may not be required more frequently than once
in any given twelve-month period), the payment of disability retirement
benefits shall cease.
E. Cessation of disability. A participant who is receiving payment of
disability retirement benefits under this Plan must notify the plan
administrator of any change in condition which may cause the
participant's entitlement to receipt of such benefits to cease. If a
participant fails to provide immediate notice to the plan administrator
of any such change in status and thereby continues to receive payment
of benefits hereunder to which the participant is not entitled, the plan
administrator may take whatever action is necessary and permitted
under applicable law to recover any amount of improper payments,
including offsetting such amounts against any future payment of
retirement or other benefits under the Plan or legal action. The plan
administrator may also recover the costs of any such action.
A. Death of participant. Upon the occurrence of the death of a participant,
there shall be benefits payable in accord with the following subsections
of this section.
B. Death prior to retirement. If a participant shall die prior to the
commencement of the payment of any retirement or other benefits
under this Plan, the beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a
distribution of the participant's accumulated contributions determined
as of the date of death of the participant.
C. Death after retirement. Except to the extent that § 94-36B is applicable,
if a participant shall die after the payment of any retirement or other
benefits under this Plan have commenced, there shall be no entitlement
to any additional payments hereunder and all obligation to the
participant, the participant's beneficiary, or any other party claiming
any right, title or interest by way of the participant's participation
herein shall cease. However, in the event that the total amount of the
benefits paid to the participant is less than the participant's
accumulated contributions, the balance of the participant's
accumulated contributions shall be paid to the participant's beneficiary.
A. Normal form. The normal form for payment of retirement benefits shall
be an annuity for the life of the participant paid in monthly installments.
§ 94-34 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-36
C:187
B. Optional form.
(1) Each participant who was first employed as an employee in
employment prior to April 1, 1992, may elect to receive payment in
the form of a joint and survivor annuity in lieu of payment in the
normal form under Subsection A of this section. The joint and
survivor annuity shall be a reduced amount which is the actuarial
equivalent of the normal form and shall be a monthly annuity for
the life of the participant until the death of the participant and
thereafter shall be paid to the beneficiary, if then surviving, in an
amount equal to 50% of the amount paid to the participant (prior to
any reduction for social security benefits) and payable for the life of
the beneficiary. If the beneficiary dies prior to the death of the
participant, there shall be no payments due after the death of the
participant shall occur.
(2) A participant who is eligible to elect the joint and survivor annuity
described above may select this optional form as early as, but no
earlier than, the date of retirement by notifying the Pension Board
in writing of such election.
C. Commencement of benefits. A participant may make an election to
commence receiving distribution of retirement benefits as of the
participant's normal retirement date or other such date as provided for
and elected by the participant pursuant to § 94-37C, whichever is
applicable, or may defer such payments to a date not later than the
required date for commencement of benefits determined under
Subsection D of this section.
D. Required distributions.
(1) Distribution prior to death.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the entire
benefit of any participant who becomes entitled to benefits
prior to death, other than a refund of accumulated
contributions, shall be distributed either:
[1] Not later than the required beginning date, or
[2] Over a period beginning not later than the required
beginning date and extending over the life of such
participant or over the lives of such participant and a
designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending
beyond the life expectancy of such participant, or the joint
life expectancies of such participant and a designated
beneficiary).
(b) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
prior to the date when the entire interest has been distributed
after distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with
Subsection D(1)(a)[2] above, the remaining portion of such
§ 94-36 ALTOONA CODE § 94-36
C:188
benefit shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the
method of distribution being used under Subsection D(1)(a)[2]
as of the date of death.
(2) If a participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan dies
before distribution of the benefit has begun, the entire interest of
such employee shall be distributed within five years of the death of
such employee, unless the following sentence is applicable. If any
portion of the employee's interest is payable to (or for the benefit
of) a designated beneficiary, such portion shall be distributed over
the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not
extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary), and such
distributions begin not later than one year after the date of the
employee's death or such later date as provided by regulations
issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, then for purposes of the
five-year rule set forth in the preceding sentence, the benefit
payable to the beneficiary shall be treated as distributed on the
date on which such distributions begin. Provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the designated
beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the participant, then the date
on which distributions are required to begin shall not be earlier
than the date upon which the employee would have attained age
70 1/2 and, further provided, if the surviving spouse dies before the
distributions to such spouse begin, this subsection shall be applied
as if the surviving spouse were the employee.
(3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions and
procedures shall apply:
(a) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall
have the meanings indicated:

(1) Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that
would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a
distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover
distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by
the distributee in a direct rollover.
(2) This Subsection E(2) shall apply to distributions made on or after
January 1, 2006. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under
this section, if a distribution in excess of $1,000 is made and the
distributee does not make an election under Subsection (a)68 and
does not elect to receive the distribution directly, the plan
administrator shall make such transfer to an individual retirement
plan of a designated trustee or issuer pursuant to authority and
duties of the plan administrator section of the Plan. The plan
administrator shall notify the distributee in writing, within a
reasonable period of time and as otherwise prescribed by law, that
the distribution may be transferred to another individual
retirement plan.
(3) For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
DIRECT ROLLOVER  A payment by the Plan to the eligible
retirement plan specified by the distributee or the plan
administrator, if the distributee does not make an election.
DISTRIBUTEE  Includes a participant or former participant. In
addition, the participant's or former participant's surviving spouse
and the participant's or former participant's spouse or former
spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic
relations order, as defined in Code section 414(p) are distributees
with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
ELIGIBLE RETIREMENT PLAN  A qualified trust described in
Code section 401(a), an individual retirement account described
in Code section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described
in Code section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code section
403(a), an annuity contract described in Code section 403(b), an
eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained

§ 94-36 ALTOONA CODE § 94-36
C:190
by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into
such plan from this plan.
ELIGIBLE ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTION 
Any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of
a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies)
of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution
to the extent such distribution is required under Code section
401(a)(9); and the portion of any distribution that is not
includable in gross income (determined without regard to the
exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to
employer securities).
(a)
For purposes of the direct rollover provisions in this section
of the Plan, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be
an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion
consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not
includable in gross income. However, such portion may be paid
only to an individual retirement account or annuity described
in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the
Code [effective for distributions on or after January 1, 2007,
any qualified trust or Code Section 403(b) plan] that agrees
to separately account for amounts so transferred, including
separately accounting for the portion of such distribution
which is includable in gross income and the portion of such
distribution which is not so includable.
(b)
F. Small amounts. If the plan administrator determines that the amount of
a participant's accrued benefit is so small as to make pension payments
in the normal form administratively impractical, the plan administrator
may cause such payments to be made at such other periodic intervals as
are administratively practical, but no less frequently than annually, to
the extent permitted under applicable law.
G. Nonduplication of benefit. To avoid any duplication of benefits, a
participant who is receiving a retirement benefit under this Plan and
who shall resume employment shall have benefit payments suspended
until the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
date such employment shall cease. Upon resumption of benefit
payments, such participant shall receive the greater of the amount of
the suspended benefit or the amount of benefit based upon average
§ 94-36 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-36
C:191
§ 94-37. Termination of employment.
monthly compensation and years of credited service as of the date that
such period of resumed employment shall cease.
H. Personal right of participant. The right to receive any benefits under
this Plan is a personal right of the participant and shall expire upon the
death of the participant. No heir, legatee, devisee, beneficiary, assignee
or other person claiming by or through a participant shall have any
interest in any benefits hereunder unless clearly and expressly so
provided by the terms of this Plan. A participant's election, failure to
make an election or revocation of an election hereunder shall be final
and binding on all persons.
I. Assignment. The pension benefit payments prescribed herein shall not
be subject to attachment, execution, levy, garnishment or other legal
process and shall be payable only to the participant or designated
beneficiary and shall not be subject to assignment or transfer unless the
subject of a domestic relations order, mandated by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that clearly provides for proper distribution of a portion of
the pension benefit payments to an alternate payee (former spouse of
the participant) and does not require any benefit to be paid in excess of
the available earned and accrued under the Plan.
A. Rights of terminated employees. A participant who shall cease to be an
employee except as otherwise hereinbefore provided shall have all
interest and rights under this Plan limited to those contained in the
following subsections of this section.
B. Distribution of accumulated contributions. A participant whose
employment with the employer shall terminate for any reason other
than death or total and permanent disability prior to attainment of
normal retirement age shall be entitled to receive a distribution of
accumulated contributions. Upon receipt of such accumulated
contributions, said participant and beneficiary shall not be entitled to
any further payments from the Plan.
C. Deferred retirement benefit.
(1) A participant who shall have completed 20 years of credited service
and who shall be dismissed, voluntarily retired, or otherwise
deprived of active employment, other than due to death or total and
permanent disability, prior to attainment of normal retirement age
shall be entitled to elect to receive a deferred retirement benefit in
lieu of a distribution of accumulated contributions under
Subsection B of this section. If such an election is made, the
participant must continue to pay contributions into the pension
fund on a monthly basis equal to the monthly amount paid during
the last full month of employment with such contributions to
continue until the participant attains 60 years of age. Such
deferred retirement benefit shall be equal to the benefit
§ 94-36 ALTOONA CODE § 94-37
C:192
§ 94-38. Administration.
determined pursuant to § 94-33B hereof and shall commence after
application pursuant to § 94-33B, upon attainment of age 60.
(2) A participant who shall have completed at least 12 years of credited
service and whose employment with the employer shall terminate
for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability
prior to attainment of normal retirement age shall be entitled to
elect to receive a deferred retirement benefit in lieu of a
distribution of accumulated contributions under Subsection B of
this section. Such a deferred retirement benefit shall be in an
amount equal to the accrued benefit determined as of the
participant's date of termination of employment, and shall
commence on or after the date which would have been the
participant's normal retirement date and after application for the
benefit has been made under § 94-33E hereof.
D. Forfeiture. Rights under this Plan shall be subject to forfeiture pursuant
to the act of July 8, 1978 (P.L. 752, No. 140), known as the "Public
Employee Pension Forfeiture Act."69
A. Plan administrator. The Pension Plan Board shall be the plan
administrator and shall have the power and authority to do all acts and
to execute, acknowledge and deliver all instruments necessary to
implement and effectuate the purpose of this Plan. The plan
administrator may delegate authority to act on its behalf to any persons

Council shall be the plan administrator.
B. Pension Plan Board.
(1) The Pension Plan Board shall consist of the Mayor, Director of
Finance, the City Controller and two employees chosen by

to the Mayor hereunder. The two participants chosen hereunder
shall include one union employee and one nonunion employee.
Each member of the Pension Plan Board shall serve in that capacity

prior to the date of resignation. Any vacancy on the Pension Plan
Board shall be filled in accord with the provisions governing initial
appointment as a member of the Pension Plan Board.

under the Plan.
C. Authority and duties of the plan administrator.
(1) The plan administrator shall have full power and authority to do
whatever shall, in its judgment, be reasonably necessary for the
proper administration and operation of the Plan. The interpretation
or construction placed upon any term or provision of the Plan by
the plan administrator or any action of the plan administrator taken
in good faith shall be final and conclusive upon all parties hereto,

Ord. No. 5721]
(2) The plan administrator in its capacity as plan administrator shall

of administering the Plan, may be paid from the pension fund upon
approval by the Council to the extent permitted under applicable law
and not otherwise paid by the employer.
E. Hold harmless. No member of the Council nor the plan administrator
nor any other person involved in the administration of the Plan shall be
liable to any person on account of any act or failure to act which is
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith in performing their respective
duties under the terms of this Plan. To the extent permitted by law, the
employer shall, and hereby does agree to, indemnify and hold harmless
the plan administrator and each successor and each of any such
individual's heirs, executors and administrators, and the plan
administrator's delegates and appointees (other than any person, bank,
firm or corporation which is independent of the employer and which
renders services to the Plan for a fee) from any and all liability and
expenses, including counsel fees, reasonably incurred in any action,
suit or proceeding to which he/she is or may be made a party by reason
of being or having been the plan administrator or a delegate or
§ 94-38 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-38
C:195
appointee of the plan administrator except in matters involving criminal
liability, intentional or willful misconduct. If the employer purchases
insurance to cover claims of a nature described above, then there shall
be no right of indemnification except to the extent of any deductible
amount under the insurance coverage or to the extent of the amount
the claims exceed the insured amount.
F. Approval of benefits. The plan administrator shall review and approve
or deny any application for retirement benefits within 30 days following
receipt thereof or within such longer time as may be necessary under
the circumstances. Any denial of an application for retirement benefits
shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for such denial.
G. Appeal procedure. Any person whose application for retirement
benefits is denied, who questions the amount of benefit paid, who
believes a benefit should have commenced which did not so commence
or who has some other claim arising under the Plan ("claimant"), shall
first seek a resolution of such claim under the procedure hereinafter set
forth.
(1) Any claimant shall file a notice of the claim with the plan
administrator which shall fully describe the nature of the claim.
The plan administrator shall review the claim and make an initial
determination approving or denying the claim.
(2) If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the plan administrator
shall, within 90 days (or such other period as may be established by
applicable law) from the time the application is received, mail
notice of such denial to the claimant. Such ninety-day period may
be extended by the plan administrator if special circumstances so
require for up to 90 additional days by the plan administrator's
delivering notice of such extension to the claimant within the first
ninety-day period. Any notice hereunder shall be written in a
manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and, if a notice
of denial, shall set forth:
(a) The specific Plan provisions on which the denial is based;
(b) An explanation of additional material or information, if any
necessary to perfect such claim and a statement of why such
material or information is necessary; and
(c) An explanation of the review procedure.
(3) Upon receipt of notice denying the claim, the claimant shall have
the right to request a full and fair review by the Council of the
initial determination. Such request for review must be made by
notice to the Council within 60 days of receipt of such notice of
denial. During such review, the claimant or a duly authorized
representative shall have the right to review any pertinent
documents and to submit any issues or comments in writing. The
Council shall, within 60 days after receipt of the notice requesting
§ 94-38 ALTOONA CODE § 94-38
C:196
§ 94-39. Pension fund.
such review, (or in special circumstances, such as where the
Council in its sole discretion holds a hearing, within 120 days of
receipt of such notice), submit its decision in writing to the person
or persons whose claim has been denied. The decision shall be
final, conclusive and binding on all parties, shall be written in
a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant and shall
contain specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on
which the decision is based.
(4) Any notice of a claim questioning the amount of a benefit in pay
status shall be filed within 90 days following the date of the first
payment which would be adjusted if the claim is granted unless the
plan administrator allows a later filing for good cause shown.
(5) A claimant who does not submit a notice of a claim or a notice
requesting a review of a denial of a claim within the time
limitations specified above shall be deemed to have waived such
claim or right to review.
(6) Nothing contained herein is intended to abridge any right of a
claimant to appeal any final decision hereunder to a court of
competent jurisdiction under 2 Pa.C.S.A. § 752. No decision
hereunder is a final decision from which such an appeal may be
taken until the entire appeal procedure of Subsection G of this
section has been exhausted.
A. Operation of the pension fund.
(1) The Council of the City of Altoona is hereby authorized to hold and
supervise the investment of the assets of the pension fund, subject

C:197
thereof. The pension fund shall be held, managed, and
administered pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the employer has

investment manager however, appoint a trustee, custodian and/or
investment manager.
B. Powers and duties of employer. With respect to the pension fund, the
employer shall be responsible for the following and shall hereby

of the powers, rights, and privileges conferred upon trustees by the
Pennsylvania Fiduciaries Investment Act, or as the same may be
subsequently modified or amended, and the power to do all acts,
take all proceedings and execute all rights and privileges, although
not specifically mentioned herein, as the employer may deem
necessary to administer the pension fund.

commingled basis with the assets of other pension plans
maintained by the employer, provided that the assets of each
respective plan shall be accounted for and administered separately.
(10) To invest the assets of the pension fund in any collective
commingled trust fund maintained by a bank or trust company,
including any bank or trust company which may act as a trustee
hereunder. In this connection, the commingling of the assets of this
Plan with assets of other eligible, participating plans through such
a medium is hereby specifically authorized. Any assets of the Plan
which may be so added to such collective trusts shall be subject to
all of the provisions of the applicable declaration of trust, as
amended from time to time, which declaration, if required by its
terms or by applicable law, is hereby adopted as part of the Plan, to
the extent of the participation in such collective or commingled
trust fund by the Plan.
(11) To make any payment or distribution required or advisable to carry
out the provisions of the Plan, provided that if a trustee is
appointed by the employer, such trustee shall make such
distribution only at the direction of the employer.
(12) To compromise, contest, arbitrate, enforce or abandon claims and
demands with respect to the Plan.
(13) To retain any funds or property subject to any dispute without

any taxes which may be imposed thereon, whether with respect to
the income, property or transfer thereof, or upon or with respect to
the interest of any person therein, which the fund is required to
pay; to contest, in its discretion, the validity or amount of any tax,
assessment, claim or demand which may be levied or made against

C:199
assistance, as it deems necessary or desirable in connection with
the management of the fund; to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, the employer shall be entitled to rely conclusively
upon and shall be fully protected in any action or omission taken by
it in good faith reliance upon, the advice or opinion of such persons
or firms, provided such persons or firms were prudently chosen by
the employer, taking into account the interests of the participants
and beneficiaries and with due regard to the ability of the persons
or firms to perform their assigned functions.
(16) To retain the services of one or more persons or firms for the
management of (including the power to acquire and dispose of) all
or any part of the fund assets, provided that each of such persons
or firms is registered as an investment advisor under the
Investment Advisors Act of 1940, is a bank (as defined in that Act),
or is an insurance company qualified to manage, acquire or dispose
of pension trust assets under the laws of more than one state; in
such event, the employer shall follow the directions of such
investment manager or managers with respect to the acquisition
and disposition of fund assets, but shall not be liable for the acts or
omissions of such investment manager or managers, nor shall it be
under any obligation to review or otherwise manage any fund
assets which are subject to the management of such Investment
manager or managers. If the employer appoints a trustee, the
trustee shall not be permitted to retain such an investment
manager except with the express written consent of the employer.
C. Common investments. The employer shall not be required to make
separate investments for individual participants or to maintain separate
investments for each participant's account, but may invest
contributions and any profits or gains therefrom in common
investments.
D. Compensation and expenses of appointed trustee. If a trustee is
appointed, the trustee shall be entitled to such reasonable
compensation as shall from time to time be agreed upon by the
employer and the trustee, unless such compensation is prohibited by
law. Such compensation, and all expenses reasonably incurred by the
trustee in carrying out his/her functions, shall constitute a charge upon
the employer or the pension fund, which may be executed at any time
after 30 days written notice to the employer. The employer shall be
under no obligation to pay such costs and expenses, and, in the event of
its failure to do so, the trustee shall be entitled to pay the same, or to
reimburse themselves for the payment thereof, from the pension fund.
E. Periodic accounting. If a trustee is appointed, the pension fund shall be
evaluated annually, or at more frequent intervals, by the trustee and a
written accounting rendered as of each fiscal year end of the fund, and
as of the effective date of any removal or resignation of the trustee, and
such additional dates as requested by the employer, showing the
condition of the fund and all receipts, disbursements and other

transactions effected by the trustee during the period covered by the
accounting, based on fair market values prevailing as of such date.
F. Value of the pension fund. All determinations as to the value of the
assets of the pension fund, and as to the amount of the liabilities
thereof, shall be made by the employer or its appointed trustee, whose
decisions shall be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto,
the participants and beneficiaries and their estates. In making any such
determination, the employer or trustee shall be entitled to seek and rely
upon the opinion of or any information furnished by brokers, appraisers
and other experts, and shall also be entitled to rely upon reports as to
sales and quotations, both on security exchanges and otherwise as
contained in newspapers and in financial publications.
A. Amendment of the Plan. The employer may amend this Plan at any time
or from time to time by an instrument in writing executed in the name
of the employer under its Municipal Seal by officers duly authorized to
execute such instrument and delivered to the Council; provided,
however:
(1) That no amendment shall deprive any participant or any
beneficiary of a deceased participant of any of the benefits to which
each is entitled under this Plan with respect to contributions
previously made;
(2) That no amendment shall provide for the use of funds or assets held
under this Plan other than for the benefit of employees and no
funds contributed to this Plan or assets of this Plan shall, except as
provided in Subsection E of this section, ever revert to or be used
or enjoyed by the employer; and
(3) That no amendment to the Plan which provides for a benefit
modification shall be made unless the cost estimate described in
§ 94-41C has been prepared and presented to the Council in
accordance with the Act.
B. Termination of the Plan. The employer shall have the power to
terminate this Plan in its entirety at any time by an instrument in
writing executed in the name of the employer.
C. Automatic termination of contributions. Subject to the provisions of the
applicable law governing financially distressed municipalities, the
liability of the employer to make contributions to the pension fund shall
automatically terminate upon liquidation or dissolution of the employer,
upon its adjudication as a bankrupt or upon the making of a general
assignment for the benefit of its creditors.
D. Distribution upon termination.
§ 94-39 HOME RULE CHARTER § 94-40
C:201
§ 94-41. Funding standard requirements.
(1) In the event of the termination of the Plan, all amounts of vested
benefits accrued by the affected participants as of the date of such
termination, to the extent funded on such date, shall be
nonforfeitable hereunder. In the event of termination of the Plan,
the employer shall direct either:
(a) That the plan administrator continue to hold the vested
accrued benefits of participants in the pension fund in
accordance with the provisions of the Plan (other than those
provisions related to forfeitures) without regard to such
termination until all funds have been distributed in accordance
with the provisions; or
(b) That the plan administrator immediately distribute to each
participant an amount equal to the vested accrued benefit to

actuary, which estimate shall disclose to the Council the impact of the
proposed benefit plan modification on the future financial requirements
of the Plan and the future minimum municipal obligation of the
employer with respect to the Plan.
A. Employment rights. Participation in this Plan shall not give any right to
any employee to be retained in the employ of the employer nor shall it
interfere with the right of the employer to discharge any employee and
to deal with such employee without regard to the effect that such
treatment might have upon participation in this Plan.
B. Meaning of certain words. As used herein the masculine gender shall
include the feminine gender and the singular shall include the plural in

articles and sections are inserted only for convenience of reference and

to the plan administrator (and where applicable, the trustee)
information in the employer's possession as the plan administrator and
the trustee shall require from time to time to perform their duties under
the Plan.
D. Incapacity of participant. If any participant shall be physically or
mentally incapable of receiving or acknowledging receipt of any
payment of pension benefits hereunder, the plan administrator, upon
the receipt of satisfactory evidence that such participant is so
incapacitated and that another person or institution is maintaining the
participant and that no guardian or committee has been appointed for
the participant, may provide for such payment of pension benefits
hereunder to such person or institution so maintaining the participant,
and any such payments so made shall be deemed for every purpose to
have been made to such participant.

or agreements, now contracted or which may hereafter be contracted,
and from all claims and liabilities now or hereafter incurred by any
participant or beneficiary.
F. Benefits for a deceased participant. If any benefit shall be payable
under the Plan to or on behalf of a participant who has died, if the Plan
provides that the payment of such benefits shall be made to the
participant's estate, and if no administration of such participant's estate
is pending in the court of proper jurisdiction, then the plan
administrator, at its sole option, may pay such benefits to the surviving
spouse of such deceased participant, or, if there be no such surviving
§ 94-41 ALTOONA CODE § 94-42
C:204
spouse, to such participant's then living issue, per stirpes; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the plan
administrator from insisting upon the commencement of estate
administration proceedings and the delivery of any such benefits to a
duly appointed executor or administrator.
G. Assets in pension fund. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
give any participant or beneficiary any interest in any specific property
of the pension fund or any right except to receive such distributions as
are expressly provided for under the Plan.
H. Personal liability. Subject to the provisions of the Act and unless
otherwise specifically required by other applicable laws, no past,
present or future officer or agent of the employer or plan administrator

(4) Background investigation. Prior to being considered for
appointment on the certified list of three the applicant will undergo
a complete background investigation, as outlined in § 105-23.
Although a requirement, only a sufficient number of top scoring
candidates necessary for consideration, as determined by the Civil
Service Board, will need to have a background investigation

(5) Computer voice stress analyzer. All candidates who undergo a
background investigation will also be required to submit to a

passed the final exam must submit to a strength and agility fitness
examination which shall be the same test and the Board shall
require that applicants meet or surpass the same minimum passing
threshold as that required for graduation from a Pennsylvania
police academy, as such requirements may be revised from time to
time by the MPOETC. Specifically, MPOETC currently requires
each applicant to achieve a 50th percentile (Cooper standards) in
each listed event of the final physical fitness test. The final physical
fitness test includes: one minute sit-up followed by at least five

C:220
§ 105-23. Eligibility list and background investigation.

continue in the application process. Applicants scoring less than 70%
shall be rejected. Within 30 days after the administration of the written
examination, all applicants shall be given written notice of their test
results and passing applicants shall be scheduled for an oral
examination appointment.
D. Oral examination. Every applicant who scored 70% or higher on the
written examination shall be given an oral examination in order to
continue in the application process. The oral examination will be
graded on a 100 point scale with a score of 70% or higher necessary for
passing. The oral examination shall involve questioning applicants on
how they would handle situations relevant to police work and
behavioral-based questions relevant to police work. Within 30 days
after the applicants' oral examination, they shall be informed of the
score in their oral examination and total overall score.
E. Veterans' preference points. Pursuant to the Veterans' Preference Act80,
any applicant for the position of police officer who qualifies as a
"soldier" under this Act shall be accorded an additional 10 points on top
of their final score by the Board, prior to being placed on the eligibility
list, if that applicant qualifies under §§ 105-22 and 105-23 of these rules
and regulations. Applicants claiming veterans' preference shall have
submitted satisfactory proof of service and honorable discharge
therefrom, such as an appropriate DD Form 214, with their application
form.
A. Creation of eligibility list. At the completion of the examination
requirements set forth in §§ 105-22C and D and 105-23D and E, which
80.Editor's Note: See 51 Pa.C.S.A. § 7104.
§ 105-22 HOME RULE CHARTER § 105-23
C:221
includes the physical agility test, the written examination, the oral
examination, the background investigation, and the computer voice
stress analyzer examination, the Board shall rank all passing candidates
on the eligibility list. The applicants having received the highest score
shall be at the top of the list, with all other candidates being listed in
descending order of their scores. Applicants who qualify for veterans'
preference points, as outlined in § 105-22E, shall have those 10 points
added to their final score prior to being ranked on the eligibility list.
In the case of tied scores, the tie will be broken by giving preference
to the applicant who received the highest score on the written test.
In the event the qualifying applicant received identical scores, the
order of listing shall be determined by the earliest application received.
No one will be certified as eligible in accordance with these rules
and regulations until they have successfully completed a background
investigation and computer voice stress analyzer examination and
received a written recommendation that the applicant is appropriate for
consideration in accordance with § 105-23D and E of these rules and
regulations.
B. Duration of eligibility list. The Board shall furnish to Council a certified
copy of the eligibility list so prepared and kept. The eligibility list shall
be maintained for a period of two years or until a new list is certified to
Council, whichever occurs first, and are public records.
C. Review of eligibility list. The eligibility list shall be annually examined
by the Board for the purpose of deleting therefrom persons who are
permanently unavailable for or disqualified for the position of full-time
police officer, either by death, permanent removal of the area, written
desire to be removed therefrom, or from other permanent cause. The
Board shall, by every reasonable cause, get a written notice from the
candidate removed from the list and provide a notice to that candidate,
in writing, that the candidate will no longer be considered for the
position.
D. Background investigation. The Board shall request the Chief of Police
or the chief's designee to conduct a background investigation on the top
scoring eligible applicants, as determined by the Civil Service Board,
prior to inclusion on the eligibility list as set forth in § 105-23A of these
rules and regulations. The background investigation must be consistent
for each applicant and shall meet, at a minimum, all the specific
requirements of the MPOETC, as required by law. The applicant may be
interviewed directly when the information collected requires
clarification or further explanation. The Chief of Police or chief's
designee may use his/her own discretion in the expansion or
contracting of these items and time frames. After the background
investigation is completed, the Chief of Police or the chief's designee
shall make a written recommendation to the City Manager on whether
the applicant is appropriate for consideration for appointment as a fulltime
police officer for the City of Altoona. The recommendation by the
Chief of Police or the chief's designee shall be based on the criteria set
§ 105-23 ALTOONA CODE § 105-23
C:222
forth in § 105-20 of these rules and regulations and on any other
relevant information developed during the background investigation.
This report to the City Manager shall be in writing and in compliance
with the Americans with Disabilities Act81 and must not include any
medical history information on a candidate. If the recommendation is
to disqualify, then a detailed, written explanation of the reasons for
disqualification must be included. The City Manager shall then make
a final determination on whether additional information is required
or if the information collected and reported warrants acceptance or
rejection of the candidate. Within 30 days after the City Manager
considers the recommendation based on the background investigation,
each applicant shall be notified as to whether they have passed or failed
this portion of the examination process.
E. Computer voice stress analyzer. Every applicant who undergoes a
background investigation pursuant to § 105-23D above shall also be
required to submit to a computer voice stress analyzer (CVSA)
examination which shall be administered by a qualified examiner. As
part of the CVSA examination, each candidate shall fill out a personal
data questionnaire. The personal data questionnaire shall be in
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act82 and must not
include or request any medical history information on a candidate. The
report on each examination shall be submitted to the Chief within 10
days after the date of the examination.
(1) The examiner shall ask questions based on the information
contained in the personal data questionnaire or developed during
the course of the background investigation. Before administering
the test, the examiner shall ask each applicant whether there is any
other information related to the personal data questionnaire which
the applicant would like to provide. There shall also be a post-test
review, during which the examiner shall again ask the participant,
if deception is indicated, whether there is any information which
the applicant is withholding.
(2) If the examiner shall deem any of the applicant's responses to be
deceptive, the examiner must tell the applicant immediately and
give the applicant an opportunity to explain, deny or admit the
deception. If the applicant denies being deceptive or if the
explanation is found unsatisfactory by the examiner, the applicant
will be given the opportunity to retake the test with a second
examiner. Notice of the opportunity to retest shall be given in
writing to the applicant. The second examiner will not have access
to the results of the first test prior to re-administering the CVSA. If
the second examiner finds no deception, the applicant will be
considered as having passed the CVSA. If the second examiner also

§ 105-23 HOME RULE CHARTER § 105-23
C:223
§ 105-24. Appointment procedure.
finds the applicant deceptive, the applicant will be considered as
having failed the examination.
(3) An applicant who has failed both tests may appeal to the Board for
a third examination and the decision to give the applicant an
opportunity to take a third test resides solely with the discretion of
the Board. If the applicant is awarded an opportunity to take a third
test and passes, then the applicant will be considered as having
passed the CVSA test. If the applicant is found deceptive on a third
test, the applicant will be rejected.
(4) After both the background investigation and computer voice stress
analyzer is completed, the Chief of Police or the chief's designee
shall make a written recommendation to the City Manager on
whether the applicant is appropriate for consideration for inclusion
on the eligibility list as a full-time police officer for the City of
Altoona. This report to the City Manager shall be in writing and in
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act83 and must not
include any medical history information on a candidate. Within 30
days after the City Manager considers the recommendation based
on the background investigation and results from the computer
voice stress analyzer examination, each applicant shall be notified
as to whether they have passed or failed this portion of the
examination process.
A. Appointing authority. Furloughed police officers shall be given first
consideration for reemployment prior to any other hiring procedure and
shall be reinstated in order of their seniority as outlined in § 105-26E of
these rules and regulations.
(1) Except as provided above, every initial position of full-time police
officer for employment in the Police Department shall be filled only
in the following manner:
(a) The City Manager shall notify the Board of any vacancy which
is to be filled and shall request certification (certified list of
three) from the eligibility list.
(b) If three names are not available, then the Board shall certify
the name(s) remaining on the list.
(c) The City Manager shall make an appointment contingent upon
the appointees passing a psychological and medical exam.
(d) At the time of the appointment of a full-time police officer, the
City Manager shall advise the Mayor and City Council of such
appointment.

§ 105-23 ALTOONA CODE § 105-24
C:224
(2) Veterans' preference: The exception to the above procedure is
when a qualified veteran is on the certified list of three, the City
Manager shall appoint the veteran, conditioned upon passing a
psychological and medical examination. If two or more of the
names on the certified list of three are veterans, the City Manager
shall have the discretion to appoint anyone of those veterans,
conditioned upon successfully passing a medical and psychological
examination.
(3) The name of the candidate appointed shall be immediately stricken
from the certified list of three or a lesser number if three names are
not on the certified list. The names of the nonappointed candidates
shall then immediately be restored to their proper place on the
certified list and an additional candidate, with the highest score on
the eligibility list, shall then be elevated to the certified list of
three, if qualified names remain on the eligibility list.
(4) If the name of any applicant has appeared on the certified list of
three, and not appointed and been rejected three times or the
conditional applicant has been determined by the medical
examination process to be unqualified, the applicants' names shall
be stricken from the certified list as eligible for appointment.
B. Physical and psychological medical examinations. After the City
Manager selects a candidate from the certified list of three for
appointment to the vacant position, that candidate shall receive a
conditional offer of employment. The offer of employment shall be
conditioned upon the appointee undergoing a physical and
psychological medical examination and a determination that the
conditional appointee is capable of performing all the essential
functions of the position. Physical medical examinations shall be under
the direction of a physician or other qualified medical professional.
Psychological medical examinations shall be under the direction of a
psychiatrist or psychologist.
(1) The physician or other qualified medical professional and the
psychiatrist or psychologist shall be appointed by the City Manager
and shall render an opinion as to whether the conditional appointee
has physical or mental condition which calls into question the
person's ability to perform all of the essential functions of the
position for which the person was conditionally appointed.
(2) The physical and psychological exams will be conducted in
compliance with the MPOETC regulations. The completion of the
required MPOETC physical and psychological forms will be
provided by the City. Drug testing shall be included as one
component of the requirements. In addition, the respective
examiners will be given a copy of the job description and the
essential functions of the job for performing the duties of police
officer. The completed forms will be certified by the examining
physician(s) indicating that the candidate is physically or
§ 105-24 HOME RULE CHARTER § 105-24
C:225
§ 105-25. Police promotions (ranking positions).
psychologically fit, as the case may be, to perform the duties of a
full-time police officer. The completed forms shall be confidential
and submitted to the appropriate City official for disposition.
(3) If the opinion rendered by the physician, other qualified medical
professional, psychiatrist or psychologist calls into question the
conditional appointee's ability to perform all essential functions of
a position, the City Manager or designee shall meet with the
conditional appointee for the purpose of having one or more
interactive discussions on whether the conditional appointee can,
with or without reasonable accommodation, perform all the
essential functions of the position.
(4) If at the conclusion of the interactive discussion the City Manager
or designee determines that the conditional appointee is not
qualified, the City Manager shall give written notice to the
conditional appointee and the Board. This written notice shall also
notify the conditional appointee of their right to appeal the decision
to the Board within 10 working days from the date of the written
notice.
(5) The rejected candidate may appeal this decision under § 105-21 of
these rules and regulations. If the candidate fails to timely exercise
the rights of appeal, or if the Board declines to uphold the appeal,
the Board shall strike the name from the eligibility list and certify
the next highest name for inclusion on the certified list of three.
C. Probationary period. Every successful applicant for the position of fulltime
police officer shall serve a twelve-month probationary period. The
probationary period may be extended by the Chief of Police but the
extension may not exceed six months. During this probationary period,
a newly hired police officer may be dismissed for cause for the reasons
set forth in § 105-20 of these rules and regulations or because of
incapacity for duty due to the use of alcohol or drugs. In addition, a
probationary police officer may be dismissed if the probationary police
officer does not meet the required expectations of the position
supported by accurate documentation. The Chief of Police shall submit
to the City Manager a final probationary report. If the conduct of the
probationer has not been satisfactory, the probationer shall be notified
in writing by the City Manager that the appointment will not be
permanent. Following receipt of this notification by the probationer, a
newly hired police officer's employment shall end. Any probationer who
is notified in writing by the City Manager, prior to the completion of the
probationary period, that his appointment will not be made permanent
has no rights of appeal under these rules and regulations. At the end of
the probationary period, if the probationer is not dismissed in
accordance with this section, a newly hired officer shall receive
permanent status within the Police Department.

§ 270-11 HOME RULE CHARTER § 270-11
C:271
Chapter 281
CURFEW
§ 281-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Curfew Ordinance."
§ 281-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated in this section:
MINOR  Any person under the age of 18 years or, in equivalent phrasing
often herein employed, any person 17 or less years of age.
PARENT  Any person having legal custody of a minor as a natural or
adoptive parent, as a legal guardian, as a person who stands in loco parentis
or as a person to whom legal custody has been given by an order of court.
REMAIN  To stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the
streets, including the congregating of groups or the interacting of minors
totalling four or more persons, in which any minor involved would not be
using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage
or going home. For the purposes of additional precision and precaution,
numerous exceptions are expressly defined in § 281-4 so that this chapter
is not a mere prohibitory or presence type of curfew ordinance. More
exceptions become available with the minor's increasing years and
advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulation
which is intended by use of the meaningful phrase "be or remain," which
was found constitutional in Baker v. Borough of Steelton, 17 Dauph. 17 (PA,
1912), a decision properly classified in Thistlewood v. Trial Magistrate for
Ocean City, 204 A. 2d 688 691 (MD, 1964), and also Borough of Middletown
v. Shaw Bykofsky and his mother, argued before the Supreme Court in
November 1976, as relating to a curfew ordinance of the "remaining" type.
STREET  A way or place, of whatever nature, open for the use of the
public as a matter of right for the purpose of vehicular travel or, in the case
of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. The word "street" includes the
legal right-of-way, including, but not limited to, the cartway of traffic lanes,
the curb, the sidewalks, whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots
or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The word
"street" applies irrespective of what it is called or formally named, whether
an alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise.
TIME OF NIGHT  The prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern
standard time or Eastern daylight saving time, generally observed at that
hour by the public in the City, which, prima facie, is the time then observed
in the City administrative offices and the Police Station.
YEAR OF AGE  Continues from one birthday, such as the 17th to (but not
including the day of) the next, such as the 18th birthday, making it clear
that 17 or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to the phrase
§ 270-11 ALTOONA CODE § 281-2
C:272
"under 18 years of age." Similarly, for example, 11 or less years of age
means "under 12 years of age."
§ 281-3. Time limits.
No person 16 years of age or less (under 17) shall be or remain in or upon
the streets of the City at night during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and
beginning:
§ 281-4. Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases, a minor on a City street during the
nocturnal hours for which § 281-3 is intended to provide the maximum
limits of regulation (and a clear general guide for minors, their parents and
their fellow citizens) shall not be considered in violation of such section.
Further, consideration and flexibility shall be applied to community events
and school-sponsored and -supervised activities, such as dances, sports
programs, hops, recreational programs and other events, advertised as
such, in which participation is open to all, which events and activities will
close at or past the designated time limit provided in § 281-3. In such cases,
a reasonable time shall be allowed for minors to arrive home following the
conclusion of the event. The exceptional cases are as follows:
A. At 10:00 p.m., for minors 16 years of age or less, on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights; and
B. At 12:00 p.m., for minors 16 years of age or less, on Friday and
Saturday nights.
A. When accompanied by a parent;
B. When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated
period of time and purpose within a specified area;
C. When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of
speech and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona
fides of such exercise by first delivering to Communications Center
personnel at the City Hall Building, by which high priority messages to
the Chief of Police or a designated representative are regularly
received, a written communication, signed by such minor and
countersigned, if practical, by a parent of such minor, with his or her
home address and telephone number, addressed to the Chief of Police,
specifying when, where and in what manner such minor will be on the
streets at night (during hours when § 281-3 is otherwise applicable to
such minor) in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication.
D. In a case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minor's parent has
communicated to police station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time
§ 281-2 HOME RULE CHARTER § 281-4
C:273
for a described purpose, including points of origin and destination.
A copy of such communication or of the police record thereof, duly
certified by the Chief of Police to be correct, with an appropriate
notation of the time it was received and of the names and address of
such parent and minor, shall be admissible evidence.
E. When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor, if that neighbor
does not communicate an objection to a police officer;
F. When returning home by a direct route from and within 30 minutes of
the termination of a school activity or an activity of a religious or other
voluntary association of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to and duly filed
for immediate reference by the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by
him on duty at the police station, thus encouraging conduct on the part
of minors involved in such activities and striking a fair balance for any
somewhat conflicting interests;
G. When authorized by a special permit from the Chief of Police, carried on
the person of the minor thus authorized, as provided herein. When
normal or necessary nighttime activities of a minor, particularly a minor
well along the road to maturity, may be inadequately provided for by
other provisions of this chapter, then recourse may be had to the Mayor
or the Police Chief, either for a regulation as provided in Subsection H
hereof or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant. Upon the
Mayor's or the Police Chief's finding of necessity for the use of the
streets to the extent warranted by a written application (as judicially
approved in People v. Walton, 161 P. 2d 498, 502-503, Cal. App. 1945),
signed by a minor and by a parent of such minor, if feasible, the Mayor
or the Police Chief may grant a permit in writing for the use by such
minor of such streets at such hours as in the Mayor's opinion may be
necessary. The application shall state the name, age and address of
such minor; the name, address and telephone number of a parent
thereof; the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other
physical characteristics of such minor; the necessity which requires
such minor to remain upon the streets during the curfew hours
otherwise applicable, such as employment; the street or route involved;
and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and
hour.
H. If a minor, as designated under this chapter, is a member of the military
or a student of a college or is declared to be an "emancipated minor" or
has shown himself or herself to be a responsible mature young adult, he
or she may be exempt from this chapter, provided that he or she does
not violate any local or state law.
I. When authorized by a regulation issued by the Police Chief in other
similar cases of reasonable necessity similarly handled but adapted to
normal or necessary nighttime activities of more minors that can
readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Normally
§ 281-4 ALTOONA CODE § 281-4
C:274
§ 281-5. Parental responsibility.
No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit, or
by inefficient control allow, such minor to be or remain upon any City
street under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise
such a regulation by the Chief permitting use of the streets should be
issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through
the news media and other agencies, such as the schools, and shall
define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the
period of time involved (not to extend more than 30 minutes beyond
the time for termination of such activity) and the reason for finding
that such a regulation is reasonably necessary and consistent with the
public interest and the purposes of this chapter.
J. When the minor carries a certified card of employment, renewable each
calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued
not more than 45 days beforehand, signed by the Chief of Police and
briefly identifying the minor, the addresses of his or her home and place
of employment and his or her hours of employment.
K. When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. Bona fide interstate movement through the
City and interstate travel beginning or ending in the City are exempted.
L. When the minor is 17 years of age, if and when the Mayor determines
that such an exception is warranted by the facts. Such exception shall
be by formal rule first reported to Council, spread upon its minutes and
so reported in the press, finding the facts as to the extent (minimal) of
juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule, currently,
in the best interest of the minors and of the City, finding the facts as to a
sufficient degree of maturity of those thus within one year of adulthood,
and finding that this chapter should be relaxed as an incentive to and
recognition of approaching maturity. By such formal rule, covering a
period of time designated therein or until rescission thereof not
exceeding one year from the date thereof, the Mayor may take
appropriate action excepting designated minors, minors in a defined
group or area or all minors (as the facts may warrant) 17 years of age
on that date or attaining 17 years of age during the period that such
formal rule is and remains in effect.
M. Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such as
provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided.
Additional, also severable, exceptions, broadening with the progress
toward maturity of minors enrolled respectively in elementary, junior
high and high schools, will be considered by Council as warranted by
future experience illuminated by the views of student government
associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward, precinct
and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in
authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile
delinquency.
§ 281-4 HOME RULE CHARTER § 281-5
C:275
beyond the scope of, this chapter. The word "knowingly" includes knowledge
which a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning the
whereabouts of a minor in that parent's legal custody. It is intended to
continue to keep neglectful or careless parents obligated to reasonable
community standards of parental responsibility through an objective test. It
shall be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities,
conduct or whereabouts of such minor.
§ 281-6. Police procedures.
A policeman, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima facie violation of any provision of this chapter, normally
shall take the minor to the police station, where a parent shall immediately
be notified to come for such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated.
This procedure is intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional
safeguards, of the relevant facts, and to centralize responsibility in the
police sergeant then on duty for accurate, effective, fair, impartial and
uniform enforcement and recording, thus making available experienced
supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access to information and
records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a birth certificate,
a policeman on the street shall, in the first instance, use his or her best
judgment in determining the age of the person.
A. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience
and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver a minor to a
parent of such minor under appropriate circumstances, for example a
minor of tender age near home whose identity and address may readily
be ascertained.
B. In any event, such policeman shall, within 24 hours, file a written report
with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the
information for which he and the sergeant involved in such case are
responsible.
C. When a parent, after being immediately called, comes to take charge of
the minor and the appropriate information has been recorded, the
minor shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent
cannot be located or fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor
shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the extent that, in
accordance with police regulations, approved in advance by juvenile
authorities, the minor may temporarily be entrusted to a relative,
neighbor or other person who shall, on behalf of a parent, assume the
responsibility of caring for the minor pending the availability or arrival
of a parent.
D. In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police shall, by
certified mail, send to a parent written notice of such violation along
with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in the full
enforcement of this chapter, including the enforcement of parental
responsibility and of all applicable penalties.
§ 281-5 ALTOONA CODE § 281-7
C:276
§ 281-7. Severability.
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of this
chapter. If any provision, including any exception, part, phrase or term, or
the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the
application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. The
Mayor is authorized to give advisory opinions, in writing or immediately
reduced to writing, which shall be binding and adhered to by the City of
Altoona Police Department, until this chapter is amended in such respect,
interpreting terms, phrases, parts or any provisions of this chapter.
Normally such advisory opinions shall be in response to good faith, signed
letters addressed to the Mayor at his or her City Hall office, questioning
as ambiguous, as having a potentially chilling effect on constitutional rights
specifically invoked or as otherwise invalid, in both categories with respect
to proposed conduct definitely described. This administrative remedy must
be exhausted prior to presenting to any court a question in either of the
categories. Council does not intend a result that is absurd, incapable of
execution or unreasonable. It is intended that this chapter be held
inapplicable in such cases, if any, where its application would be
unconstitutional. A constitutional construction is intended and shall be
given. Council does not intend to violate the Constitution of the
Commonwealth or the Constitution of the United States.
§ 281-8. Continuing evaluation.
Council shall continue its evaluation and updating of this chapter.
A. There shall be compiled and informally reported to Council through
effective channels (such as the normal monthly distribution of
noteworthy material by the juvenile authorities to the Mayor and the
City Solicitor) all exceptional cases hereunder of reasonable necessity,
the notices of schools and other activities, the Mayor's special permits
and regulations hereinbefore authorized, and the Mayor's advisory
opinions, for consideration by the appropriate committee and by
Council in further updating and continually evaluating this chapter.
B. For the same reasons, as well as for the implementation beyond these
legal aspects of the basic purposes hereof, the Mayor and relevant
committees of Council, through their respective chairmen in
coordinated efforts, shall work with existing and newly organized
volunteer groups and shall stimulate volunteer leadership in programs
of research and of action dealing constructively on neighborhood and
local bases with juvenile delinquency and the prevention, control or
containment thereof, in all its ramifications, and with practical steps
toward a better life for minors 17 or less years of age, and with the
working of this chapter as a needed legal tool toward that end, as well
as for the continuing present protection of minors and of other persons
and of property and other interests important to the welfare of the
people of the City.

Where, pursuant to Section 508(b)(1)(i) of Act 98 of 1992,126 the Finance
Director issues a certificate indicating that there are no delinquent taxes,

(2) Disposition of claims.
(a) Upon the receipt of a certificate pursuant to Subsection B(1)(a)
of this section, the insuring agent shall pay the claim of the
named insured in accordance with the policy terms, unless the
loss agreed to between the named insured and the insuring
agent equals or exceeds 60% of the aggregate limits of liability
on all fire policies covering the building or other structure. In
the case of such a loss, the insuring agent, the insured property

transferred to the municipality shall be $2,000; or
B. If at the time of a loss report the named insured has submitted a
contractor's signed estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or

agent shall transfer to the municipality from the insurance proceeds the
amount specified in the estimate.

named insured, if the municipality has not commenced to remove,
repair or secure the building or other structure. This subsection only
applies to municipalities that have adopted an ordinance authorizing

duties of this section.
E. Upon receipt of proceeds under this section, the municipality shall do
the following:

repairing or securing the building or structure which are incurred
by the municipality. Such costs shall include, without limitation,
any engineering, legal or administrative costs incurred by the
municipality in connection with such removal, repair or securing of
the building or any proceedings related thereto; and
(2) It is the obligation of the insuring agent when transferring the
proceeds to provide the municipality with the name and address of
the named insured. Upon receipt of the transferred funds and the
name and address of the named insured, the designated officer
shall contact the named insured, certify that the proceeds have
been received by the municipality, and notify the named insured
that the procedures under this subsection shall be followed; and
(3) When repairs, removal or securing of the building or other
structure have been completed in accordance with all applicable
regulations and orders of the municipality, and the required proof
of such completion received by the designated officer, and if the
municipality has not incurred any costs for repairs, removal or
securing, the fund shall be returned to the named insured. If the
municipality has incurred costs for repairs, removal or securing of
the building or other structure, the costs shall be paid from the
fund and, if excess funds remain, the municipality shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured; and
(4) To the extent that interest is earned on proceeds held by the
municipality pursuant to this section and not returned to the named
insured, such interest shall belong to the municipality. To the extent
that proceeds are returned to the named insured, interest earned
§ 352-3 HOME RULE CHARTER § 352-3
C:311
on such proceeds shall be distributed to the named insured at the
time that the proceeds are returned.
F. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability of the
municipality to recover any deficiency. Furthermore, nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to prohibit the municipality and the
named insured from entering into an agreement that permits the
transfer of funds to the named insured if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
G. Proof of payment by the insuring agent of proceeds under a policy in
accordance with Subsections A through D of this section is conclusive
evidence of the discharge of its obligation to the insured under the
policy to the extent of the payment and of compliance by the insuring
agent with Subsections A through D of this section.
H. Nothing in this section shall be construed to make an insuring agent
liable for any amount in excess of proceeds payable under its insurance
policy or for any other act performed pursuant to this section or to
make the municipality or public official an insured under a policy of
insurance or to create an obligation to pay delinquent property taxes or
unpaid removal liens or expenses other than as provided in this section.

periodically produce a register listing those municipalities filing the
ordinance. This register shall be made available to insurance
companies at minimum cost. An insurance company, association or
exchange shall not be required to comply with any municipal ordinance
if the municipality fails to provide a copy of the ordinance to the

§ 362-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has, by the passage
of the Pennsylvania Flood Plain Management Act of 1978,128 delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt floodplain management
regulations to promote public health, safety, and the general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the City of Altoona does hereby order as
follows.
§ 362-2. General provisions.
C. In Section 5806.2 (geographic limits in which the storage of flammable
cryogenic fluids in stationary containers is prohibited): the City of
Altoona.
D. In Section 6104.2 (geographic limits in which the storage of liquefied
petroleum gas is restricted for the protection of heavily populated or
congested areas): the City of Altoona.
A. Statement of intent. The purpose of this chapter is to promote the
general health, welfare, and safety of the residents of the City through
regulation of development in designated floodplains. More specifically,
these regulations are designed to encourage the utilization of
appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize
dangers to public health by protecting water supply and natural
drainage from the effects of flooding; and to reduce financial burdens
imposed on the City, its governmental units, and its residents by
preventing excessive and inappropriate development in designated
floodplains; and to comply with federal and state floodplain
management requirements.
B. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
sought by the provisions of these regulations is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes and is based on acceptable engineering

methods of study. Larger floods may occur or flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge
openings restricted by debris. This chapter does not imply that areas
outside any identified floodplain area or that land uses permitted within
such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the City of Altoona or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from
reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.
C. Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or
phrase of this chapter shall be declared invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such a decision shall not affect the remaining portions of
the chapter, which shall remain in full force and effect, and for this
purpose, the provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be
severable.
D. Abrogation and greater restrictions. This chapter supersedes any other
conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other article provisions shall remain in full force
and effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If
there is any conflict between the provisions of this chapter, the more
restrictive shall apply.

J. Application approval permit issuance.
(1) Floodplain area permits shall consist of a floodplain location/
elevation permit and a floodplain/construction permit. These
permits shall be issued contingent upon the requirements of these
regulations and only after it is determined that all necessary
requirements for issuing a building permit have been met. The
procedure for these permits is as follows:
(a) Floodplain location and elevation permits shall be issued after
a land survey is conducted by a registered surveyor/engineer
to determine the location and elevation of any proposed
construction, development, or use of land. The purpose of this
permit is to ensure compliance with this chapter by
determining the initial location and elevation of all
improvements submitted according to the requirements of this
chapter. The only activities that may be undertaken in
§ 362-5 HOME RULE CHARTER § 362-5
C:327
conjunction with this permit are excavation, grading, filling,
and foundation work. The floodplain location/elevation permit
shall be issued only if all survey information complies with the
requirements of this chapter. No construction, development, or
use of land shall be undertaken within an identified floodplain
area unless the above permit has been legally issued.
(b) Partial building permits shall be issued by the Building
Inspector if all requirements for building codes and the
floodplain location and elevation permit are satisfied.
(c) Floodplain/construction permits shall be issued only after all
activities undertaken in conjunction with the floodplain
location/elevation permit have been completed according to
the requirements of this chapter. All activities proposed for the
construction, development, or use of land, which are not
permitted to be undertaken in conjunction with the floodplain
location/elevation permit, shall be undertaken in conjunction
with the floodplain/construction permit.
(d) Supplemental building permits shall be issued by the Building
Inspector if all requirements and regulations for building codes
and the floodplain/construction permit are satisfied.
(2) All requested change orders during construction, development, use
of land, or interior repair governed by the provisions of this chapter
must be approved, in writing, by the floodplain administrator. No
approval by the floodplain administrator is necessary for any
requested change order not governed by these provisions.
(3) No floodplain area permit shall be issued for any encroachment,
alteration, or improvement of any kind within a watercourse until
all adjacent municipalities which may be affected by such action
have been notified by the City, and until all required permits or
approvals have been first obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection, Bureau of Dams, Waterways and
Wetlands. No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any
kind shall be made to any watercourse unless it can be shown that
the activity will not reduce or impede the flood-carrying capacity of
the watercourse in any way. In addition, the Federal Insurance
Administrator, Pennsylvania Department of Community and
Economic Development, Bureau of Community Planning, shall be
notified by the City prior to any alteration or relocation of any
watercourse.
(4) After the issuance of a permit by the floodplain administrator, no
changes of any kind shall be made to the application, permit or any
of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application, without the written consent or approval of the
floodplain administrator. Requests for any such change shall be in

applicant to execute a developer agreement with the City setting forth
the conditions of approval and such other matters deemed necessary for
approving any application filed pursuant to this chapter. The developer's
agreement, may at the option of the City, be recorded into the chain of
title to the premises which is subject to the application. In addition, the
City may require the posting of financial security in accordance with the
Pennsylvania Municipality Planning Code, as amended from time to time.134
writing and shall be submitted by the applicant to the floodplain
administrator for consideration.
A. Schedule of inspections.
(1) During the construction period, the floodplain administrator and/or
or other authorized official shall inspect the premises to determine
that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the building and floodplain area permit application and
with all applicable municipal laws and ordinances. He shall make
as many inspections, during and upon completion, of the work as
are necessary. The permittee shall notify the officer 48 hours in
advance of the completion of the following key development
phases:
(a) At the completion of the preliminary site preparation, including
elevation grading or fill, but prior to block or concrete
foundation/footers being poured, to satisfy the requirements of
the floodplain location/elevation permit.
(b) After block or concrete foundation/footers are poured, but
prior to framing or block work, to satisfy the requirements of
the floodplain construction permit.
(c) First floor elevation, if applicable, must be verified to satisfy
the requirements of the floodplain construction permit.
(d) After flood openings are constructed or flood vents are
installed, to satisfy the requirements of the floodplain
construction permit.
(e) Utility elevations must be verified, to satisfy the requirements
of the floodplain construction permit.
(2) In the discharge of his or her duties, the floodplain administrator
and/or any authorized representative shall have the authority to
enter any building, structure, premises, or development in the
identified floodplain area, upon presentation of proper credentials,
at any reasonable hour to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

D. Noncompliance. Upon failure to comply within the time specified,
unless otherwise extended by the City of Altoona, the applicant,
developer, owner or his/her agent shall be subject to the penalty
provisions of this chapter. Any development initiated or any structure or
building constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered, or relocated in
noncompliance with this chapter may be declared, by the floodplain
administrator, to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
E. In the event the floodplain administrator discovers that the work does
not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or
misrepresentation by any applicant, such official may revoke any
approvals given under this chapter.

All fines shall have added to them the costs incurred by the City
for enforcement, including, but not limited to, court costs, attorneys'
fees, professional fees to engineers, architects, surveyors, planners,
landscape architects, or other design professionals, and expert witness
compensation.
B. Time frame. Each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation, unless the Magisterial District Judge, determining
that there has been a violation, further determines that there was a
good faith basis for the person, partnership or corporation violating this
chapter to have believed that there was no such violation. Under such
circumstances, there shall be deemed to have been only one such
violation until the fifth day following the date of the initial
determination of a violation by the Magisterial District Judge;
thereafter, each day that a violation continues shall constitute a
separate violation.

C:332
§ 362-12. Variances/appeals.
City Council, or the Planning Commission do not have jurisdiction once
the enforcement procedures contained in this section are initiated.
J. In addition to any other remedy available to the City of Altoona, the City
may also seek remedies and penalties under applicable Pennsylvania
statutes or regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Any activity
conducted in violation of this chapter is declared a public nuisance by
the City and abatable as such. The City may institute and maintain
appropriate actions by law or equity to restrain, correct or abate
violations, to prevent unlawful construction, to recover damages and to

the state or federal government, the Zoning Officer shall, within
five working days, send a copy of said variation request to the
appropriate governmental body or agency.
(4) All those charged with reviewing the request shall, within 15
working days, conduct such a review and transmit comments to the
Zoning Officer to be forwarded to the Zoning Hearing Board for its
consideration at the hearing.
(5) Failure to review the variance request and comment within the
time allotted shall be deemed that the nonresponding official has
no problems with the request. No time limits shall be placed upon
federal or state governmental bodies or agencies except the outer
time limits placed on hearings by the Municipalities Planning
Code.135
(6) The Zoning Officer shall place the request for variance on the
agenda of the Zoning Hearing Board in accordance with the normal
procedures used for hearings. Should federal or state

§ 362-11 HOME RULE CHARTER § 362-12
C:333
opened but then continued until the first meeting following the
receipt of any said comments or approvals.
(7) Upon hearing any request for variation of this chapter, the Zoning
Hearing Board shall render a written decision within 45 days to the
applicant, Zoning Officer, and the officials in Subsection A(1)
above. Each decision shall be accompanied by findings of fact and
conclusions based on this chapter and shall contain a reference to
the provision relied on and the reasons why the decision is deemed
appropriate in light of the facts found.
(8) Whenever a request for variation of this chapter is granted, the
Zoning Hearing Board shall also notify the applicant, in writing,
that:
(a) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance; and
(b) Such variations may increase the risk to life and property.
B. Standard. If compliance with any of the requirements of this chapter
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City of Altoona may, upon request, grant
relief from the strict application of the requirements.
C. Variance procedures and conditions. Requests for variances shall be
considered by the City of Altoona in accordance with the procedures
contained in this section:
(1) No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any floodway area that would cause any
increase in the BFE.
(2) No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,
use, or activity within any AE Area without floodway that would,
together with all other existing and anticipated development,
increase the BFE more than one foot at any point.
(3) No variance shall be granted for any of the other requirements
pertaining specifically to development regulated by Subsections A
through C of § 362-12, Development which may endanger human
life.
(4) If granted, a variance shall involve only the least modification
necessary to provide relief.

C:334
(6) In determining whether to vary the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, the Zoning Board shall consider
whether an equally good or better form of mitigation is available.
(7) Financial disadvantage of the property owner or developer is not in
and of itself sufficient evidence of a need to permit any variance.
(8) No variance shall be granted permitting structures to be designed
and constructed without the capacity to withstand the base flood.
(9) No variance shall be granted on the basis that compliance with this
chapter will increase the cost of construction, development, use of
land, or interior repair. The decision shall document the
noneconomic basis for the grant of the variance.
(10)No variance of the regulations contained within this chapter shall
be granted if said variation serves to abrogate the terms or
requirements of any other federal, state, or local regulations and/or
ordinances.
(11) Whenever a variance is granted, the Zoning Board shall notify the
applicant in writing that:
(a) The granting of the variance may result in increased premium
rates for flood insurance.
(b) Such variances may increase the risks to life and property.
(12) In reviewing any request for a variance, the City of Altoona shall
consider, at a minimum, the following:
(a) That there is good and sufficient cause.
(b) That failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional
hardship to the applicant.
(c) That the granting of the variance will:
[1] Neither result in an unacceptable or prohibited increase in
flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or
extraordinary public expense; nor
[2] Create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimize the public,
or conflict with any other applicable state or local
ordinances and regulations.
(13) A complete record of all variance requests and related actions shall
be maintained indefinitely by the City of Altoona. In addition, a
report of all variances granted during the year shall be included in

E. Exercise of power. In exercising the above powers, the Zoning Board
may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and, to
that end, shall have all the powers of the officer or agency from whom
the appeal was taken. Every change granted or denied shall be
accompanied by written findings of fact based on sworn testimony and
evidence, specifying the reason for granting or denying the variance.
The decision of the Zoning Board shall be made a part of any plan
approval.
A. Identification.
(1) The identified floodplain area shall be any areas in the City of
Altoona classified as special flood hazard areas (SFHAs) in the
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) dated March 2, 2012, and issued by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or the most
recent revision thereof, including all digital data developed as part
of the Flood Insurance Study.
(2) The above-referenced FIS and FIRMs, and any subsequent
revisions and amendments, are hereby adopted by the City of
Altoona and declared to be a part of this chapter.
B. Description of floodplain areas.
(1) The floodway.
(a) Description. The area identified as the floodway in the FIS
which represents the channel of a watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to
discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the
water surface elevation by more than one foot at any point.
This term shall also include floodway areas which have been
identified in other available studies or sources of information
for those special floodplain areas where no floodway has been
identified in the FIS.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other
development shall be permitted unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result
in any increase in flood levels within the community during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
§ 362-12 ALTOONA CODE § 362-13
C:336
[2] No new construction or development shall be allowed
unless a permit is obtained from the Department of
Environmental Protection Regional Office.
(2) Special floodplain area.
(a) Description. The areas identified as Zones AE (A1-A30 previous
mapping) in the FIS which are subject to inundation by the
one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed
methods and have base flood elevations (BFEs) shown.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse unless a permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
[2] In special floodplain areas without a designated floodway,
no new development shall be permitted unless it can be
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of all past and
projected development will not increase the BFE by more
than one foot.
(3) Approximate floodplain area.
(a) Description. The areas identified as Zone A in the FIS which
are subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance
flood event determined using approximate methodologies.
Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed,
no BFEs or flood depths are shown.
(b) Special requirements.
[1] No new construction or development shall be located
within the area measured 50 feet landward from the topof-
bank of any watercourse unless a permit is obtained
from the Department of Environmental Protection
Regional Office.
[2] When available, information from other federal, state, and
other acceptable sources shall be used to determine the
BFE as well as a floodway area, if possible. When no other
information is available, the BFE shall be determined by
using a point on the boundary of the identified floodplain
area which is nearest the construction site in question.
[3] In lieu of the above, the City of Altoona may require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by
professional engineers or others of demonstrated

C:337
§ 362-14. Existing structures in identified floodplain areas.
qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. Studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical
review by the City of Altoona.
C. Changes in identification of area. The areas considered to be floodplain
may be revised or modified by the City of Altoona where studies or
information provided by a qualified agency or person document the
need or possibility for such revision and shall follow the guidelines as
set forth in these regulations and all applicable Federal Emergency
Management Agency requirements. No modification or revision of any
floodplain area identified in the Flood Insurance Study shall be made
without prior approval from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. Additionally, as soon as practicable, but not later than six
months after the date such information becomes available, a community
shall notify the FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or
scientific data.
D. Boundary disputes. Should a dispute arise concerning any identified
floodplain boundary, an initial determination shall be made by the
floodplain administrator, and any party aggrieved by this decision may
appeal to the Zoning Hearing Board. The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant.
A. Existing structures. The provisions of this chapter do not require any
changes or improvements to be made to lawfully existing structures.
However, when an improvement is made to any existing structure, the
provisions of Subsection B of this section shall apply.
B. Improvements. The following provisions shall apply whenever any
improvement is made to an existing structure located within any
identified floodplain area:
(1) No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be
allowed within any floodway area that would cause any increase in
the elevation of the base flood.
(2) No expansion or enlargement of an existing structure shall be
allowed within any AE Area without floodway that would, together
with all other existing and anticipated development, increase the
BFE more than one foot at any point.
(3) Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement of any
kind to an existing structure to such extent or amount less than
50% of its market value does not constitute substantial
improvement and therefore shall be elevated and/or floodproofed
to the greatest extent possible (see § 362-3B, Definitions).
§ 362-13 ALTOONA CODE § 362-14
C:338
§ 362-15. Technical requirements.
(4) Any modification, alteration, reconstruction, or improvement of any
kind to an existing structure to an extent or amount of 50% or more
of its market value shall constitute a substantial improvement (see
§ 362-3B, Definitions) and shall be undertaken only in full
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
A. General.
(1) No encroachment, alteration, or improvement of any kind shall be
made to any watercourse until all adjacent municipalities which
may be affected by such action have been notified by the City of
Altoona and until all required permits or approvals have been first
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection,
Bureau of Dams, Waterways and Wetlands.
(2) In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic
Development, Bureau of Community Planning, shall be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
(3) Any new construction, development, uses or activities allowed
within any identified floodplain area shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the provisions contained in this chapter, the entire
Altoona Planning Code (this chapter), and any other applicable
codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(4) Within six months of the completion of any new construction,
development, or other activity resulting in changes in the BFE,
submit technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map
revision (LOMR).
B. Special floodway requirements. Within any identified floodway area, the
following provisions apply:
(1) Any new construction, development, use, activity, or encroachment
that would cause any increase in flood heights shall be prohibited.
(2) No new construction or development shall be allowed unless a
permit is obtained from the Department of Environmental
Protection, Bureau of Dams, Waterways and Wetlands.
C. Elevation and floodproofing requirements. In Zones A, AE (A1-30
previous mapping), and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial
improvement shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated
up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation. The design and
construction standards and specifications contained in the 2009
International Building Code (IBC) and in the 2009 International
Residential Code (IRC), or the most recent revisions thereof, and ASCE

AH Zones, any new construction or substantial improvement shall
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated up to, or above,
the regulatory flood elevation. See § 362-3B for regulatory flood
elevation definition. In A Zones, where there are no base flood
elevations specified on the FIRM, any new construction or
substantial improvement shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation
determined in accordance with § 362-4B of this chapter.
(2) Nonresidential structures. In Zones AE (A1-30 previous mapping)
and AH Zones, any new construction or substantial improvement of
a nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated up to, or above, the regulatory flood elevation
or be designed and constructed so that the space enclosed below
the regulatory flood elevation:

substantially impermeable to the passage of water; and
(b) Has structural components with the capability of resisting
hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of
buoyancy.
(c) 136In A Zones, where no base flood elevations are specified on
the FIRM, any new construction or substantial improvement
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated or
completely floodproofed up to, or above, the regulatory flood
elevation determined in accordance with § 362-4B of this
chapter.
(d) 137Any nonresidential structure, or part thereof, having a
lowest floor which is not elevated to at least 1 1/2 feet above
the base flood elevation shall be floodproofed in a completely
or essentially dry manner in accordance with the W1 or W2
space classification standards contained in the publication
entitled "Flood-Proofing Regulations" (published by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, June 1972, as amended March

(d) Auctions of real estate.
C. Records to be kept. Each and every secondhand dealer shall keep a
book legibly written in the English language at the time of acquiring

own records, the records must contain all of the information specified
above in this subsection.
E. Retention of purchased articles. No secondhand dealer shall sell or
dispose of any secondhand articles or goods until seven days have
elapsed after the purchase of the same. However, it shall be an
affirmative defense to any prosecution or administrative proceeding
brought for a violation of this section that, in the case of precious
metals, retention for the time period required would have resulted in
serious and substantial economic losses to the dealer, or the probability
of such losses was significant, due to rapid and highly fluctuating
market conditions, provided the persons so charged shall prove the
existence of the market conditions giving rise to the aforesaid defense
by preponderance of the evidence. Market conditions, in order to be a
defense hereunder, must be such that financial analysts would
characterize trading as at or approaching a level or occurrence in an
atmosphere of panic so as to clearly distinguish trading conditions from
normal variations in market movement in response to economic news or
other events.
F. Forbidden transactions. No secondhand dealer shall purchase any
article from any person under the age of 18. A secondhand dealer shall
require any person who appears to be under 30 years of age to verify
that he or she is at least 18 years old by presentation of photo
identification card listing his/her date of birth or age (such as a driver's
license, passport, student identification card, employee identification
card, or alien resident card). If a person fails or refuses to present photo

applicants shall be charged a fee of $25, which license shall thereafter be
renewed in accordance with this chapter upon payment of the specified fee
and fulfillment of all other requirements hereunder.
and age verification upon request of the secondhand dealer, the
secondhand dealer shall not buy any articles from that person.168
G. Conviction of certain crimes. If any secondhand dealer shall be
convicted of robbery, burglary, theft, receiving stolen goods or any
other crime involving the unlawful obtaining of personal property, a
hearing officer shall, after notice and hearing, revoke said secondhand
dealer's license.
H. Fee. The fee for the issuance of a secondhand dealer's license shall be
as established by resolution of the City Council.169

Part 8
Urban Redevelopment
ARTICLE XXIX
Blight Declarations
§ 535-212. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to enable the Planning Commission to
make declarations of blight on properties or neighborhoods independent
of the actions and processes of the Redevelopment Authority and Urban
Redevelopment Law. Such declarations may be made where a property
or neighborhood is blighted but the actions and processes defined in the
subsequent articles of this Part 8 are inappropriate for the circumstances.
§ 535-213. Factors for blight declaration on individual properties.
The Planning Commission may make a blight declaration on a specific
individual property when it determines that one or more of the following
conditions are present.
§ 535-214. Factors for blight declaration on entire areas.
The Planning Commission may make a blight declaration on specific areas
of the City when it determines that two or more of the following conditions
are present:
A. Any of the conditions enumerated under Section 12.1(c) of the
Pennsylvania Urban Redevelopment Law.203
B. Prone to significant damage from flooding.
C. The presence of conditions, particularly in structures, which pose a
threat to neighboring properties or passersby in the public right-of-way.
D. Abandoned accessory structures.
E. Collection or accumulation of junk, trash, or other refuse.
F. A use or structure which is not compatible with the surrounding
neighborhood and was not put in place by legal means. Legal
nonconforming uses and structures are considered to have been put
into place legally.
A. Unsafe, unsanitary, inadequate, or overcrowded conditions in
dwellings.
B. Excessive land coverage.
C. Defective design or arrangement of buildings.
203. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 1712.1(c).
§ 535-212 HOME RULE CHARTER § 535-214
C:459
§ 535-215. Procedure for blight declaration.
When making a blight declaration, the Commission shall abide by this
procedure:
§ 535-216. Effect of blight declaration.
A blight declaration is a tool used to provide funding to certain areas and
projects within the City. In and of itself, the declaration has no tangible
effect. However, because the use of funding which can result from such
a declaration can have financial, social, and other immediate negative
effects on those who own or lease property affected by a declaration, the
Commission must include in its declaration what it foresees the funding
available being used for and how it will impact owners and leaseholders.
§ 535-217. Appeals.
Persons owning or leasing property included in a blight declaration shall
have standing to appeal the declaration to any court of competent
jurisdiction. Should the court find that the blight declaration is in error, the
declaration shall be vacated so far as it applies to the property owned or
leased by the appellant. Such appeal shall be done in the same manner as
an appeal from a determination of a public nuisance.
D. Faulty street or lot layout.
E. Economically or socially undesirable land uses.
F. Building obsolescence.
G. Other effects of inadequate planning.
A. Declaration shall be made publicly at any regular Commission meeting.
B. Declaration shall be made by resolution of the Commission. The
resolution shall include a specific description of the property or area
subject to the declaration, the factors leading to such declaration, and
any adverse effects such declaration may have on property owners
included in the boundaries of the declaration.
C. The Commission shall then notify all property owners affected by the
declaration that such declaration has been made, the adverse effects
that the declaration may have on them, and a notice of the right to
appeal the declaration in accordance with the procedure in § 535-217
below. The notice shall be mailed within five days of the vote on the
declaration.
D. The Commission shall notify the City Council of the blight declaration
after the possibility of appeal has ended.
§ 535-214 ALTOONA CODE § 535-218
C:460
§ 535-218. Limitations.
No blight declaration issued under this article may be subsequently used as
a basis for activity under Article XXX or XXXI of this Part 8. Likewise, no
declaration or certification of blight under Article XXX or XXXI of this Part 8
may be used as a blight declaration under this article. In both cases, a new
blight declaration must be issued pursuant to the criteria and procedures
outlined in each respective article.
§ 535-218 HOME RULE CHARTER § 535-218
C:461

ARTICLE XXX
Spot Blight
§ 535-219. Purpose.
It is the stated purpose of this article to bolster, support, and sustain
the various neighborhoods in the City through the elimination of blighted
properties as they are brought to the attention of the City. The City and
the Redevelopment Authority are to work jointly to further the goal of
eliminating blighted properties throughout the City as is provided by the
Urban Redevelopment Law. It is not the intent of this section to remove
blighted properties through other avenues, although it should not be
construed that this article prohibits the use of alternative methods.
§ 535-220. Findings by Blighted Property Review Committee.
The Blighted Property Review Committee shall inspect and evaluate certain
properties brought to its attention which may be in a state of blight.
Blighted properties shall include any property meeting any one or more of
the criteria set forth in Section 12.1(c) of the Urban Redevelopment Law.204
If the Committee finds that the property is indeed in a state of blight, it
shall serve notice by certified mail and first class mail at the last known
address of the property owner and post a notice on the subject property
that the premises have been found to be in a blighted condition. A record of
all notices shall be kept with the property file. A photograph of the posting
on the premises shall suffice as record of posting. The notice shall include
an order to remove the conditions causing the blight as well as notice
that failure to remove such conditions could result in condemnation of the
property under the Urban Redevelopment Law.
§ 535-221. Appeals of finding of blight.
The owner shall have the right of appeal from the findings in § 535-220 in
the same manner as an appeal from the determination of a public nuisance.
§ 535-222. Certification of blight.
Once the property has been declared a public nuisance and no action has
been taken to either timely appeal such a declaration or to correct the
blighted conditions, the property can be certified as blighted in accordance
with the following:
A. The Blighted Property Review Committee shall examine and inspect the
property to determine if a certification of blight is necessary. If the
certification is justified, the Committee shall make such a certification
and forward the property to the Planning Commission for its review and
certification.
204. Editor's Note: See 35 P.S. § 1712.1(c).
§ 535-219 HOME RULE CHARTER § 535-222
C:463
§ 535-223. Removal of blighted properties.
The Redevelopment Authority may remove the blight from the
neighborhood through one of two methods:
§ 535-224. Redevelopment of formerly blighted properties.
In the event the Redevelopment Authority acquires property under
§ 535-223B above, it shall redevelop the property through one of the
following methods:
B. The Planning Commission shall then also examine and inspect the
property to determine if a certification of blight is necessary. If the
certification is justified, the Commission shall make such a certification
and forward the property to the Redevelopment Authority. The
Commission shall, with its certification, also forward its
recommendation as to the appropriate reuse of the property and
whether the disposition of the property for residential or related use
would not be in accord with the Comprehensive Plan.
C. All properties certified as blighted must be vacant and must have
cleared the procedures in §§ 535-220 and 535-221 above before
entering the process described in this section.
A. Agreement with the owner. The Redevelopment Authority or its
designee may enter into an agreement with the owner of the property to
cause either its rehabilitation or its demolition in order to eliminate the
blight from the neighborhood. Such agreements may include, but are
not limited to, a consent to raze or a proposal to rehabilitate.
B. Acquisition. The Redevelopment Authority may acquire the property by
any means given to it by law in order to remove the blight. Once
acquired, the Authority may clear the property, rehabilitate the
property, or cause the property to be cleared or rehabilitated. Once
acquired, the Authority shall have the responsibility to maintain the
property in accordance with all applicable City codes.
C. Limitations. The Redevelopment Authority may not exercise any power
under this section unless all the following are true:
(1) The processes in §§ 535-220 through 535-222 above have been
completed.
(2) The Planning Commission has issued its recommendation on the
appropriate reuse of the property.
(3) The Planning Commission has certified that disposition of the
property for residential or related use is in accord with the
Comprehensive Plan. This certification is necessary only where
acquisition is involved.
§ 535-222 ALTOONA CODE § 535-224
C:464
§ 535-225. Certification of restoration.
A. Contract. The Authority may enter into a contract to effect
redevelopment of the property in a specified manner, with the Authority
retaining ownership.
B. Operation. The Authority may retain ownership and operate and
maintain the property.
C. Lease. The Authority may enter into either a short- or long-term lease
with another entity to operate and maintain the property.
D. Disposition, outside of an urban renewal area. The Authority may sell
the property. When selling property acquired under § 535-223B outside
of a designated urban renewal area as described in Article XXX, the
Authority may enter into a sales agreement and attach any such
conditions as it deems necessary to effect proper redevelopment of the
property.
E. Disposition, inside of an urban renewal area. The Authority may sell the
property. When selling property acquired under § 535-223B within a
designated urban renewal area as described in Article XXX, the
Authority must enter into a redevelopment agreement with the buyer.
Such agreement must conform to the requirements of the urban
renewal area, and the form of such agreement must also be approved
by City Council. Such property could also be redeveloped under
Subsection F below.
F. Incorporation into another project. Property acquired under § 535-223B
can also be incorporated into an urban renewal proposal under Article
XXX or into an urban redevelopment program under Article XXXI. In so
doing, the property will be subject to the provisions set forth for the
project into which the property is placed.
A. Upon completion of its redevelopment efforts, the Redevelopment
Authority shall submit the property to the Planning Commission. The
Planning Commission shall then examine and inspect the property to
determine whether the property has been restored to a nonblighted
condition. If the Commission finds that the property has been restored,
it shall certify the property as restored, thereby nullifying the
certification of blight issued previously.
B. In the event a property is not restored within 10 years of the Planning
Commission certifying it as blighted, the certification of blight shall
automatically expire. Such expiration shall not affect any
redevelopment activity undertaken by the Redevelopment Authority to
that date, nor will it relieve the Authority from any responsibilities is
has assumed during the 10 years of blight.

ARTICLE XXXI
Urban Redevelopment Areas
§ 535-226. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to permit the stabilization and rebirth of an
entire neighborhood where significant decay and blight have occurred. It
is the intent of this section that the City and the Redevelopment Authority
work with the targeted neighborhood to achieve a successful revitalization
not to force a proposal onto the residents and businesses located there.
Where there is an urgent need or where the blighted condition of the
targeted neighborhood threatens the stability of adjoining neighborhoods,
the City and Authority may impose an urban renewal area to protect the
larger interests of the City as a whole.
§ 535-227. Preliminary findings.
Prior to the development of any urban redevelopment plan under § 535-228
below, the Planning Commission shall make and certify, by resolution, the
following findings:
A. A certification that the neighborhood targeted is blighted. In finding
that the area is blighted, the Commission shall consider at least the
following factors:
(1) Unsafe, unsanitary, inadequate, or overcrowded conditions in
dwellings.
(2) Excessive land coverage.
(3) Defective design or arrangement of buildings.
(4) Faulty street or lot layout.
(5) Economically or socially undesirable land uses.
(6) Building obsolescence.
(7) Other effects of inadequate planning.
B. A certification of the area as an urban redevelopment area. Such
certification shall include the following factors:
(1) The certification is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
(2) The certification references the certification of blight required
above.
(3) For extraterritorial certifications, the Commission shall make
findings that the certification is in compliance with the
comprehensive plans or community objectives of both the local
municipality and the county in which the area is to be certified.
Absent such documents, the Commission shall find that the goals of
§ 535-226 HOME RULE CHARTER § 535-227
C:467
§ 535-228. Urban redevelopment plan.
the area are consistent with surrounding land uses, streets, and
infrastructure so as to not overburden the neighborhood.
A. Once the Planning Commission makes the requisite preliminary
findings, it shall undertake a study of the redevelopment area to
ascertain exactly what factors are causing the blighting influences and
outline methods to overcome those influences. The results of this study
shall form an urban redevelopment plan. At a minimum, the urban
redevelopment plan shall include the following:
(1) The elements required under Section 10(c) of the Urban
Redevelopment Law.205
(2) A statement on how the redevelopment will integrate into its built,
social, and natural surroundings.
(3) Specific descriptions on the regulatory effects that proposals
arising from the plan will have on the requirements of other parts
of this chapter.
(4) A statement of goals and objectives of the plan as well as a
statement of consistency with the Comprehensive Plan.
(5) A method of amending or appealing specific provisions of the plan
and subsequent proposals.
(6) A definite expiration date of the plan and all proposals. In no case
shall any urban redevelopment plan remain effective for longer
than 20 years from the date it is initially adopted by the Planning
Commission.
B. Upon completing the draft which will be presented for passage, the
Commission shall circulate the document through the
interdepartmental review procedure in Part 10 to solicit comments and
recommendations from other agencies, as well as to make them aware
of the plan. Such comments and recommendations may include
requests from those agencies that the Commission include certain
projects within the scope of the plan.
C. The Commission may, at its discretion, hold a public hearing on the
proposed urban redevelopment plan. Notice of the hearing shall be
published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the
redevelopment area at least two weeks, but not more than three weeks,
prior to the hearing date. The notice shall include the time, date,
location, and purpose of the hearing. The Commission is hereby
encouraged to hold these hearings within the geographic limits of the
redevelopment area or as close as possible thereto.

§ 535-229. Urban redevelopment proposal.
D. The Planning Commission shall adopt the urban redevelopment plan by
resolution at any regularly scheduled meeting.
A. Once the Planning Commission passes the urban redevelopment plan,
the Redevelopment Authority shall, in conformity with the plan, prepare
an urban redevelopment proposal for all or part of the redevelopment
area. The proposal shall, at a minimum, include the following elements:
(1) The urban redevelopment plan from which the proposal is derived.
(2) A project narrative including the background, rationale, objectives,
and goals.
(3) A review of similar or model projects which have achieved
favorable results.
(4) The methodology to be used to achieve the objectives of the plan
and the specific proposal.
(5) A statement of participants and assignment of responsibilities.
(6) The form of the redevelopment contract to be used to implement
the proposal. The redevelopment contract shall comply with
Section 11 of the Urban Redevelopment Law.206
(7) A definite expiration date of proposal. In no case shall any urban
redevelopment proposal remain effective for longer than the plan
from which it is derived, nor shall any proposal run for more than
10 years.
B. Upon completing the draft which will be presented for passage, the
Authority shall circulate the document through the interdepartmental
review procedure in Part 10 to solicit comments and recommendations
from other agencies as well as to make them aware of the proposal.
Such comments and recommendations may include requests from those
agencies that the Authority include certain projects within the scope of
the plan.
C. Once the interdepartmental review is complete, the Authority shall
consider all comments and incorporate those which are deemed
appropriate into the proposal. Once this has been done, the Authority
shall forward the resulting proposal document to the Planning
Commission for its review and recommendation. The Commission shall
have 45 days to submit its recommendations to the Authority and City
Council.
D. The Authority may, at its discretion, hold a public hearing on the
proposed urban redevelopment proposal. Notice of the hearing shall be
published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the

Upon approval of the urban redevelopment proposal by City Council, the
Authority is fully authorized to carry out the proposal by any means
necessary at its disposal; provided, however, that all acts shall comply with
the proposal and the controlling plan promulgated through the procedures
set forth above.
§ 535-231. Altering provisions of urban redevelopment proposal.
The provisions of a plan or proposal under this article may be altered by any
one of the following three methods, unless such plan or proposal specifically
provides an alternate method upon adoption:
redevelopment area at least two weeks, but not more than three weeks,
prior to the hearing date. The notice shall include the time, date,
location, and purpose of the hearing. The Authority is hereby
encouraged to hold these hearings within the geographic limits of the
redevelopment area or as close as possible thereto. This hearing shall
not be held until after the review period in Subsection C of this section
has been completed.
E. The Authority shall then submit the proposal to the City Council with
the Commission's recommendations for final passage.
F. Upon receipt of the proposal, the City Council shall schedule a public
hearing on the proposal in accordance with Section 10(g) of the Urban
Redevelopment Law.207
G. The City Council shall reject or adopt by ordinance the urban
redevelopment proposal at any regularly scheduled meeting in
accordance with Section 10(h) of the Urban Redevelopment Law.208
A. Amendment.
(1) A plan may be amended by the Planning Commission by the same
process by which the plan was originally adopted. No amendment
shall cause the life of the plan to extend beyond 20 years from the
date the plan was originally passed by the Commission. When a
plan is amended, the Authority shall immediately undertake to
amend any affected proposals.
(2) A proposal may be amended through the same process by which
the proposal was originally adopted. No amendment shall cause the
life of the proposal to extend beyond either the life of the plan or 10
years from the date Council originally adopted the proposal,
whichever first occurs.
B. Appeal.

§ 535-232. Certification of restoration.
Upon completion of all proposed activity within any given redevelopment
area, the Planning Commission shall certify the area as restored. Such
certification shall serve to dissolve the certification of blight and the
certification of the redevelopment area. In the event the Commission fails
to make such a certification, it shall be deemed certified upon the tolling
of six months after the final expiration of the controlling plan. A deemed
certification shall have the same effect as one granted by the Commission.
All redevelopment areas previously certified as blighted by the Commission
are hereby certified as restored unless such blight certification was issued
after January 1, 1997.
(1) If a specific provision is detrimental to a specific property, the
owner of the property may appeal to the Altoona City Planning
Commission for relief from that specific provision. The Committee
shall not provide relief unless it is able to make the following
findings:
(a) The relief requested is not contrary to the goals and objectives
set forth in the urban redevelopment plan.
(b) The request is the minimum alteration necessary to provide
relief.
(c) The Authority and Commission have had opportunity to review
and comment on the appeal.
(d) The request is not in violation of the contract form approved by
Council and that, if a redevelopment contract is involved, the
contract can be amended without necessitating amendment of
the plan or proposal.
(e) The request is in harmony with the surrounding built, social,
and natural environment and will not be deleterious to the
public safety, health, and general welfare.
(2) In the event that relief granted by the Committee necessitates a
change in the contract, the Authority shall execute such change as
expeditiously as possible.
C. Contract. If the alteration is simply a need to change the provisions of
the redevelopment contract, the Authority is authorized to make such
change, provided:
(1) The change will not violate the form of contract approved by
Council.
(2) The change is not in violation of the goals and objectives of the plan
or the proposal which the contract seeks to implement.
(3) The change is consistent with the provisions and requirements set
forth in the plan and proposal the contract seeks to implement.

ARTICLE XXXII
Urban Redevelopment Programs
§ 535-233. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to allow the Redevelopment Authority, in
conjunction with the Planning Commission, to carry out redevelopment
financing independent of Articles XXX and XXXI of this Part 8. The primary
intent of this article is to allow the redevelopment of property, buildings,
and facilities in designated areas by the private sector with the assistance
and oversight of the Authority. The provisions of this article may be applied
to residential, commercial, or industrial development. It should be noted
that the provisions of this article are primarily intended to prevent, not
eliminate, blight. However, where this article can assist in eliminating
blight, it may be so used.
§ 535-234. Use compatibility.
Financial assistance may be given to residential, commercial, or industrial
development projects only where such projects are permitted under the
zoning requirements. For purposes of this article, commercial and industrial
uses are considered appropriate if they are listed as permitted uses, special
exception uses, or conditional uses in the zone in which the project is
located. The financing of residential uses is not limited by zoning, but
the compatibility of uses should be considered. The existence of an urban
redevelopment program does not alter any requirements in place for a piece
of land.
§ 535-235. Preparation of urban redevelopment program.
The Redevelopment Authority may, of its own volition or by request, create
an urban redevelopment program for all or part of the City. The program
shall contain documentation consisting of at least the following:
A. The geographic area covered by the program.
B. Whether the program is residential in nature or commercial and
industrial. Programs cannot be both; however, the geographic
boundaries of two or more programs may overlap, regardless of the
type of each program.
C. The potential blighting effects of the current conditions in the program
area.
D. A description of how the program will prevent the blighting effects from
causing further deterioration or destabilization in the program area.
E. A business plan for the program, including the sources of funding.
F. A tentative list of potential projects within the program area.
§ 535-233 HOME RULE CHARTER § 535-236
C:473
§ 535-236. Passage of urban redevelopment program.
Once the program documentation has been prepared, the Authority shall
formally request the Planning Commission to review and approve the
program as proposed. The Planning Commission shall have 45 days to
approve, modify, or reject the program as presented. Failure of the Planning
Commission to act within 45 days shall result in automatic approval on the
46th day.
§ 535-237. Implementation.
Upon approval of a program, the Authority shall have full power and
authority to carry out the provisions of the program within the scope of its
powers and the context of this article. Individual projects shall be approved
as outlined below.
§ 535-238. Residential projects.
Residential projects may be located anywhere in the City so long as proper
approvals are obtained and may be financed to assist in any one of the
following activities:
§ 535-239. Commercial and industrial projects.
Commercial and industrial projects must be located in an area where they
are allowed under zoning, and such project must by its nature have or offer
reasonable likelihood of preventing, reversing, or slowing the deterioration
of the program area. These projects may be financed for any one of the
following activities:
§ 535-240. Project preparation.
The Authority may, on its own volition or by request, initiate a project to
carry out the provisions of an urban redevelopment program. Projects shall
A. Purchase.
B. Rehabilitation.
C. Construction.
D. Demolition.
E. Equipping.
A. Purchase.
B. Rehabilitation.
C. Construction.
D. Demolition.
E. Equipping.

C:474
be documented as to how they will further the goals of the program, how
they are consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, and contain a financial
plan so the Authority can ascertain the investment is sound. All projects
shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission for consistency with the
Comprehensive Plan and sound planning practice. The Commission shall
have 45 days to review the project and make its recommendations to the
Authority on the project.
§ 535-241. Project implementation.
Once the Planning Commission's comments are received, or after the 46th
day, the Authority shall take whatever steps it deems are necessary to
implement the project. Such action may include contracts, loans,
mortgages, liens, or any other action.
§ 535-242. Reviews.
A program and its related projects shall be reviewed at least every five years
to ensure the program and its related projects are current. The Authority
may alter any program or related project in compliance with all applicable
law and the procedures contained in this article for passage of the same.
§ 535-243. Expiration.
A program shall automatically expire at the end of 10 years from the
approval of the Planning Commission, unless extended by a majority vote of
the Authority and a majority vote of the Commission. A project commenced
under a program may continue for as long as is negotiated at the start of
the project; however, it may not be further extended once the program from
which it is derived has expired.

reinspection fee shall be assessed on the fifth and 10th days thereafter

(e) Such other measures as may be required by the City due to any
unique circumstances related to the area in question.
(2) Furnish, and/or cause to be furnished, prior to the issuance of any
such permit, an irrevocable letter of credit from a state or federally
chartered and insured lending institution and/or bond or other type
of financial security (collectively "financial security"), to the City of
Altoona in the amount of 110% of the total cost estimate for
replacement of that part of the street, alley, sidewalk and/or other

§ 555-7 ALTOONA CODE § 558-1
C:574
§ 558-2. Purpose and intent.
A. The social and economic vitality of the City of Altoona is adversely
affected by vacant, abandoned, and tax-delinquent properties.
B. These properties continuously impose significant costs on residents,
taxpayers and neighborhoods throughout the City by lowering property
values, decreasing tax revenues, increasing fire and police protection
costs, and diminishing quality of life.
C. There is an overriding public need to confront the problems caused by
vacant, abandoned and tax delinquent properties by using all available
and appropriate tools to return these problem properties to productive
use, thereby revitalizing neighborhoods and strengthening the City's
tax base.
D. A land bank is a proven tool for local governments to systematically
remove problem properties from an endless cycle of vacancy,
abandonment and tax foreclosure, and return them to productive use.
E. Extensive grassroots community planning, including the report of the
City of Altoona Blight Task Force, has recommended the use of a land
bank to support blight removal and strategic redevelopment in the City
of Altoona.
F. Under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, certain eligible
counties and municipalities may create a land bank (Act 153 of 2012) or
designate a redevelopment authority to act as a land bank (Act 33 of
2018).242
G. Designating the City of Altoona Redevelopment Authority to act as a
land bank will confer the powers and duties of a land bank on the
Redevelopment Authority and the benefits of a land bank on the City of
Altoona without the need to establish a separate entity, thereby saving
administrative costs and promoting governmental efficiency.
A. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to designate the City of
Altoona Redevelopment Authority to act as a land bank for the City of
Altoona as authorized by Act 33 of 2018, P.L. 221, an enactment of the
Pennsylvania General Assembly signed by the Governor on June 19,
2018, amending the Pennsylvania Land Bank Law, 68 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 2101
through 2120.
B. By designating the Redevelopment Authority to act as a land bank for
the City of Altoona, the Council of the City of Altoona intends to
facilitate the return of vacant, abandoned, tax delinquent and blighted
properties to productive use, combat community deterioration, improve
the quality of neighborhoods, foster economic growth, and spur
reinvestment.

determined to serve the general public interest may reduce storage,

Day and at such other times as may be announced by the City
in situations considered to be an emergency by the City. If
regular collection occurs in a particular zone on any of such
holidays, the collection for all zones which have yet to have
collection occur the week of said holiday shall be delayed until
the following day for each such zone. For example, if a holiday
falls on a Monday, collection in Zone 1 would occur on Tuesday
of that week instead of Monday, and collection in Zone 2 would
occur on Wednesday of that week instead of Tuesday, and so
on. In the event a holiday falls on a Thursday, collection in Zone
4 would occur on the Friday of that week; however, collection
in all other zones would not be affected. Any time and date of
collection may, at any time, be changed by resolution of the
City Council of the City of Altoona.
(2) Hours of collection. The collection of municipal waste, other refuse
material and/or recyclables at residential establishments and/or
multifamily dwellings having more than four units per structure,
shall only occur between the hours of 5:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on
any single day of collection and shall not occur at any other time,
unless otherwise provided herein or by the City. In the event the
City declares a weather emergency or like situation, collection of
said waste and recyclables may continue to take place during the
above-stated hours; however, said collection will be permitted to
also take place between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. the
Friday following the termination of such weather emergency or like
situation unless otherwise announced by the City. In the event the
weather emergency or like situation is of a severe nature, as the
same shall be announced by the City, no such collection shall take
place during such time but shall be permitted to occur the Friday
following the termination thereof between the hours of 3:00 a.m.
and 6:00 p.m., unless otherwise instructed by the City. All
declarations and/or announcements by the City with regard to

ARTICLE I
Erosion and Sedimentation Control
§ 620-1. Scope.
A. It shall be unlawful for any person, landowner, business or corporation
to undertake any earthmoving activities without developing,
implementing, and maintaining erosion and sedimentation control
measures and facilities that effectively minimize accelerated erosion
and prevent sediment pollution to waters of the commonwealth, both
during and after construction. These controls shall be contained in an
erosion and sedimentation control plan that meets the requirements of
the Department of Environmental Protection (25 Pa. Code, Chapter
102, Erosion and Sediment Control Regulations). An approved copy of
the erosion and sedimentation control plan must be available at the
earthmoving site at all times. An additional approved copy must be
provided by the applicant to the Director of the City of Altoona
Inspections Department and to the Director of Public Works.
B. Prior to the commencement of any improvement which involves an
earthmoving disturbance greater than 5,000 square feet, all erosion
and sedimentation control plans must be submitted by the applicant to,
and approved by, the Blair County Conservation District prior to formal
approval of land development plans or the issuance of any building or
other permit by the City of Altoona. In addition, all earthmoving
disturbances for sites involving one acre or more and/or runoff to the
storm sewer or one acre or more will require that the appropriate
Department of Environmental Protection permit and review be
obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection or the Blair
County Conservation District.
C. All Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and/or Blair
County Conservation District permits reviews involving earthmoving
disturbances shall be attached to said approved plan and shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to obtain. Copies of the approved erosion
and sedimentation control plans must be submitted to the City of
Altoona Department of Inspections, and the City Engineering
Department.
D. All earthmoving activities less than 5,000 square feet shall be exempt
from plan and permit approvals; however, all other provisions of this
article shall apply. Best management practices must be implemented to
prevent sediment from leaving the site.
E. For all regulated earth disturbance activities, erosion and sediment
control best management practices shall be designed, implemented,
operated, and maintained during the regulated earth disturbance
activities (e.g. during construction) to meet the purposes and
requirements of this chapter and to meet all requirements under Title
25 of the Pennsylvania Code and the Clean Streams Law.264 Various best

ARTICLE II
Stormwater Management
§ 620-9. General Provisions.
A. Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as "Altoona
Stormwater Management Regulations."
B. Statement of findings. The City Council of the City of Altoona finds that:
(1) Stormwater runoff from lands modified by human activities
threatens public health and safety by causing increased runoff
flows and velocities, which overtaxes the carrying capacity of
existing streams and storm sewers causing flooding, loss of water
quality, and greatly increases the cost of public facilities to convey
and manage stormwater.
(2) Inadequate planning and management of stormwater runoff, as
well as inadequate maintenance of stormwater facilities and best
management practices (BMPs), resulting from land development
and redevelopment throughout a watershed can also harm surface
water resources by changing the natural hydrologic patterns,
accelerating stream flows (which increase scour and erosion of
stream beds and stream banks thereby elevating sedimentation
and aggregation), destroying aquatic habitat and elevating aquatic
pollutant concentrations and loadings such as sediments, nutrients,
heavy metals, and pathogens.
(3) These impacts happen mainly through a decrease in natural
infiltration of stormwater, with groundwater resources impacted
through loss of recharge for water supplies and base flow of
streams, which protects and maintains surface water quality.
(4) A comprehensive program of stormwater management, including
reasonable regulation of development and other activities causing
loss of natural infiltration, is fundamental to the public health,
safety, welfare, and the protection of the people of the City of
Altoona, and all the people of the commonwealth including the
greater Susquehanna River/Chesapeake Bay Watershed, their
resources and the environment.
(5) Stormwater is an important resource. Public education on the
control of pollution from stormwater is an essential component in
successfully addressing stormwater and stormwater management
issues.
(6) Federal and state regulations require the City to implement a
program of stormwater controls. The City is required to obtain a
federal permit for stormwater discharges from its storm sewer
systems under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES).
§ 620-9 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-9
C:643
(7) Permittees are required to enact, implement, and enforce a
prohibition of nonstormwater connections and discharges to their
separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) under their NPDES permit.
Nonstormwater discharges to separate storm sewer systems can
contribute to pollution of waters of the commonwealth by the City.
C. Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to promote the public
health, safety and welfare within the City and its watershed by
minimizing the damages and maximizing the benefits described in
§ 620-9 of this article by provisions designed to:
(1) Assure safe management of stormwater runoff resulting from land
alteration and disturbance activities in accordance with watershed
stormwater management plans adopted pursuant to the
Pennsylvania Stormwater Management Act265 (Act 167 of 1975, as
amended).
(2) Utilize and preserve existing natural drainage systems to the
extent possible, and to preserve the flood carrying capacity of
streams.
(3) Encourage natural infiltration of rainfall to preserve groundwater
recharge supplies and stream flows, and to prevent degradation of
surface and groundwater quality and to otherwise protect water
resources.
(4) Provide for proper and adequate operation and maintenance of all
permitted stormwater management facilities and stormwater
management BMPS within the municipality.
(5) Provide standards to achieve compliance with the requirements of
the City's stormwater NPDES permit requirements.
(6) Provide review procedures, performance standards, and design
criteria for stormwater planning and management.
(7) Meet legal water quality requirements under federal and state law,
including the regulations of 25 Pa. Code Chapter 93 to protect,
maintain, reclaim, and restore the existing and designated uses and
maintain the level of water quality to support those uses in all
waters of the commonwealth, and to protect and maintain water
quality in special protection streams.
(8) Prevent stream bank and streambed scour and erosion.
(9) Manage stormwater impacts close to the runoff source, which
requires a minimum of structures and relies on natural processes.
(10) Implement an illegal discharge detection and elimination program
to address nonstormwater discharges into the separate storm
sewer system.

§ 620-9 ALTOONA CODE § 620-9
C:644
D. Statutory authority. The City also is empowered to regulate land use
activities that affect runoff by the authority of the Act of July 31, 1968,
P.L. 805, No. 247. The Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, as
amended, and/or the Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 864 (Act 167), 32 P.S.
§ 680.1 et seq., as amended, the Stormwater Management Act.
E. Applicability. All regulated activities and all activities involving
alteration, land development, or earth disturbance deemed to have
possible effects upon stormwater runoff characteristics and/or any
activity that may contribute nonstormwater discharges to a regulated
MS4 are included within the scope and subject to regulation by this
chapter. Examples include, but are not limited to:
(1) Subdivision or parcels of subdivision.
(2) Land development.
(3) Construction of new or additional impervious surfaces with
reduced permeability (driveways, parking lots, etc.).
(4) Installation, additions, replacement or substantial repair of
stormwater systems or appurtenances.
(5) All earthmoving activities, including but not limited to those as
regulated or required by the Erosion and Sediment Pollution
Control Ordinance of the City of Altoona.
(6) Placement of fill, structure(s), or pipe(s) in the floodplains, as
designated on the official floodplain map and as may be
documented by other pertinent sources of floodplain information
used by the City.
(7) Construction of new buildings or additions to existing buildings.
(8) Forest management operations.
(9) Nursery operations.
(10) Diversion or piping of any natural or man-made stream channel.
(11) Mining operations.
(12) In general, this article applies to any land development activities
within the City, all stormwater runoff entering into the separate
storm sewer system from lands within the City, as well as existing
and proposed stormwater best management practices.
(13) Stormwater activities are also regulated under existing state or
federal law and their implementing regulations. The article shall
operate in conjunction with those parallel requirements; the
requirement of this article shall be no less restrictive in meeting
these purposes than state or federal law.

chapter, nonstructural BMPs or measures refer to operational and/
or behavior-related practices that attempt to minimize the contact
of pollutants with stormwater runoff whereas structural BMPs or
measures are those that consist of a physical device or practice that
is installed to capture and/or treat stormwater runoff. Structural
BMPs include, but are not limited to, a wide variety of practices
and devices, from large-scale retention ponds and constructed
wetlands, to small-scale underground treatment systems,
infiltration facilities, filter strips, low impact design, bioretention,
wet ponds, permeable paving, grassed swales, riparian or forested

four HSGs (A, B, C, and D) according to their minimum infiltration
rate, which is obtained for bare soil after prolonged wetting. The
NRCS defines the four groups and provides a list of most of the
soils in the United States and their group classification. The soils
in the area of the development site may be identified from a soil
survey report that can be obtained from local NRCS offices or
conservation district offices. Soils become less pervious as the HSG
varies from A to D.

development activity differs significantly from the total site
area, only the proposed impact area shall be subject to the
runoff criteria; however, the entire site will be considered for
total runoff.
(2) Storm frequencies.
(a) Stormwater management facilities on all development sites
shall control the peak stormwater rates of discharge for the
two-, five-, ten-, twenty-five-, fifty-, and one-hundred-year
storm frequencies. At a minimum, the United States
Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation
Service (USDA NRCS) twenty-four-hour, Type II Rainfall
Distribution or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Precipitation-Frequency Atlas of the
United States, Atlas 14, Volume 2, version 3.0 shall be used for
analyzing stormwater runoff for both pre- and postdevelopment
conditions. The twenty-four-hour total rainfall for
these storm frequencies in the watershed are:
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:687
Storm Frequency
Rainfall Depth
(inches)
2-year 2.7
5-year 3.3
10-year 3.9
25-year 4.7
50-year 5.3
100-year 6.1
(b) If at any time, the United States Department of Agriculture
Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA NCRS) or the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
updates the rainfall depths for these storm frequencies, the
new data shall be used.
(3) Volume control. The low impact development practices provided in
the BMP Manual shall be utilized for all regulated activities to the
maximum extent practicable. Water volume controls shall be
implemented using the design storm method in Subsection A or the
simplified method in Subsection B. For regulated activity areas
equal or less than one acre that do not require hydrologic routing
to design the stormwater facilities, this chapter establishes no
preference for either methodology.
(a) The Design Storm Method (CG-1 in the BMP Manual) is
applicable to any size of regulated activity. This method
requires detailed modeling based on site conditions.
[1] Do not increase the post development total runoff volume
for all storms equal to or less than the two-year twentyfour-
hour precipitation duration.
[2] For modeling purposes:
[a] Existing (predevelopment) non-forested pervious
areas must be considered meadow in good condition
unless the natural ground cover generates a lower
curve number (i.e., forest).
[b] Twenty percent of existing impervious area, when
present, shall be considered meadow in good
condition in the model for existing conditions.
(b) The simplified method (CG-2) in the BMP manual provided
below is independent of site conditions and should be used if
the design storm method is not followed. This method is not
applicable to regulated areas greater than one acre or for
projects that require hydrologic routing to design stormwater
storage facilities. For new impervious surfaces:
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:688
[1] Stormwater facilities shall capture at least the first two
inches of runoff from all new impervious surfaces.
[2] At least the first one inch of runoff from new impervious
surfaces shall be permanently removed from the runoff
flow i.e., it shall not be released into the surface waters of
the commonwealth. Removal options include reuse,
evaporation, transpiration, and infiltration.
[3] Whenever possible, infiltration facilities should be
designed to accommodate infiltration of the entire
permanently removed runoff; however, in all cases at least
the first 0.5 inch of the permanently removed runoff
should be infiltrated.
(4) Calculation methods.
(a) Development sites. For the purpose of computing peak flow
rates and runoff hydrographs from development sites,
calculations shall be performed using one of the following:
United States Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources
Conservation Service (USDA NRCS) publications, Technical
Release (TR) 55 or 20, HEC I or Penn State Runoff Model
(PSRM) or Modified Rational Method. Under special
circumstances, other computation methods may be used,
subject to the approval of the City of Altoona. The designer
must list or identify the method and resources used in the
stormwater design report or narrative.
(b) Stormwater collection/conveyance facilities. For the purposes
of designing storm sewers, open swales and other stormwater
runoff collection and conveyance facilities, the Rational
Method or other method as approved by the City of Altoona
may be applied. Current rainfall intensities for design should
be obtained from the United States Department of
Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service, NOAA,
or the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation rainfall
charts (the more restrictive of the three shall apply).
(c) Routing of hydrographs through detention/retention facilities
for the purpose of designing those facilities shall be
accomplished using the recognized reservoir routing methods,
subject to the approval of the Stormwater Officer.
(d) Predevelopment conditions. Predevelopment conditions shall
be assumed to be those which exist on any site prior to
commencing any development activities. Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS, formerly "SCS") runoff curve
numbers selected for use in the calculations shall accurately
reflect existing conditions subject to the approval of the City of
Altoona. The runoff curve number is based on the area's
hydrologic soil group, land use, treatment and hydrologic
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:689
condition. References, such as those from the USDA indicate
the runoff curve numbers for characteristic land cover
descriptions and a hydrologic soil group. See Appendix A for
Table 2-2a273 from SCS TR-55. At its discretion, the City of
Altoona may direct that hydrologic conditions for all areas
with pervious cover (i.e., fields, woods, lawn areas, pastures,
cropland, etc.) shall be assumed to be in "good" condition,
and the lowest recommended Natural Resources Conservation
Service (NRCS) runoff curve number (CN) shall be applied for
all pervious land uses within the respective range for each
land use and hydrologic soil group. Use CN values for specific
conditions, i.e. grass, paved area, gravel, dirt, etc. Average
values, such as those for urban or residential districts, are
discouraged and their use prohibited unless necessary.
Impervious cover shall include, but not be limited to, any roof,
parking, or driveway areas, and any new streets and sidewalks.
Any areas designed to initially be aggregate, gravel or crushed
stone shall be considered impervious (use the highest CN value
for Impervious) for the purposes of the stormwater design
and these criteria. The Stormwater Officer has the authority
to require that computed existing runoff rates be reconciled
with field observations and conditions. If the designer can
substantiate through actual physical calibration that more
appropriate runoff values should be used at a particular site,
then appropriate variations may be made upon review and
recommendations of the Stormwater Officer. Calibration shall
require detailed gauge and rainfall data for the particular site
in question.
(e) As required by DEP's Pennsylvania Stormwater Best
Management Practices Manual's model for existing conditions,
all redevelopment sites must consider 20% of existing
impervious surfaces to be meadow in good condition for
predevelopment calculations.
(f) Calculations for any development site one acre or less should
be calculated in square feet. Calculations for sites greater than
on acre may be calculated in acres.
(5) Stormwater quality management requirements.
(a) Applicability. In addition to the other performance standards
and design criteria requirements of this article, the land
developer shall implement the following water quality
requirements unless otherwise exempted by the provisions of
this article.
(b) Water quality requirements.
273. Editor's Note: Said appendix is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:690
[1] No regulated activities within the City of Altoona shall
commence until approval by the City of Altoona of a plan
which demonstrates compliance with state water quality
requirements after construction is complete.
[2] Stormwater best management practices must be designed,
implemented, and maintained to meet all applicable state
water quality requirements in effect at the time of design/
submission.
[3] To control postconstruction stormwater impacts from
regulated activities, state water quality requirements can
be met by BMPs, including site design, which provide for
replication of preconstruction stormwater infiltration and
runoff conditions, so that postconstruction discharges do
not degrade the physical, chemical, or biological
characteristics of the receiving waters. This may be
achieved by, but not limited to, the following:
[a] Infiltration: replication of preconstruction stormwater
infiltration conditions.
[b] Treatment: use of water quality treatment BMPs to
ensure removal of the chemical and physical
pollutants from the stormwater runoff.
[c] Stream bank and streambed protection: management
of volume and rate of postconstruction stormwater
discharges to prevent physical degradation of
receiving waters (e.g., from scouring).
[4] Provisions for the assurance of long-term operations and
maintenance of BMPs must be provided in accordance
with § 5.
[5] Acceptable stormwater management BMPs must be
provided to manage the net increase in stormwater runoff
volume from the land development activities from a two-,
ten-, twenty-five-, and one-hundred-year/twenty-four-hour
frequency storm. A two-year/twenty-four-hour frequency
storm equates to 2.6 inches of rainfall occurring over a
twenty-four-hour period.
[6] Evidence of any necessary permit(s) for earth disturbance
activities from the appropriate DEP or soil conservation
district office must be provided to the City of Altoona.
(c) BMP selection criteria.
[1] BMP selection and application shall be in accordance with
guidance provided in the BMP manuals published by the
Department of Environmental Protection. In selecting the
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:691
appropriate BMPs or combinations thereof, the land
developer shall consider the following:
[a] Total contributing area.
[b] Permeability and infiltration rate of the site soils.
[c] Slope and depth to bedrock and other applicable
geological features.
[d] Seasonal high water table.
[e] Proximity to building foundations and wellheads.
[f] Erodibility of soils.
[g] Land availability and configuration/slope of the
topography.
[2] The following additional factors should be considered
when evaluating the suitability of the BMPs used to control
water quality at a given development site:
[a] Peak discharge and required volume control.
[b] Soil or stream bank erosion.
[c] Efficiency of the BMPs to mitigate potential water
quality problems.
[d] The volume of runoff that will be effectively treated.
[e] The nature of the pollutant(s) being removed.
[f] Maintenance requirements.
[g] Recreation value.
[h] Enhancement of aesthetics and property values.
[3] Refer to Appendix B for worksheets 11,12, and 13 from the
PA Stormwater BMP manual.
B. Design criteria for stormwater management controls.
(1) General criteria.
(a) Applicants may select runoff control techniques, or a
combination of techniques, which are most suitable to control
stormwater runoff from the development site. All controls shall
be subject to approval of the Stormwater Officer. The
Stormwater Officer may request specific information on design
and/or operating features of the proposed stormwater controls
in order to determine their suitability and adequacy in terms of
the standards of this chapter.
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:692
(b) The applicant should consider the effect of the proposed
stormwater management techniques on any special soil
conditions or geological hazards which may exist on the
development site. In the event such conditions are identified on
the site, the Stormwater Officer may require in-depth studies
by a competent geotechnical engineer. Not all stormwater
control methods may be advisable or allowable at a particular
development site.
(c) In developing a stormwater management plan for a particular
site, stormwater controls shall be selected according to the
following order of preference:
[1] Infiltration and/or treatment of runoff on site.
[2] Flow attenuation by use of open vegetated swales and
natural depressions.
[3] Stormwater detention/retention structures.
(d) Infiltration practices shall be used to the extent practicable to
reduce volume increases and promote groundwater recharge.
A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve
the applicable minimum control requirements. Justification
shall be provided by the applicant for rejecting each of the
preferred practices based on actual site conditions.
(2) Criteria for infiltration systems.
(a) Infiltration systems shall be sized and designed based upon
local soil and groundwater conditions as well as subsurface
geological features. Provide percolation test results and indepth
studies by a competent Geotechnical Engineer.
(b) Infiltration BMPs should be spread out, made as shallow as
practicable, and located to maximize use of natural on-site
infiltration features while still meeting the other requirements
of this chapter. Infiltration systems greater than three feet
deep shall be located a minimum of 10 feet from basement
walls.
(c) Infiltration systems shall not be used to handle runoff from
commercial or industrial working or parking areas. This
prohibition does not extend to roof areas which are
demonstrated to be suitably protected from the effects of the
commercial/industrial activities. Consideration and approval
may be given to commercial infiltration systems on a case-bycase
basis, provided the stormwater is clean and/or is treated
in a water quality device prior to being infiltrated. Pretreated
water will meet the requirements of the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection.
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:693
(d) Infiltration systems once installed may not receive
construction traffic which could affect the design and/or
working integrity of the system.
(e) Infiltration systems may not receive runoff until the entire
drainage area to the system has received final stabilization.
(f) The stormwater infiltration facility design shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a nonerosive
velocity of flow along its length and at the outfall.
(g) Roof drain stormwater infiltration systems shall provide a
volume of at least one cubic foot for every two square feet of
roof surface.
(3) Criteria for attenuation facilities.
(a) If flow-attenuation facilities are employed to assist in the
control of peak rates of discharge, their effects must be
quantified using the NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation
Service) Technical Release (TR) 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, or other approved method. The effects of the flowattenuation
facilities on travel time should be reflected in the
calculations.
(b) Flow-attenuation facilities such as swales and natural
depressions should be properly graded to ensure positive
drainage and avoid prolonged ponding of water.
(c) Swales shall be properly vegetated and stabilized or otherwise
lined to prevent erosion.
(d) Swales shall be designed according to the recommendations
contained in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Erosion and
Sediment Pollution Control Program Manual and the
Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual.
(e) Swales, ditches, etc., that are equal to or in excess of 15%
grade shall be rock-lined or designed with an approved energy
dissipater. Rock lining may be required regardless of the slope
or for any reason by the Stormwater Officer.
(4) Criteria for stormwater detention facilities.
(a) All detention facilities including wet ponds, rain gardens, bioretention
areas, etc. will be per the design criteria in the
Pennsylvania Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual
and shall be equipped with outlet structures to provide
discharge control for the four designated storm frequencies.
Provisions shall also be made to safely pass the postdevelopment
one-hundred-year storm runoff with a minimum
of one foot of freeboard without damaging or impairing the
continued function of the facilities. Should any stormwater
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:694
management facilities qualify as a dam under Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection Chapter 105, the
facility shall be designed in accordance with those regulations
and meet the regulations concerning dam safety.
(b) Shared-storage facilities which provide detention of runoff for
more than one development site within a single sub area are
encouraged wherever feasible, and provided such facilities
meet the criteria contained in this section. In addition, runoff
from the development sites involved shall be conveyed to the
facility in a manner that avoids adverse impacts (such as
flooding or erosion) to channels and properties located
between the development site and the shared-storage
facilities.
(c) Where detention facilities will be utilized, multiple use
facilities, such as wetlands, lakes, ballfields or similar
recreational/open space uses are encouraged wherever
feasible, subject to the approval of the City of Altoona and
compliance with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection Chapter 105 Regulations.
(d) Other considerations which should be incorporated into the
design of the detention facilities include:
[1] Stormwater system shall be the first thing constructed
unless otherwise noted in writing by the City.
[2] Inflow and outflow structures shall be designed and
installed to prevent erosion, and bottoms of impoundmenttype
structures should be protected from soil erosion.
[3] Control and removal of debris both in the storage
structure and in all inlet or outlet devices shall be a design
consideration.
[4] Inflow and outflow structures, pumping stations, and other
structures shall be designed and protected to minimize
safety hazards.
[5] The water depth at the perimeter of a storage pond should
be limited to that which is safe for children. Current
chapters require restriction of access by use of fencing,
refer to [10] below. Further restriction of access (i.e. walls,
etc.) may be necessary depending on the location of the
facility and/or the maximum depths of water.
[6] Side slope of storage ponds shall not exceed a ratio of 2 1/
2 to one (2.5:1) horizontal-to-vertical dimension.
[7] Landscaping shall be provided for the facility which
harmonizes with the surrounding area. Native
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:695
(noninvasive) woody and herbaceous vegetation and tree
planting is encouraged for shading, water quality, and site
enhancement.
[8] Facility shall be located to facilitate maintenance,
considering the frequency and type of equipment that will
be required. All detention ponds shall be provided with a
suitable access road with a minimum width of 12 feet
located within a twenty-foot minimum easement.
[9] Bottoms of detention basins should be graded with
sufficient slope to provide positive surface drainage. A subdrainage
system may be required, depending on the
location of the pond bottom relative to groundwater levels.
Note: This is not to be interpreted as an exclusion of wet
ponds, bioretention areas, and basins with forebays,
islands, or other permitted stormwater structures that
may have irregular bottoms as a design feature.
[10] Fencing shall be provided around the entire perimeter for
all above ground retention/detention stormwater facilities.
The height of the fence shall be a minimum of six feet. A
double gate having a minimum width of 12 feet shall be
installed to provide access to the stormwater detention
basin. A written variance may be requested/submitted if
the proposed facility meets the following three criteria:
[a] Maximum possible ponding depth of 12 inches or less.
[b] Maximum side slopes of the facility are three
horizontal to one vertical (3:1).
[c] Calculations are provided to demonstrate the facility
will dewater within 48 hours of a storm event.
[11] Where any tract is traversed by a watercourse,
drainageway, channel, stream, etc., there shall be provided
a drainage easement, conforming substantially with the
line of such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream,
of such width as will be adequate to: preserve the
unimpeded flow of natural drainage; or encompass the
widening, deepening, improving or protecting of such
drainage facilities. An existing watercourse, drainageway,
channel, or stream location shall be changed only when
approved by the City of Altoona.
[12] Natural drainageways shall be utilized to the maximum
extent possible in carrying stormwater runoff.
[13] Erosion and sedimentation. All earthmoving activities shall
be conducted in such a way as to minimize accelerated
erosion and resulting sedimentation. Measures to control
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:696
erosion and sedimentation shall at a minimum meet the
standards of the Conservation District and Chapter 102
(Erosion and Sedimentation Control) of Title 25 Pa. Code,
Rules and Regulations of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, and Article XV of Part 4 of this
chapter.
[14] All structures are to be located and sited to minimize the
risk of flooding of said structures. When the elevation of
any entrance, including windows, to a structure, whether
existing or to be constructed on a site, is lower than the
elevation of the public cartway serving that site, the site
plan which includes construction or alteration of the
structure(s) and/or grading shall show a method to
minimize the risk of flooding from drainage moving from
the public cartway.
[15] In areas underlain with limestone geology, detention and
retention ponds shall be lined. If at any time a sinkhole
develops in a pond or channel, a lining shall be required to
be installed by the developer. Stormwater resulting from
land development shall not be discharged into sinkholes.
[16] Methods of stormwater detention/retention and control
which are designed to result in the surface accumulation
of ponding may be enclosed, at the discretion of the City.
Said enclosure shall be designed to restrict access to
unauthorized individuals only, while providing
maintenance capabilities.
[17] Any stormwater management facility required or
regulated by this chapter shall be designed to provide an
emergency spillway to handle flow up to and including the
one-hundred-year post-development conditions. The
height of embankment must be set as to provide a
minimum one foot of freeboard above the maximum pool
elevation computed when the facility functions for the onehundred-
year post-development inflow. However, criteria
for design and construction of stormwater management
facilities are not the same criteria that are used in
permitting of dams under the Department of
Environmental Protection's Dam Safety Program.
Depending upon the physical characteristics of a dam, a
dam permit may be required, and the design will have to
meet the provisions of the Dam Safety and Encroachments
Act, as amended, Chapter 105 of Title 25 of the
Pennsylvania Code. Depending on the physical
characteristics of a dam, the design could require that
anywhere from a fifty-year to a "probable maximum flood"
storm event be considered.
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:697
[18] A percolation test may be required after an evaluation of
the soil profile indicates that soils may be suitable for an
on-lot stormwater runoff control system. In accordance
with DEP requirements, applicable geotechnical
information, percolation test results, infiltration test pit
results, test location map, etc., will be submitted along
with the stormwater plans and/or narratives for
stormwater review. Refer to the Pennsylvania Stormwater
Best Management Practices Manual for test criteria.
[19] Construction criteria for stormwater management
facilities shall be in accordance with the approved plans
and accompanying specifications.
[20] Cut-and-fill slopes shall be no steeper than two horizontal
to one vertical feet, unless substantiated data justifying
steeper slopes, presented by a professional engineer, are
submitted to and approved by the City of Altoona. If fill is
used, it shall:
[a] Consist of soil or small rock materials only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted.
[b] Be compacted to provide the necessary permeability
and resistance to erosion, scouring, setting or
settlement.
[c] Be used to the extent to which it does not adversely
affect adjacent properties.
[d] Meet the requirements of Standards Specifications 
Form A, General Technical Provisions, Section 1,
Earthwork, of the City of Altoona.274
C. Design criteria for collection/conveyance facilities.
(1) Criteria for collection and conveyance facilities: All stormwater
runoff collection or conveyance facilities, whether storm sewers,
open or closed channels, or other shall be designed in accordance
with the following criteria:
(a) All sites shall be graded to provide positive drainage away from
and around structures. This will help in preventing any
potential flooding damage. If not provided, the City may
require a grading and drainage plan.
(b) Lots located on the high side of streets shall extend roof,
French drains, and other stormwater discharges to the curb
line and/or storm sewer (if applicable). Low side lots shall
extend roof, French drains, and other stormwater discharges
274. Editor's Note: Said standards and specifications are on file in the City's offices.
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:698
to a stormwater collection/conveyance/control system or
natural watercourse in accordance with the approved
stormwater management plan for the development site.
(c) Collection/conveyance facilities should not be installed parallel
and close to the top or bottom of a major embankment to avoid
the possibility of failing or causing the embankment to fail.
(d) All collection/conveyance facilities shall be designed to convey
the twenty-five-year storm peak flow rate from the contributing
drainage area and to carry it to the nearest suitable outlet such
as a stormwater control facility, curbed street, storm sewer or
natural watercourse without damage to the drainage structure
or roadway, with runoff from the twenty-five-year design storm
at a minimum one foot of freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway. Roadway crossings located
within designated floodplain areas must be able to convey
runoff from a one-hundred-year design storm with a minimum
of one-and-one-half-foot freeboard measured below the lowest
point along the top of the roadway.
[1] When it can be shown that, due to topographic conditions,
natural drainageways on the site cannot adequately
provide for drainage, open channels may be constructed
conforming substantially to the line and grade of such
natural drainageways. Work within natural drainageways
shall be subject to approval by Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Protection through the joint permit
application process or, where appropriate, by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
through the general permit process.
(e) Where drainage swales or open channels are used, they shall
be suitably lined to prevent erosion and designed with energy
dissipaters to avoid excessive velocities. Swales, ditches, etc.
that are equal to or in excess of 15% grade shall be rock-lined
or designed with an approved energy dissipater. Rock lining
may be required regardless of the slope or for any reason by
the Stormwater Officer. The minimum size rock shall be R4.
(f) Stormwater drainage systems shall be provided in order to
permit unimpeded flow along natural watercourses, except as
modified by stormwater management facilities or open
channels consistent with this chapter.
(g) Existing points of concentrated drainage that discharge onto
adjacent property shall not be altered without permission of
the altered property's owner(s) and shall be subject to any
applicable discharge criteria specified in this chapter.
(h) Areas of existing diffused drainage discharge shall be subject
to any applicable discharge criteria in the general direction of
§ 620-12 HOME RULE CHARTER § 620-12
C:699
existing discharge, whether proposed to be concentrated or
maintained as diffused drainage areas, except as otherwise
provided by this chapter. If diffused flow is proposed to be
concentrated and discharged onto adjacent property, the
developer must document that adequate downstream
conveyance facilities exist to safely transport the concentrated
discharge or otherwise prove that no erosion, sedimentation,
flooding, or other harm will result from the concentrated
discharge.
(i) Where a development site is traversed by watercourses,
drainage easements shall be provided conforming to the line of
such watercourses. The terms of the easements shall prohibit
excavation, the placing of fill or structures, and any alterations
that may adversely affect the flow of stormwater within any
portion of the easement. Maintenance within the easement
shall be required. Mowing of vegetation will be subject to
approval by the Stormwater Officer.
(j) Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this article
that would be located in or adjacent to waters of the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or wetlands shall be subject to
approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Protection through the joint permit application process or,
where deemed appropriate by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection, the general permit process. When
there is a question whether wetlands may be involved, it is the
responsibility of the developer or his or her agent to show that
the land in question cannot be classified as wetlands;
otherwise, approval to work in the area must be obtained by
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
(k) Any stormwater management facilities regulated by this
Article that would be located on federal or state highway
rights-of-way shall be subject to approval by the appropriate
governing agency having jurisdiction.
(l) In order to promote overland flow and infiltration/percolation
of runoff where it is advantageous to do so, roof drains must
not be connected to streets, sanitary or storm sewers, or
roadside ditches. When it is more advantageous to connect
directly to streets or storm sewers, then it shall be permitted
on a case-by-case basis by the Stormwater Officer.
(m) Stormwater drainage, including roof drains, from any new
construction shall not be connected to the sanitary sewer
system.
(2) Criteria for proposed storm sewers: Wherever storm sewers are
proposed to be utilized, they shall comply with the following
criteria:
§ 620-12 ALTOONA CODE § 620-12
C:700
(a) Where practical, designed to traverse under seeded and
planted areas. If constructed within 10 feet of road paving,
walks or other surfaced areas, storm sewers or drains shall
have the minimum allowable trench and maximum compaction
of backfill to prevent settlement of the superimposed surface
or development.
(b) Preferably installed after excavating and/or filling of the area
to be traversed is completed, unless the storm sewer is
installed in the original ground with a minimum of three feet of
cover and/or adequate protection is provided during the fill
construction. At no time may additional fill be added over the
pipe thereby increasing the amount of cover over the designed
elevations. This restriction of adding additional fill over the
pipe applies to existing storm sewers and piping as well as
proposed.
(c) Storm sewers shall be designed:
[1] With cradles, when traversing fill areas of indeterminate
stability or when required due to lack of vertical clearance
between utilities.
[2] With anchors, when slope gradient exceeds 20%.
[3] With encasement and/or special backfill requirements as
otherwise directed by the Stormwater Officer and/or
backfilled with PennDOT 2A coarse aggregate when
traversing under a paved area and/or shoulder area.
[4] To include a gas trap at the point of discharge; his
standard is applicable only when tying into a combined
sewer system.
(d) Designed to adequately handle the anticipated stormwater
flow and be economical to construct and maintain. The

other public improvements located in the right-of-way are to be
dedicated to the City of Altoona, stormwater control facilities
located within these public improvements shall also be
dedicated to and maintained by the City of Altoona.
(b) If a development site is to be maintained in a single ownership
or if storm sewers and other public improvements are to be
privately owned and maintained, then the ownership and
maintenance of stormwater control methods and facilities shall
be the responsibility of the owner or private management
entity.
(c) Any existing inlets, piping, ditches, swales, channels, etc.
located within a site and/or property are considered
stormwater facilities. These existing facilities are considered
private, and maintenance of the stormwater management
facilities will be required and the responsibility of the owner or
private management entity.
(8) The City or the Stormwater Officer shall make the final
determination regarding the continuing maintenance
responsibilities prior to final approval of the stormwater
management plan. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
herein, City Council reserves the right to accept or reject the
ownership and operating responsibility for any or all of the
stormwater control methods and facilities, and to determine the
terms and conditions under which it will accept ownership and
operating responsibility.
(9) Requirements and agreement for the operation and maintenance
plan as submitted and approved will be covered under the

stormwater management plan, the property owner and the City
shall execute (sign and record) a developers agreement covering
all stormwater control facilities which are to be privately owned.
The developers agreement shall be recorded with the final
subdivision/land development plan for the site. The agreement
shall stipulate that:
(a) The owner, successor and assigns shall operate and maintain
all facilities in accordance with the approved maintenance
schedule(s) in the O&M plan and shall keep all facilities in a
safe and attractive manner.
(b) The owner shall convey to the City of Altoona easements and/or
rights-of-way to assure access for periodic inspections by the
City of Altoona and maintenance, if necessary or required.
(c) The owner shall keep on file with the City of Altoona the name,
address and telephone number of the person or company
responsible for operation and maintenance activities. In the
event of a change, new information will be submitted by the
owner to the City of Altoona within 10 working days of the
change.
(d) The engineer must meet with and provide the developer or
owner with a copy of the operation and maintenance plan. The
engineer is required to explain all required maintenance to the
developer or owner as well as all associated requirements of
this chapter (i.e., recordkeeping, contact information,
submittal of records, etc.)
(e) The owner is responsible for operation and maintenance
(O&M) of the SWM BMPs. If the City of Altoona determines at
any time that any permanent stormwater management control
facility has been eliminated, altered or improperly maintained
in accordance with the O&M agreement, the owner of the
property shall be advised of corrective measures required and
given a reasonable period of time to take necessary action. If
such action is not taken by the property owner, the City of
Altoona may institute penalties or cause the work to be done,
file a municipal claim or lien against the property, or institute
an action in assumpsit against the property owner, to collect all
costs, i.e., contractor's work, administrative costs, filing, fees,
and interest at 6% on the unpaid balance.
(2) Other items may be included in the agreement where determined
necessary to guarantee the satisfactory maintenance of all
facilities. The maintenance agreement shall be subject to the
review and approval of the Municipal Solicitor and governing body.

required to pay a specified amount to the municipal
stormwater maintenance fund to help defray costs of periodic
inspections and maintenance expenses. The amount of the
deposit shall be determined as follows:
[1] If the storage facility is to be privately owned and
maintained, the deposit shall cover the cost of periodic
inspections performed by the City of Altoona for a period
of 10 years, as established by the City fee schedule or as
estimated by the Stormwater Officer. After that period of
time, inspections will be performed at the expense of the
City. Said fee may also be used to help defray the costs of
maintaining the existing separate storm system within the
City of Altoona.
[2] If the storage facility is to be owned and maintained by the
City of Altoona, the deposit shall cover the estimated costs
for maintenance and inspections for 10 years. The
Stormwater Officer will establish the estimated costs
utilizing information submitted by the applicant.
[3] The amount of the deposit to the fund shall be converted to
present worth of the annual series values. The Stormwater
Officer shall determine the present worth equivalents,
which shall be subject to the approval of the planning
agency.
(b) If a storage facility is proposed that also serves as a recreation
facility (e.g., ball field, park, lake, etc.), the Altoona City
Planning Commission may reduce or waive the amount of the
maintenance fund deposit based upon the value of the land for
public recreation purposes.
(c) If in the future a storage facility (whether publicly or privately
owned) is eliminated due to the installation of storm sewers or
other storage facility, the unused portion of the maintenance
fund deposit will be applied to the cost of abandoning the
facility and connecting to the storm sewer system or other
facility. Any amount of the deposit remaining after the costs of
abandonment are paid will be returned to the depositor.
(d) In the event of a dispute between the owner and the
Stormwater Officer over the amount of the maintenance fund
deposit, both parties shall appear before the Planning
Commission, which shall mediate the dispute. Parties

goals and outcomes as described in this section.
A. All subdivisions and land development shall be designed to minimize
environmental damage to the maximum extent possible by carefully
fitting the proposal to the existing conditions of the site.
(1) Grading. Roads, building sites, and lots should be laid out in a
manner that will minimize disturbance of the land. Newly proposed
road layouts should generally minimize cut-and-fill activity.
Naturally level areas should be given high consideration for
building sites. Clustering of development on less steep areas of the
site is strongly encouraged as an alternative to mass grading.
(2) Steep slopes. Altoona is located at the foot of the Allegheny Front
along the western fringe of the ridge-and-valley region of
Pennsylvania. Steep slopes are a predominate part of this
topography. Creating stable slopes is critically important to the
safety and welfare of the community. Development must
demonstrate the methods proposed to keep slopes stabilized with
vegetation and/or other engineered features.
(3) Water resources. Watercourses are the City's natural drainage
system for runoff and floodwaters. Much of the City's natural
stormwater drainage has been incorporated into a combined sewer
system, providing a challenge to regain the natural system and its
natural flow patterns. It is therefore critical that the remaining
open streams and the land immediately adjacent be preserved to
carry out this natural drainage function as well as to provide visual
amenity to the citizenry.
(4) Vegetation. Vegetation is an important element of the cityscape. It
maintains stable slopes, cleans the air, mitigates runoff, and
provides visual character to the City and its neighborhoods. Efforts
shall be made to preserve mature trees and base vegetation on
slopes whenever possible. Trees located within the street right-ofway
fall under the jurisdiction of the Altoona Shade Tree
Commission.
(5) Identified natural resources. Care must be taken in the design and
construction of subdivisions to protect habitats which include rare
or endangered plants or animals or are found to be ecologically
important.
(6) The human environment. Sites containing structures of historic or
architectural significance should be designed to preserve, enhance,
or reuse such structures as often as possible. Buildings beyond
rehabilitation should be demolished.
§ 640-3 ALTOONA CODE § 640-3
C:748
(7) Air and water resources. All subdivisions shall comply fully with all
applicable laws and regulations concerning air and water pollution.
Transit-oriented development is encouraged to minimize
dependency on the automobile.
B. Where hazardous or potentially hazardous features are present on
proposed development sites, the design of subdivisions shall consider
such features. Appropriate precautions shall be taken to ensure that
development will be safe and the public health and welfare will be
protected. Development may not be approved unless safety is assured.
(1) Landslide-prone areas. In areas where soils or underlying geology
may be unstable, a geotechnical investigation should be
undertaken to ascertain the appropriate design standards for the
site and ensure the long-term safety of any occupants of the
subdivision.
(2) Undermined and cavernous areas. In areas where mining has
occurred or is occurring, or areas known to contain cavernous
pockets, subsidence risk assessments may be required to establish
that the proposal will be safe.
(3) Flood-prone areas. New construction in the undeveloped onehundred-
year floodplain or other areas of known frequent flooding
shall be avoided wherever possible. Where such construction has
already occurred or is unavoidable, the development shall proceed
in full compliance with Ch. 362 and any other applicable
requirements at the state and federal levels.
(4) Hazardous waste and other contaminated sites. To protect the
public health, no subdivision shall be approved in areas which may
have been contaminated by prior uses or contain hazardous waste,
unless it is determined during the review that the site is now safe
for development. Development of such sites shall be limited to uses
which do not pose health risks for site occupants.
(5) Noise-prone sites. Subdivisions proposed in areas of unusual noise
shall ensure that the safety and health of the occupants of the site
are not harmed by the presence of such noise. In the event a noiseprone
site is being proposed, the developer bears the responsibility
to mitigate the noise so that occupants of surrounding properties
are not unduly exposed to unnecessary noise.
(6) Air traffic. No subdivision proposal shall include features which
inhibit the flow of air traffic or present a hazard to air vehicles. In
most areas, compliance with zoning will ensure this.
C. The general layout of subdivisions and land developments should
respect the natural resources of the site, the character of the
surrounding area, and be suitable for intended uses. The design of
blocks and lots shall allow compliance with the zoning provisions found
in this Code and provide suitable space for buildings. The design of
§ 640-3 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-3
C:749
subdivisions and land developments shall consider the topography,
natural features, traffic circulation which includes bicycles and
pedestrians, and the surrounding neighborhood. Subdivisions and land
developments should further the goals of the Altoona Comprehensive
Plan.
D. Subdivisions and land development shall include landscaping which is
designed to improve community appearance, contribute positively to
environmental quality and the livability of new areas, and to mitigate
any negative impacts on the existing areas surrounding it. Uses and
structures should be sited to minimize adverse impact from or upon
abutting uses. Landscaping, buffers, and screening should be designed
to reduce unavoidable impacts and to augment the natural features of
the site.
E. Proposals must provide a full range of improvements throughout the
subdivision and land development as required to ensure public health,
safety and welfare as well as the creation of desirable neighborhoods
for living, working, and recreation.
(1) Water supply. All new subdivisions and land development shall
provide direct connections to the public water system. New
development shall not degrade the quality of potable water
supplies, including, but not limited to, the public system and the
groundwater. Private wells for any purpose are discouraged.
(2) Sanitary sewage disposal. All new subdivisions and land
developments shall provide direct connections to the public
sanitary sewer system. With the exception of required and
approved nonresidential pretreatment facilities, no new on-site
sewerage disposal or treatment systems are permitted. No new
sanitary sewer shall be connected to the storm sewer.
(3) Storm drainage. Every subdivision and land development shall
manage stormwater flows in accordance with this Code. All
development located within watersheds for which stormwater
management plans have been adopted shall comply with the
requirements of the plan as well. No new storm drain system shall
be connected to the sanitary sewer system.
(4) Public utilities. New subdivisions and land development shall be
served by other public utilities, including electricity, natural gas,
and communications. The use of alternative energy sources shall be
accommodated in the approval of plans.
(5) Community services. All new subdivision and land development
shall have access to the full range of public services and facilities,
such as public safety and emergency response, recreation, schools,
and libraries.
(6) Transportation facilities. New subdivisions and land developments
shall provide a full range of transportation facilities for access to all
§ 640-3 ALTOONA CODE § 640-3
C:750
lots, buildings, and open space areas intended for use by people.
Transportation facilities designed within subdivisions shall be
designed as elements of the larger transportation system serving
the public. No private or gated streets should be permitted.
Transportation facilities shall include public transportation,
walkways, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, cartways, parking facilities,
and multipurpose trails.

Part 2
Subdivision Regulations
ARTICLE III
Subdivisions Generally
§ 640-7. Standards and waivers.
This Part 2 of this chapter provides specific standards for the design of
subdivisions as well as requirements for improvements. Minimum standards
of design are specified for each element of design or improvement. This
article outlines the general goals of this Part 2. The provisions of these
standards may be waived by the approving authority upon written request
by the applicant, provided the applicant provides appropriate alternatives
which demonstrate compliance with the desired outcome to a higher degree
or will produce more desirable results than the application of a specific
standard.
§ 640-8. Unapproved subdivision prohibited.
No owner of land shall make a subdivision of any land or proceed with
the improvement or sale of lots in a subdivision, or the construction of any
improvements, unless and until a plan is submitted and approved under this
Part 2 or Part 3.
§ 640-9. One principal structure per lot in residential zones.
Not more than one building designed or available for use for dwelling
purposes shall be erected, placed, or converted to use as such on any lot
in the City zoned residential without the express consent of the Planning
Commission. The placement of multiple residential structures on one lot
requires approval under Part 3, Land Development. The approval of such
an application shall be deemed the approval necessary to comply with this
section. Accessory structures, such as garages, sheds, and pools, are not
governed by this section.
§ 640-10. Site analysis.
The design of a subdivision shall be based upon an analysis of the existing
conditions on the site, including all natural and man-made features. The
analysis shall include an examination of the opportunities and constraints
of the site based upon the existing conditions. The site analysis shall also
consider the relationship of the site to the surrounding neighborhood. The
project narrative shall summarize the site analysis and how it influenced the
design of the subdivision.
§ 640-11. Alternative development plan.
Before considering requests for waivers or modifications of the standards
or requirements contained in this Part 2, the Commission may require
§ 640-7 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-11
C:773
the applicant to prepare an alternative development plan which complies
with the requirements of this Part 2. The original proposal shall then be
considered in light of the alternative presented.
§ 640-12. Effect on construction-related permits.
No construction-related permit, including foundation permits, building
permits, or other related permits, shall be issued for a lot within a
subdivision unless the plans approved under Part 2 or Part 3 have been
approved and recorded and all improvements shown thereon have been
installed or bonded. It is strongly recommended, but not required, that
applicants withhold application for such permits until approvals under Part
2 or Part 3 have been obtained, as significant changes may occur during
the approval process which could substantially alter the plans required for
those permits.
§ 640-13. Expiration of subdivision approval.
All permits necessary for the construction of improvements and buildings
upon lots shown on an approved subdivision plan shall be obtained and
substantially completed within five years of the date of approval. Lots
which do not comply with this section will require new approval relative
to the physical improvements within the subdivision after the expiration
of the fifth year. Application for such approval shall be made under the
appropriate article(s) of this part.

administrative review of these situations to allow access to these lots on an
improved way in an orderly manner. Because of the extreme variation in the
nature of these lots, the Planning Administrator is empowered to be creative
in finding solutions which allow the property owner to build on his or her
land.
§ 640-20. Criteria.
The Planning Administrator may define the construction standards for
incomplete streets in previously approved subdivisions if all of the following
criteria are met:

the following notation placed on the plan by the Planning
Administrator: "This approval is not a determination as to conformance
with zoning regulations."
A. The access should utilize a previously approved layout.
B. The accessway should be made part of the public street system. Where
this is not possible, the applicant must submit legal instruments
running with the land that recognize that the accessway is not part of
the public street system and the landowner shall not petition for public
services on the accessway and post "Private Lane" signs.
C. When extending a public street or installing a street which has the
potential of becoming a public throughway, the extension should match
the existing constructed street, if it is adequate. In this case, adequate

§ 640-24. Decision of Planning Administrator.
§ 640-25. Appeal.
Any aggrieved applicant may appeal the decision of the Planning
Administrator to the Altoona City Planning Commission. Such appeal shall
shall be liquid fuels standards for width and surfacing and subdivision
standards for all else.
D. When installing other types of accessways, the subdivision standards
should govern wherever appropriate. In no case shall an accessway be
less than a twelve-foot-wide gravel lane.
E. Provision of public utilities shall be considered by consulting with or
deferring to the City of Altoona Public Works Department.

complete, the Planning Administrator will distribute copies of the plan
to the County Planning Commission, the City of Altoona Code
Enforcement Department, the Zoning Officer, City of Altoona Public
Works Department, and Altoona City Authority, and keep the other two
copies for technical review.
B. With the exception of the Blair County Planning Commission, the
agencies undertaking the technical review shall have 20 days to make
written recommendations and comments on the plan. Failure of an
agency to respond in writing within 20 days shall indicate that agency's
approval of the plan as submitted. The comments of the Blair County
Planning Commission must be received within 30 days of the
forwarding date to be considered.
C. If the Planning Administrator determines that the plan does not qualify
for approval under this article or is somehow deficient, he or she shall
notify the applicant of such in writing within 35 days of the submittal
date, giving specific reasons for the determination.
D. If the Planning Administrator, in consultation with the other reviewing
agencies, determines that the plan does qualify for approval under this
section, he or she shall endorse the plan and issue a certificate of
approval within 35 days of the submittal date. The original plan will
then be returned to the applicant, who is responsible for its recording
with the Recorder of Deeds. The provisions of Article VI, Standard
Subdivisions, shall then apply.

ARTICLE VI
Standard Subdivisions
§ 640-26. Introductory discussion.
Prior to filing a formal application, the applicant is encouraged to meet
with the Planning Administrator (who shall invite representatives of other
departments to be present) to discuss the concepts and issues related to
the proposed subdivision. The applicant should bring the following to the
introductory meeting:
§ 640-27. Preapplication review.
Prior to filing a formal application, the applicant may, at his or her option,
submit a sketch plan for a more technical interdepartmental review by City
staff. This review is not binding on the Planning Commission but allows
the applicant to work out many of the technical issues which typically
accompany a subdivision plan. The review takes approximately 15 to 30
days, depending on the issues at hand and ability to communicate. To
engage this review, the applicant shall submit the following:
A. Any professional representatives which are engaged to work on the
project.
B. Written documentation regarding the project.
C. A sketch plan depicting the project. It is helpful if the sketch plan
includes as many of the items listed in § 640-27 below as possible.
D. A willingness to candidly discuss the project with planning staff in a
nonbinding manner to ascertain the goals, objectives, opportunities,
and limitations of both the City and the applicant.
A. A brief narrative of the project, which includes a request for a
preapplication review of the plans under this section.
B. A contact list of professionals working on the project (if hired), the
owner, and the applicant submitting the project.
C. A list of waivers the project will likely need for approval.
D. The fee established by resolution of the City Council from time to time.
This amount will be subsequently deducted from the filing fee required
for the formal application.
E. A sketch plan. The sketch plan shall include at least the following:
(1) The title: "Sketch Plan of (name of subdivision)."
(2) Date, scale, North point, and if appropriate, a legend to explain any
graphic representations or symbols on the plan.
(3) The names of the owner of record and the applicant.
§ 640-26 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-27
C:785
§ 640-28. Effect of introductory meeting and preapplication review.
Neither the introductory meeting nor the preapplication review have
standing as part of the formal review process. Approval of plans under this
Article requires action by the Altoona City Planning Commission, which
is specifically and deliberately absent from the processes described in
§ 640-26 and § 640-27. The purpose of these processes is to familiarize the
staff and work out technical kinks in the proposal before it enters into the
formal review process. No comments made by staff during these processes
are binding on the Planning Commission for its review; however, staff is
hereby required to act expeditiously and in good faith in its representations
to the applicant. The applicant is not required to engage in the introductory
discussion or preapplication review.
§ 640-29. Submission of a subdivision proposal.
Any person wishing to obtain approval of a subdivision shall submit a
package meeting the following requirements to the City of Altoona:
(4) The name of the draftsman (this need not be a design professional).
(5) The outer lines of the subdivision in a heavy shaded line.
(6) The names, location, alignment, and width of existing streets and
easements.
(7) Lines and names of proposed streets and easements in a general
manner.
(8) The following information for each lot within the subdivision
boundaries:
(a) Approximate boundary lines.
(b) Approximate dimensions, including area and frontage.
(c) A numerical designation for each lot, preferably in sequential
order.
(9) The topography in a general manner.
(10) A rough sketch of the proposed drainage system in a general
manner.
(11) Identification of any existing or proposed public areas.
(12) The approximate size and location of new and existing utilities.
(13) Any additional items required for a formal proposal which may be
helpful in the staff's review of the plan.
(14) Any other information the applicant feels would be helpful in the
review.

easements, rights-of-way, restrictions, covenants, trusts, or other
encumbrances on the land.
E. A list of all owners of land abutting the proposal and directly across any
streets, watercourses, or railroads. For corner properties, this shall
include the land diagonally across the intersection as well.
F. Three copies of any studies that may be required by the applicable
section of this chapter or other controlling law or regulation.
G. The appropriate filing fees as established by resolution of the City
Council from time to time. Fees are due at approval.

§ 640-30. Basic layout.
All plans submitted shall depict the proposal, which shall conform to the
following basic layout standards for subdividing the land.
A. Placement of buildings:
(1) Buildings, landscaping, and screening shall be placed so that they
conceal the less desirable elements generally installed with
construction (items such as air-conditioning units, parking areas,
garages, and garbage storage are typical of such elements) so that
they are not visible from adjacent lots and streets.
(2) Building areas shall be laid out so that any scenic site features and
views are preserved, both into and out of the site.
(3) Building layout shall promote a sense of neighborhood yet allow
individual privacy for each landowner.
(4) Buildings sited in such a manner that they may block public scenic
views through the site shall be laid out and designed so as to
complement the viewshed into which they are placed. Attempts
shall be made to preserve a portion of the viewshed, whenever
practical.
(5) Building sites shall be laid out with consideration given to the
provision of adequate solar access and air circulation. New
development shall be accomplished such that excessive winds are
neither created nor exacerbated.
(6) Building sites shall be laid out and graded so as to provide positive
drainage away from proposed buildings.
(7) Building placement shall not hinder the effective and efficient
response of emergency personnel in a fire or medical emergency.
(8) Buildings shall not be sited or designed to create a public nuisance
or a traffic hazard once constructed.
B. Placement of lot lines.
(1) Lots shall be laid out so as to provide buildable areas, accessible
driveways, and usable yards and open space areas, with the
minimum possible disturbance to the site.
(2) Lots shall be laid out with consideration given to views and privacy.
(3) Lots shall meet the minimum requirements of Chapter 800, Zoning.
Where this is not possible or not desired, the lot shall be
conspicuously labeled "unbuildable" and appropriate legal
instruments restricting construction on the lot shall be executed
with the City as party.
§ 640-30 ALTOONA CODE § 640-30
C:788
§ 640-31. Environmental mitigation.
All subdivision proposals shall provide for the following environmental
mitigation measures as well as any additional requirements of the state and
federal governments.
(4) Lots shall abut on public streets (including new streets intended to
be public).
(5) Lots should be laid out to avoid driveway access from roadways
with three or more lanes. Twin one-way pairs shall be considered as
one roadway for purposes of this standard.
(6) Lot shape shall be rectangular wherever practical. Where not
practical, other shapes may be proposed so long as side lot lines
intersect the street right-of-way line at no more than 45° from
perpendicular or radial and maintain the intersecting angle until
such side line intersects a projected line running parallel to and 20
feet away from the street right-of-way line.
C. Layout of blocks.
(1) Block length shall be a minimum of 300 feet and no longer than 800
feet.
(2) Blocks in residential areas shall be of sufficient depth to allow for
two house lots between avenues.
(3) Alleys are neither required nor prohibited.
(4) Block layout shall be designed giving neighborhood stability and
nonautomotive traffic primacy above automotive traffic and
parking.
A. Grading and soil removal.
(1) It is the intent of this subsection to protect life and property by
preventing rock and soil slippage, loss and degradation of natural
drainageways, increased soil erosion and sedimentation, and other
soil and water management issues.
(2) Grading shall be limited to the minimum area necessary to provide
for buildings, roads, parking areas, utilities, and other facilities
shown on the subdivision plan.
(3) A soil erosion and sedimentation plan shall be prepared in
accordance with Chapter 580 and Chapter 620.
(4) Where required by the National Pollution Discharge Elimination
System or state regulations, a permit shall be secured prior to the
commencement of any grading or earthmoving activities for the
following:
§ 640-30 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-31
C:789
(a) Development of sites between five and 25 acres in size which
are not located within a special protection watershed and
which are not ineligible for other reasons specified in the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
regulations. In this case, General Permit PAG-2 may be used
once obtained from the Blair County Conservation District.
(b) Development of sites in excess of 25 acres in size that are not
divided into parcels shall obtain individual NPDES permits.
Individual NPDES permits are also required for smaller sites
that are located in special protection watersheds or are
otherwise ineligible for the general permit. Processing of
individual NPDES permits has been delegated to the Blair
County Conservation District.
(5) The applicant is responsible for protecting adjacent and
downstream properties from any damage which occurs as a result
of earth disturbance on the development site. Such protection shall
include cleaning up and restoring to their predamage condition any
adjacent or downstream properties adversely affected by silt,
debris, flooding, or other damage resulting from the earth
disturbance activity.
(6) The top and bottom edges of cut-and-fill slopes shall be set back
from property lines a minimum of two feet plus 20% of the height of
the slope. This setback need not exceed 10 feet.
(7) Topsoil stripped from the site in preparation for earthmoving
activities shall be stockpiled and replaced on the site over all
regraded nondeveloped areas at a minimum depth of six inches.
(8) Fill areas shall be prepared by removing organic material such as
vegetation or rubbish and any other material which is determined
to prevent proper compaction and stability.
(9) Proposed grading activities shall be accomplished so that postdevelopment
stormwater flows cause no additional harm to
abutting properties and streets. The stormwater management
provisions of Chapter 620 apply.
(10) Maximum gradient of graded slopes shall be no greater than two
horizontal feet to one vertical foot, except as follows:
(a) Where the height of a proposed slope will not exceed 10 feet,
then a maximum gradient of 1:1 may be permitted where soil
conditions permit and where doing so will help preserve
existing vegetation or other significant natural features.
(b) Where a retaining wall, designed and sealed by a registered
professional engineer, is constructed to support the face of the
slope.
§ 640-31 ALTOONA CODE § 640-31
C:790
(11) Excavation adjacent to any building foundation walls, footings, or
structures shall not extend beyond the angle of repose or natural
slope of the soil under the nearest point of same unless the
footings, foundations, or structures have been sufficiently
underpinned or otherwise protected against settlement.
B. Steep slopes. The following shall apply to all grading and disturbance
on land with slopes of 25% or greater.
(1) For slopes between 25% and 40%, no more than 30% of the slope
area shall be stripped of vegetation or disturbed through grading.
Grading and clearing for roads on these slopes shall be limited to
that necessary to accommodate the improvements required by this
chapter. Wherever possible, roads should follow the contours of the
land.
(2) No development or disturbance shall be allowed on slopes
exceeding 40%. Limited disturbance for utilities may be allowed
where no reasonable alternative location exists.
C. Significant natural areas and features.
(1) Where a proposed subdivision includes an identified natural area or
feature such as endangered species or wetlands, the applicant shall
demonstrate compliance with all applicable state and federal
requirements.
(2) All healthy trees with trunks equal to or exceeding 24 inches in
diameter, or any tree which may be noteworthy because of its
species, age, uniqueness, rarity, or status as a landmark due to
historical or other cultural association, shall be preserved, unless
removal is deemed necessary by these criteria:
(a) The health of the tree is such that it is dead, dying, or diseased
beyond remedy.
(b) The tree endangers the public or adjoining property.
(c) Site constraints make preserving the tree impossible.
(3) Large trees removed pursuant to Subsection C(2) above shall be
replaced with a minimum of three trees with a minimum caliper of
three inches. Tree placement shall be in such a manner so as to
complement the site and ensure the long-term health of the trees
planted.
D. Water quality.
(1) All buildable lots within the subdivision shall be supplied public
sewage facilities. The applicant must document application for a
sewage facilities planning module prior to approval under Chapter

wetland.
E. Air quality. Design of the subdivision should promote alternative modes
of transportation to reduce automotive dependency. Transit-oriented
design is encouraged to promote air quality.
F. Noise. Subdivisions located in areas which are subject to high levels of
noise may install soundproofing measures to mitigate the noise. In all
cases, a notation shall be made on the plan that the project is subject to
high levels of noise.
A. Landslide areas. No grading, removal of vegetation, construction, or
other disturbance shall be permitted on soils that are classified as slideprone
or unstable in the soil survey for Blair County or on other areas
exhibiting signs of instability, except in accordance with the provisions
below.
(1) Unstable areas may be set aside for public, common, or private
open space.
(2) Limited disturbance may be considered if the applicant is able to
demonstrate that the proposed disturbance will not cause sliding
movement or any unsafe condition either on the subject property or
any property adjacent to it.
(3) Evidence of the safety of any proposed disturbance shall require
site investigation and certification in writing by a registered soils
engineer, engineering geologist, or structural engineer that the
proposed activity will not create or exacerbate unsafe conditions.
B. Undermined and cavernous areas. No subdivision of land intended to
create lots for building construction shall be approved on a site which
has been undermined, or is known to contain cavernous pockets at
shallow depths, or in an area where there is evidence of past
subsidence, unless the applicant demonstrates that the proposed
subdivision will be safe and will not cause hazards for adjacent
properties. Evidence of safety shall be required if the site or any area of
the site has less than 100 feet of overburden; evidence of the safety of
the proposed subdivision shall require site investigation and
§ 640-31 ALTOONA CODE § 640-32
C:792
certification in writing by an engineering geologist that the proposed
development will be safe.
C. Flood-prone areas. To the maximum extent feasible, new development
shall not be undertaken in areas subject to periodic flooding, including
identified floodplain areas and flood hazard areas as determined by the

Federal Emergency Management Agency has not provided maps and
studies but may be flood-prone as indicated in local records and
histories, field studies, or on-site investigations.
(1) Portions of proposed subdivisions that are susceptible to flooding
should be preserved as open space or other uses that will not be
harmed or cause hazards if exposed to inundation by floodwaters.
(2) Construction in the floodway portion of a flood-prone area shall
comply with Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
regulations.
(3) Where development within flood-prone areas cannot be avoided,
such development shall be subject to the flood hazard provisions of
Part 4 of the Altoona Planning Code.
D. Contaminated sites. No subdivision shall be approved on land known to
contain substances which are classified as hazardous, unless the site
has been made safe for the proposed use.
(1) A contaminated site shall be considered safe for subdivision when a
remediation plan has been completed and approved by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, subject to
Subsection D(2) below.
(2) The subdivision of contaminated land (not including any
development or earth disturbance) may be approved prior to
remediation if a notation approved by the Commission is placed on
the plan that indicates that the site or specified lots within the site
contain or may contain hazardous substances.
E. Air traffic. Subdivisions located in areas where development may create
hazards to aircraft because of height, illumination, or other features
that may interfere with aircraft operation shall be designed so as not to
create hazards to air traffic.
(1) All proposals shall comply with applicable state and federal

(2) Proposed connections to the existing street system shall be
approved by the jurisdiction owning the street at the point of
connection.
(3) Where a proposed street must continue into an adjoining
municipality, the proponent shall coordinate the street design to
maintain traffic safety.
(4) Streets shall provide convenient connections and not adversely
affect the quality of life in the neighborhood.
(5) Residential streets shall be designed to minimize through traffic,
discourage excessive speeds, and provide privacy in residential
areas.
B. Classifications and levels of service.
(1) Streets shall be classified as either residential or nonresidential
and shall be further classified as arterial, collector, feeder, or local,
as defined herein.
(2) The classification of each street shall be based upon the projection
of traffic volumes 10 years after the completion of the final phase of
the proposal. Traffic volumes shall be calculated in accordance
with trip generation rates published in the Trip Generation Manual
published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (or an
alternate source acceptable to the Commission), and shall consider
all traffic likely to use that street.
(3) Each street shall be designed for its entire length to meet the
standards for its classification.
(4) Proposed streets shall be designed to function at Level of Service B
or higher. Existing streets shall not fall below Level of Service D,

(5) Private streets shall not be allowed, except in cases where a
homeowners' association is established and agreements executed
placing full responsibility for street installation, maintenance,
replacement, and liability with the homeowners' association.
C. Traffic impact study.
(1) A traffic impact study shall be required for a subdivision which will
generate more than 100 peak hour trips when fully developed. The
Commission may also require a study to assess the impacts of
smaller projects if traffic congestion or safety concerns already
exist.
(2) The traffic study shall be conducted in accordance with the
recommended practice "Traffic Access and Impact Studies for Site
Development," published by the Institute of Transportation

demonstrate compliance with the desired outcome to a higher degree or will
produce more desirable results than application of a specific standard.
§ 640-39. Unapproved land development prohibited.
No owner of land shall proceed with construction of any improvements
unless and until a land development plan is submitted and approved under
this Part 3. Subdivisions shall be governed by Part 2, unless the proposal
includes both subdivision and land development.
§ 640-40. Site analysis.
The design of a property shall be based upon an analysis of the existing
conditions on the site, including all natural and man-made features. The
analysis shall include an examination of the opportunities and constraints
of the site based upon the existing conditions. The site analysis must also
consider the relationship of the site to the surrounding neighborhood. The
project narrative shall summarize the site analysis and how it influenced the
design of the property.
§ 640-41. Alternative development plan.
Before considering requests for waivers or modifications of the standards
or requirements contained in this Part 3, the Commission may require
the applicant to prepare an alternative development plan which complies
with the requirements of this Part 3. The original proposal shall then be
considered in light of the alternative presented.
§ 640-42. Effect on construction-related permits.
No construction-related permit, including foundation permits, building
permits, or other related permits, shall be issued for a lot subject to land
development review unless the plans approved under this Part 3 have
been approved and recorded and all improvements shown thereon have
been bonded. It is strongly recommended, but not required, that applicants
withhold application for such permits until approvals under this part have
§ 640-38 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-42

construction phase may be considered for larger proposals or other
special circumstances.
§ 640-44. Proposals requiring review under Part 3.
The following activities shall require land development review under this
Part 3. All land development reviews are conducted by the Planning
Commission and/or staff; however, if it is a low impact land development,
the review can be deferred. A land development review shall be conducted
by the Planning Commission and/or staff for the following:
A. The improvement of one lot or two or more contiguous lots, tracts or
parcels of land or structures for any purpose involving:
(1) A group of two or more residential or nonresidential buildings,

the introductory meeting:
§ 640-55. Preapplication review.
Prior to filing a formal application, the applicant may, at his or her option,
submit a sketch plan for a more technical interdepartmental review by City
staff. This review is not binding on the Planning Commission but allows
the applicant to work out many of the technical issues which typically
accompany a land development proposal. The review takes approximately
15 to 30 days, depending on the issues at hand and ability to communicate.
To engage this review, the applicant shall submit the following:
A. Any professional representatives which are engaged to work on the
project.
B. Written documentation regarding the project.
C. A sketch plan depicting the project. It is helpful if the sketch plan
includes as many of the items listed in § 640-55 below as possible.

Also specified are the traffic level of service standards and minimum
requirements which must be satisfied for future development impacts.
(1) Traffic study requirements. Any development, subdivision,
expansion or change in use which will generate 100 or more trips
during any hours of any day of the week shall be required to have a
traffic impact study completed as part of the development. The
estimated number of trips shall be determined by either an analysis
of similar uses through data collected by the Institute of
Transportation Engineers or through studies of similar uses,
whichever is deemed acceptable to City staff. Note that traffic
studies may also be required where there are current traffic
problems in the local area (such as a high-accident location,
confusing intersection, or an intersection in need of a traffic
signal), where the current or projected level of service of the
roadway system adjacent to the proposed land development could
§ 640-60 ALTOONA CODE § 640-61
C:828
be significantly affected, or where adjacent or nearby
neighborhoods may be impacted by pass-through traffic.
(2) Report contents and scope. Prior to performing a traffic impact
study, the City will provide a scope of study specifying the study
area, intersections and any special requirements. Prior to
beginning the study, a meeting may be held to review the scope of
work. PennDOT may be invited to the meeting, when appropriate.
The study shall include the following:
(a) A description of the proposed project in terms of land use and
magnitude, including a site plan.
(b) An inventory and analysis of existing roadway and traffic
conditions in the site environs, including roadway network and
traffic control; existing traffic volumes in terms of peak hours
and average daily traffic (ADT), where specifically requested;
planned roadway improvements by others; intersection levels
of service; roadway levels of service (where requested); other
measures of roadway adequacy (lane widths, traffic signal
warrants, vehicle delay studies, etc.); projected site-generated
traffic volumes in terms of peak hours and ADT (by phase, if
required); approach/departure distribution including method
of determination; site traffic volumes in roadway; an analysis of
future traffic conditions, with and without the proposed
development (including future design year or years with
phasing, combined traffic volumes, intersection levels of
service, roadway levels of service where appropriate, and a
pavement analysis of roadways); a description of future levels
of service and their compliance with standards for traffic
capacity of streets, intersections and driveways; a description
and analysis of the proposed access plan and site plan; an onsite
circulation plan showing parking locations and
dimensions, loading access, and traffic control; and a driveway
access plan showing location of driveways and new
intersections, including geometric conditions and traffic
control.
(3) Review of traffic impact studies. City staff will review the submitted
traffic impact study and report its contents, as well as any
recommendations, to the City Planning Commission before that
Commission may approve the involved subdivision or land
development. In reviewing a traffic impact study, City staff may use
the services of a qualified consultant, whose costs will then be
billed to and paid by the applicant, as authorized by Section 503(1)
of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (Act of 1968, P.L.
805, No. 247, as reenacted and amended)293.

§ 640-61 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-61
C:829
§ 640-62. Building placement.
(4) Standards for traffic capacity and access. New or modified streets
and intersections shall be designed for adequate traffic capacity,
defined as follows, unless approved by City Engineering and the
Planning Commission. All references to levels of service (LOS) shall
be as defined by the Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report
209, published by the Transportation Research Board.
(a) Traffic capacity LOS shall be based upon a future design year
which coincides with completion of the development and
PennDOT requirements.
(b) New unsignalized intersections or driveways which intersect
streets shall be designed for LOS D or better for each traffic
movement.
(c) New or modified (adding an additional approach) signalized
intersections shall be designed for LOS D or better for each
traffic movement.
(d) Existing intersections impacted by development traffic shall
maintain a minimum LOS D or better for each traffic
movement.
(e) Streets shall be designed for a minimum LOS D.
(f) Sight distance at driveways and new intersections shall meet
standards specified by PennDOT regulations.
A. Buildings, landscaping, and screening shall be placed so that the less
desirable elements generally installed with construction, such as airconditioning
units, parking areas, garages, and such like, are not visible
from adjacent lots and streets.
B. Buildings should be sited toward the front of the lot, as close to the
setback line as practical. Parking shall not be placed in front of the
building. Where a parking lot must be placed against a street or avenue
in a designated historic district, landscaping (shrubs planted tightly
against each other and trees planted no more than 30 feet apart) and/or
a short wall must be used to preserve the streetscape as much as
possible.
C. Building areas shall be laid out so that any scenic site features and
views are preserved, both into and out of the site.
D. Building layout shall promote a sense of neighborhood, yet allow
practical utility of the land by the occupants.
E. Buildings sited in such a manner that they could block public scenic
views through the site shall be laid out and designed so as to
complement the viewshed into which they are placed. Attempts shall be
made to preserve a portion of the viewshed, whenever practical.
§ 640-61 ALTOONA CODE § 640-62
C:830
§ 640-63. Parking and vehicular access.
Wherever off-street parking or vehicle access is to be provided, whether
required by ordinance or not, such areas shall conform to the following
requirements:
F. Building sites shall be laid out with consideration given to the provision
of adequate solar access and air circulation. New development shall be
accomplished such that excessive winds are neither created nor
exacerbated.
G. Building sites shall be laid out and graded so as to provide positive
drainage away from proposed buildings.
H. Building placement shall not hinder the effective and efficient response
of emergency personnel in a fire or medical emergency.
I. Buildings shall not be sited or designed to create a public nuisance or a
traffic hazard once constructed.
A. Vehicular access.
(1) Vehicular access shall be gained from an alleyway wherever
physically practical. Where not physically practical, access may be
gained from a street. In most business areas, on-street parking is
strongly encouraged.
(2) No access driveway shall be located within 50 feet of an
intersection or as otherwise directed by the Planning Commission.
Access driveways serving parking facilities of more than 25 spaces
shall not be located closer than 100 feet to an intersection. Access
driveways shall access side streets instead of main arterials
(including, but not limited to, Logan Boulevard, North Logan
Boulevard, Chestnut Avenue, Juniata Gap Road, the 300 to 600
blocks of East 25th Avenue, Union Avenue, 58th Street, 6th Avenue,
7th Avenue, Broad Avenue, Beale Avenue, Plank Road, Pleasant
Valley Boulevard, Valley View Boulevard, and North 4th Avenue)
where practicable, and where it is not practicable, the Planning
Commission or Planning and Community Development Department
may waive this requirement.
(3) No more than one bidirectional access driveway or two one-way
access driveways shall be permitted for up to 150 feet of frontage.
One additional bidirectional access driveway or two one-way
access driveways may be installed for each additional full 150 feet
of frontage.
(4) No bidirectional access driveway shall be wider than 24 feet or
narrower than 16 feet at the point where such a driveway crosses
the street or alley right-of-way line. The width may be increased to
35 feet if the access driveway is to be utilized heavily by truck
traffic.
§ 640-62 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-63
C:831
(5) No one-way access driveway shall be wider than 18 feet or
narrower than 10 feet at the point where such a driveway crosses
the street or alley right-of-way line.
(6) The minimum curb radius on an access driveway at the street or
alley shall be 10 feet.
(7) All access driveways shall be paved with a nonerosive material
suitable to bear the load of vehicular traffic.
(8) Parking shall not be permitted on an access driveway.
(9) Access through a residential zoning district to a nonresidential
district shall be prohibited unless no other option exists.
(10) State highway occupancy permits are required for access to a state
highway, and separate City permits are required to access a City
street. Possession of such permits does not relieve an applicant's
responsibility to comply with these standards.
(11) The Commission, upon proper review of the application, may
require the applicant to install an access driveway to the abutting
property line to facilitate better movement between uses in
business districts. This requirement can be invoked even if there is
no existing connection on the opposite side of the property line as a
planned future connector.
B. Location of parking facilities.
(1) Off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot as the
principal use they are intended to serve or on an immediately
adjacent lot under the same ownership or legal control. Parking on
adjacent lots must remain available to the principal use it was
constructed to serve for as long as that use remains.

C:833
spaces are generally located next to those provided for the
physically disabled and are not required for approval.
(e) Spaces reserved for employees shall be clearly signed and
shall be the farthest from the use served. Such spaces are not
required for approval.
(5) Accessways shall be physically separated from any stall rows to
which they do not directly provide access. Stalls shall be accessed
through one end only. Such separation shall consist of landscaped
islands as regulated in § 640-65.
(6) All parking areas shall be paved with a nonerosive material suitable
to bear the load of vehicular traffic, with stall lines clearly marked
on the surface. Asphalt and concrete shall be the standard
surfacing materials unless site conditions indicate an alternate

considered where multiple windows or lanes are proposed.
J. General circulation and layout. The Planning Commission shall consider
the entire site layout and its overall effect on traffic circulation and
vehicular interaction with other users of the property. In doing so, the
Commission shall take into consideration internal intersections, sight
distances, crosswalks, loading areas, pickup and dropoff areas, exterior
doors, and landscaping. The Commission shall have the responsibility to
condition approvals on changes to the proposal it feels are necessary to

extend from the street right-of-way line to the curb. In such areas,
the following treatments shall also apply:
(a) Street tree wells shall be installed so that a tree may be
planted 18 inches inside the curb. There shall be one street
tree for every 50 feet of street on the block (i.e., a block 400
feet long would require eight trees). The number of trees
required shall be placed equidistantly along the block but no
closer than 15 feet to an intersecting curbline. An applicant
shall be responsible only to install such well(s) and tree(s)
§ 640-63 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-64
C:843
§ 640-65. Landscaping.

crosswalk shall be clearly designated on the surface of the access
driveway. Crosswalks shall also be provided anywhere a sidewalk
intersects an access drive.
(6) If the proposal requires a traffic signal, such traffic control signal
shall include button-activated pedestrian lights for all directions of
travel and painted crosswalks on the streets at the intersection.
This signal shall be of the two-tier walk/don't walk variety, or its
equivalent.

(a) Each berm shall have no greater than a 2:1 slope.
(b) Each berm shall be at least five feet high as measured from the
finished grade of the property at the interior base of the berm.
Properties shall not be designed or graded so that the intended
screening function of the berm is negated.
(c) The Planning Commission may allow existing topographical
features to be used in place of an artificial berm. Use of such
features shall not preclude the applicability of the screening
and landscaping requirements contained herein.
(d) Artificial berms shall be constructed so as to support and
sustain the required screening and landscaping to be placed
upon them.
C. Perimeter landscaping.
(1) The landscaped area for perimeter landscaping shall be coincident
with the required buffer yard area.
(2) The perimeter landscaping area shall be seamlessly integrated with
any street tree requirements as well as the parking lot landscaping
and foundation landscaping requirements shown below.
(3) Along the frontage, the area shall be planted with shrubs and trees
so as to provide a pleasant driving and walking atmosphere and to
minimize the impact of the project on the street. Frontage
landscaping must be designed so it does not interfere with drivers
entering and leaving the property.
(4) Along the parking lot, trees and shrubs shall be planted so as to
screen the parking facility from all surrounding streets and
properties. The intent is to mitigate the impact of vehicle noise,
lights, and fumes on adjacent land. Such vegetation shall be
planted so as to provide a full screen within five years.
(5) Where berms are required, the entire berm shall be landscaped
with shrubs and trees to completely segregate the proposed use
from adjacent uses. Evergreen plantings shall be required along
the crest of the berm.
§ 640-65 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-65
C:847
(6) Elsewhere the plantings shall be designed to screen and filter out
noise, light, and odor produced by the proposal and create a full
screen within five years.
(7) Alternatives to plantings and berms can be considered by the
Commission; however, they must meet the intent of this subsection
and maintain some landscaped presence along the proposal.
D. Foundational landscaping.
(1) The required setback between parking facilities and buildings shall
be landscaped to eliminate large expanses of barren wall.
(2) The area reserved for foundational landscaping shall not be used
for any other purposes, such as outdoor sales or storage of
merchandise.
(3) The foundational landscaping requirements may be waived where a
sidewalk runs along the wall and architectural features have been
added to the wall which visually enhances its presence. Simple
striping and signing shall not qualify for this waiver.
(4) Foundational landscaping shall include low shrubbery at a ratio of
at least one shrub for every five linear feet of wall and high shrub or
tree for every 50 linear feet of wall.
(5) Foundational landscaping may be waived if the proposal includes
yard trees throughout the site that serve the same screening
purposes as foundational plantings. Such a waiver may be applied
only where such yard trees serve the noted function.
E. Interior landscaping.
(1) Interior landscaping shall be required between the perimeter and
foundational landscaping, particularly in the parking facility.
Landscaping shall be required to provide definition and traffic
control within a parking lot. Such landscaping shall be provided at
the ends of all stall rows, between parking spaces and access drives
which do not directly serve them, along travel corridors within the
parking lot, and to separate the loading area from the main lot.
(2) Yard trees may be proposed to provide further screening of the
building.
(3) Where a parking space abuts any element of the parking or loading
facility except the access drive directly servicing the space or
another parking space, an island shall be installed to protect the
parked vehicle from the moving vehicles and to provide definition
to traffic patterns. Island design shall be, at a minimum, as follows:
(a) Islands shall be six feet wide.
§ 640-65 ALTOONA CODE § 640-65
C:848
(b) Islands shall be curbed with vertical or sloped curbing. Asphalt
curbing is not acceptable.

length. Where the length does not equal an exact multiple of
18, the nearest multiple (by standard rounding) shall be used.
(d) For each tree required in the island, six shrubs shall be
required. Shrubs shall grow to a sufficient height and thickness
to clearly define the presence of the island to passing motorists
but shall not be so high so as to impede motorists' view of
traffic within the parking lot. Shrubs growing between two and
four feet are generally acceptable.
(e) Islands surrounding loading areas shall be screened with thick,
high shrubbery, except where such height inhibits motorists'
ability to see other traffic in the facility.
(f) Trees planted shall meet the specifications for street trees
above.
(4) Where grass is provided, a minimum of six inches of loam shall be
applied and a fine-bladed lawn grass seeded or installed on the
loam.
(5) Signs shall be kept to the minimum necessary for safe and efficient
traffic operation. Pavement markings shall be maintained so as to
always be visible under normal circumstances.
(6) Lighting units shall be installed according to the following
standards:
(a) Units shall not be higher than 15 feet above finished grade in
the Suburban Residential, Single Household Residential,
Limited Residential, Multiple Household Residential, Urban
Residential, Mixed Residential Commercial, and Neighborhood
Business Zoning Districts. Elsewhere, they may be up to 25
feet above finished grade. [Amended 7-12-2017 by Ord. No.
5705]
(b) Units shall be positioned and shielded to direct light downward
onto the property. For purposes of this standard, "downward"
shall mean 60° from the vertical plane.
(c) In no event shall any lighting be installed which directly shines
onto abutting streets or properties or which allows light to
directly shine into the sky. Photometries shall be submitted
with any land development with exterior lighting greater in
luminescence than a two-hundred-watt incandescent light
bulb.
§ 640-65 HOME RULE CHARTER § 640-65
C:849
§ 640-66. Loading areas.
(d) Parking lot lighting shall be illuminated only from dusk to
closing and from opening until dawn. Other lighting on the
property shall be reduced by 75% during these periods.
F. Noise.
(1) No property shall have exterior speakers, unless approved on a
temporary basis under the temporary use provisions below.
(2) On properties where the use necessitates idling vehicles for more
than five minutes on a regular basis (such as deliveries, pickups, or
engine repair), a sound barrier shall be installed along the area
where such vehicles will be idling. The barrier may be a wall, fence
or vegetated screen but shall block the sound of idling vehicles
from reaching the property line.
(3) No outdoor activity on any property governed by this article shall
create noise which can be heard and identified above the ambient
noise in a residential area between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
nightly. This provision shall not apply to traffic coming to and
leaving the premises but does apply to deliveries, collections,
speakers, idling vehicles, and other activities.
G. Dumpsters.
(1) All dumpsters must be placed on a reinforced concrete base shown
on the land development plans.
(2) Each dumpster must be fully screened by a fence or verminproof
container no less than six feet tall. This enclosure must be gated
and closed when not being accessed.
(3) The required concrete base and screening must be large enough to
hold all of the dumpsters and recycling bins required by the
particular business to be located there as well as required by any
local ordinances or state laws.
H. Required landscaping. All landscaping and improvements that are
specifically required by this section shall be maintained and must be
replaced if the required vegetation is damaged, diseased, cut, or dies.
A. Loading spaces, wherever proposed, shall be a minimum of 12 feet wide
and 25 feet long. These calculations shall not include any access drives
or maneuvering space.
B. Landscaping of loading areas shall be as described in § 640-45.
C. Loading and storage facilities shall not be visible from the street or any
residential use.
§ 640-65 ALTOONA CODE § 640-66
C:850
§ 640-67. Utilities and drainage.
§ 640-68. Temporary uses.
§ 640-69. Applicability of subdivision requirements.
In the event that a land development application is submitted which
requires improvements governed by Part 2, the standards in Part 2 may be
applied to the proposal by the Planning Commission as a part of the review
under this article.
§ 640-70. Approval process.
D. Access drives to loading areas shall be of sufficient dimensions to
handle the traffic using the loading area.
A. All utility connections shall be adequate for the servicing of the
proposed use(s) of the property.
B. Utility connections shall be underground. If underground connections
are not feasible, the Commission may approve overhead connections to
the rear of the property from the alley.
C. Drainage shall be provided on site for the entire property. Design and
installation of drainage facilities shall be governed by the standards set
forth in Chapter 620, Stormwater Management, Erosion and
Sedimentation Control.
A. Option one: review each time. If a property owner or occupant desires
to temporarily use a portion of the property for a use other than that
approved under this article, such person or entity shall submit sketch
plans indicating the location, extent, duration, and type of temporary
use proposed for approval by the Planning Administrator. This section
applies to any temporary use proposed for an area used for vehicular
access, parking, pedestrians, or landscaping. The intent of this review
is to ensure the basic function of each element of the property is not
compromised.
B. Option two: permanent approval. If a property owner or occupant
knows at the time the layout is designed that such temporary functions
will occur, permanent provision for those functions can be incorporated
into the land development plans and approved by the Commission.
Once done, the administrative review in Subsection A above is not
necessary unless the location, extent, or type of use is changed.
C. Yard sales on exclusively residential properties are exempt from this
section as are farmers' markets and church/social club festivals.
A. Submittal and review of land developments shall be in accordance with
Part 3.

B. Upon completion of the review of the application, the Altoona City
Planning Commission shall take action on the proposal. Such action
may be taken at a subsequent meeting so long as the time lines
established under state law are met. Such action shall be:
(1) Request further information for a second review. This is done when
the submittal and substantive requirements for the plan are not
met or when an issue arises during the review which needs to be
addressed.
(2) Issue a certificate of approval without condition.
(3) Issue a certificate of approval with conditions.
(4) Issue a certificate of denial which clearly states the reasons for
denial.
C. All approvals under this Part 3 shall be accompanied by a performance
contract which shall be recorded in the chain of title with the plan.
D. The applicant is required to obtain any and all other approvals which
may be required for the proposal. Approval under this Part 3 does not
automatically grant other approvals, except those noted in the
certificate of approval.
A. The property owner shall be responsible for the installation and
maintenance of all improvements as shown on the approved land
development plans.
B. All improvements approved under this article shall be installed and
continuously maintained in good condition and appearance. Whenever

§ 646-77. History of enactment of tax.
Ordinance No. 5550 is derived from Ordinance No. 3865, adopted

Ordinance No. 3865 having been subsequently amended by Ordinance No.
3933, and reenacted by Ordinance No. 3974 on 12-29-1967, which was then

The City, through those officials empowered in this article, may order the
removal, partial removal or treatment of any tree on private property which
in such official's opinion is sufficiently diseased, damaged, dead or in such

the City Manager shall be appealable to court as provided by law. Appeals
to the City Manager shall include a determination of the facts of the case.
Following a determination by the City Manager that a certain action shall
be taken with respect to such a tree, the property owner shall have 10 days
to comply. Failure to appeal and/or comply within the permitted time frames
shall render the property owner subject to the penalties specified in § 679-9.
In such a case of failure to comply, the City is authorized to carry out the
work, and is also permitted to assess such work to the property owner by
any means available, including but not limited to the filing of a municipal
lien.

or to trees on public property, such official will immediately notify the
property owner of the hazard and request its elimination. If the hazard is
not eliminated within five days, the matter shall be considered by the City
Manager. Upon the City Manager's determination that an immediate hazard
exists, the said City official may act to eliminate the hazard, no sooner
than five days after providing the property owner with written notice of the
intended action. Failure to comply within the permitted time frame shall
render the property owner subject to the penalties specified in § 679-9. The
cost for such work shall also be assessed against the property owner by any
means available, including but not limited to the filing of a municipal lien.

are made where relevant in a given case:
That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions,
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or
shape, or exceptional topographical or other physical conditions
peculiar to the particular property and that the unnecessary
hardship is due to such conditions and not the circumstances or
conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is
located.
(1)
That, because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict

That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant.

That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is

A. When zoning permits are needed. A zoning permit is needed before a
landowner may have a non-sign structure erected, constructed, altered,
converted, or moved onto his or her lot or have a nonconforming, nonsign
structure reconstructed, structurally altered, or moved on his or
her lot (unless this chapter specifically states otherwise). Article VI of
this chapter, Signs, explains when zoning permits are required for
signs. No land improvements or other development activities shall be
commenced before the involved landowner has a zoning permit for
these activities.
B. The procedure for obtaining a zoning permit. Anyone who wishes to
obtain a zoning permit shall follow the procedure below. [Amended
7-12-2017 by Ord. No. 5706]

accompanied by a drawing in duplicate, drawn to scale, actually
showing the shape and dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the
exact size and location of any buildings existing on the lot, the lines
within which the proposed building or structure shall be erected or
altered, the existing and intended use of each building or part of a
building, the number of households or dwelling units the building is
designed to accommodate, and such information as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter and all other
pertinent ordinances. One copy of such plans shall be approved. All
applications with accompanying plans and documents shall become
a public record after a permit is issued or denied.

the project. For zoning applications, the applicant
should make points relevant to his or her case in this
document.

C:1024
[e] Any additional information as required below or by the
standards set forth in the text relating to the
submittal.
[2] All applications submitted for variances, special
exceptions, or conditional use approval shall contain the
following information. Due to the wide variety of requests
made under zoning provisions, the requirements below are
general. The applicant should work with the Zoning Officer
to develop a suitable plan for submittal to the reviewing
agency. In all cases, the requirements of § 800-15B above
apply.
[a] A project narrative is required for cases to be decided
by the Zoning Hearing Board or City Council. This
narrative must describe the project and must explain,
point by point, how the application meets the specific
requirements for the involved variance, special
exception, or conditional use.
[b] Photographs of the involved property and its existing
condition. All applications involving signs must show
detailed, scaled drawings of the proposed signs as
well as any existing ones on site.
C. Special permit application requirements for industrial zones. In order
that the Zoning Officer may have a reasonable basis upon which to
approve a proposed industrial operation or an expansion of an existing
industrial operation for conformity to the requirements of this chapter,
the data required in § 800-56F, Supplemental zoning permit
requirements, (under I-L Light Industrial Zone) and § 800-57E,
Supplemental zoning permit requirements, (under I-G General
Industrial Zone) shall be submitted with an application for a permit, in
addition to the requirements aforementioned for a zoning permit in
§ 800-15, Zoning permits.

C:1025
§ 800-16. Vested rights and development changes.
requested through the Zoning Hearing Board. In such cases, the zoning
permit shall remain valid until the Board renders its decision.
F. Inspections. In order to determine if the information submitted on or
with an application is true and is being adhered to, the Zoning Officer
shall have the authority to enter any building, structure, premises,
property, or development in the City at any reasonable hour upon
presentation of proper credentials. If the party seeking a zoning permit
believes that the denial of a zoning permit was made in error, he or she
may appeal.
G. Revocation of permits. If the Zoning Officer discovers that the
development does not comply with the approved application or any
applicable laws or ordinances, or if the permit fee required by this
chapter has not been paid, or if the Zoning Officer determines that an
applicant has made any false statements or misrepresentations
regarding the development, the Zoning Officer shall revoke the zoning
permit and proceed with whatever legal action is necessary to correct
the violation.
H. Permits issued in error. Any zoning permits issued in error shall be null
and void.
I. Appeals. The applicant may appeal the denial of a zoning permit, and
aggrieved persons may appeal the issuance of a zoning permit.
A. Nothing in this chapter shall require any change in the development or
use of a lot or structure for which a zoning permit was officially filed
prior to July 24, 2003, or the effective date of an amendment to this
chapter; however, no properties or buildings shall deviate from the
plans and other information submitted and approved under prior
ordinances. Conditional uses, special exceptions, and variances issued
under prior ordinances shall become nonconforming uses or structures
on July 24, 2003, and all changes from the original plans shall be
treated as changes to nonconforming uses under Article III of this
chapter, unless such changes comply with this chapter.
B. If a zoning permit is issued, the involved development shall not deviate
from the plans and other information submitted to the Zoning Officer
without the written approval of the Zoning Officer, or the City Council in
the case of a conditional or temporary use, and the Zoning Hearing
Board in the case of a special exception or variance. Requests for all
such approvals shall be submitted in writing to the Zoning Officer.

C:1026
ARTICLE III
Nonconforming Buildings and Uses
§ 800-17. Purpose.
§ 800-18. Nonconforming vacant lots.
A. The districts established by this chapter constitute the proper location
for the specific enumerated uses, buildings, and other structures
permitted therein. Within such districts, however, there exist
nonconformities that were lawfully in existence before July 24, 2003 (or
the effective dates of subsequent amendments), but are prohibited
under the terms of this chapter. Future amendments to this chapter
may be expected to create additional nonconformities.
B. The legitimate interests of those who established these nonconformities
are recognized in this chapter by permitting such nonconformities to
continue, subject to regulations for and limitations upon their
completion, restoration, reconstruction, extension, and substitution. It
is recognized, however, that nonconformities substantially and
adversely affect the orderly development, maintenance, use, and
taxable value of other property in the district  property that is itself
subject to the regulations of this chapter. In order to secure eventual
compliance with the standards of this chapter, it is, therefore,
necessary to strictly regulate nonconformities and to prevent the
reestablishment of nonconformities that have been discontinued.
C. Accordingly, the following sections divide nonconformities into five
classes and provide appropriate regulations for each class. These
classes are:
(1) Vacant lots smaller than the minimum size, width, depth, or any
combination thereof, required by this chapter.
(2) Nonconforming buildings and structures used for a permitted use.
(3) Nonconforming uses of conforming buildings and structures.
(4) Nonconforming buildings and structures used for a nonconforming
use.
(5) Nonconforming use of land.
D. In the case of existing residential uses and structures in any
nonresidential zone, regulations for the geographically closest
residential district for setbacks, height, areas and coverage shall apply.

ARTICLE IV
Designation of Zones
§ 800-25. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to constitute policies that involve and affect
all or a majority of the zoning districts in the Altoona Zoning Ordinance.
The article provides for the designation of the zoning districts, the
establishment of the zoning map and the district boundaries interpretation
procedure, as well as annexation, floodplain, building height, lot area, lot
coverage, lot width and lot frontage general policy, permitted reductions
in lot dimensions and obstructions to vision safety policies. Furthermore,
this article regulates home-based businesses, wireless communications
facilities, public utility facilities and establishes farming policy.
§ 800-26. Zoning districts.
For the purpose of this chapter, the City is hereby divided into zoning
districts, which shall be designated as follows:
Zone Designation Category Title
R-S Residential Zone Suburban Residential
R-SH Residential Zone Single-Household
Residential
R-L Residential Zone Limited Residential
R-MH Residential Zone Multiple-Household
Residential
R-U Residential Zone Urban Residential
M-RC Mixed Use Zone Residential/Commercial
C-NB Commercial Zone Neighborhood Business
C-HB Commercial Zone Highway Business
C-CB Commercial Zone Central Business
I-L Industrial Zone Light Industrial
I-G Industrial Zone General Industrial
§ 800-27. Zoning Map.
The boundaries of the districts shall be shown upon the map attached to
and made part of this chapter, which shall be designated "City of Altoona
Zoning Map." The said map and the entire notation, references, and other
data shown thereon are hereby incorporated by reference into this section
as if all were fully described herein.361
361. Editor's Note: Said map is included as an attachment to this chapter.
§ 800-25 HOME RULE CHARTER § 800-28
C:1035
§ 800-28. Boundaries between districts.
Where practical, district boundary lines shall follow street, alley, or public
rights-of-way, center lines, railroad rights-of-way, streams, and projected
extensions or offsets thereof as they exist on plats of record at the time of
the passage of this chapter. Whenever any street, alley, or other public rightof-
way is vacated, the one adjoining each side of such street, alley, or public
right-of-way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation.
§ 800-29. Interpretation of boundaries.
When a district boundary line divides a lot held in single and separate
ownership on July 24, 2003, each portion of the lot shall be controlled by the
requirements of the district in which it is located. Where boundaries follow
a physical feature, but an exact description is absent, the physical feature
shall be deemed to be included entirely within the more restrictive district.
§ 800-30. Annexation.
Where land area has become a part of the City by annexation, the same shall
automatically be classed as being in the R-S, Suburban Residential Zone
until such classification shall have been changed by an amendment to the
title as provided herein. The process for such amendment shall begin within
60 days of the annexation.
§ 800-31. Floodplain areas.
Where land area possessing any of the zoning districts has been identified
as part of a floodplain by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and is indicated as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Maps, then
Chapter 362 shall govern the floodplain area. However, the provisions and
requirements of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect to the
extent that they are more restrictive than the Floodplain Regulations.
§ 800-32. Height.
Height regulations shall not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, penthouses,
or domes not used for human occupancy, nor to chimneys, ventilators,
skylights, water tanks, bulkheads, utility poles or towers, silos, and similar
features, such as necessary mechanical appurtenances, usually carried
above roof level.
§ 800-33. Area.
Any parcel of land with an area or width less than that prescribed for a lot in
the zone in which such parcel is located on or before July 23, 2003, when the
owner thereof owns no adjoining land, may be used as a lot for any purpose
permitted in the zone, provided that all other regulations prescribed for the
zone by this chapter are complied with.
§ 800-28 ALTOONA CODE § 800-34
C:1036
§ 800-34. Coverage.
Maximum coverage of a lot shall be 90%, unless a more restrictive
requirement is listed for the district in which the property is located.
§ 800-35. Width.
All lots shall have a minimum width of 25 feet, unless a more restrictive
requirement is listed for the district in which the property is located.
§ 800-36. Frontage.
All lots shall have a minimum of 25 feet of frontage on an improved street,
unless a more restrictive requirement is listed for the district in which the
property is located.
§ 800-37. (Reserved)362
§ 800-38. Reduction of lot dimensions.
The area, width, or depth of any lot shall not be reduced by subdivision,
sale, or development so that the lot width, lot area, lot area per dwelling
unit, yards, or other open spaces are smaller, or so that the coverage is
greater than prescribed herein. Exceptions to this shall be developments
falling under § 800-19 or § 800-21I above.
§ 800-39. Obstruction to vision.
Walls, fences, signs, or other structures shall not be erected or altered and
hedges, trees, or other growth shall not be planted or maintained which
may cause danger to traffic on a street or road by obstructing the view or
which may cause a hindrance or danger to pedestrian traffic.
§ 800-40. Off-street parking and loading berths.
In general, off-street parking and loading is regulated through land
development approval provided in Chapter 640. Because some uses do not
qualify for land development review, basic parking standards are included
here to ensure parking is in line with the policies outlined in Chapter 640.
A. All properties shall have a minimum of one parking space available.
Availability can be a specific provision on the property or sufficient
street frontage to provide area for one vehicle parked parallel with the
edge of the pavement. This space shall be a minimum of eight feet wide
by 22 feet long and shall be located so that vehicles accessing the space
may do so freely without necessitating the movement of other vehicles
or objects.

C:1037
§ 800-41. Home-based businesses. [Amended 8-14-2019 by Ord. No.
5748]
B. No parked vehicle shall impede the flow of traffic or the ability of
pedestrians to utilize the sidewalk area, whether or not a physical
sidewalk has been installed.
C. No loading or deliveries shall be made in such a manner that the
delivery vehicle must fully block traffic from utilizing the street or
impede a pedestrian from utilizing the sidewalk area, whether or not a
physical sidewalk has been installed.
D. The parking requirements of Chapter 640 shall also apply.
A. Types of home-based businesses; purposes; applicability.
(1) A home-based business is defined as a business that is conducted
entirely within a dwelling unit; entirely by the members of the
household residing in that unit; and in a manner that is clearly
incidental, accessory, and subordinate to the unit's primary
residential use. Most modern zoning ordinances regulate homebased
businesses because of the deleterious effects that these
businesses can have on their neighborhoods. A home-based
business can congest its neighborhood's parking spaces and
streets; generate intrusive amounts of noise, vibration, glare,
electrical interference, odors, and radio/television signal
disruption; draw large trucks for delivery purposes; erect a
disturbing number of signs; utilize unsightly outdoor storage areas;
and generally change the character of its neighborhood from
residential to commercial. Many zoning ordinances attempt to
minimize such damaging effects by designating all home-based
businesses as special exceptions and requiring each to procure the
approval of the Zoning Hearing Board, which is to reject any such
business that will adversely affect its neighborhood.
(2) However, more and more home-based businesses are being created
that have little or no deleterious effects on their neighborhoods.
Many professionals now "telecommute" from home, draw no extra
parking or traffic activity, generate no noise or other interference,
and have no signs. While home-based businesses that could have a
significant effect on their neighborhoods clearly should still lie
under the Zoning Hearing Board's jurisdiction, those that have
little or no such effects should be excused from the paperwork,
time, and expense involved in a special exception application.
(3) This chapter attempts to establish such a system by dividing homebased
business into two categories: no-impact home-based
businesses (which will have little or no effect on their
neighborhoods) and major-impact home-based businesses (which
may have some effects on their neighborhoods). The Zoning Officer
shall determine which of these categories a particular home-based
§ 800-40 ALTOONA CODE § 800-41
C:1038
business falls into according to the standards of Subsection B
below. If a particular home-based business is determined to be a
no-impact home-based business according to these standards, then
it may be established without any further approvals. However, if
it is determined to be a major-impact home-based business, then
Subsection C below requires that it must be approved by the
Zoning Hearing Board as a special exception.
(4) This section applies to all home-based businesses within the City of
Altoona, regardless of the zoning district in which they are located.
B. Distinguishing no-impact home-based businesses from major-impact
home-based businesses.
(1) Any person who wishes to establish a home-based business within
the City is required to apply for a home-based business license with
the Zoning Officer on a form supplied by the City. This application
shall not be considered complete unless enough information is
included on the form to enable the Zoning Officer to determine
whether the proposed home-based business is a no-impact homebased
business or a major-impact home-based business according
to the standards below.
(2) After a complete notarized application has been filed, the Zoning
Officer shall have 45 days to determine the status of the proposed
home-based business. When the Zoning Officer fails to make this
determination within 45 days, then the proposed home-based
business shall automatically be classified as a no-impact homebased
business.
(3) The Zoning Officer shall determine that a proposed home-based
business would be a major-impact home-based business unless it
meets the standards below, in which case it shall be classified as a
no-impact home-based business and may be established without
any further approvals.
(a) A no-impact home-based business shall be a business or
commercial activity administered or conducted as an accessory
use which is clearly secondary to the use as a residential
dwelling and which involves no customer, client or patient
traffic, whether vehicular or pedestrian, pickup, delivery or
removal functions to or from the premises, in excess of those
normally associated with residential use.
(b) The business activity shall be compatible with the residential
use of the property and surrounding residential uses.
(c) The business shall employ no employees other than family
members residing in the dwelling.
(d) There shall be no display or sale of retail goods and no
stockpiling or inventory of a substantial nature.
§ 800-41 HOME RULE CHARTER § 800-41
C:1039
§ 800-42. Wireless communications facilities. [Amended 10-9-2019
by Ord. No. 5752]
(e) There shall be no outside appearance of a business use,
including, but not limited to, parking, signs or lights.
(f) The business activity may not use any equipment or process
which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors or electrical
or electronic interference, including interference with radio or
television reception, which is detectable in the neighborhood.
(g) The business activity may not generate any solid waste or
sewage discharge, in volume or type, which is not normally
associated with residential use in the neighborhood.
(h) The business activity shall be conducted only within the
dwelling and may not occupy more than 25% of the habitable
floor area.
(i) The business may not involve any illegal activity.
(j) Nursery schools, day-care centers, tutoring or teaching
services, dancing schools, exercise or health centers, funeral
homes, mortuaries, eating or drinking establishments, animal
kennels, animal hospitals, veterinarian offices,
boardinghouses, medical or dental clinics or offices,
transportation vehicle repair or rental facilities, theaters, and
any other business that does not meet the definition of homebased
businesses given under Subsection B above shall not be
classified as no-impact home-based businesses.
C. Major-impact home-based businesses. If a proposed home-based
business is determined to be a major-impact home-based business by
the Zoning Officer, then its proprietor must apply for a special
exception use before the Zoning Hearing Board and the conditions set
by the zoning district in which the business is to be located. Note that
any off-street parking space or loading berth requirements for these
occupations (beyond the requirements of the involved dwelling unit)
shall be set by the Zoning Hearing Board at the involved hearing.
A. Purpose. The purposes of this section are as follows:
(1) To provide a competitive and wide range of communications
services.
(2) To encourage the shared use of existing communication towers,
buildings and structures.
(3) To ensure compliance with federal and state regulations.
(4) To promote the health, safety and welfare of City residents and
businesses with respect to wireless communications facilities.

C:1040
(5) To address modern and developing technologies including, but not
limited to, distributed antenna systems, data collection units, cable
Wi-Fi and other communications facilities.
(6) To establish procedures for design, siting, construction,
installation, maintenance and removal of both tower-based and
non-tower-based wireless communications facilities in the City,
including facilities both inside and outside of the public rights-ofway.
(7) To protect City residents and businesses from potential adverse
impacts of wireless communications facilities and preserve, to the
extent permitted under law, the visual character of established
communities and the natural beauty of the landscape.

C. General requirements for all tower-based wireless communications
facilities. The following regulations shall apply to all tower-based
wireless communications facilities:
(1) Standard of care. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed,
constructed, operated, maintained, repaired, modified and
removed in strict compliance with all current applicable technical,
safety, and safety-related codes including, but not limited to, the
most recent editions of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) Code, National Electrical Safety Code, National Electrical
Code, as well as the accepted and responsible workmanlike
industry practices of the National Association of Tower Erectors.
Any tower-based WCF shall at all times be kept and maintained in
good condition, order and repair by qualified maintenance and
construction personnel, so that the same shall not endanger the life
of any person or any property in the City.
(2) Wind. Any tower-based WCF structures shall be designed to
withstand the effects of wind according to the standard designed by
the ANSI as prepared by the engineering departments of the
Electronics Industry Association, and Telecommunications Industry
(ANSFEINTIA-222-E Code, as amended).
(3) Height. Any tower-based WCF shall be designed at the minimum
functional height and shall not exceed a maximum total height of
200 feet, or 40 feet when located within the right-of-way (ROW),
which height shall include all subsequent additions or alterations.
Height shall be measured from the average natural grade to the top
point of the communications tower or antenna, whichever is
greater. All tower-based WCF applicants must submit
documentation to the City justifying the total height of the
structure. Tower-based WCF constructed outside the ROW at a
height greater than 200 feet but not to exceed 300 feet shall be
permitted in the General Industrial Zoning District if the following
criteria are met:
(a) The applicant shall provide documentation to the City which
details the commitment to provide capacity on the proposed
tower-based WCF to more than one provider. The document
must describe the additional tower height that is required to
provide the capacity to the additional provider(s). The
document shall also show that by providing the additional
height and capacity, there will not be a need from the involved
companies for an additional tower outside the ROW within a
radius of one mile of the site. The burden of proof shall be on
§ 800-42 HOME RULE CHARTER § 800-42
C:1043
the applicant to show that the proposed tower is the minimum
height needed to provide the required service.
(b) The applicant shall provide documentation to the City that the
height limitation of 200 feet will require the construction of
two or more towers and that by permitting an increase in the
height of the tower, only one tower will be required. The
burden of proof shall be on the applicant to show that the
proposed tower is the minimum height needed to provide the
required services. The purpose of this is to permit an increase
in the height of one tower to reduce the need for additional
towers.
(4) Public safety communications. No tower-based WCF shall interfere
with public safety communications or the reception of broadband,
television, radio or other communication services enjoyed by
occupants of nearby properties.

alteration places the entire use in full compliance with this
section.
[5] Is so designed so that activities within the business cannot
be seen, heard, or smelled outside the structure, or portion
thereof, in which the business is located. This shall
include, without limitation, devices, objects, toys, tools,

C:1156
§ 800-61. Sign area per lot.
Any sign designated by an "S" or "P" in Sign Table A above shall be allowed
only if the sum of the area of all building, freestanding and miscellaneous
signs on the lot conforms with the maximum permitted sign area as
determined by the standard for the zoning district in which the lot is located
as specified in Sign Table B, below.
A. How to compute the sign area of individual signs. The area of a sign
face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only
one face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle,
rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof, that will encompass the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display,
together with any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display and used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed. The calculation shall
not include any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or
wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the provisions of this
chapter and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
B. How to compute the sign area of multifaceted signs. The sign area for a
sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign
faces area are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed
from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of
the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign
area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
C. How to compute the maximum total permitted sign area for a lot.
(1) The permitted sum of the area of all individual signs on a lot shall
be computed by applying the standard contained in Sign Table B,
Maximum Sign Area per Lot, to the lot frontage, building frontage,
or wall area, as appropriate, for the zoning district in which the lot
is located. Lots fronting on two or more streets may utilize the
permitted sign area for each street frontage. However, the total
sign area that is oriented toward a particular street may not exceed
the portion of the lot's total sign area allocation that is derived from
the lot, building, or wall area frontage on that street.
(2) The maximum total area of all signs on a lot, except incidental
signs, building marker signs, identification signs, and flags, shall
not exceed the lesser of the maximum area shown in Sign Table B,
Maximum Sign Area per Lot.

A. How to compute sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base anchoring at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the existing grade prior to construction. In cases in
which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height
shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal
grade at the base anchoring of the sign is equal to the elevation of the
nearest point of the crown of a nonelevated public street or the grade of
the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot,
whichever is lower. Individual signs, including base anchoring, shall not
exceed the applicable standards shown on Sign Table C and on Sign
Table D.
B. Additional height requirements. An off-premises advertising sign shall
have no less than three feet of bottom open space along its entire
length. Latticing shall be regarded as satisfying this requirement.
C. Additional placement specifications.
§ 800-61 ALTOONA CODE § 800-62
C:1158
(1) In addition to the setback requirements of Sign Table C, no sign
shall be located closer than 10 feet to an intersection between
public and/or private roads and/or driveways unless that sign
allows a clear view between the intersecting roads and/or
driveways at all heights between three and 10 feet.
(2) Pole(s) or standard(s) may be located at any point within a required
yard if, between the level of 30 inches above curb level and the
level of 10 feet above curb level, the diameter or greatest
dimension of the supporting pole(s) or standard(s) does not exceed
20 inches.
(3) Placement of off-premises advertising signs.
(a) No off-premises advertising sign or structure shall be erected
within 300 feet of any church or school.
(b) No off-premises advertising sign shall be erected within 1,000
feet of any other off-premises advertising sign on the same side
of the street.
(c) No off-premises advertising sign shall be located within 300
feet of another off-premises advertising sign.
(d) No off-premises advertising shall be permitted on the roof of
any structure.
(e) No additional off-premises advertising signs shall be permitted
within the City limits unless another off-premises advertising
sign is removed within the City limits. The total number of offpremises
advertising signs in the City shall not exceed the
number in place presently.
D. Double-frontage specifications. Lots fronting on two or more streets
may utilize the permitted number of signs for each street frontage.
However, these signs cannot be accumulated and used on one street in
excess of that allowed for lots with only one street frontage.
E. Additional wall area specifications. The percentage figure of "wall area"
shall be interpreted as a maximum percentage of the area of the wall of
which such a sign is a part or to which each sign is most nearly parallel.
F. Dimensional and numerical standards.
(1) No sign shall exceed any applicable maximum numbers or
dimensions shown on Sign Table D. Likewise, no sign shall
encroach on any applicable minimum clearances shown below.
(2) On any single property with multiple storefronts, each storefront
shall be entitled to a maximum of one twenty-five-square-foot sign
affixed to the building above the storefront. This subsection can be
invoked by the owner of the business only when the dimensional
§ 800-62 HOME RULE CHARTER § 800-62
C:1159
standards in Sign Tables B, C and D would otherwise prohibit any
identification for the business on the premises.
(3) All signs must comply with all applicable dimensional standards of
this article. Where two standards conflict, the stricter shall apply.

any limitations listed in Sign Table A (see § 800-62), and the
characteristics of the sign must conform with the limitations of Sign
Table E. In Table E, a "P" signifies that the characteristic is allowed in
the column's zoning district, while "N" signifies that the characteristic
is not allowed. A "SE" signifies that the characteristic is allowed only as
a special exception, subject to the Zoning Hearing Board finding that
the sign will not impact residences or motorists due to sign specific
distances, shielding, brightness, and/or hours of operation.
B. All permitted signs must follow the requirements of § 800-64, Design,
construction and maintenance. No electronic screen sign shall be

§ 800-64 ALTOONA CODE § 800-65
C:1164
§ 800-66. Signs exempt from requirements of article.
The following kinds of signs are exempt from the requirements of this
article:
§ 800-67. Prohibited signs.
All signs that are not expressly permitted under this chapter or exempted
from its regulations by § 800-66, Signs exempt from requirements of article,
are prohibited from the City of Altoona. Such signs include, but are not
limited to, beacons, pennants, strings of lights that are not permanently
mounted to a rigid background, inflatable signs, tethered balloons, and
sexually suggestive signs.
§ 800-68. Abandoned signs.
If a conforming use has been discontinued for a total of 12 months, then
all signs that are related to that use, as well as any structures that support
these signs, shall be known as "abandoned signs." Likewise, if a
nonconforming use has been abandoned as described in this chapter, then
immediate confiscation. The City shall have the right to recover from

(2) The sign shall be secured so that it is not a hazard.
(3) There shall be no more than one such sign per project (any
subsequent project signs must comply with all provisions of this
article).
§ 800-65 HOME RULE CHARTER § 800-68
C:1165
all signs that are related to that use, as well as any structures that support
these signs, shall be known as "abandoned signs." All abandoned signs shall
be removed at the expense of the owner. If such a sign is not removed,
the Zoning Officer shall give notice and enforce the requirements of this
section.
§ 800-69. Nonconforming signs.
A. Applicability.
(1) The requirements of this section only apply to nonconforming
signs. A nonconforming sign is defined as a sign that:
(a) Was legally established before the effective date of the
particular ordinance or amendment relating thereto;
(b) Does not conform to the requirements of the provisions of this
chapter.
(2) Because nonconforming signs are not illegal, they have a right to
remain in place and to be maintained so long as they adhere to the
requirements of this chapter.
B. Phasing out nonconforming signs. So long as it does not threaten the
public health or welfare, a nonconforming sign may maintain its
nonconforming characteristic or characteristics so long as it is in
continuous use, is properly maintained, and adheres to the
requirements of this section.
C. Nonconforming status. The following rules apply to or concern all
nonconforming signs:
(1) The Zoning Officer may keep and maintain a list of all
nonconforming signs that exist in the City on the effective date of
the particular ordinance or amendment relating thereto and on the
effective dates of any relevant amendments to either this chapter
or its map.
(2) The owner of a nonconforming sign may obtain a "certificate of
nonconformity" from the City's Zoning Officer. This certificate shall
state that the sign may continue to be used for as long as it is in
continuous use, is properly maintained and kept in conformity with
the requirements of this section.
(3) Aggrieved parties and the involved landowner may both appeal the
Zoning Officer's determination of whether or not a sign is
nonconforming.
(4) Any sign that was illegally erected under a previous zoning
ordinance or land use regulation shall remain illegal under this
chapter.
§ 800-68 ALTOONA CODE § 800-69
C:1166
(5) Any sign that becomes a nonconforming sign due to an amendment
made after the effective date of this chapter shall be subject to the
regulations of this chapter, as amended.
D. Replacing nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign may be replaced
with only a conforming sign. Changing a nonelectronic screen sign into
an electronic screen sign shall be defined as a "replacement" for the
purposes of this chapter.
E. Enlarging, relocating, or altering nonconforming signs.
(1) A nonconforming sign shall not be enlarged or relocated within the
City.
(2) A nonconforming sign shall not be altered in any aspect, except:
(a) To make safety improvements (for the safety of the general
public passing by);
(b) To keep the sign maintained in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter or other City ordinances; or
(c) To bring the sign into conformance with the requirements of
this chapter.
F. Bringing a nonconforming sign into conformance. If a nonconforming
sign is altered so that it becomes a conforming sign, it shall not be
subsequently altered back to a nonconforming state. Likewise, if a
nonconforming sign is replaced with a conforming sign, that
conforming sign shall not be subsequently replaced with another
nonconforming sign.
