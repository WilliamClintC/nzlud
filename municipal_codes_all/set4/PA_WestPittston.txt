and during its pendency before the Zoning Hearing Board, all land development
pursuant to any challenged ordinance, order or approval of the Zoning Officer
or of any agency or body, and all official action thereunder, shall be stayed
unless the Zoning Officer or any other appropriate agency or body certifies to
15-9
1513.2
1513.3
1513.4
the Board facts indicating that such stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the development or official action shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by
the court having jurisdiction of zoning appeals, on petition, after notice to the
zoning officer or other appropriate agency or body. When the application for
development, preliminary or final, has been duly approved and proceedings
designed to reverse or limit the approval are filed with the Board by persons
other than the applicant, the applicant may petition the court having jurisdiction
of zoning appeals to order such persons to post a bond as a condition to
continuing the proceedings before the Board.
After the petition is presented, the court shall hold a hearing to detennine if the
filing of the appeal is frivolous. At the hearing, evidence may be presented on
the merits of the case. It shall be the burden of the applicant for a bond to
prove the appeal is frivolous. After consideration of all the evidence presented,
if the court determines that the appeal is frivolous, it shall grant the petition for
a bond. The right to petition the court to order the appellants to post bond may
be waived by the appellee, but such waiver may be revoked by him if an appeal
is taken from a final decision of the court.
The question whether or not such petition should be granted and the amount of
the bond shall be within the sound discretion of the court. An order denying a
petition for bond shall be interlocutory. An order directing the responding party
to post a bond shall be interlocutory.
If an appeal is taken by a respondent to the petition for a bond from an order of
the court dismissing a zoning appeal for refusal to post a bond and the appellate
court sustains the order below to post a bond, the respondent to the petition for
a bond, upon motion of the petitioner and after hearing in the court having
jurisdiction of zoning appeals, shall be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses,
and attorney fees incurred by the petitioner.
